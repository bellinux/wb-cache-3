The various components of the feminine apparel are: the headgear (mucadore), the shirt (camisa), the bodice (palas, cossu), the jacket (coritu, gipone), the skirt (unnedda, sauciu), the apron (farda, antalena, defentale). Those of the male are: the headdress (berritta), the shirt (bentone or camisa), the jacket (gipone), the trousers (cartzones or bragas), the skirt (ragas or bragotis), the overcoat (gabbanu, colletu) and the mastruca, a sort <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>or</b> <b>lamb</b> leather jacket without sleeves ("mastrucati latrones" [...] or [...] "thieves with rough wool cloaks" [...] was the name by which Cicero denigrated the Sardinians who rebelled against the Roman power).|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, three classifications of wool {{are named}} in the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939. [...] "Wool" [...] is [...] "the fiber from the fleece <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> <b>or</b> <b>lamb</b> <b>or</b> hair <b>of</b> the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include the {{so-called}} specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been reclaimed from any woven or felted wool product". [...] "Virgin wool" [...] and [...] "new wool" [...] are also {{used to refer to}} such never used wool. There are two categories of recycled wool (also called reclaimed or shoddy wool). [...] "Reprocessed wool" [...] identifies [...] "wool which has been woven or felted into a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without having been used by the ultimate consumer". [...] "Reused wool" [...] refers to such wool that has been used by the ultimate consumer.|$|R
50|$|A long {{tradition}} of sausage-making exists in Germany; more than 1500 different types of sausage (Wurst) are made. Most Wurst is made with natural casings <b>of</b> pork, <b>sheep</b> <b>or</b> <b>lamb</b> intestines. Among {{the most popular and}} most common are Bratwurst, usually made of ground pork and spices, the Wiener (Viennese), which may be pork or beef and is smoked and fully cooked in a water bath, and Blutwurst (blood sausage) or Schwarzwurst (black sausage) made from blood (often of pigs or geese). Thousands of types of cold cuts also are available. There are many regional specialties, such as the Münchner Weißwurst (Munich white sausage) popular in Bavaria or the Currywurst (depending on region, either a steamed pork sausage or a version of the Bratwurst, sliced and spiced with curry ketchup) popular in the metropolitan areas of Berlin, Hamburg and the Ruhr Area. Strict regulations governing what may and may not be put into them have been in force in Germany since the 13th century. In the market ordinance of Landshut in 1236, it was set down that only top-quality meat could be made into sausages.|$|R

60|$|As to sheep, none, I thought, were {{strangers to}} the general failure of the article of turnips last year: the early having been burned, as they came up, by the great drought and heat; the late, {{and those of the}} early which had escaped, were {{destroyed}} by the chilling frosts of the winter and the wet and severe weather of the spring. In many places a full fourth <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> <b>or</b> the <b>lambs</b> were lost; what remained of the lambs were poor and ill fed, the ewes having had no milk. The calves came late, and they were generally an article the want of which was as much to be dreaded as any other. So that article of food, formerly so abundant {{in the early part of}} the summer, particularly in London, and which in a great part supplied the place of mutton for near two months, did little less than totally fail.|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the parentage reference is the early step of information needed for genotyping study. Inaccurate data <b>of</b> recording <b>sheep</b> numbers is often occurred. Sometimes, we found <b>sheep</b> <b>or</b> <b>lambs</b> with uncertain original parents. This {{study was designed to}} identify the parentages <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and to find the putative parents of lambs. Using an advance DNA technology in molecular genetics particularly in genotyping study, those purposes can be clarified. DNA <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> were isolated from fresh blood samples in EDTA using a high salt method. A concentration of 50 ng/(il DNA was used for amplification. Several microsatellite markers were applied in the amplification. Using a DNA analyser and sequencer, PCR products were analysed to look at the figures of alleles (bands). Results showed that using microsatellite markers could inform that parents of several experimental lambs were incorrect. It was found that putative parents of some lambs were generated from incorrect parents. This study suggests that microsatellite marker can be used to clarify unknown original parents...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} 60 thermotolerant Campylobacter strains (37 C. jejuni and 23 C. coli) {{isolated}} from the cows, pigs, chickens and ducks (15 strains of each type of animal) were used to establish their growth capacity on media containing cow or swine blood as potential substitutes <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>or</b> horse blood. The growth capacity was assessed by viable counts on cow and swine blood media, using the modified Miles and Misra method. Campylobacter strains showed better growth in the media supplemented with pig <b>or</b> <b>sheep</b> blood than with cow blood. Thus, the use of pig blood could be a supplement for Campylobacter culture medium, {{when there was no}} availability <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> <b>or</b> horse blood...|$|R

She assigns him the job <b>of</b> washing the <b>sheep</b> and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.|$|R

Socio-economic criteria were studied conducting a questionnaire-based survey by 62 questionnaires. Also some data about consumptive costs of households {{were obtained from the}} data center of Iran Statistics Center. Relative poverty line was calculated in two situations with /without considering the costs and revenues outside the rangeland.

These results could be utilized for range management plans and policies within similar areas...|$|R
