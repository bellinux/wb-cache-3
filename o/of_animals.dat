5|$|Aristotle's {{writings}} on biology, {{the first in}} the history of science, are scattered across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that have survived. The main biology texts were the History <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> Generation <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> Movement <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> Progression <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> Parts <b>of</b> <b>Animals,</b> and On the Soul, as well as the lost drawings of The Anatomies which accompanied the History.|$|E
5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{begins by}} {{discussing}} the history <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in political theory before considering the approaches {{taken to the}} status <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> by five schools of political theory: utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism. The final chapter outlines Cochrane's own approach, which he situates between liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Animal Coloration, or in full Animal Coloration. An {{account of}} the {{principal}} facts and theories relating to the colours and markings <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> is a book by the English zoologist Frank Evers Beddard, published by Swan Sonnenschein in 1892. It formed part of the ongoing debate amongst zoologists about the relevance of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to the observed appearance, structure, and behaviour <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> and vice versa.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues for}} a {{coherent}} theory <b>of</b> the <b>animal</b> {{in the written}} and visual works of the German Expressionist painter, Franz Marc. By contextualizing Marc’s animal theory within the history <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies, this thesis will analyze how Marc’s animal theory corresponds with several central concepts within this field. One of these concepts—a theory <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> death—is central to the artist’s greater theory <b>of</b> the <b>animal</b> and to the analysis this thesis provides. In examining Marc’s theory <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> death, the following work will propose that the artist’s theory <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> spirituality is his greatest legacy within the field <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> theory...|$|R
5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions between humans and animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in entertainment and sport, the relationship <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> to environmental practices and the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle {{distinguished}} about 500 {{species of}} birds, mammals and fishes in History <b>of</b> <b>Animals</b> and Parts <b>of</b> <b>Animals.</b> His system of classification, {{one of the}} earliest in scientific taxonomy, was influential for over two thousand years. Aristotle distinguished animals with blood, Enhaima (the modern zoologist's vertebrates) and animals without blood, Anhaima (invertebrates).|$|E
5|$|Edward III added {{other types}} <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> two lions, a leopard and two wildcats.

In 1436, {{during the time of}} Henry V, all of the lions died; Keeper William Kerby was terminated because of this.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{application}} of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) in SR <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies can promote the translation from bench to bedside. We aim {{to explore the}} use of GRADE in systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies. METHODS We used a theoretical analysis method to explore the use of GRADE in SR <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies and applied in a SR <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies. Meanwhile, we presented and discussed our results in two international conferences. RESULTS Five downgrade factors were considered as follows in systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies: 1) Risk of bias: the SYRCLE tool {{can be used for}} assessing the risk <b>of</b> bias <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies. 2) Indirectness: we can assess indirectness in systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies from the PICO. 3) Inconsistency: similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals and statistical heterogeneity are also suitable to evaluate inconsistency <b>of</b> evidence from <b>animal</b> studies. 4) Imprecision: optimal information size (OIS) and 95...|$|R

5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment <b>of</b> <b>Animals</b> (PETA), over the welfare <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E
