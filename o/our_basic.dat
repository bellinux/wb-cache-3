25|$|All {{sound is}} {{inherently}} powerful. If a hunter kills a lion {{he can see}} it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because {{the sound of the}} lion signals its presence and its power. Speech is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; <b>our</b> <b>basic</b> instincts compel us to pay attention.|$|E

25|$|Work on cloning {{techniques}} {{has advanced}} <b>our</b> <b>basic</b> understanding of developmental biology in humans. Observing human {{pluripotent stem cells}} grown in culture provides great insight into human embryo development, which otherwise cannot be seen. Scientists {{are now able to}} better define steps of early human development. Studying signal transduction along with genetic manipulation within the early human embryo has the potential to provide answers to many developmental diseases and defects. Many human-specific signaling pathways have been discovered by studying human embryonic stem cells. Studying developmental pathways in humans has given developmental biologists more evidence toward the hypothesis that developmental pathways are conserved throughout species.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{extraterrestrial}} atmospheres {{is an active}} field of research, both as an aspect of astronomy and to gain insight into Earth's atmosphere. In addition to Earth, {{many of the other}} astronomical objects in the Solar System have atmospheres. These include all the gas giants, as well as Mars, Venus, and Pluto. Several moons and other bodies also have atmospheres, as do comets and the Sun. There is evidence that extrasolar planets can have an atmosphere. Comparisons of these atmospheres to one another and to Earth's atmosphere broaden <b>our</b> <b>basic</b> understanding of atmospheric processes such as the greenhouse effect, aerosol and cloud physics, and atmospheric chemistry and dynamics.|$|E
25|$|Alderfer, {{expanding}} on Maslow's {{hierarchy of}} needs, created the ERG theory. This theory posits {{that there are}} three groups of core needs — existence, relatedness, and growth, hence the label: ERG theory. The existence group is concerned with providing <b>our</b> <b>basic</b> material existence requirements. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs are those of relatedness- the desire we have for maintaining important personal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others {{if they are to be}} satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs as an intrinsic desire for personal development. Maslow's categories are broken down into many different parts and there are a lot of needs. The ERG categories are more broad and covers more than just certain areas. As a person grows, the existence, relatedness, and growth for all desires continue to grow. All these needs should be fulfilled to greater wholeness as a human being. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization.|$|E

[...] W.L. McGrath, president of the Williamson Heater Company in Cincinnati, Ohio, told the Senate that the International Labour Organization, to which he had been an American delegate, was [...] "seeking to set itself up as a sort of international legislature to formulate socialistic laws which it hopes, by the vehicle of treaty ratification, can essentially be imposed upon most of the countries of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Radio-telescope {{images taken}} in 1998 confirm that Betelgeuse has a highly complex atmosphere, with a {{temperature}} of , similar to that recorded on the star's surface but much lower than surrounding gas in the same region. The VLA images also show this lower-temperature gas progressively cools as it extends outward. Although unexpected, {{it turns out to}} be the most abundant constituent of Betelgeuse's atmosphere. [...] "This alters <b>our</b> <b>basic</b> understanding of red-supergiant star atmospheres", explained Jeremy Lim, the team's leader. [...] "Instead of the star's atmosphere expanding uniformly due to gas heated to high temperatures near its surface, it now appears that several giant convection cells propel gas from the star's surface into its atmosphere." [...] This is the same region in which Kervella's 2009 finding of a bright plume, possibly containing carbon and nitrogen and extending at least six photospheric radii in the southwest direction of the star, is believed to exist.|$|E

[...] "They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion." [...] Cameron emphasized people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were [...] "celebrating their own essential humanity" [...] by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally [...] "incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect <b>our</b> <b>basic</b> emotional fabric" [...] and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. [...] "Turan mistakes archetype for cliche," [...] he said. [...] "I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration." ...|$|E

She also faced the difficulty of leading an opposition caucus of only seven members, two short of official status (though Newman subsequently promised that Labor would have the full rights and resources entitled to the official opposition).

500|$|The {{detention}} conditions prompted {{national and}} international concern. Juan E. Méndez, United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, told The Guardian that the U.S. government's treatment of Manning was [...] "cruel, inhuman and degrading". In January 2011 Amnesty International asked the British government to intervene because of Manning's status as a British citizen by descent, although Manning's lawyer said Manning did not regard herself as a British citizen. The controversy claimed a casualty in March that year when State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley criticized Manning's treatment and resigned two days later. In March, 295 members of the academic legal community signed a statement arguing that, contrary to former professor of constitutional law President Obama's assertion that Manning's confinement was [...] "appropriate and meet <b>our</b> <b>basic</b> standards," [...] Manning was being subjected to [...] "degrading and inhumane pretrial punishment." [...] On April 20 the Pentagon transferred Manning to the medium-custody Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she was placed in an 80-square-foot cell with a window and a normal mattress, able to mix with other pretrial detainees and keep personal objects in her cell.|$|E

Moreover, Dulles did not share any sentimental regard for the Anglo-American [...] "special relationship", which led the Americans to lean towards the Egyptian side in the Anglo-Egyptian disputes. During the extremely difficult negotiations over the British evacuation of the Suez Canal base in 1954–55, the Americans generally supported Egypt, though at the same time trying hard to limit the extent of the damage that this might cause to Anglo-American relations.|$|E
