5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) is {{a learned}} {{society for the}} field of linguistics. Founded {{at the end of}} 1924 in New York City, the LSA works to promote the {{scientific}} study of language. The Society publishes two scholarly journals, Language and the open access journal Semantics and Pragmatics. Its annual meetings, held every winter, foster discussion amongst its members through the presentation <b>of</b> <b>peer-reviewed</b> research, as well as conducting official business of the Society. Since 1928, the LSA has offered training to linguists through courses held at its biennial Linguistic Institutes held in the summer. The LSA and its 3,500 members work to raise awareness of linguistic issues with the public and contributes to policy debates on issues including bilingual education and the preservation of endangered languages.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDepartment of Defense (DOD) spending {{has been steadily}} increasing ever since the early 1990 s. During that period, the acquisition workforce has steadily declined. This situation resulted in an undermanned and undertrained contracting workforce with an increased workload. With the workforce spread thin, lapses in contracting processes occurred. As {{a result of these}} issues, in 2008, the DOD established the requirement for independent management reviews, or peer reviews, of contractual actions. Since the onset <b>of</b> the <b>peer-review</b> requirement, the Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy (DPAP) has maintained a database <b>of</b> <b>peer-review</b> results. Data analytics were used to analyze the frequency of occurrences of the data elements within the DPAP database <b>of</b> <b>peer-review</b> results in an effort to answer two research questions. First, are there trends within the <b>peer-review</b> results <b>of</b> DOD-level <b>peer-reviewed</b> contracts? Second, are any trends identified related to the competency gaps identified in the 2007 Department of Defense Contracting Workforce Competency Assessment Final Report? Trends within the data elements present in the DPAP database <b>of</b> <b>peer-review</b> results were identified. Certain categories garnered more attention <b>of</b> the <b>peer-review</b> teams.

40|$|Recent controversies {{highlighting}} substandard {{peer review}} in Open Access (OA) and traditional (subscription) journals {{have increased the}} need for authors, funders, publishers, and institutions to assure quality <b>of</b> <b>peer-review</b> in academic journals. I propose that transparency <b>of</b> the <b>peer-review</b> process {{may be seen as}} an indicator of the quality <b>of</b> <b>peer-review,</b> and develop and validate a tool enabling different stakeholders to assess transparency <b>of</b> the <b>peer-review</b> process. Based on editorial guidelines and best practices, I developed a 14 -item tool to rate transparency <b>of</b> the <b>peer-review</b> process on the basis of journals' websites. In Study 1, a random sample of 231 authors of papers in 92 subscription journals in different fields rated transparency of the journals that published their work. Authors' ratings of the transparency were positively associated with quality <b>of</b> the <b>peer-review</b> process but unrelated to journal's impact factors. In Study 2, 20 experts on OA publishing assessed the transparency of established (non-OA) journals, OA journals categorized as being published by potential predatory publishers, and journals from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Results show high reliability across items (α =. 91) and sufficient reliability across raters. Ratings differentiated the three types of journals well. In Study 3, academic librarians rated a random sample of 140 DOAJ journals and another 54 journals that had received a hoax paper written by Bohannon to test peer-review quality. Journals with higher transparency ratings were less likely to accept the flawed paper and showed higher impact as measured by the h 5 index from Google Scholar.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{whether the}} Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) effects any real change in peer-review litigation under the antitrust laws. Although HCQIA 2 ̆ 7 s protection from legal liability {{is not limited}} to antitrust cases, the threat of antitrust liability provided the primary impetus for enacting the immunity provision, and thus this article focuses on the Act 2 ̆ 7 s impact on antitrust litigation only. The article concludes that, although Congress could have made reforms in the substantive or procedural adjudication <b>of</b> <b>peer-review</b> disputes under the antitrust laws, it has not done so by this Act, and that therefore courts should not interpret HCQIA as if it had enacted true reforms. Moreover, because the immunity granted by HCQIA is limited, a substantial amount <b>of</b> <b>peer-review</b> litigation will continue to arise that is outside the scope of the Act. This article is intended to guide courts not only in the interpretation of HCQIA, but also in the resolution <b>of</b> medical <b>peer-review</b> litigation under the antitrust laws whether or not the Act applies...|$|R
25|$|Copper alloy {{surfaces}} have intrinsic {{properties to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} microorganisms. In the interest of protecting public health, especially in healthcare environments with their susceptible patient populations, an abundance <b>of</b> <b>peer-reviewed</b> antimicrobial efficacy studies have been conducted in the past 10 years regarding copper's efficacy to destroy E. coli O157:H7, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus, Clostridium difficile, influenza A virus, adenovirus, and fungi. Stainless steel was also investigated because it is an important surface material in today's healthcare environments. The studies cited here, plus others directed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, resulted in the 2008 registration of 274 different copper alloys as certified antimicrobial materials that have public health benefits.|$|E
