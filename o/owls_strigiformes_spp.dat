In PNPG area there are records of the seven species present in Portugal; the Long-eared Owl and the Short-eared Owl are here occasional species. This work aims to determine the distribution, density and abundance of Strigiformes in PNPG (Northwest of Portugal). Between December 2007 and June 2008, 106 passive hearing point counts of 15 minutes each were done in the centre of each of 106 squares (2 x 2 km). Distribution maps for each species were obtained. Therefore, we recorded a total of 98 contacts for Tawny Owl and 67 contacts for Scops Owl. We also obtained 7 contacts of Little Owl, 2 contacts of Barn Owl and one of Eagle Owl. The habitat selection by Scops Owl and Tawny Owl was also studied. Scops Owls seems to avoid low shrub and preferred forested areas. Tawny Owls also avoid low shrub areas, preferring forested areas, and were found in urban areas.

40|$|The use of {{artificial}} nest boxes {{has led to}} significant progress in bird conservation and {{in our understanding of}} the functional and evolutionary ecology of free-ranging birds that exploit cavities for roosting and reproduction. Nest boxes and their improved accessibility have made it easier to perform comparative and experimental field investigations. However, concerns about the generality and applicability of scientific studies involving birds breeding in nest boxes have been raised because the occupants of boxes may differ from conspecifics occupying other nest sites. Here, we review the existing evidence demonstrating the importance of nest box design to individual life-history traits in three falcon (Falconiformes) and seven <b>owl</b> (<b>Strigiformes)</b> species, as well as the extent to which publications on these birds describe the characteristics of exploited artificial nest boxes in their "Methods" sections. More than 60 % of recent publications did not provide any details on nest box design (e. g. size, shape, material), despite several calls > 15 years ago to increase the reporting of such information.

40|$|In {{literature}} it {{is established}} that the iris musculature consists of striate muscle fibers in birds while in mammals it consists of smooth muscles. Some authors report the presence of smooth muscle tissue also in the iris of some species of birds. In the present study {{we report on the}} iris muscle tissues (type of tissue, direction and mean diameter of muscle fibers or cells) in five species of Accipitriformes (diurnal raptors) and four species of Strigiformes (nocturnal raptors) because they show different way of life depending of their predatory behavior. This morphological study was carried out from raptors died or euthanized at the Wild Life Rescue Centre of Sea and Water birds in Livorno (Italy). From histological examination of iris serial radial sections we find both striated and smooth musculature even if with marked differences among analyzed species, not directly correlated with diurnal or nocturnal lifestyle. Striated fibers are always present, mainly with cross direction, throughout the iris stroma, while the histological differences concern the smooth cells. Indeed, harrier and sparrow hawk (Accipitriformes) and great horned owl and little <b>owl</b> (<b>Strigiformes)</b> show a compact layer of cross smooth muscle cells throughout the iris stroma. In the other species analyzed smooth muscle cells are slightly detectable as scattered or not detectable. Since the cross smooth muscle tissue allows to maintain a myotic state for extended periods of time, our results might be correlated more to the predatory behavior than the taxonomic order...|$|R
40|$|Located {{in southwestern}} Transylvania, Romania, the {{uppermost}} Cretaceous continental deposits of the Hat¸eg Basin are widely {{known for their}} well-preserved and diverse vertebrate fauna (e. g., Bojar et al., 2010; Grigorescu, 2010). Since {{the end of the}} 19 th century, investigations of the fossiliferous continental deposits within the Hat¸eg Basin have revealed a wide range of preservation modes and taxa, including a large variety of small non-avian theropods (Weishampel and Jianu, 1996; Csiki and Grigorescu, 1998; Codrea et al., 2002; O? si and Fo? zy, 2007), several sites with dinosaur egg clutches and hatchlings (Grigorescu et al., 1990; Grigorescu, 1993; Weishampel et al., 1993; Codrea et al., 2002), a large pterosaur (Buffetaut et al., 2002), mammals (Grigorescu and Hahn, 1987; Csiki and Grigorescu, 2000; Codrea et al., 2002), and numerous other vertebrates (Folie and Codrea, 2005; Martin et al., 2006). It is thus surprising that bird remains have proved extremely rare within the Hat¸eg fauna. So far, only inconclusive records have been reported: Andrews (1913) first referred the proximal end of a femur and two distal tibiotarsi to Elopteryx nopcsai, a supposed pelecaniform bird. These tibiotarsi were later redescribed by Harrison and Walker (1975), who suggested that they belonged to two new taxa of Cretaceous <b>owls</b> (<b>Strigiformes)</b> —Bradycneme draculae and Heptasteornis andrewsi. However, the affinities of these bones have been much disputed and they are now generally regarded as belonging to non-avian theropods (Brodkorb, 1978; Elzanowski, 1983; Olson, 1985; Naish and Dyke, 2004; Kessler et al., 2005). Here, we present the first unequivocal evidence for a fossil bird in the Maastrichtian of the Hat¸eg Basin, a partial left tibiotarsus from the ‘middle member’ of the Densus¸-Ciula Formation (Fig. 1). The Maastrichtian age of these continental deposits is rather poorly constrained, as they overlie uppermost Campanian marine deposits (Melinte-Dobrinescu, 2010) and have yielded palynological assemblages indicative of a latest Cretaceous age (Antonescu et al., 1983; Csiki et al., 2008). The specimen (FGGUB [Faculty of Geology and Geophysics, University of Bucharest] R. 1902) was discovered in the rich microvertebrate bonebed at Fˆantˆ anele, nearV? alioara (seeGrigorescu et al., 1999), in the northwestern part of the Hat¸eg Basin, preserved in drab, fine-grained deposits suggestive of a poorly drained floodplain environment...|$|R

We utilized sequence data from two sequencing methodologies, Illumina paired-end sequence data with insert lengths ranging from approximately 250 nucleotides (nt) to 9, 600 nt and read lengths from 100 – 375 nt and Sanger-derived sequences. We employed multiple assemblers and alignment methods to generate the final assemblies. The circular genomes of S. o. caurina and S. varia are comprised of 19, 948 nt and 18, 975 nt, respectively. Both code for two rRNAs, twenty-two tRNAs, and thirteen polypeptides. They both have duplicated control region sequences with complex repeat structures.

It was initially placed in the <b>owl</b> order <b>Strigiformes</b> and {{considered to be a}} sophiornithid. S. dubius is based on a single tibiotarsus from the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene Quercy phosphorites of France. This tibiotarsus was destroyed in World War II during the bombing of Munich, but casts remain. In 1939, Gaillard described a second species of Strigogyps, S. minor, based on a humerus, two coracoids, and two carpometacarpi, also from Quercy. In 1981, Mourer-Chauviré redescribed S. minor as Ameghinornis minor, {{the only member of the}} new phorusrhacid subfamily, Ameghinornithinae. Ameghinornis was later placed in its own family, Ameghinornithidae. In 1987, Peters named another monospecific genus of ameghinornithid, Aenigmavis sapea, based on a nearly complete skeleton from the Middle Eocene Messel pit of Germany. Mayr (2005) found Aenigmavis to be a species of Strigogyps, S. sapea, and found Ameghinornis to be synonymous with S. dubius, as they both came from Quercy, and are almost identical except for coracoids and carpometacarpi of Ameghinornis, which Mayr found to be unlike other ameghinornithids, and probably from an idiornithid.In 1935, Lambrecht described a new New World vulture, Eocathartes robustus, and a hornbill, Geiseloceros robustus, from the Middle Eocene (Lutetian) of the Geisel Valley of Germany. Each was based on a single specimen, and they were found very close together. Mayr (2007) found them to be synonymous and a species of Strigogyps, S. robustus.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{evolution}} of birds began about 150 years ago with the finding of Archaeopteryx. Yet, many unsolved questions about avian evolution remain to be answered. This thesis aims at addressing some of these questions. The Early Cretaceous Confusiusornis is the most well-represented Mesozoic bird in the fossil record. The abundance of fossils facilitates a {{study of the}} preservation of specimens in the two geological formations in which this taxon is found. It was demonstrated that specimens in the Yixiang Formation always are represented by complete, articulated skeletons, while those in the Jiofutang Formation often lack the pectoral girdle and the wings. Despite the many specimens available of Confusiusornis few clues to the diet of this taxon have been found. We describe a Confusiusornis specimen with a pellet of fish remains preserved in the throat region. The enantiornithid birds probably constituted the most species-rich and diverse bird group during the Cretaceous. Several well-preserved specimens have been found in China, e. g. Grabauornis lingyuanensis described herein. The mass extinction {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous probably gave the only surviving group of birds,Neornithes,chance to radiate and evolve into new niches. One such group is the <b>Strigiformes</b> (<b>owls).</b> We describe a new species from the Eocene Green River Formation in USAthat we suggest is closely related to the contemporary European Prosybris antique and P. medius. Although birds are known from several Miocene localities in Europe, the discovery of vertebrate fossils in the Hambach opencast lignite mine was thus unexpected and remarkable. The most significant bird found in Hambach is a specimen of darter, genus Anhinga. It agrees in size, proportions and morphology the fossil species Anhinga pannonica to which we refer the Hambach specimen.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 I {{experimentally}} {{examined the}} adaptive {{significance of the}} anatomical and behavioral convergence between the harrier (Circus cyaneus, also refered to as the marsh hawk) and certain owls {{that are capable of}} capturing prey in total darkness. Anatomically, both the harrier and owls have evolved a sound collecting facial ruff (a curved wall of skin and feathers surrounding the ears) analogous to the mammalian pinna. Behaviorally, both the harrier and the owls forage very close to the substrate. This position substantially reduces the field of view but concomitantly increases the intensity and directional resolution of the acoustical cues emitted by concealed prey. There are at least two mutually exclusive evolutionary alternatives for localizing highly concealed prey. A predator relying on high resolution vision can circumvent the reduced visibility of individual prey by foraging from a high perch or flight position. Increased foraging height can increase the field of view and hence the number of prey simultaneously scanned. The likelihood of detecting a vulnerable prey item can thus increase with increasing field of view. A second alternative is to employ sonic cues that can penetrate the vegetational barrier to visual prey detection. This alternative constrains a raptor to forage from a low position due to the restricted range of sonic prey localization compared to visual prey localization. Thus, a raptor detecting concealed prey through sonic cues must forfeit the larger field of view available to raptors relying exclusively on visual cues. In this research I test the hypothesis that the diurnal harrier (Order Falconiformes) has converged with certain nocturnal <b>owls</b> (Order <b>Strigiformes)</b> in the ability to sonically locate concealed prey. I also test the idea that a reliance on auditory cues in part explains the harrier's low foraging position. My thesis research was divided into two parts, a laboratory and a field study. In the laboratory, the auditory localization capacity of the harrier was compared to that of an owl species (barn owl, Tyto alba) with an experimentally established ability to acoustically locate prey in total darkness, to a second owl species (short-eared owl, Asio flammeus) with a behavioral repertoire {{similar to that of the}} harrier, and two typical diurnal raptor species (red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis and the American kestrel, Falco sparverius) lacking apparent anatomical specializations for directional hearing. Two individuals from each species were tested. The directional hearing of the harrier was found to be superior to that of the sample of typical diurnal raptors and similar to that of the sample of owls. Specifically, the horizontal resolution was two degrees for the harriers, eight to twelve degrees for the sample of typical diurnal raptors, and one to two degrees for the sample of nocturnal owls. The range of effective sonic prey detection was estimated to be three to four meters for the harrier compared to seven meters for the barn owl. In the field experiments a subterranean wiring network (test grid) was used to broadcast synthetic vole vocalizations (squeaks) from concealed miniature loudspeakers. The speakers were covered with replaceable plastic membranes. When a wild free-ranging raptor flew over the test grid, the vole vocalization was broadcast at a normal volume. The sound stimulus was terminated when the bird approached to within three to four meters of the speaker. Five harriers were tested for a total of ten trials. In all but one case the harriers responded to the sound stimulus by striking through the overlying vegetation and piercing the speaker membrane with their talons. Neither of two American kestrels that were tested responded to the auditory stimulus even when actual recordings of the resident voles were used. Because no visual or olfactory cues were available, the harriers determined the simulated vole position exclusively through auditory cues. The field experiments also demonstrated that the sonic localization capacity determined under highly idealized conditions in the laboratory is sufficiently elaborate to compensate for the distortions produced by heterogeneities in the more complex natural environment. Thus the harrier, like many nocturnal owls, is capable of capturing concealed prey by locating them through sonic cues. Because the sonic localization capacity of the harrier only has an effective range of three to four meters, this species is constrained to forage relatively close to the substrate while employing sonic prey detection...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIV) are {{prevalent in}} birds, several mammals and in humans. Low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) of subtypes H 5 and H 7 can become highly pathogenic {{due to the}} high frequency of mutation. Certain virus strains have zoonotic potential. Infections with highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) of subtype H 5 N 1 have caused hundreds of cases of illness and deaths in humans in recent years. LPAIV are widely distributed among wild birds, especially wild waterfowl. However, since {{the emergence of the}} HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 in the year 2005, numerous infections have occurred in wild birds, with different susceptibility of certain species. Although the role of wild birds in HPAIV is still controversial, this host reservoir poses a risk for AIV infections to occur among commercial poultry which then results in extensive epizootic disease control activities and enormous economic consequences. Besides HPAIV infections, it is also mandatory to control LPAIV infections of subtypes H 5 and H 7 throughout Europe. To acquire data for risk assessment, first voluntary and later obligatory specifications for monitoring the prevalence of AIV in wild birds were developed. According to refined risk assessment certain species, especially of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriformes, were preferentially included in the monitoring program. Through implementation of these specifications wild bird monitoring was performed in the federal state of Brandenburg. This work evaluates the resulting data from the period of 2006 to 2010. In total, 8. 290 wild birds of 139 domestic species and 43 families have been examined for AIV by testing organs from bird remains, pharyngeal or cloacae swabs as well as excrement. The largest fraction of the investigated species were geese and ducks (Anseriformes) forming 35 % of total. 21 birds, predominantly swans, tested positive for HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 infection with the “Asia” strain in combination with Europe-wide outbreaks of the virus in wild birds during spring-time 2006. Subsequently, there was no further evidence for HPAIV infection in the federal state of Brandenburg. During the period of five years (2006 - 2010) 90 cases of LPAIV have been diagnosed, among them the subtypes H 5 and H 7. The species with the highest prevalence was Mallard followed by Eurasian Coot. Orders with LPAIV infections have been Anseriformes, Podicipediformes (Grebes), Gruiformes (cranes and relatives), Accipitriformes (raptors) und <b>Strigiformes</b> (<b>owls).</b> Significant differences in the distribution pattern of LPAIV have been detected within individual years and between different years, as well as differences in geographic distribution. Numbers of AIV infections showed a peak in late summer to early winter, especially in the Ramsar Site Peitzer Teiche located in the administrative district Spree-Neiße. The wild bird monitoring was completed by the investigation of Mallards (Anas plathyrhynchos) which were kept in a facility at the Lake Felchowsee in the administrative district Uckermark. These sentinel animals lived in a permanent contact with the local wild birds for the period of October 2008 to October 2010. A sampling of the sentinels was performed every two weeks by taking swabs for AIV detection and every four weeks with blood tests for AIV antibody detection. Compared to the comprehensive wild bird monitoring, the detection rate among the sentinels was significantly higher and several subtypes were detected. AIV antibodies were found in the Mallards two weeks after beginning testing with a positive serological response lasting from two weeks to several months. However, the subtype specificity of the antibodies (H 7) could only be determined for a single animal by hemagglutination inhibition reaction. From the wild bird monitoring an overview of the AIV prevalence in the federal state of Brandenburg could be achieved. However, for some species the number of investigated animals was not sufficient to confirm AIV infection’s significance in certain months and areas. Examination of data clearly shows that sampling of carcasses (passive monitoring) is superior to sampling of live animals (active monitoring) in confirmation of HPAIV infection in wild birds. However, active monitoring seems to be more suitable for the detection of LPAIV. Focusing on certain species (Mallard, Eurasian Coot), certain areas (wetlands, especially Lakes Peitzer Teiche and Lakes Havelseen), certain months (September, October and January to March) and a certain sampling specification (hunted Mallards) could increase efficiency of surveillance. Sentinel facilities seem to provide a cost-efficient alternative to conventional monitoring in order to provide data, including serology, to follow the course of AIV infections over long time periods in a particular ecosystem...|$|R
