5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> reason {{should be used to}} determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E

Heffernan contended that while he had not actually engaged in any protected speech, the department acted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> he had, and the department should not have demoted him on the basis of that erroneous belief.|$|E
5|$|In modern fiction, {{the vampire}} {{tends to be}} {{depicted}} as a suave, charismatic villain. Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities, occasional sightings of vampires are reported. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons. Allegations of vampire attacks swept through Malawi during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor Eric Chiwaya, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the government was colluding with vampires.|$|E

Her incomplete hulk initially was retained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> it {{could be used as a}} target in nuclear weapons tests. However, the some $30million it would cost to complete the ship enough to be able to launch her proved too great and the plan was abandoned. She remained in the dockyard until September 1958, when she was broken up on the builder's ways.|$|E

5|$|Alchemy {{was already}} well {{established}} before {{the rise of}} Islam. It was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> substances were {{made up of the}} four Aristotelian elements, fire, earth, air, and water in different proportions. Alchemists supposed that gold was the noblest metal, and that other metals formed a series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, too, that a fifth element, the elixir, could transform a base metal into gold. Jabir ibn Hayyan (8th–9th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue to be used when alchemy had transformed into chemistry. Ibn Hayyan identified many substances including sulphuric and nitric acids. He described processes such as sublimation, reduction and distillation. He made use of equipment such as the alembic and the retort stand.|$|E

Shortly {{after the trial}} and conviction, his wife Debra filed for divorce and their marriage was formally dissolved a year later. Chandler was no longer allowed to see his daughter Whitney, and, in accordance with his ex-wife's wishes, he {{was not allowed to}} see later photographs of her. In July 2008, Chandler was on Florida's short list of executions. Profiling experts speculated that Chandler may have killed previously, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> a first-time killer would not be experienced, or bold enough, to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remained a suspect in the 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island until 2011, when the body was identified as 29-year-old Amy Hurst and her husband {{was arrested and charged with}} her murder. Chandler was never charged with another murder. All of his appeals of his 1994 conviction were denied; his last was in May 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{has been with}} humans {{since at least the}} Bronze Age. The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians {{through the end of the}} first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> it was caused by spirits.|$|E
5|$|Prior to a {{government}} report being presented on 30 March 1993, SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of free competition, while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date. Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated {{that the company had}} bought the new aircraft based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline time to pay more of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E

He applied for the job of England manager after Don Revie quit the role and after Brian Clough was ruled out by the Football Association but did not receive a reply to his application, and he vowed never to apply for another job again and instead wait until he was approached.|$|E

5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

50|$|A Socratic Circle (also {{known as}} a Socratic Seminar) is a {{pedagogical}} approach based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Socratic method and uses a dialogic approach to understand information in a text. Its systematic procedure is used to examine a text through questions and answers founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> all new knowledge is connected to prior knowledge, that all thinking comes from asking questions, and that asking one question should lead to asking further questions. A Socratic Circle is not a debate. The goal of this activity is to have participants work together to construct meaning and arrive at an answer, not for one student or one group to “win the argument”.|$|R

[...] Students who are not self-regulated learners may daydream, rarely complete assignments or forget assignments completely. Those who do practice self-regulation ask questions, take notes, allocate their time effectively, and use resources available to them. Pajares lists several practices of successful students that Zimmerman and his colleagues developed in his chapter of Motivation and Self-Regulated Learning: Theory, Research, and Applications.|$|R
