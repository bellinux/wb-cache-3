Club, rated the episode an [...] "A." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Fearnet columnist Alyse Wax {{called it a}} [...] "pretty good episode", and believed it to be [...] "far more enjoyable than last week's", as it lacked that episode's [...] "conspiracy nonsense" [...] and John Scott storyline. However, Wax continued that [...] "The Equation" [...] "seemed rather pedestrian" [...] because [...] "nothing too freaky" [...] happened, and wished that Walter and Peter had been used more. [...] Jane Boursaw <b>of</b> <b>AOL</b> TV considered Walter's return to the asylum [...] "heartbreaking".|$|E

[...] Sharon Knolle <b>of</b> <b>AOL</b> TV said, [...] "I'd say overall this ep ranks with some of the better Sideshow Bob eps, if not the very best.
