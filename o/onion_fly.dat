40|$|The current goal of our {{research}} {{is to develop a}} biocompatible management strategy for <b>onion</b> maggot <b>flies</b> that would replace the use of foliar applications of broad-spectrum pesticides.   Foliar sprays are used in an attempt to kill <b>onion</b> maggot <b>flies</b> before they lay eggs in onion fields.   However, {{there is no evidence that}} this strategy is worthwhile and there are multiple disadvantages. As an alternative, insecticide-baited devices could be used in onion fields to “attract and kill” <b>onion</b> maggot <b>flies.</b>   In 2006, we evaluated the efficacy of spinosad-baited spheres in a commercial onion production area near Elba, NY. These spheres, which were nearly the same size and color as a softball, contained a low concentration of the insecticide active ingredient spinosad (< 1. 0 %) plus sucrose. Spheres were hung about 18 inches from the ground and placed along onion field edges. We estimated that 45 to 60 % of the flies that visited a sphere were killed.   Based on fly visitation rates, we also predicted that one spinosad-baited sphere would kill approximately 182 flies (147 males and 36 females) during the onion-growing season. In 2007, we wanted to evaluate the performance of these spheres by assessing the level of protection they would provide to onion plants in commercial fields. Unfortunately, we did not observe a reduction in onion plant damage in field plots of onions where spinosad-baited spheres were placed. Examination of these spheres in the lab revealed that they failed to kill flies. Some of these spheres were rinsed with water and scrubbed lightly and the trial was repeated. This time, 56 to 72 % of flies confined within cages containing the “recharged” spinosad-baited spheres died within 72 hrs. Therefore, it is likely that the poor field performance of the spinosad-baited spheres for protecting the onion crop was due to a problem with the spheres not making the spinosad available.   We believe that extremely dry weather was responsible for this phenomenon. Additional research is being discussed for dealing with this trap design issue under dry conditions...|$|R

40|$|Since 2007 Applied Plant Research (PPO) investigates {{whether the}} carrot root fly (Psila rosae) can be disorientated by {{applying}} strong smelling oils. A mature carrot root fly {{can find a}} carrot field by smell. The {{question is whether the}} smell of carrots may be masked by strong smelling oils so that the carrot root fly can not find the carrot plants. In 2008 we found an indication that strong smelling oil can reduce <b>onion</b> root <b>fly</b> damage. In the untreated plot 7 % of the roots were affected by the carrot root fly and in the treated plot (masked by strong smelling oil) 1 % of the roots were affected. In 2009 on 6 carrot fields and one root parsley field demonstrations were created by Dutch organic farmers to reduce carrot fly damage. In all the 6 carrot fields the root fly damage was too little to determine differences. The maximum percentage of infected carrot roots was below 3 %. As a result, the effect of oregano-oil could not be determined. In the parsley root field damage was sufficiently high to see effects of the oil treatment. In the patch protected by onion oil 1. 5 % of the roots were affected. At a distance of 150 m from this patch no infected roods were found. At a distance of 270 m from the patch 11. 5 % of the roots were affected. The oils used have a natural origin (extracted from plants). The method is selective because only insects reacting on the carrot smell are affected. They have more difficulty in finding carrot fields, or can not find them at all. If this method functions well, it can be used in organic and conventional cultivation of carrots...|$|R

40|$|The {{onion maggot}} (OM) {{continues}} to threaten commercial onion production in New York (ca. 12, 000 acres), Michigan (ca. 8, 000 acres), and Wisconsin (ca. 2, 000 acres). In these states, onions are intensively grown on high organic (muck) soils. Because onion production is specialized and costly, many growers concentrate {{primarily on the}} one crop, resulting in minimal rotations to other plant species. This practice invariably increases onion maggot pressure, since this insect usually completes three generations per growing season; and has only one major commercial host in the U. S. Immature stages of the OM dwell within or just outside of underground portions of the onion plant. A system where onions are grown either continuously or {{in close proximity to}} last year's plantings must rely heavily upon effective soil chemicals applied at seeding to control the larval stages. In addition, sprays are often applied in an attempt to control the adult fly stage. However, sprays directed at flies cannot be relied upon.

40|$|Experiments on sex {{determination}} of the <b>onion</b> <b>fly,</b> Hylemya antiqua (Meigen), are reported {{in the first two}} chapters. The main purpose was to establish if the sex ratio distortion observed in certain crosses, was based on a mechanism which could be used for genetic purposes. Two types of males, XY 1 and XXY 2 , were found and the aberrant sex ratios appeared only to occur in progenies of XXY 2 (and some XXY 2 Y 2 ) males. A numerical variation for Y 2 was frequently observed in embryos, larval ganglion cells and especially in testes, which is caused by numerical non-disjunction in somatic cells. The sex ratio distortion is attributed to such a numerical variation of Y 2 between primordial germ cells. Some progenies with a highly distorted sex ratio in male direction descended probably from XXY 2 Y 2 males. Since an effective selection of XXY 2 Y 2 males is not possible, this type of sex ratio distortion is not suited for application in a genetic control method. Other subjects treated in chapters 1 and 2 are gynandromorphism, a polymorphism with respect to the length of the X-chromosome and X-polysomy. In the progeny of one cross a chromosome morphologically identical to Y 2 but lacking its holandric inheritance was found. From its inheritance in various crosses it could be concluded that it {{was nothing more than a}} (mutated) non-functional Y 2 chromosome. The meiotic segregation of a Y 1 -linked translocation T 61 is reported in the third chapter. The high percentage of alternate segregation observed in T 61 -heterozygous males (22 YXY 2 ) was in good accordance with the high fertility of this translocation (95 %). Because of an early separation (or asynapsis) of the centromeric regions of the acrocentric X and Y 2 , chain quadrivalents with X and Y 2 in terminal position predominated in diakinesis/ prometaphase I stages. In these chain quadrivalents adjacent l is supposed to be unstable since neither X nor Y 2 have a neighbouring centromere in trans-position. The very low frequency of adjacent 2 is attributed to a preferential coorientation of homologous centromeres. The suitability of T 61 for genetic sexing (preferential killing of females) is discussed. Double-translocation heterozygous T 14 /T 61 males (2 6 2 Y 6 2 6 XY 2 ) were produced by intercrossing T 14 -homozygous females (2 6 2 6 6 2 6 2 XX) and T 61 -heterozygous males (22 Y 66 XY 2 ) These double heterozygotes showed several segregation types but for predominated. The total frequency of duplication/deficiency gametes was 60 - 65 %. Application possibilities for these heterozygotes in genetic control of the <b>onion</b> <b>fly</b> are discussed. The meiotic segregation of five different autosomal reciprocal translocations are given in chapter 5. For translocation T 14, which has very short interstitial segments, significant differences in segregation between the sexes were found. In males the ratio of alt. : adj. 1 :adj. 2 was about 7 : 3 : 0 and in females 8 : 1 : 3. It is assumed that the very intimate meiotic pairing in males (without chiasmata) results in relatively very short "Coorientation Determining Distances" (CDD's) between the homologous centromeres. Due to these short CDD's a preferential coorientation between homologous centromeres is expected favouring alternate and adjacent l segregation. On the contrary, in females chiasmata act very probably as reference points for coorientation. Due to variable positions of the centromeres, in T 14 -heterozygous females less pronounced differences in CDD's between homologous and non-homologous are expected as in males. This is suggested to be the reason that in females a coorientation between non-homologous centromeres can occur resulting in a certain frequency of adjacent 2. The very low frequencies or absence of adjacent 2 in the other four translocations is attributed to their longer interstitial segments. For translocation T 14 a pure breeding stock of homozygotes could be obtained using egg-hatch percentages and cytology for the recognition of the karyotypes (chapter 6). In cage experiments under laboratory conditions the competitiveness of the translocation homozygotes was tested. Starting from an initial population consisting of equal numbers of translocation homozygotes (TT) and wild type flies (++), the karyotype frequencies were determined for three successive, non-overlapping generations. The results obtained did not suggest substantial differences in fitness between TT and ++. In field cage experiments (chapter 7) a high diapause sensitivity was found for the translocation homozygotes as well as for the laboratory strain of wild type flies (++) used. As a consequence of this high diapause sensitivity the fitness of the homozygotes could not be determined under field conditions. In the "General Discussion" different application possibilities of translocations for genetic control of the <b>onion</b> <b>fly</b> are discussed. A summary of unpublished data concerning the egg-hatch and pupal survival of eight threechromosome double-translocation heterozygotes and three more complex translocation heterozygotes is also presented there. The aim of these experiments was to determine if perhaps a double translocation could be isolated meeting the conditions for a stable equilibrium. However, neither of these translocations met these conditions. Firstly, the frequencies of duplication/deficiency gametes were not high enough; secondly, insufficient complementation occurred and, thirdly, the recombination percentages in the differential segments were too high (resulting in undesirable karyotypes). Two of three double translocations tested, appeared to be viable as homozygotes in the adult stage...|$|E

The τ in constant dim light(LdimLdim) was longer than that in DD, suggesting that the phase delay of locomotor activity in LLdim cycle was caused by increase in τ.

The τ in DD at 20 ℃ became short er than that at 25 ℃, suggesting again that the phase advance of locomotor activity in LD cycles at 20 ℃ was caused by decrease in τ. A 1 h light pulse falling in early night in LD ll: 13 at 20 ℃ caused a phase delay of locomotor activity of D. antiqua and the pulse falling in late night a phase advance.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to isolate structural chromosome mutations causing "semi"-sterility which can be used for genetic control of the <b>onion</b> <b>fly</b> Hylemya antiqua (Meigen). For the induction, X-rays or fast neutrons were applied in different doses on males and females. "Semi"-sterile families were screened cytologically for translocations and inversions. It appeared that high doses 0. 5 krad of X-rays) tended to yield complex rearrangements which present difficulties in practical programs, in addition to the useful less complicated rearrangements. They also produce more genetic background damage than lower doses (0 - 5 krad), which still yield acceptable numbers of uncomplicated rearrangements and therefore are advised for a genetic control program. Because of strongly reduced fecundity of irradiated females these are less suitable for induction of rearrangements than males, although older females because of higher fecundity give better results than young females. Fast neutrons on young males were useful and a low dose of 0. 25 krad appeared {{to be as good as}} 1. 0 krad. Seventeen different translocations and two pericentric inversions were observed. Most "breakpoints" are located on the longer chromosome arms. Inversion heterozygous males were as fertile as the control which confirms their achiasmate meiosis. Eight translocation stocks were sibcrossed. In five of these, translocation homozygotes were found as larvae and in three out of these five even as adults. The occurrence of duplication/deficiency (from adjacent I orientation) larvae in the five stocks mentioned was remarkable. From experiments with an X-linked translocation it was concluded that the acrocentric chromosomes are the sex-chromosomes. The alternate and adjacent I orientation frequencies in translocation heterozygotes (X-linked) were shown to be equal in each sex, while no adjacent II was found. In this translocation meiotic numerical non- disjunction occurred in 18. 7 % of the tranlocation heterozygous females but in 2. 0 % of the males. This difference is probably a consequence of the difference in meiotic behaviour between the sexes. A good relationship was found between the degree of chromosomal unbalance and the frequency of late embryonic lethals (brown eggs) which was used as a graduator in the selection for "semi"-sterility. Adult fertile translocation trisomics and adult sterile tertiary trisomics were obtained (both sexes) after meiotic numerical non- disjunction. In translocation trisomic males the X-, Y- and translocated (extra) X-chromosome were shown to disjoin at random. In females the two normal X-chromosomes almost (95 %) preferentially disjoin, while the translocated X-chromosome goes to either one of the poles. Primary trisomic males (XXY) and females (XXX) were obtained from testcrossed translocation trisomic parents. XXY males produced four types of gametes XY, X, Y and XX in equal numbers. XXX females only gave XX and X gametes in an equal number. Succesfull attempts to obtain homozygotes for this X-linked translocation are reported. The theoretical background of genetic insect control is discussed...|$|E
