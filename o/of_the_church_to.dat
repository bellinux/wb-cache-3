5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> mission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> is <b>to</b> make disciples <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> nations. However <b>the</b> <b>church</b> {{has lost}} focus of its mission {{to reach the}} lost people outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> Over <b>the</b> last several decades <b>the</b> <b>church</b> has become {{inwardly}} focused on itself and its members. This has caused <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>to</b> be in a serious state <b>of</b> decline to <b>the</b> point that many are on <b>the</b> verge <b>of</b> closing. If <b>the</b> <b>church</b> does not rediscover the biblical model that Jesus gave it, it could lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> as we know it...|$|R
25|$|The Crypt was <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>to</b> be {{completed}} in the Domain, and is today among the smallest. Construction was started by Abbé Peyramale and Mgr. Laurence. Bernadette's father worked on its construction and was present at its official opening, on Pentecost Sunday, 1866.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the debts}} {{related to the}} costs for the {{construction}} of the building having been settled in the early-mid 19th century, and the church ceasing to exist 100 years later, the three acts of Parliament allowing trustees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> levy rates on properties in the parish for the purpose of settling those debts remained in force and untouched until the Law Commission proposed their repeal in July 2014, with a view to presenting recommendations to Parliament in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Haydock also {{considered}} a {{theme in the}} film to be the inability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> fulfill individual spiritual needs. This {{is said to be}} shown through many of Joan's encounters with the church; as a girl she is scolded for going to confession too often, denied communion and forced to sneak into the church to take it herself, and during her trial, where she is denied confession until The Conscience confesses her instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was the inability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from {{the spirit of the}} Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|In 1574, Queen Elizabeth I {{promoted}} the restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>to</b> {{serve as the}} grand parish church of Bath. She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work, and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath. James Montague, the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608–1616, paid £1,000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction; according to the inscription on his tomb, this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm. He is buried in an alabaster tomb in the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the couple}} {{went through a}} {{marriage}} ceremony on 15 December 1785 at her house in Park Street, Mayfair. Legally the union was void, as the King's consent was not granted (and never even requested). However, Fitzherbert believed {{that she was the}} prince's canonical and true wife, holding the law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> be superior to the law of the State. For political reasons, the union remained secret and Fitzherbert promised not to reveal it.|$|E
5|$|On December 14, 2014 Naasón Joaquín García, {{the fifth}} {{born of the}} Joaquin family, became the spiritual leader and {{international}} director of La Luz del Mundo church. Naasón was born on May 7, 1969 and previously served as pastor in Santa Ana, California. After almost three years of arduous work Naasón continues to lead the church, with ambition to fulfill a promise he received from God in a vision, that La Luz del Mundo Church will grow to a number that he could never imagine or perceive. He also urges the youth and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> join him in spreading their doctrine {{to the ends of}} the earth.|$|E
50|$|In Italy it was {{customary}} {{to scatter}} rose petals from <b>the</b> ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> <b>to</b> recall <b>the</b> miracle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fiery tongues; hence in Sicily {{and elsewhere in}} Italy Whitsunday is called Pasqua rosatum.

5|$|The Imperial {{government}} {{wanted to}} reform the church and appointed a series of well educated, reforming bishops. Although these bishops agreed with the government {{on the need to}} reform, they did not share Pedro II's views on the subservience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> government and tended to be influenced by Ultramontanism which emphasised loyalty to the Papacy over loyalty to the civil powers.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a {{great number}} of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of the}} church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>to</b> be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, news of Henry's {{death had}} reached Stephen of Blois, {{conveniently}} placed in Boulogne, {{and he left}} for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen reached the edge of London by 8 December {{and over the next}} week he began to seize power in England. The crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return, and his brother, Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, delivered the support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>to</b> Stephen. Stephen had sworn to support Matilda in 1127, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath, and suggested that the King had changed his mind on his deathbed. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 26 December.|$|E

5|$|The {{church at}} Llanfaelrhys {{is the only}} one in the United Kingdom {{dedicated}} to Saint Maelrhys, the cousin of both Saint Cadfan and Saint Hywyn, who accompanied them to Wales from Brittany. Legend attributes the building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> a trader who landed a cargo of flour near Aberdaron during a famine; he used the profit from his sale to construct a small church for the locals. Much of the building is medieval; the font dates back to the 15th century; and there are plain hard wooden benches on the north side; on the south side are 19th century wooden box pews. The graveyard contains the graves of the three Keating sisters, who restored Plas yn Rhiw.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowds in}} London {{traditionally}} claimed {{a right to}} elect the king of England, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return. Henry of Blois delivered the support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, who was both the Bishop of Salisbury and the Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury {{to be handed over}} to Stephen. On 15 December, Henry delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.|$|E
5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{church on}} the site was named All Hallows, and was constructed in medieval times on land granted by the monarch at the time, Henry II, to the monks of St. Denys Priory. This building fell into disrepair and in the 1790s a new church building was constructed and the church renamed to All Saints. The old church was demolished in 1791 and the new building was completed in 1795, following two acts of Parliament allowing trustees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> raise funds from rates on property and rents in the parish. The All Hallows catacombs were incorporated into the All Saints building, and a separate graveyard was established. The church was regularly attended by author Jane Austen while she lived in Southampton and painter Sir John Everett Millais was baptised there. A new organ was installed in the church in 1861 and a substantial refurbishment programme took place in 1872. All Saints was heavily damaged in the Southampton Blitz and was subsequently demolished.|$|E
5|$|The timing {{could not}} have been better for the Vale Royal community, for in a storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the {{unfinished}} nave of their abbey church collapsed, and rebuilding {{could not have}} been funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full. It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been in response to that event. Given that the abbey was already – and remained – in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that. As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>to</b> be maintained by the parish.|$|E
