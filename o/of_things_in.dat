5|$|Aristotle, {{and nearly}} all Western {{scholars}} after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to humans: the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany—the History of Plants—which survived {{as the most important}} contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the Middle Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpion for seed vessel. Dioscorides wrote a pioneering and encyclopaedic pharmacopoeia, De Materia Medica, incorporating descriptions of some 600 plants and their uses in medicine. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History, assembled a similarly encyclopaedic account <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> nature, including accounts of many plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature <b>of</b> <b>Things).</b> <b>In</b> the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant {{for more than a}} quarter of a century. Manning's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; arthritis increasingly affected her, leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in The Levant Trilogy, The Sum <b>of</b> <b>Things,</b> <b>in</b> which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, but having said goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet's travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy's supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet's ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone's injury during the battle of El Alamein and recovery.|$|E

5|$|Later {{chapters}} tell {{of events}} since Metamorphosis. In British Columbia, Suzuki spends {{time on the}} Queen Charlotte Islands and in Stein Valley advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of The Nature <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> <b>in</b> 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.|$|E

25|$|With {{the goal}} of {{explaining}} Epicurean philosophy to a Roman audience, the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius wrote De Rerum Natura (The Nature <b>of</b> <b>Things)</b> <b>in</b> 50 BC. In the work, Lucretius presents the principles of atomism; {{the nature of the}} mind and soul; explanations of sensation and thought; the development of the world and its phenomena; and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Thought is {{a mental}} act that allows humans {{to make sense}} <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the world, and to {{represent}} and interpret them {{in ways that are}} significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the symbolic or semiotic mediation of ideas or data, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reasoning, and making decisions. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, ideation, discourse and imagination.|$|E

25|$|What is {{generally}} accepted in Buddhism is that effects arise from causation. From {{his very first}} discourse onwards, the Buddha explains the reality <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> terms of cause and effect. The existence of misery and suffering in any given individual {{is due to the}} presence of causes. One way to describe the Buddhist eightfold path is a turning towards the reality of things as they are right now and understanding reality directly, although it is debated the degree to which these investigations are metaphysical or epistemological.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{than the}} {{attestations}} {{in the full}} function as a numeral are a few instances where sampi was used in Athens as a mark to enumerate sequences <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> a set, along with the 24 other letters of the alphabet, without implying a specific decimal numeral value. For instance, there {{is a set of}} 25 metal tokens, each stamped with one of the letters from alpha to sampi, which are dated to the 4th century BC and were probably used as identification marks for judges in the courts of the Athenian democracy.|$|E

25|$|In 1954 and 1955, Simpson {{explored}} the global and time variations of cosmic rays {{around the world}} at these neutron monitor stations. In 1956, the giant cosmic ray flare provided for Simpson the first direct glimpse of the state <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> interplanetary space. At this point the scientific community surrounding cosmic rays and solar activity had grown largely, and for the International Geophysical Year (1957–58) Simpson was one of 12 other scientists responsible for organizing and coordinating the international program, helping {{to make it a}} huge success.|$|E
25|$|As the Corriere della Sera Asian correspondent, {{he went to}} China. On 11 December 1937, he was {{aboard the}} USS Panay on the Yangtze Patrol in Nanking at the {{prompting}} of George Atcheson, a U.S. Embassy official. Also aboard were Universal News cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone News' Eric Mayell, the New York Timess Norman Soong, Collier's Weekly correspondent Jim Marshall, and La Stampa correspondent Sandro Sandri. Atcheson had invited them aboard the Panay {{so that they could}} document the fall of the city from relative safety. The four journalists had been covering the ongoing Japanese invasion of China in the mid-1930s, and found themselves in the thick <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> early December 1937 as Japanese forces moved on Nanking.|$|E
25|$|Years {{of peace}} under Russian rule brought {{increasing}} prosperity and many new manor houses {{were built in}} country estates, but economic exploitation worsened situation of the native population. The native Latvian and Estonian population enjoyed fewer rights under the Baltic German nobility compared to the farmers in Germany, Sweden, or Poland. In contrast to the Baltic Germans, Estonians and Latvians had restricted civil rights and resided mostly in rural areas as serfs, tradesmen, or as servants in manors and urban homes. They had no rights to leave their masters and no last names. This was {{in keeping with the}} social scheme <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> Russian Empire, and lasted until the 19th century, when emancipation from serfdom brought those inhabitants increased civil freedoms and some political rights.|$|E

25|$|Mexican {{handcrafted}} {{toys are}} mostly miniature representations <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> life, such as birds, furniture, mermaids, bullfighting scenes, carts and much more, made with materials on hand such as bulrush, wood, cloth, clay and lead. They were mostly made {{for children of}} the Mexican underclasses. They are considered artistic not because of originality but rather the ingenuity of creating something special from practically nothing. These toys, most of which that survive are from the 19th and early 20th century are increasingly valued by collectors but are in disdain among the general Mexican populace. Since the 1950s, with the influence of movies and television, most children stopped wanting these types of toys for mass products produced abroad and {{based on what they}} see in media. Most toys sold to tourists now are cheaply made imitations {{of what used to be}} common.|$|E
25|$|An object either (1) is {{immediate}} to a sign, {{and that}} is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a dynamic object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's universe of discourse, the totality <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) immediate to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) dyanamic, an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) final or normal, a question's true settlement, which would be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.|$|E
25|$|The load a {{skyscraper}} experiences {{is largely}} from {{the force of the}} building material itself. In most building designs, the weight of the structure is much larger than the weight of the material that it will support beyond its own weight. In technical terms, the dead load, the load of the structure, is larger than the live load, the weight <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the structure (people, furniture, vehicles, etc.). As such, the amount of structural material required within the lower levels of a skyscraper will be much larger than the material required within higher levels. This is not always visually apparent. The Empire State Building's setbacks are actually a result of the building code at the time (1916 Zoning Resolution), and were not structurally required. On the other hand, John Hancock Center's shape is uniquely the result of how it supports loads. Vertical supports can come in several types, among which the most common for skyscrapers can be categorized as steel frames, concrete cores, tube within tube design, and shear walls.|$|E
