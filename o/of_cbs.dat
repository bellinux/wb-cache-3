40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{visual system}} exhibits significant experience-induced plasticity {{in the early}} postnatal period. While physiological studies have revealed the contribution <b>of</b> the <b>CB</b> 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB 1) to developmental plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V 1), it remains unknown whether the expression and localization <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 is regulated during development or by visual experience. To explore a possible role of the endocannabinoid system in visual cortical plasticity, we examined the expression <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 in the visual cortex of mice. We found intense CB 1 immunoreactivity in layers II/III and VI. CB 1 mainly localized at vesicular GABA transporter-positive inhibitory nerve terminals. The amount <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 protein increased throughout development, and the specific laminar pattern <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 appeared at P 20 and remained until adulthood. Dark rearing from birth to P 30 decreased the amount <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 protein in V 1 and altered the synaptic localization <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 in the deep layer. Dark rearing until P 50, however, did not influence the expression <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1. Brief monocular deprivation for 2 days upregulated the localization <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 at inhibitory nerve terminals in the deep layer. Taken together, the expression and the localization <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 are developmentally regulated, and both parameters are influenced by visual experience...|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow derived mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (BM-MSCs) are {{considered}} {{as the most}} promising cells source for bone engineering. Cannabinoid (CB) receptors play important roles in bone mass turnover. The {{aim of this study}} is to test if activation <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor by chemical agonist could enhance the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization in bone BM-MSCs. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity staining and real time PCR were performed to test the osteogenic differentiation. Alizarin red staining was carried out to examine the mineralization. Small interference RNA (siRNA) was used to study the role <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor in osteogenic differentiation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cannabinoids are {{derivates}} of {{the marijuana}} component Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol that exert {{their effects on}} mesenchymal cells and immune cells via CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the role <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 in systemic sclerosis. METHODS: CB 1 -deficient (CB 1 (-/-)) mice and wild-type littermates (CB 1 (+/+) mice) were injected with bleomycin. CB 1 signaling was activated in vivo with the selective agonist N-(2 -chloroethyl) - 5 Z, 8 Z, 11 Z, 14 Z-eicosatetraenamide (ACEA). Bone marrow transplantation experiments were performed to investigate whether the phenotype <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 (-/-) mice was mediated by leukocytes or mesenchymal cells. The role <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 was also investigated in the TSK- 1 mouse model. RESULTS: CB 1 (-/-) mice were protected from bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis, with reduced dermal thickening, hydroxyproline content, and myofibroblast counts. Inactivation <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 decreased the number of infiltrating T cells and macrophages in lesional skin. In contrast, activation <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 with ACEA increased leukocyte infiltration and enhanced the fibrotic response to bleomycin. The phenotype <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 (-/-) mice was mimicked by transplantation <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 (-/-) mouse bone marrow into CB 1 (+/+) mice, demonstrating that CB 1 exerts its profibrotic effects indirectly by regulating leukocyte infiltration. Consistently, knockdown <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 did not prevent fibrosis in the inflammation-independent TSK- 1 mouse model. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that the cannabinoid receptor CB 1 is crucial for leukocyte infiltration and secondary fibroblast activation and that inactivation <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 exerts potent antifibrotic effects in inflammation-driven models of fibrosis.

In this study, we followed CB 1 R internalization using confocal microscopy and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer measurements in HeLa and Neuro- 2 a cells. We found that upon activation CB 1 R binds beta-arrestin 2 (beta-arr 2), but not beta-arrestin 1. Furthermore, both the expression of dominant-negative beta-arr 2 (beta-arr 2 -V 54 D) and siRNA-mediated knock-down of beta-arr 2 impaired the agonist-induced internalization <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 R. In contrast, neither beta-arr 2 -V 54 D nor beta-arr 2 -specific siRNA had a significant effect on the constitutive internalization <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 R.

We conclude that although clathrin is required for both constitutive and agonist-stimulated internalization <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 R, beta-arr 2 binding is only required for agonist-induced internalization of the receptor suggesting that the molecular mechanisms underlying constitutive and agonist-induced internalization <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 1 R are different...|$|R

40|$|Neurocognitive {{effects of}} cannabinoids have been {{extensively}} studied {{with a focus}} on CB 1 cannabinoid receptors because CB 1 receptors have been considered the major cannabinoid receptor in the nervous system. However, recent discoveries <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 2 cannabinoid receptors in the brain demand accurate determination of whether and how CB 2 receptors are involved in the cognitive effects <b>of</b> cannabinoids. <b>CB</b> 2 cannabinoid receptors are primarily involved in immune functions, but also implicated in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Here, we examined the effects <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor knockout in mice on memory to determine the roles <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptors in modulating cognitive function.

Methods  Using a repeated measures design, 60 staff working with children who have severe intellectual disabilities completed measures of cognition, emotion and helping behaviour in reaction to a ‘real’ incident <b>of</b> <b>CB,</b> and then completed the same measures in reaction to reading a ‘vignette’, that was matched to the ‘real’ incident <b>of</b> <b>CB.</b> There was a 2 -week interval between the completion of measures {{in response to the}} ‘real’ incident <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> and the ‘vignette’.

There were significant differences between the correlations detected using ‘real’ incidents <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> in comparison to ‘vignettes’.
