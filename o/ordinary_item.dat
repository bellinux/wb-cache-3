2500|$|Justice Fortas {{agreed with}} Chief Justice Warren's dissent, but added a brief {{additional}} {{explanation of why}} he {{thought that it would}} be constitutional to ban flag-burning. First, he argued, if the flag were nothing more than an <b>ordinary</b> <b>item</b> of property, the state could prohibit its burning merely as an exercise of its authority to protect the public safety. [...] The flag's status as a special emblem of nationality, however, entitles it to additional protections, some of which have been upheld by the Court in the past. In summary, [...] "Protest does not exonerate lawlessness"; thus, the state can prohibit the burning of any item in public, {{and the nature of the}} flag entitles it to more protection under the law, rather than less.|$|E
50|$|Officials' hats {{are also}} {{occasionally}} used as additional equipment. If a player not carrying the ball {{steps out of}} bounds (a wide receiver running a deep passing route or a player running downfield on punt coverage, for example), the official will drop his hat to mark the spot of where the player went out of bounds. The hat also {{is often used to}} signal a second foul called by the official on a play (by those officials that may carry only one flag); to indicate unsportsmanlike conduct committed against the official himself (as when a player shoves an official); or when some other situation requires a physical mark and the official has already used the <b>ordinary</b> <b>item</b> on the play. Some conferences discourage the use of the hat in these situations; the bean bag will be used instead.|$|E

Ancient alchemists sought perfection in all things and visualized a personal spiritual hierarchy that resided within all physical matter.

40|$|The {{competition}} {{for the attention of}} users is a central element of the Internet. Crucial issues are the origin and predictability of big hits, the few items that capture a big portion of the total attention. We address these issues analyzing 10 (6) time series of videos' views from YouTube. We find that the average gain of views is linearly proportional to the number of views a video already has, in agreement with usual rich-get-richer mechanisms and Gibrat's law, but this fails to explain the prevalence of big hits. The reason is that the fluctuations around the average views are themselves heavy tailed. Based on these empirical observations, we propose a stochastic differential equation with Levy noise as a model of the dynamics of videos. We show how this model is substantially better in estimating the probability of an <b>ordinary</b> <b>item</b> becoming a big hit, which is considerably underestimated in the traditional proportional-growth models...|$|E

Using behavioral and brain-imaging experiments, the present studies explored whether the previous finding was applicable imagined loss. In a behavioral experiment, a free recall paradigm was used to compare the memory performance of individuals who imagined loss with that of individuals who imagined importance. The superior memory performance conferred by imagining loss was constrained to <b>ordinary</b> <b>items</b> of low to medium importance and did not generalize to vital items. Moreover, brain imaging evidence revealed that the activation in certain brain regions was stronger when participants were imagining the loss of <b>ordinary</b> <b>items</b> of low to medium importance compared to vital items. These brain regions included cognitive effort-related areas (such as the parietal cortex and middle prefrontal cortex) and areas related to emotional experiences and emotion-related memories (such as the amygdala, parahippocampal gyms, and posterior cingulate gyms). Our study provides a new way of exploring the superior memory performance when imagining loss and enriches the literature on memory enhancement by contributing to {{a deeper understanding of the}} psychological mechanisms related to the imagining of vital losses...|$|R

50|$|Object {{manipulation}} {{is a form}} of dexterity play {{or performance}} in which one or more people physically interact with one or more objects. Many object manipulation skills are recognised circus skills. Other object manipulation skills are linked to sport, magic, and everyday objects or practices. Many object manipulation skills use special props made for that purpose: examples include the varied circus props such as balls, clubs, hoops, rings, poi, staff, and devil sticks; magic props such as cards and coins; sports equipment such as nunchaku and footballs. Any other object can also be used for manipulation skills. Object manipulation with <b>ordinary</b> <b>items</b> may be considered to be object manipulation when the object is used out of its socially acknowledged context and used differently from its original purpose.|$|R

Applying this method to different data, ranging from views in YouTube videos to posts in Usenet discussion groups, we invariantly find that the predictability increases for the most extreme events. This indicates that, despite the inherently stochastic collective dynamics of users, efficient prediction is possible for the most extreme events. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{important}} reasons {{for consumers to}} spend gift certificates differently than gifts in cash or non-gift income: a) {{they are forced to}} change their shopping pattern because of the conditions imposed by the issuer of the certificates, or b) they purposely separate gift certificates from other sources of income. The first reason implies a welfare loss, the second reason does not. We survey consumers who have just redeemed one or more gift certificates. For the gift certificate considered in our empirical application, we find that consumers are not constrained by the set of accepting merchants but that they do make some small changes in the timing of expenditures because of the certificate's no-refund policy. About 14 percent of recipients separate their gift certificates from other income sources in order to buy a product they really love to have.
