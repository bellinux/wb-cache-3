5|$|As the Great Depression hit the United States, Fairbanks bucked {{the poor}} {{economic}} trend.

In 1938, Lathrop took advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> economic situation by reviving the Alaska Miner as a weekly supplement to the News-Miner. The Miner covered happenings in the gold-mining camps outside Fairbanks and was focused on areas outside the city. In 1939, Fairbanks radio station KFAR was founded, and it shared the Lathrop building with the News-Miner, which occupied the bottom floors of the building.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{compares the}} executions of Domitian to those under Emperor Claudius (41–55), noting that Claudius {{executed}} around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and {{regarded as one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> Emperors of history. Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's loss of power, while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{competitive}} retail industry many retailers employ <b>the</b> strategy <b>of</b> bundling <b>goods</b> they merchandize with optional value-added packages to enhance <b>the</b> attraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> and increase <b>the</b> revenue. The package offerings can vary with <b>the</b> inventory level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> Offering such packages impacts upon <b>the</b> sales <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> and hence, affects inventory management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> In this {{paper we propose}} a model to analyze <b>the</b> optimal choice <b>of</b> package offerings and <b>the</b> optimal management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> inventory for a single type of goods. We define a procedure to construct superior offerings which are shown to contain the optimal package offerings for all inventory levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods.</b> After obtaining structural properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superior offerings and applying an existent result, we deduce that the optimal inventory management policy is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reorder-point, order-up-to-level, or (s, S), type and <b>the</b> optimal choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> package offerings at any given inventory level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superior offerings. We further show that, when the market is separated into independent segments, each segment can be treated independently for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> selecting <b>the</b> optimal offerings. Numerical examples show that the optimal dynamic choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> package offerings can substantially improve profitability over <b>the</b> policy <b>of</b> offering <b>the</b> same packages all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time...|$|R
50|$|In {{the former}} case after <b>the</b> {{formation}} <b>of</b> economic union, <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> considered is decreased, {{leading to an}} increase of efficiency of economic integration. Hence, trade creation's essence is in elimination of customs tariffs on inner border of unifying states (usually already trading with each other), causing further decrease <b>of</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> {{while there may be}} a case of new trade flow creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> between <b>the</b> states decided to economically integrate.|$|R
40|$|This work {{considers}} <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> with stochastic shortages from {{factories to}} stores. It {{is assumed that}} in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> shipping <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> to various stores, some proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> will be damaged (which will lead to shortage <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in transit). <b>The</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damaged <b>goods</b> is added to <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shipment. A proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total expected cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shortage <b>goods</b> {{is assumed to be}} recovered and should be deducted from <b>the</b> total cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shipment. In order to determine the minimum transportation costs for the operation, we adopt dynamic optimization principles. The optimal transportation cost and optimal control policies <b>of</b> shipping <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> from factories to stores were obtained. We find that <b>the</b> optimal costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> recovered could be determined. It was further found that <b>the</b> optimum costs <b>of</b> distributing <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> with minimum and maximum error bounds coincide only at infinity...|$|R
5|$|M-53 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that connects Detroit to The Thumb region.

In Macomb County, M-53 follows the Christopher Columbus Freeway, while {{the remainder of the}} highway is known as Van Dyke Avenue in the metro area or Van Dyke Road elsewhere.

In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior, and started discussing Catholicism with his family. He began attending church with them regularly, and met with their parish priest, who offered Cooper spiritual guidance. After several months of study, Cooper was baptized as a Roman Catholic on April 9, 1959, before a small group of family and friends at the Church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Shepherd in Beverly Hills.|$|E
