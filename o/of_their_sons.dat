5|$|In 1957, al-Jamri {{married his}} cousin's granddaughter, Zahra' Yousif Atiya al-Jamri, who was 16 at the time. In his book The Story of My Life, al-Jamri devoted a section {{to speak about}} his marriage, in which he {{described}} it as a happy one and praised his wife for her patience and loyalty. They had 10 children together: 7 sons and 3 daughters. One <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> is Mansoor Al-Jamri, editor-in-chief of Al-Wasat newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Karl Borromäus Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 – 14 July 1759), {{died as a}} small child. The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 – 5 June 1790), {{married in}} 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von Fürstenberg (sister of {{the third and fourth}} princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> survived childhood, but {{died at the age of}} 15 years. The other {{children}} of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of Fürstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the agnatic male descendants of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg.|$|E
5|$|Professorship brought Rimsky-Korsakov {{financial}} security, which {{encouraged him}} {{to settle down and}} to start a family. In December 1871 he proposed to Nadezhda Purgold, with whom he had developed a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the Purgold household. They married in July 1872, with Mussorgsky serving as best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs had seven children. One <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons,</b> Andrei, became a musicologist, married the composer Yuliya Veysberg and wrote a multi-volume study of his father's life and work.|$|E

5|$|Sledd and {{his wife}} Annie had nine {{children}}. Eight of their children graduated from Emory, seven with Phi Beta Kappa honors, a fact newsworthy enough {{to be picked up}} by the Associated Press wire service when youngest daughter Antoinette graduated from Emory the year following Sledd's death. Two <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> followed in their father's footsteps, earning doctorates and becoming university professors: James H. Sledd became a Rhodes Scholar and noted professor of English literature at the University of Chicago and the University of Texas; Marvin B. Sledd was a professor of mathematics at Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do.

5|$|The Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties saw an {{increase}} in the number of burials (both here and in the Valley of the Queens), with Ramesses II and later Ramesses III constructing a massive tomb that was used for the burial <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> (KV5 and KV3 respectively). There are some kings that are not buried within the valley or whose tomb has not been located: Thutmose II may have been buried in Dra' Abu el-Naga' (although his mummy was in the Deir el-Bahri tomb cache), Smenkhkare's burial has never been located, and Ramesses VIII seems to have been buried elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|After her {{delivery}} to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), George Washington {{was used to}} transport 250 members of the American Legion to France as guests of the French Government in 1921. The vessel was then reconditioned by USSB for transatlantic service, and chartered by the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, for whom she made one voyage to Europe in March 1921. The company {{was taken over by}} the government August 1921 and its name changed to the United States Lines. In 1930, she transported the first group of American Gold Star Mothers to France to visit the graves <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons.</b> George Washington served the Line on the transatlantic route until 1931 when she was laid up in the Patuxent River, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Greene's wife Martha died in 1883 {{at an age}} of 74. Their oldest son, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, was the {{executive}} officer on the ironclad ship USS Monitor during the Battle of Hampton Roads. Another <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons,</b> Francis V. Greene, commanded a brigade at the Battle of Manila during the Spanish–American War. A third, Charles Thurston Greene, was a lieutenant on his father's staff at Culp's Hill. Later in 1863, Charles was wounded by an artillery shell and his leg was amputated, but he remained on active service until 1870. George Sears Greene, Jr., volunteered to serve but {{was not allowed to}} do so by his father so he could survive and carry on the family name.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{had five}} {{children}} {{with his second}} wife, Irene. She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse. She and her family had hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse, but ultimately {{felt that he was}} unable to. The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found intermittent work, including bricklaying, but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided the family with clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley and returned to her family, although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, but she refused. After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for goiter. Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.|$|E

5|$|The emperor's most {{powerful}} relative was the empress dowager, widow {{to the previous}} emperor and usually the natural mother of the emperor. If the grandmother of an emperor—the grand empress dowager—was still alive during his reign, she enjoyed a superior position over the empress dowager. Emperors often sought {{the approval of the}} empress dowager for their decisions. If an emperor was only a child, he acted merely as a figurehead while the empress dowager dominated court politics. She not only had the right to issue edicts and pardons, but if the emperor died without a designated heir, she had the sole right to appoint a new emperor. Below the empress dowager were the empress and imperial concubines. Although she was the wife of the emperor, the empress's position at court was not secure and she could be removed by the emperor. However, the empress did enjoy the submission of concubines as her subordinates, who advocated the elevation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> over the empress's at their own peril.|$|E
5|$|Henry Peake (1821–1886) was occupying Westholme by 1885. Peake was a {{solicitor}} {{who served}} as clerk to the county magistrates, and was {{a partner in the}} local law firm Peake, Snow and Peake, along with his son Henry Arthur Peake. The partnership had connections with Kirk and Parry, and Peake married Eliza, a daughter of Charles Kirk the elder. After his death, Peake's sons, George Herbert and Henry Arthur, successively occupied the house in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the First World War, Henry Arthur and his wife, Alice Ann, lost three <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> in battle. In 1923, Henry Arthur died while staying at Hastings. He and his wife were planning to sell Westholme and move to Guildford before his death; she did so and died there in 1933. The businessman and Liberal politician Samuel Pattinson (1870–1942) lived at the house from at least 1924. His wife, Betsy Sharpley Pattinson, also died in 1942 and their trustees auctioned off the furniture at Westholme two years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{two types}} of {{inheritance}} during Han included the common inheritance of property from the deceased, which all social groups (except for slaves) participated in, and the inheritance of titles, which only the people of twenty ranks, nobility, and royalty could enjoy. In the first form, officials and commoners bequeathed an equal share of property to each <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> in their will. This excluded daughters, who married into other families and thus did not carry on the family name. However, daughters did receive {{a portion of the}} family property in the form of their marriage dowries, which were sometimes equal to a brother's share of wealth in the will. The second type of inheritance involved the practice of primogeniture, where the official title was inherited by only one son. This was as true of the emperor as it was for any king, marquess, or commoner of the twenty ranks. However, to limit the power of the kings while still upholding primogeniture, an imperial edict of 127 BCE stated that kings had to divide the territories of their kingdoms between the chosen successor (i.e. heir apparent) and the kings' brothers, who were made marquesses, thus establishing new marquessates and effectively reducing the size of every kingdom with each generation.|$|E

5|$|The typical Han-era Chinese {{household}} {{contained a}} nuclear family {{with an average}} of four to five members, unlike in later dynasties when multiple generations and extended family members commonly lived in the same household. Families were patrilineal, which made the father the supreme head of the house. Arranged marriages were the norm, while a new wife was expected to join the clan of her husband. Having sons over daughters was considered extremely important for the sake of carrying on ancestor worship. Although girls and women were expected by custom and Confucian tradition to behave passively towards their male relatives, mothers were given a familial status above that <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sons.</b> Women also engaged in various professions in and outside of the home and were given protection under the law. The empress was superior in status to the male relatives of her consort clan, while the mother of the emperor—the empress dowager—had the authority to override his decisions and choose his successor (if one had not been appointed before his death).|$|E
