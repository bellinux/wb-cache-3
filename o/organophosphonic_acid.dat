40|$|International audienceHybrid {{materials}} that are composed of a polymeric material interfaced with an inorganic, metal oxide material have been a rapidly expanding research area {{in the last few}} decades. However, interfacial regions remain an important area of focus, and as such hybrid materials do not always possess a very robust or stable interface. Tailor-made interfacial molecules have been successfully reported but material scientists wishing to develop composite interfacial materials would favorably use commercial solutions. Our study shows how we can leverage a commercially available <b>organophosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> group that is coupled with a 2 -bromo isobutyrate initiator for surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) for use as a strong interfacial molecule. We illustrate this mechanism with both nanoparticles of titania and flat titania substrates used as the grafting support and polymerization anchoring points. We demonstrate that the size of the <b>organophosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> initiator, specifically the carbon spacer between the reactive groups, controls the stability of the molecule. The actual covalent linkage between the phosphonic acid group and the titania surface while also leaving the ATRP initiating group able to start the polymerization, is confirmed via P- 31 solid state NMR spectroscopy, liquid H- 1 NMR spectroscopy XPS, DLS and SEM...|$|E

Semiconductors such as Si modified with surface-bound capture molecules have enormous potential for use in biosensors for which an ideal detection platform should be inexpensive, recognize targets rapidly with high sensitivity and specificity, and possess superior stability. In this process, a self-assembled film of an <b>organophosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> is bonded to the native or synthesized oxide-coated Si surface as a film of the correspondingphosphonate. The phosphonate film is functionalized to enable covalently coupling biological molecules, ranging in size from small peptides to large multi-subunit proteins, to the Si surface. Surface modification and biomolecule coupling procedures are easily accomplished: all reactions can proceed in air, and most take place under ambient conditions. The biomolecule-modified surfaces are stable under physiological conditions, are selective for adhesion of specific cells types, and are reusable...|$|E
40|$|Capillary zone electrophoresis-ionspray mass {{spectrometry}} (CZE-IS-MS) in the negative-ion mode was {{applied in the}} identification of five <b>organophosphonic</b> <b>acids,</b> which are the primary hydrolysis products of nerve agents. The spectra exhibit a very abundant (M - H) - ion with minimal fragmentation. Fragment ions were produced by raising the nozzle - skimmer voltage difference in the first vacuum stage between the atmospheric pressure ion source and the mass analyzer. CZE-IS-MS provides extremely good separation efficiency and very high sensitivity for the phosphonic acids. Sensitivity in the range 10 - 30 pg was achieved with standard solutions using selected ion monitoring. Linear regression analysis data showed correlation coefficients to be between 0. 994 and 0. 999, indicating good quantitative linearity of the method...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of <b>organophosphonic</b> <b>acids</b> on {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) surfaces from different solvents (triethylamine, ethyl ether, tetrahydofuran (THF), pyridine, acetone, methanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or water) has been performed with some significant differences observed. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and contact angle measurement demonstrated {{that the quality of}} SAMs depends critically on the choice of solvents. Higher density, more stable monolayers were formed from solvents with low dielectric constants and weak interactions with the ITO. It was concluded low dielectric solvents that were inert to the ITO gave monolayers that were more stable with a higher density of surface bound molecules because higher dielectric constant solvents and solvents that coordinate with the surface disrupted SAM formation. 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Formation {{of dense}} monolayers with proven {{atmospheric}} stability using simple fabrication conditions remains {{a major challenge}} for potential applications such as (bio) sensors, solar cells, surfaces for growth of biological cells, and molecular, organic, and plastic electronics. Here, we demonstrate a single-step modification of <b>organophosphonic</b> <b>acids</b> (OPA) on 1 D and 2 D structures using supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO 2) as a processing medium, with high stability and significantly shorter processing times than those obtained by the conventional physisorption-chemisorption method (2. 5 h vs 48 - 60 h). The advantages of this approach in terms of stability and atmospheric resistivity are demonstrated on various 2 D materials, such as indium-tin-oxide (ITO) and 2 D Si surfaces. The advantage of the reported approach on electronic and sensing devices is demonstrated by Si nanowire field effect transistors (SiNW FETs), which have shown a few orders of magnitude higher electrical and sensing performances, compared with devices obtained by conventional approaches. The compatibility of the reported approach with various materials and its simple implementation with a single reactor makes it easily scalable for various applications...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the actual}} {{orthopaedic}} devices, widely made of titanium and its alloys, present different weaknesses like ions release and risks of loosening over a long period. To solve such problems, new developments in surface modification are crucial. This work {{is an extension of}} our recent effort on the development and improvement of a multifunctional inorganic/organic bilayers coating. A thin tantalum oxide layer is formed by sol-gel synthesis followed by the modification with organophosphonic acids of the tantalum oxide layer. We focus in particular on the effect of the bilayers coating on corrosion resistance and hydroxyapatite growth rate by immersion in a simulated body fluid solution.

The key steps in the proposed catalytic cycle involve the monodealkylation of phosphonate diester and in situ generation of a R 1 SnI or R 1 2 SnI 2 intermediate via the oxidative addition of alkyl iodide on tin. Evidence in support of the formation of organotin species comes from the isolation of Me 2 Sn{O(P) (O) (OiPr) Me} 2 (6) from the direct reaction of tin metal with MeP(O) (OiPr) 2 in the presence of methyl iodide. The method has also been extended to isolate Zn{OP(O) (OMe) Me} 2 (7) using metallic zinc as the precursor.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a new {{mechanism for the}} incorporation of <b>organophosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> into silane self-assembly monolayers, which {{has been used to}} protect AA 1100 aluminum alloy. The protection improvement has been attributed to the fact that phosphonic structures promote the formation of strongly bonded and densely packed monolayer films, which show higher surface coverage and better adhesion than conventional silane systems. In order to evaluate the linking chemistry offered by phosphonic groups, two functionalized organophosphonic groups have been employed, 1, 2 -diaminoethanetetrakis methylenephosphonic acid (EDTPO) and aminotrimethylenephosphonic acid (ATMP), and combined with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) films prepared by sol–gel synthesis. Results suggest that phosphonic acids may interact with the surface through a monodentate and bidentate coordination mode and, in addition, form one or more strong and stable linkages with silicon through non-hydrolysable bonds. Therefore, the incorporation of a very low concentration of phosphonic acids on TEOS solutions favors the complete coverage of the aluminum substrate during the silanization process, which is not possible using TEOS alone. The linking capacity of phosphonic acid has been investigated by FTIR-RA spectroscopy, SEM and EDX analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and quantum mechanical calculations. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been used to study the corrosion protection revealing that EDTPO-containing films afforded more protection to the AA 1100 substrate than ATMP-containing filmsPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

As a first step to design a new inorganic-organic hybrid proton conductor, a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the MLaNb 2 O 7 (M=H, Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) series of ion-exchangeable layered perovskite is presented. In particular, their structural and electronic properties have been investigated by periodic calculations in the framework of DFT. A general very good agreement with the available experimental data has been found. The protonated compound (HLaNb 2 O 7) has been then functionalized with imidazole trying two different settings: in the first arrangement the molecule is adsorbed on the layered oxide exposing the interlayer surface, in the second the organic moiety is just put between two perovskites slabs. This latter model, including the effect of the confinement, allowed to better reproduce the experimental structural XRD data and 13 C-NMR measurements of the hybrid system. [1] Schaak, R.

Self Assembled Monolayers (SAMs) of <b>organophosphonic</b> Octadecylphosphonic <b>acid</b> (ODPA) were formed on the oxide surface of Co-Cr alloy by chemisorption using the solution deposition technique. High quality and well ordered SAMs were formed which were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy – Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Contact Angle Measurements and Ellipsometry. The resulting monolayers were then exposed to in vitro conditions using Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution. The samples were analyzed {{for a period of}} 1, 3, 7 and 14 days. The resulting samples were characterized using XPS, AFM and Contact angle measurements. XPS atomic concentrations and detailed high energy elemental scans gave an insight into the trends of elemental concentrations over the duration of the study. SAMs were found to be strongly bound to the oxide surface after PBS exposure. AFM gave the topographic details of SAMs presence by island formation before and after SAM formation and also over the duration of the PBS exposure. Contact Angle Measurements confirmed the hydrophobicity of the surface after SAM formation and indicated a slight disorder of the SAM alkyl chain upon exposure to PBS. Thus, ODPA SAMs were successfully coated on Cobalt Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy surface and were found to be stable and strongly bound after PBS exposure...|$|R
