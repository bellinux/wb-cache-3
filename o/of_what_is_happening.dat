5|$|After {{watching}} a news {{report on the}} cause of the explosion, Alex realizes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the plane. He deduces that Ms. Lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety. Thinking Alex is up to no good, Ms. Lewton calls the FBI agents, who take him in for questioning. Although Alex is unable to convince the agents <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> they decide to let him go. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled and killed by a falling kitchen knife.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem with}} this kind of {{argument}} is just that, in defining the meaning <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> in society, {{it is very difficult to}} provide definite scientific proof that this meaning is the objective truth. It remains an interpretation, which may make sense of things at a certain level, without providing the whole truth. Engels's comment illustrates that the concept of character masks is not infrequently used in a polemical way to describe a false or inauthentic representation.|$|E

25|$|In the New Testament {{all four}} gospels {{conclude}} with an extended narrative of Jesus's arrest, trial, crucifixion, burial, and his resurrection. In each gospel these five {{events in the}} life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> The death and resurrection of Jesus are treated as the climax of the story, the point to which everything else has been moving all the while.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} detailed {{accounts of}} the death of Jesus are contained in the four canonical gospels. There are other, more implicit references in the New Testament epistles.

25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E

25|$|No volcanoes in the Canadian Cascade Arc are {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. The Canadian National Seismograph Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide a good indication <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> under them. It may sense an increase in seismic activity they become very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only once a volcano has started erupting. If they were to erupt, relief efforts would probably be orchestrated. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that will have effects in Canada.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} quality {{which supports}} right action is Heedfulness (Appamada), {{a combination of}} energy/effort (Viriya) and Mindfulness. Mindfulness is an alert presence of mind which allows one to be more aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> with one's intentional states. Heedfulness is aided by 'clear comprehension' or 'discrimination' (Sampajañña), which gives rise to moral knowledge of {{what is to be}} done. Another important supporting quality of Buddhist morality is Trust or Confidence in the teachings of the Buddha and in one's own ability to put them into practice. Wisdom and Understanding are seen as a prerequisite for acting morally. Having an understanding of the true nature of reality is seen as leading to ethical actions. Understanding the truth of not-self for example, allows one to become detached from selfish motivations and therefore allows one to be more altruistic. Having an understanding of the workings of the mind and of the law of karma also makes one less likely to perform an unethical action.|$|E
25|$|Currently, no volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma chambers are.

The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan, Canada's volcanic emergency notification program, was established to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to a volcanic eruption in Canada, an eruption close to Canada's borders, or an eruption significant enough to have an effect on Canada and its people. It focuses primarily on aviation safety because jet aircraft can quickly enter areas of volcanic ash. The program notifies all impacted agencies that have to deal with volcanic events. Aircraft are rerouted away from hazardous ash and people on the ground are notified of potential ash fall.|$|E

500|$|Operations {{on a set}} {{of network}} {{equations}} have a topological meaning which can aid visualisation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> [...] Elimination of a node voltage from a set of network equations corresponds topologically to the elimination of that node from the graph.

A conversation is an exchange; and these poems, a dozen or fewer, stretching from 'The Eolian Harp' [...] to 'To William Wordsworth] [...] and perhaps further, are plainly monologues. Those who met Coleridge in his later life, it is true, were inclined to find his conversation arrestingly one-sided, but this will hardly serve as an explanation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> here." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{opposition}} leader, Treatt proved {{effective in}} attacking {{the shortcomings of}} the McGirr's Labor Government and in the Labor Party on a national level, particularly in areas of economics: [...] "Because of the inflationary pressure, which is largely {{a result of the}} Socialists' own low production policy, continuation of subsidies is necessary on basic everyday goods..." [...] and utilities: [...] "The public is sick of seeing Ministers hunting up alibis, shifting about from one explanation to another and washing their hands of responsibility for powershortages on some flimsy pretext." [...] In matters of ideology, Treatt supported Federal Liberal Leader Robert Menzies in his virulent opposition to communism, particularly from the Soviet Union, China and Korea. After returning from the Empire Parliamentary Conference in London in December 1948, Treatt declared [...] "The Communists are on the move throughout the world. Australians must sit up and take just as much notice <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> across our narrow northern waters...It is of outstanding importance to Australia that the Western Powers' should secure some uniform policy to combat the Communist Asian menace." ...|$|E

He presses the Sergeant further, in the second verse – why are people breathing so hard? why are some men collapsing? These signs of the effect that watching the hanging has upon {{the men of the}} regiment are explained away by the Sergeant as being due to the cold weather or the bright sun. The voice is reassuring, keeping the young soldier calm in the sight of death, just as the Sergeant will calm him with his voice in combat. In the third verse, Files thinks of Deever, saying that he slept alongside him, and drank with him, but the Sergeant reminds him that Deever is now alone, that he sleeps [...] "out an' far to-night", and reminds the soldier of the magnitude of Deever's crime – ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile in Polis, Cyprus, Ruth {{is living}} {{at peace with}} husband George (Daniel Rabib) and stepson Nico (Luke Tzortzis).

Soon, while being transferred to a safe house, Ruth is captured and brought to Harry, while George and Nico are taken to the safe house unaware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> To save them, Ruth reveals the uranium is at a base in Norfolk, however Mani reveals he searched the base and it is no longer there, and hence orders George's execution.|$|E
500|$|The clip portrays {{sexual assaults}} mostly against women, {{and how they}} cope after the incident. The {{black-and-white}} video opens with a warning message: [...] "The following contains graphic content that may be emotionally unsettling but reflects the reality <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> daily on college campuses." [...] It then shows a girl walking through an empty corridor, followed by young people in various activities in a college campus: reading (portrayed by actress Nikki Reed), a trans man adjusting his chest binder in the bathroom, attending a party (one of the partygoers being portrayed by actress Kiersey Clemons). However they are all sexually assaulted, {{with one of the}} scenes showing a couple of young girls being drugged and raped at the party. The heartbroken girls and the trans man cry, while alternate images show them expressing their emotions by inscribing words on themselves. Ultimately they find solace and hope in friendship, and leave the college with their friends, as the words inscribed on their bodies change to positive messages. Near its ending, the music video displays the message: [...] "One in five college women will be sexually assaulted this year unless something changes", following which the message points the audience to the Facebook page for The Hunting Ground and Itsonus.org, the White House support website for people who have endured a sexual crime. A portion of the earnings from the song's digital sales will be donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault.|$|E
