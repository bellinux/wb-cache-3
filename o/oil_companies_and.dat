The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{was born}} in Jacksonville, Florida on July 9, 1911 to librarians Joseph Lewis Wheeler and Mabel Archibald (Archie) Wheeler. He was the oldest of four children, having two younger brothers, Joseph and Robert, and a younger sister, Mary. Joseph earned a Ph.D. from Brown University and a Master of Library Science from Columbia University. Robert earned a Ph.D. in geology from Harvard University {{and worked as a}} {{geologist}} for <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> at colleges. Mary studied library science at the University of Denver and became a librarian. They grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, but spent a year in 1921 to 1922 on a farm in Benson, Vermont, where Wheeler attended a one-room school. After they returned to Youngstown he attended Rayen High School.|$|E

25|$|Paul {{voted on}} {{multiple}} occasions in 2007—2012 to block measures {{that would have}} eliminated or reduced tax breaks {{for oil and gas}} producers. For example, in January 2007, he voted against the Energy Independence and Security Act, which supporters said would have rescinded $14 billion in tax breaks for oil and gas drillers. In February 2008, he voted against the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act, which supporters said would have eliminated $18 billion in tax benefits for <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> substituted tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. In May 2008, he voted against the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, which supporters said contained provisions to cut tax breaks for <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> to expand tax breaks for alternative energies like solar and geothermal power, biodiesel fuels, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In July 2010, he voted against the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2009, which would have removed federal caps on oil companies' liability for oil spills, and would have cut certain tax breaks for oil companies. In February 2011, he voted against a measure to reinstate royalties assessed for oil drilled when oil prices are high. In March, April, and May 2011, he voted against measures that would have allowed consideration of legislation to eliminate tax breaks for <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> promote production and use of alternative energy sources.|$|E

In 1976, BP and Shell de-merged their marketing operations in the United Kingdom by dividing Shell-Mex and BP. In 1978 the company acquired a controlling interest in Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio).|$|E

BP agreed to financial compensation for the damage they caused, including payouts to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust. Regulations drafted after the accident required oil companies to update their safety equipment, including blowout preventers. This measure was criticized as too costly to integrate and thus harmful to industry and job growth, so it has been weakly enforced.|$|E

25|$|Unrest in Transcaucasia, {{which also}} {{included}} major strikes, reached a climax with the widespread uprisings throughout the Russian Empire {{known as the}} 1905 Revolution. 1905 saw a wave of mutinies, strikes and peasant uprisings across imperial Russia and events in Transcaucasia were particularly violent. In Baku, {{the centre of the}} Russian oil industry, class tensions mixed with ethnic rivalries. The city was almost wholly composed of Azeris and Armenians, but the Armenian middle-class tended to have a greater share in the ownership of the <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> Armenian workers generally had better salaries and working conditions than the Azeris. In December 1904, after a major strike was declared in Baku, the two communities began fighting each other on the streets and the violence spread to the countryside.|$|E
25|$|As president, one of Obregón's top {{priorities}} was securing US diplomatic {{recognition of his}} regime, to resume normal Mexico–United States relations. Although he rejected the U.S. demand that Mexico rescind Article 27 of the constitution, Obregón negotiated a major agreement with the United States, the Bucareli Treaty of August 1923 that made some concessions to the US {{in order to gain}} diplomatic recognition. It was particularly helpful when the Mexican Supreme Court, in a case brought by Texas Oil, declared that Article 27 did not apply retroactively. Another important arena in which Obregón resolved issues with the U.S. and other foreign governments was the Mexican-United States General Claims Commission. Finance Minister Adolfo de la Huerta signed a deal in which Mexico recognized a debt of $1.451million to international bankers. Finally, at the Bucareli Conference, Obregón agreed to an American demand that Mexico would not expropriate any foreign <b>oil</b> <b>companies,</b> <b>and</b> in exchange, the U.S. recognized his government. Many Mexicans criticized Obregón as a sellout (entreguista), including Adolfo de la Huerta for his actions at the Bucareli Conference.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the same}} tone as the French debate, {{much of the}} {{discussion}} revolved around {{the economy and the}} environment. The other four leaders keep criticizing Harper, especially for his lack of an economic platform despite asking for the format change to focus more on the economy in light of the ongoing financial crisis, and instead using the time to criticize the economic platforms of the other leaders. May lashed out at Harper for not understanding that Canadians were worried about their homes, jobs and finances, and comparing the current situation to Dutch disease, Dion stated that the only thing that keeps Canada from being hit as hard by the crisis as the US are laws created by the previous Liberal government that the Conservatives had been attempting to overturn, Duceppe repeatedly criticized Harper for financial practices and attitudes similar to the Bush administration, and Layton at one point stated that Harper's position showed he was either incompetent or uncaring to the situation, and asked which one he was, to which Harper did not respond. Harper also came under criticism for his laissez-faire attitude to the job sector, supporting primarily the <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> companies that outsource jobs in the manufacturing sector.|$|E

500|$|Until mid-1888, Foraker had the {{enthusiastic}} support of Hanna, who, while still boosting John Sherman for president, was a generous {{contributor to the}} governor's 1885 and 1887 campaigns. [...] Hanna hoped {{to be able to}} dispense patronage in northern Ohio. [...] According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, however, [...] "unfortunately for Hanna, Foraker largely refused to grant Hanna the authority that by tradition he probably had earned." [...] One example, later cited by Foraker as a reason his close relationship with Hanna ended, was the question of the position of state oil inspector, whose substantial fees were paid, not by the taxpayer, but by the <b>oil</b> <b>companies,</b> <b>and</b> who was permitted to appoint large numbers of deputies. [...] In 1885, soon after Foraker's inauguration, Hanna advocated the appointment of William M. Bayne, while Congressman McKinley pressed the name of Edwin Hartshorn. [...] Hanna agreed to withdraw Bayne, not to accommodate McKinley, but to save Foraker from a difficulty. [...] Hanna wrote to Foraker, [...] "I had a call from Major McKinley and his oil inspector candidate. ... I tell him he 'wants the earth'..." [...] However, Foraker instead reappointed the incumbent, Louis Smithnight. [...] One of the men appointed deputy oil inspector was Harry Smith, the black editor who had supported Foraker in the 1885 election. [...] McKinley again approached Foraker after his re-election in 1887 seeking Hartshorn's appointment; however, Foraker appointed George B. Cox, Republican boss of Cincinnati, as chief though Smithnight was retained as a deputy. [...] In later years, Foraker suggested the dispute over the oil inspectorship was a reason for Hanna breaking from him and allying with McKinley, stating after Hanna's death in 1904, [...] "I have often thought since that my appointment of Cox made McKinley president." ...|$|E
