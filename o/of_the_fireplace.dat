5|$|The {{main house}} {{protected}} John McQueen's family and neighbors during attacks from invading Creeks in 1802; {{he wrote that}} at one time 26 people took refuge there. Following raids from Americans during the Patriot Rebellion in 1813, the house was gutted and vandalized. Plantations as far south as New Smyrna were destroyed by rebels fleeing into Georgia. When Kingsley arrived, there were no metal fixtures in the doors and the wooden slave quarters had been burned down. John Rollins added sections to the east and west sides of the house in between the pavilions in the 1890s and removed at least three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> chimneys from the pavilions. One of the clubs that owned the island in the 1920s added electricity.|$|E
25|$|While {{tending to}} the fire, George and Kathy saw {{the image of a}} demon with half his head blown out. It was burned into the soot in the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b>|$|E
25|$|The little parlor was {{private and}} {{decorated}} plainly. The walls were painted a neutral grey. Above the fireplace was a split pediment overmantel (a rectangle, and a partial triangle above that). During Mason's lifetime, the rectangle contained either a painting or a mirror. On either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> are deep-shelved beaufats (niches) to store and display the tableware, with doors to secure valuable possessions.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} old buildings, the {{ceilings}} are quite low. An original bread-oven {{is next to}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces.</b> It has a large beer garden with different seating arrangements, as well as seats out the front.|$|R
40|$|Following a long article <b>of</b> 1982 on <b>the</b> {{typology}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces,</b> <b>the</b> author, here, in {{a volume}} dedicated to <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> Prof. Giuseppe Tucci, entitled Orientalia Iosephi Tucci Memoriae Dicata, {{is dealing with}} the topic which ultimately was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> that previous article: <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire altar. Starting from <b>the</b> mud types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stepped <b>fireplaces</b> in Dahan-i Ghulaman, in a private context, crossing the big one uncovered a Tepe Nush-i Jan in a Median context, the author led one to hypothesize <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a fire altar as a <b>the</b> monumentalization <b>of</b> a <b>fireplace</b> with <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> a ancient ritual element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Near East, the steps...|$|R
50|$|Apex Union Depot is {{an example}} of Late Victorian {{architecture}} and features a double fireplace, ticket windows, and the original switchmen’s lanterns. The brick building was originally designed to segregate white and black riders. White people used a waiting room located on <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depot. Women who were traveling alone used a room located behind one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces.</b>|$|R
25|$|Thérèse {{was sitting}} in a low chair, to the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Chin in hand, she was staring fixedly at the dancing flames, and did not turn her head when Laurent entered the room. Wearing a lace-edged {{petticoat}} and bed-jacket, she looked particularly pale in the bright firelight. Her jacket had slipped from one shoulder which showed pink through the locks of her black hair.|$|E
25|$|A similar central hallway {{divides the}} basement. On its north, the large space {{functions}} as a kitchen. Its fireplace has a brick firebox with a full-width hewn timber nailer across the top. Above it is the cradle for the hearth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> above. Its ceiling beams, too, retain their original dimensions. In the south room, used for handling the house's modern heating and electrical systems, there is another fireplace with an original brick bake oven next to it.|$|E
25|$|In 1500, Scotstarvit Tower {{was built}} a mile {{southwest}} from Hill of Tarvit. This was {{constructed by the}} Inglis family of Tarvit as the centre of their estate. The tower was then sold in 1611 to Sir John Scott of Scotstarvit. Sir John rebuilt much of the tower in the 1620s – seen by the date 1627 {{on a piece of}} the Tower's chimneypiece that now forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> in the Hill of Tarvit's smoking room.|$|E
50|$|He {{was able}} to operate it successfully, and maps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area from the 1850s {{identify}} it as his tavern. The late Greek Revival molding on some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior architraves suggests some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subdivisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior rooms in the main block occurred under his ownership. Doors were grained as well, and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> may have had stoves added at that time.|$|R
500|$|An {{alteration}} saw <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> two chimneys {{and additional}} alterations {{to the window}} and door openings on the northeast and southwest sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. It is believed that the central door and window alterations were done as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek Revival renovations. Luyster states, [...] "urther investigation would undoubtedly reveal additional changes in the interior, including changes in <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> and their chimney connections." ...|$|R

25|$|What is {{consistent}} {{in the stories}} of Lowe are accounts of his insatiable appetite for learning. He could not read enough material, and he had questions beyond the answering of his father or teachers. Lowe was also limited {{in the amount of}} time he had for school. His farm chores only allowed him the three winter months to attend Common School at Jefferson Mills, two miles away. The school had no books, but like Abraham Lincoln Thad would spend his evenings in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> reading books loaned from his teacher’s personal library.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} room (called {{the dining}} room or the palladian room), was public, and was the most elaborately decorated in the house. The classical woodwork shows touches of the fashionable rococo design. The fireplace wall has an ornate chimney breast. On either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> are beaufats, these ones with shallower shelves than in the little parlour, and no doors. Classical broken pediments top the chimney breast and the beaufats. The floor was made of carefully matched blind-doweled planks, an expensive feature. Egg-and-dart carved patterns surround the black-walnut entry doors. During Mason's lifetime, painted or decorated paper covered the thin pine paneling on the walls. The two windows look out onto Mason's garden.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the stenciling, de Forest's touch {{can be seen in}} the incorporation of other Eastern designs and Tiffany glass. De Forest used carved teakwood, like that produced by the Ahmedabad Woodcarving Company, in the molding along the outer edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> in Mamie Gwinn's study, as well as some picture frames in the corridor between her and Thomas's study (the Blue Room). In the third expansion of the house in 1908, de Forest decorated the ceiling of the Dorothy Vernon Room with thin sheets of patterned brass in a variety of East Indian designs. Several of the rooms also included Tiffany glass lamps or fixtures that were designed by de Forest and created in the Tiffany Studios.|$|E
50|$|Gibside's {{main house}} is not <b>the</b> focal point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate: the long walk runs from <b>the</b> Column <b>of</b> Liberty to <b>the</b> chapel and the mansion is located to one side. The house became vacant in the 1920s after the Bowes-Lyon family sold some of its {{properties}} to pay death duties. The building was stripped of its fixtures and fittings, with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> and other items being transferred to Glamis Castle. Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure were demolished in 1958, including <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof, the remains are protected by Grade II listed building status.|$|R
2500|$|When Aldrington {{was absorbed}} into <b>the</b> Borough <b>of</b> Hove in 1894, more school {{accommodation}} was needed. [...] Clayton & Black were commissioned {{to execute the}} School Board's [...] "grandiose plans" [...] for three blocks accommodating about 1,200 children and associated facilities. [...] Limited finances meant the plans had to be redesigned, and the firm provided for a single block for 580 children. [...] An extension was needed by 1904, however, and Clayton & Black were commissioned again. [...] They had to work to a modest budget, and problems with <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> caused Charles Clayton to return in 1907 and carry out more work. [...] The red-brick buildings are still in use under the name West Hove Junior School.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner ward {{were more}} {{substantial}} than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer ward, [...] high and [...] thick, with huge towers and two large gatehouses, enclosing a [...] area. The inner ward {{was intended to}} hold the accommodation and other domestic buildings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle, with ranges of buildings stretching along the west and east sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ward; some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> for these buildings can still {{be seen in the}} stonework. It is uncertain if these ranges were actually ever built or if they were constructed but later demolished after the Civil War. If finished, the castle {{would have been able to}} host two substantial households and their followers, for example the king and queen, or the king, queen and a prince and his own wife.|$|R
25|$|The western room (called {{the parlor}} or the dining room) was a public, ornately {{decorated}} room. The walls are painted a yellow ocher, and the woodwork is Chinese-style. The wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> has a mantel decorated with fretwork, pagoda-like scalloped moldings, {{as well as}} canopies topped by pine cone finials. Above the doors are similar canopies, which might have displayed Chinese porcelain vases or ceramic figures. The two long windows are topped by scalloped pediments, decorated with fretwork. During Mason's lifetime, three of the walls were probably wallpapered. During the 18th century, chinoese (Chinese-style) design was popular in Great Britain, however the Gunston Hall museum does not know of any other rooms in colonial America {{with this type of}} coordinated chinoiserie woodwork.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{there were}} only open living areas {{at the back of}} the {{farmhouse}} on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Here there were tables, chairs and wall beds and, of course, open contact with the animals. Not until after the Thirty Years War when the demand for living comfort grew, were separate rooms built {{at the back of the}} farmhouse, each the length of a bay (ca. 2.5 m) i.e. the space between the interior posts. This living space was called a Kammerfach from Kammer (room or chamber) and Fach (bay). One subsequent change was the addition of a cellar under the Kammerfach, but it was not very deep. The separate living quarters were raised above the level of the main hall as if on a plinth and in the larger four-post farmhouses (Vierständerhäuser) sometimes formed a sort of gallery.|$|E
25|$|The Copeland House is {{an example}} of Wright's {{remodeling}} design work. It is listed as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District. The historic district joined the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The William Copeland House is one of three homes in Oak Park that Wright was commissioned to remodel. The other two are the 1906 Peter A. Beachy House and the Hills-DeCaro House, also on Forest Avenue. Wright also added a large brick fireplace to the library. However, as was so often the, (as evidenced by the sagging cantilevers at Falling Water and the sagging second floor of the Heurtley House) Wright's use of available materials exceeded their structural capacity. The mantle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> is a large stone that cracked {{under the weight of the}} bricks, as did steps in the front stairway. The center wall of the coach house also sank due to inadequacy of the center foundation.|$|E
25|$|The {{small size}} is deceiving as the Parker House is spacious. The turret bays have walls {{that are more}} than half {{consisted}} <b>of</b> windows. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> is set in <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house which allows it to heat and service two rooms, the parlor and the dining room. <b>The</b> side elevations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parker House are symmetrical but adjacent buildings are built too close for the design to be seen clearly.|$|R
50|$|In 1910, Mary married {{sculptor}} and polo player Charles Cary Rumsey (1879-1922), {{shortly after}} <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> her father on September 9, 1909. Rumsey {{had been working}} at Arden House, creating one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principal <b>fireplace</b> surrounds, {{as well as other}} decorative sculpture. Together they had a daughter and two sons.|$|R

25|$|The {{cabinets}} of the Netherlands and Belgium {{are excellent}} models of design. These {{pieces of furniture}} were usually arranged in two storeys with a fine moulded and carved cornice, mid division and plinth. The pilasters at the sides, and small raised panels carved only on the projecting part, would compose a very harmonious whole. A proportion of the French cabinets are decorated with caryatids not carved in the best taste, and, like other French woodwork of this period, are sometimes overloaded with sculpture. The doors of St Maclou, Rouen, fine as they are, would hardly to-day be held up as models for imitation. A noteworthy set of doors belong to the Oudenaarde Town Hall. The central door contains twelve and that on either side eight panels, {{each of which is}} carved with Renaissance foliage surrounding an unobtrusive figure. In the Palais de Justice we see that great scheme of decoration which takes up the whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> end of the hall. Five large figures carved in the round are surrounded by small ones and with foliage and coats of arms.|$|E
25|$|Floo powder can be {{used with}} any {{fireplace}} connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder into the flames, turning them emerald green, then steps into the fireplace and states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> and stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the Prisoner of Azkaban by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.|$|E
500|$|Much of the hôtel d'Alluye's {{original}} {{interior decoration}} remains. A notable {{exception is the}} fireplace in the largest room of the south wing, which was repainted and redecorated by Martin Monestier during the nineteenth century. On the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> two maxims (maxima propositio) are engraved in ancient Greek. The first reads, [...] "Remember the common fate" [...] ("ΜΕΜΝΗΣΟ ΤΗΣ ΚΟΙΝΗΣ ΤΥΧΗΣ") and the second [...] "Above all, respect the divine" [...] ("ΠΡΟ ΠΑΝΤΩΝ ΣΕΒΟΥ ΤΟ ΘΕΙΟΝ").|$|E
2500|$|The new {{interiors}} were in {{a different}} style and at a larger scale. Furness was exploring the Art Nouveau, and used a calla lily motif [...] sometimes literally, sometimes abstractly [...] for the mantel brackets in <b>the</b> drawingroom, <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> mosaics in <b>the</b> master bedroom and library, <b>the</b> stone carvings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study <b>fireplace,</b> and a glorious leaded glass window, also in the study. The circa-1888 alterations probably included the front bedroom's buff-colored, terra-cotta <b>fireplace</b> and mantel, <b>the</b> detailing <b>of</b> which {{is closely related to}} <b>the</b> reading room <b>of</b> Furness's contemporaneous University of Pennsylvania Library (1888–91).|$|R
50|$|A room on {{the east}} side was wainscoted and {{panelled}} in a plain style; a long window extended <b>the</b> whole length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apartment, and a thick beam crossed the ceiling, supported at each end by rude pieces <b>of</b> timber. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> was highly enriched by caryatid figures, and carved work of oak-foliage in low relief ornamented the stone mantle. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> in <b>the</b> apartment immediately under this on the basement floor was ornamented. The upper rooms were lofty and airy, the space usually divided off into lofts being open to the roof—showing the heavy beams and girders in all their rude simplicity, the windows small and near the roof, the doorways narrow and low, and formed roughly of unplaited boards—opening by a wooden latch and spring.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the new {{communist}} government seized the assets and property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal family. Beli dvor was periodically used by presidents Josip Broz Tito {{and later by}} Slobodan Milošević for official state functions and foreign visits. Milošević received U.S. envoy Richard Holbrook at the palace before <b>the</b> NATO bombing <b>of</b> Yugoslavia began; Milošević later officially resigned his presidency in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace <b>fireplace.</b>|$|R
500|$|The winning couple are escorted {{away in a}} grand {{ceremony}} with [...] "trompets, tabourets, {{and other}} manoir of mynstralcie". [...] Although this is a valuable prize, {{it does not seem}} to have been claimed very often. [...] Horace Walpole, who visited Whichnoure in 1760, reported that the flitch had not been claimed for thirty years and that a real flitch of bacon was no longer kept ready at the manor. [...] A replacement, carved in wood, was now displayed over the mantle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> in the main hall, presumably in order to continue to meet the conditions of the original land grant.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the [...] "Black Burghardts" [...] {{had settled in}} the Egremont Plain area a few miles outside the center of Great Barrington. [...] Du Bois' birthplace was torn down around 1900). When {{abandoned}} by Du Bois' father, his mother moved with her infant son {{to the house of}} her parents, Othello Burghardt and his wife. [...] In his 1928 article, [...] "The House of the Black Burghardts", Du Bois described the house as [...] "a delectable place [...] simple, square and low, with the great room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> the flagged kitchen, half a step below, and the lower woodshed beyond. [...] Steep strong stairs led to Sleep, while without was a brook, a well and a mighty elm." ...|$|E
500|$|Kappa Delta Epsilon ("KDE") {{is a local}} {{sorority}} {{founded in}} the fall of 1993 by the Panhellenic Council at Dartmouth.

5|$|The {{building}} {{has been changed}} and expanded over the centuries. It now consists of a main 3 storey block with two wings. The interior includes fine wooden panelling and plaster ceilings. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>fireplaces</b> survive and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rooms include decorative stained glass. It is surrounded by landscaped grounds including a sunken garden and a knot garden. There is a 17th century barn adjacent to the house.|$|R
50|$|According to de Lumley, {{the site}} {{contained}} {{a settlement with}} several layers of habitation located on a fossil beach. The habitations dated to 380,000 BC, and included vestiges which suggested that the inhabitants lived in huts on the beach. In <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> each hut was a fireplace, with ashes showing that the inhabitants had domesticated fire. These signs of fire, along with those at Menez Dregan in the Finistere in France, at Beeches Pit in Suffolk, England, and at Vertesszollos in Hungary, are <b>the</b> earliest evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestication <b>of</b> fire known in Europe. These vestiges included low walls of stones and beach pebbles, placed to <b>the</b> northwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces,</b> which would have sheltered the fire from the strong Mistral wind. De Lumley believed the inhabitants built <b>the</b> huts <b>of</b> animal skins supported by poles, {{with a hole in}} the center for the smoke to escape. Twenty to forty people could gather in such a shelter. If his theory is correct, Terra Amata is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first discoveries <b>of</b> man-made human habitations in Europe.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} other {{buildings}} once stood in the inner bailey, though only traces now remain. <b>The</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curtain wall was lined with timber-framed domestic buildings such as the great hall, which {{appears to have been}} totally rebuilt by Edward I in 1301–02 and possibly on other occasions. <b>The</b> arrangement <b>of</b> these buildings is not known but remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> can still be seen built into the curtain wall. Due to the relatively small space available in the inner bailey, the buildings would have been very narrow. <b>The</b> stone foundations <b>of</b> a small chapel are also visible in the inner bailey. The chapel was first documented in the 13th century and was rebuilt in 1302, either on the existing stone foundations or in the outer bailey in a new location. The castle's water supply was provided by a well situated beside the chapel. It has never been fully dug out, but investigations have revealed that it is lined with stone to a depth of around [...] and with wood beyond that.|$|R
