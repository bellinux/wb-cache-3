40|$|When <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> is {{denatured}} there occurs {{a striking}} change in its SH groups. This change provides {{a clue to}} an understanding of the change in configuration of the <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> molecule that takes place during denaturation.

40|$|The {{following}} facts {{have been}} established experimentally. 1. In {{the presence of the}} synthetic detergent, Duponol PC, there is a definite reaction between dilute ferricyanide and denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin.</b> 0. 001 mM of ferrocyanide is formed by the oxidation of 10 mg. of denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> despite considerable variation in the time, temperature, and pH of the reaction and in the concentration of ferricyanide. 2. If the concentration of ferricyanide is sufficiently high, then the reaction between ferricyanide and denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> in Duponol solution is indefinite. More ferrocyanide is formed the longer the time of reaction, the higher the temperature, the more alkaline the solution, and the higher the concentration of ferricyanide. 3. Denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> which has been treated with formaldehyde or iodoacetamide, both of which abolish the SH groups of cysteine, does not reduce dilute ferricyanide in Duponol PC solution. 4. Cysteine is the only amino acid which is known to have a definite reaction with ferricyanide or which is known to react with dilute ferricyanide at all. The cysteine-free proteins which have been tried do not reduce dilute ferricyanide in Duponol PC solution. 5. Concentrated ferricyanide oxidizes cystine, tyrosine, and tryptophane and proteins which contain these amino acids but not cysteine. The reactions are indefinite, more ferrocyanide being formed, the higher the temperature and the concentration of ferricyanide. 6. The amount of ferrocyanide formed from denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> and a given amount of ferricyanide is less in the absence than in the presence of Duponol PC. 7. The amount of ferrocyanide formed when denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> reacts with ferricyanide in the absence of Duponol PC depends on the temperature and ferricyanide concentration throughout the whole range of ferricyanide concentrations, even in the low range of ferricyanide concentrations in which ferricyanide does not react with amino adds other than cysteine. The foregoing results have led to the following conclusions which, however, have not been definitely proven. 1. The definite reaction between denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> in Duponol PC solution and dilute ferricyanide is a reaction with SH groups whereas the indefinite reactions with concentrated ferricyanide involve other groups. 2. The SH groups of denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> in the absence of Duponol PC react with iodoacetamide and concentrated ferricyanide but they do not all react rapidly with dilute ferricyanide. 3. Duponol PC lowers the ferricyanide concentration at which the SH groups of denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> react with ferricyanide. The SH groups of denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin,</b> however, are free and accessible {{even in the absence of}} Duponol PC...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{experimental results}} have been obtained. 1. Native <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> treated with iodine and then denatured no longer gives a nitroprusside test or reduces dilute ferricyanide in neutral Duponol PC solution. 2. More iodine is needed to abolish the ferricyanide reduction if the reaction between native <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> and iodine is carried out at pH 6. 8 than if the reaction is carried out at pH 3. 2. At pH 6. 8 iodine reacts with tyrosine {{as well as with}} cysteine. 3. Cysteine and tryptophane are the only amino acids with reducing groups which are known to react with dilute iodine at pH 3. 2 The reducing power of cysteine is abolished by the reaction with iodine, whereas the reducing power of tryptophane remains intact. Pepsin and chymotrypsinogen which contain tryptophane but not cysteine, do not react at all with dilute iodine at pH 3. 2. 4. Native <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> treated with iodoacetamide at pH 9. 0 and then denatured by Duponol PC reduces only 60 per cent as much dilute ferricyanide as <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> which has not been treated with iodoacetamide. 5. The SH group is the only protein reducing group which is known to react with iodoacetamide. The simplest explanation of the new observation that the SH groups of <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> can be modified by reactions with the native form of the protein is that the native <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> has free and accessible but relatively unreactive SH groups which can react with iodine and iodoacetamide {{despite the fact that they}} do not react with ferricyanide, porphyrindin, or nitroprusside.

The phenomenon is explained on the basis that coagulated protein in suspension is covered with undenatured antigen and the addition of precipitin causes agglutination of the coagulated protein.

Bovine globulin, casein, <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> and alanine were even more effective than prostatic fluid in preventing the dilution phenomenon, and motility in their presence {{was as good as}} in con¬ centrated suspensions. <b>Egg</b> <b>albumin,</b> casein, acacia, serine and alanine improved the motility of washed dog spermatozoa...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between plasma and brain amino acids and short-term food intake after administration of albumin, or its constituent amino acids, was examined. Rats given protein (0. 85 g chicken <b>egg</b> <b>albumin)</b> or an amino acid mixture patterned after <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> reduced their food intake during 1 h of feeding beginning 30 min after gavage. Similarly, when given separately, the essential (EAA) and nonessential amino acid (NEAA) fractions of <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> caused comparable decreases in food intake. As the dose increased from 0. 5 to 1. 5 g {{the duration of}} anorexia prolonged to 12 h. Little change occurred in plasma amino acids at 30 and 60 min after albumin at 0. 85 g, although many increased by 25 - 50 % at 60 min after 1. 5 g. Marked changes in plasma occurred after gavage with the total mixture of constituent free amino acids and after either EAA or NEAA fractions. Brain amino acid concentrations were little affected by albumin and did not show consistent changes after the amino acid treatments. Thus the reductions in food intake after ingestion of albumin or of its constituent amino acids were not predicted from the resulting changes in either plasma or brain concentrations of amino acids. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|It was {{attempted}} {{to observe the}} influence of the change of aggregation on the electrophoretic behavior of denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin.</b> For this research the denatured albumin solutions of pH 3 and ionic strength 0. 065 were used. The solutions changed their η_ /φ values corresponding to the change of aggregation, and the electrophoretic mobilities were determined over the range of η_ /φ values from 30 to 250. The results showed that the electrophoretic mobility did not depend appreciably on the change of aggregation except in the region extremely high viscosity. This and other facts suggest the possibility that the electrophoretic migration of denatured <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> aggregate is determined mainly by the charge, size and shape of the molecule. A ramifying structure of the aggregate gives an appropriate explanation for it...|$|R
40|$|During an {{investigation}} of the effect of basic and acidic proteins on the growth of thermophilic aerobic sporeformers, crystalline <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> was found to be strongly bactericidal. This finding was uncharacteristic of acidic proteins. The bactericidal fraction was heat sensitive and separated from the non-bactericidal albumin fraction during gel filtration on Sephadex G- 75. Cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Bacillus stearothermophilus were lysed rapidly by the bactericidal component, leading to its tentative identification as lysozyme. The bactericidal substance possessed an electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate identical to that of crystalline egg white lysozyme. Users of crystalline <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> are cautioned that commercial preparations may be contaminated with lysozyme. Destruction of the thermophilic aerobes by lysozyme should be considered when performing counts on egg products...|$|R
25|$|The {{majority}} of MRPs use whey protein, casein (often listed as calcium caseinate or micellar casein), soy protein, and/or <b>egg</b> <b>albumin</b> as protein sources. Carbohydrates are typically derived from maltodextrin, oat fiber, brown rice, and/or wheat flour. Some MRPs also contain flax oil powder {{as a source}} of essential fatty acids.|$|R
