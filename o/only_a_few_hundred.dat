5|$|Fluorite or {{fluorspar}} {{is called}} Blue John in the Peak District, the name allegedly {{coming from the}} French Bleu et Jaune which describes the colour of the bandings. Blue John is now scarce, and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave; mining still {{takes place in the}} nearby Treak Cliff Cavern.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn Mine or Wythburn Mine {{opened in}} 1839 by the gill between Whelpside and Helvellyn Screes. It was {{operated}} by a succession of different owners, driving five levels through mostly barren rock to explore three mineral veins. It finally closed in 1880 when Manchester Corporation acquired the land for the Thirlmere reservoir. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> tons of galena {{came out of the}} mine; probably insufficient to cover its costs.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1960s, when Ejby was a {{small village}} with <b>a</b> {{population}} of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds,</b> the village has grown rapidly and is now surrounded by residential areas of single-family detached homes and terraced houses.|$|R
25|$|Another {{possibility}} {{is the use}} of thorium in a reactor especially designed for thorium (rather than mixing in thorium with uranium and plutonium (i.e. in existing reactors).

5|$|The {{noble gases}} show {{extremely}} low chemical reactivity; consequently, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> noble gas compounds have been formed. Neutral compounds in which helium and neon {{are involved in}} chemical bonds have not been formed (although there is some theoretical evidence for a few helium compounds), while xenon, krypton, and argon have shown only minor reactivity. The reactivity follows the order Ne < He < Ar < Kr < Xe < Rn.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{population}} estimates {{range from}} fewer than 2,500 to between 16,000 and 20,000 individuals. In 1999, {{the total population}} in China was estimated at between 3,000 and 7,000 individuals. In 2001, the wild population in India was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 individuals. Estimates for Nepal indicate <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> individuals. No records from Bhutan or Burma exist.|$|E
5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> words. Since then, the use of Elvish has flourished in poems and texts, phrases and names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation. As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded {{over the years as}} new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language that is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{having been}} completed, it was opened for business on August 16, 1859, F K Milne, afterwards the first town clerk, being appointed schoolmaster, each scholar to pay 1/6 (1 shilling and 6 pence) (or 18 pence) per week. Thus a day a school was started, the population being <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds,</b> principally men.|$|R

5|$|Behind the Wells Fargo {{office is}} a powder house which, as of 2011, {{contains}} models of the town, the town's major mills, and its Catholic church. The Catholic and Protestant cemeteries were restored by the Leeds Lion's Club in 1998 and can be visited. Several other original buildings remain, including the Clancy Market, McCormick Store, the two-story Harrison House Hotel, {{and some of the}} mining buildings. Main Street, once a mile long, is now <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> yards long and is surrounded by private homes.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{historical}} note, the Jewish {{community has}} figured centrally {{in the history}} of Transylvania, and in that of the wider region. They were a substantial and increasingly vibrant presence in Cluj in the modern era, contributing significantly to the town's economic dynamism and cultural flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although the community comprised a significant share of the town's population during the interwar era—between 13 and 15 percent—this figure plummeted {{as a consequence of the}} Holocaust and emigration; by the 1990s <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> Jews remained in Cluj-Napoca.|$|E
50|$|In a 2010 {{article in}} Scientific American, Marean {{explained}} how anatomically modern humans survived the MIS 6 glacial stage 195-123 thousand years ago, a {{period during which}} the human population was limited to <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> breeding individuals. During this period, sea levels dropped {{more than a hundred}} meters and the sloping South African Agulhas Bank was transformed into a plain on which humans could survive on shellfish and wash-ups from the sea.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a method to}} quickly and accurately estimate substrate coupling effects in analog and mixed digital/analog integrated circuits. Unlike numerical methods, {{that can be used}} for circuits containing <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> of substrate terminals, the new method can quickly extract circuits containing many thousands of substrate terminals. Examples are given that show that the method is sufficiently accurate for practical circuit verification. The method has been implemented in the layout-to-circuit extractor Space...|$|R
50|$|The Italian {{exodus from}} the city {{continued}} and in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years was almost total. The last stroke to the Italian presence {{was made by the}} local administration in October 1953, when the last Italian schools were closed and the students forced to move, in one day, into Yugoslavian schools, putting an end to the Romance identity of the city. Today the Italian community counts <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> people, gathered into a local community (Comunità degli Italiani di Zara).|$|R
5|$|Platinum is {{a member}} of the {{platinum}} group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5μg/kg. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.|$|E
5|$|Some Jesuit {{institutions}} {{still exist}} in the Chiquitania. For example, the towns of San Rafael de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, Santa Ana de Velasco and San Ignacio de Velasco have functioning town councils (cabildos), and the caciques and the sexton still retain their capacities. The {{majority of the population}} of the Chiquitania is staunchly Catholic; the Chiquitano cosmovision is now only a dimly understood mythology for its inhabitants. Between 1992 and 2009, the populations of San Xavier and especially Concepción tripled, and more than doubled in San Ignacio de Velasco, now the region’s fastest-growing municipality. In other mission towns the population also increased, albeit on a smaller scale. As of 2011, San José de Chiquitos, San Xavier and Concepción have around 10,000inhabitants each; and San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the Chiquitania, has about 35,000 and is now boasts a campus of a national university. On the other hand, in Santa Ana de Velasco there are currently <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> people. The remoter settlements of Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Corazón are quite small as well. According to various sources, in Bolivia the number of ethnic Chiquitanos is between 30,000 and 47,000 of which less than 6,000– mainly elderly people– still speak the original language. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> are monolingual in the Chiquitano language.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean 2nd and 9th Divisions {{were almost}} {{completely}} {{destroyed in the}} battles. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men {{at the beginning of}} the offensive on September 1. The 2nd Division numbered 6,000. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> from each division returned to North Korea after the fight. The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed, captured or deserted. All of NK II Corps was in a similar state, and the North Korean army, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.|$|E
5000|$|Eradi is a Samanthan Nair clan of Kshatriya origin, {{coming from}} the Indian state of Kerala. The word {{is derived from the}} place name Eranad in Kerala. The [...] "Samoothiri" [...] (Zamorin) comes from this Eradi subcaste, now assimilated to Samantha Kshatriya, the major upper caste of state of Kerala. Historically the Eradis {{numbered}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> of members. The 1891 Census of India reported their population at just 356, constituting less than 0.04% of the total Nair population.|$|R
40|$|The Ninetyeast Ridge hotspot track {{displays}} strontium, neodymium {{and lead}} isotope variations over time that reflect simple radioactive decay in the plume source {{rather than a}} change in the mantle components present. The lead isotope variations indicate that the time spent by the plume source in a non-convecting mantle boundary layer was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> of millions of years, contrary to the conventional view of individual plume sources as old (1 - 3 Gyr) or persistent features.

25|$|Contestants {{go through}} at least three sets of cuts. The first is a brief {{audition}} with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. The number of auditionees can exceed 10,000 people each city, but <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> in each city may make it past this round of preliminary auditions. Successful auditionees then sing in front of producers where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition {{in front of the}} judges, which is the only audition stage shown on the show.|$|R
5|$|The age of {{the tree}} was {{determined}} by carbon dating of genetically matched plant material collected from under the tree, as dendrochronology would cause damage. The trunk itself {{is estimated to be}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> years old, but the plant has survived for much longer due to a process known as layering (when a branch comes in contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning (when the trunk dies but the root system is still alive, it may sprout a new trunk).|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, {{germanium}} {{was thought to}} be a poorly conducting metal. Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an electronic semiconductor were recognized. During World War II, small amounts of germanium were used in some special electronic devices, mostly diodes. The first major use was the point-contact Schottky diodes for radar pulse detection during the War. The first silicon-germanium alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year, {{but by the end of}} the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached 40 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{permanent}} garrisons at Berwick, Calais, and Carlisle, England's {{standing army}} numbered <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> men. This was increased only slightly by Henry. Henry's invasion force of 1513, some 30,000 men, {{was composed of}} billmen and longbowmen, {{at a time when}} the other European nations were moving to hand guns and pikemen. The difference in capability was at this stage not significant, however, and Henry's forces had new armour and weaponry. They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the war wagon, relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns. The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the case of the latter produced disastrous results at Montreuil.|$|E
40|$|Calculations using {{realistic}} mean-field methods {{suggest the}} existence of nuclear shapes with tetrahedral T-d and/or octahedral O-h symmetries sometimes at <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundreds</b> of keV above the ground states in some rare earth nuclei around Gd- 156 and Yb- 160. The underlying single-particle spectra manifest exotic fourfold rather than Kramers's twofold degeneracies. The associated shell gaps are very strong, leading to {{a new form of}} shape coexistence in many rare earth nuclei. We present possible experimental evidence of the new symmetries based on the published experimental results-although an unambiguous confirmation will require dedicated experiment...|$|R
