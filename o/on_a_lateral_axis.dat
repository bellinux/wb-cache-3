The goal is to compute lower and upper bounds for unmeasured state as well as unknown inputs. The bounds are guaranteed {{under the assumption that}} external disturbances and noises are bounded with a priori known bounds. The proposed interval observer structure is based on decoupling the unknown input effect on the state dynamics by solving algebraic constraints on the estimation errors. Numerical simulations <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 5 th-order <b>lateral</b> <b>axis</b> model of <b>a</b> fixed-wing aircraft are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique...|$|R
30|$|If spatial {{knowledge}} {{exhibited a}} non-analog correspondence to modal experience, then preferred reference frames in spatial memory tasks {{should also be}} an unobserved phenomenon (Waller, 2014). In tasks probing judgment of relative distance, participants consistently prefer to encode the location of objects {{with respect to their}} natural corporeal orientation to gravity. Rather than observing a chance distribution of a participant’s reference frame with respect to an array of objects, there is a strong bias to orient the upward z-axis with the viewer’s bodily axis. In addition to preferring the vertical bodily axis, Franklin and Tversky (1990) have also demonstrated that location judgments are not made equally along all bodily axes. Testing the spatial framework hypothesis, Franklin and Tversky showed that an isotropic notion of space is undercut by response time biases where individuals in an upright position were fastest to identify objects from an imagined array above and below them, slower to identify objects in front of or behind them, and slowest to identify the location of objects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> left–right body <b>axis.</b> Moreover, Kosslyn, Ball, and Reiser (1978) observed that spatial representations in memory preserve metric properties. Kosslyn and colleagues demonstrated that irrespective of whether a participant viewed an actual spatial pictorial representation or simply imagined one, response times on tasks where individuals were asked to scan the image were nearly identical. Taken together, these findings point to an understanding of space that is modal and analog.|$|R

40|$|The inﬂorescence unit of Schoenus nigricans and S. ferrugineus {{consists}} of a zigzag axis and distichously arranged bracts, each of {{which may or may}} not subtend a bisexual ﬂower. Each ﬂower seems to terminate <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>axis.</b> These features have led to a controversy about the nature of the inﬂorescence unit, particularly whether it is monopodial or sympodial. It was often seen as a pseudospikelet composed of <b>a</b> succession of <b>lateral</b> axes, each subtended by the prophyll of the previous axis, as in a rhipidium. Many authors, however, consider the inﬂorescence units of all Cyperaceae to be indeterminate, racemose, actual spikelets. In our study, we present new SEM observations on the ﬂoral ontogeny of S. nigricans, corroborating a monopodial interpretation of the spikelet. Concaulescent growth of the ﬂower primordium and the spikelet apex explains: (1) the presence of a peduncle under the ﬂower, (2) the advanced development of the subtending glume compared to its own ﬂower primordium, and (3) the position of the distal glume with regard to the distal ﬂower primordium...|$|R

2500|$|The {{position}} of the Cross of Sacrifice in Commonwealth war cemeteries varies depending <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wide range of factors. [...] Many cemeteries were laid out haphazardly during the war. The role of the junior designing architect {{was to determine the}} {{position of}} the Cross (and Stone of Remembrance) in relationship to the graves. Most cemeteries had two axes—a main axis and an entrance axis, or a main/entrance <b>axis</b> and <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>axis.</b> An overriding guiding principle was that the War Stone should be the focus of the cemetery. The Cross of Sacrifice, however, usually functioned as the primary orienting feature of the cemetery for visitors, due to its height. In hilly areas, the architect had to ensure that the cross was visible from the road or path. (This was far less important in flat areas, obviously.) When a road passed directly by the cemetery, the cross usually was placed near the road and the entrance to the cemetery associated with the cross. [...] These design considerations meant that the Cross of Sacrifice could be placed {{in a wide variety of}} places. [...] Sometimes it was situated next to the War Stone, and sometimes in opposition to it. [...] In some cases, the Cross of Sacrifice was placed in a distant corner of the cemetery, so that its relationship to the Stone of Remembrance was not clear.|$|R

40|$|Labeled ‘the all-time {{breakthrough}} in geology’, plate tectonics brought {{a revolution in}} Earth Science 40 years ago. This theory links movements of lithospheric plates to processes taking place deep inside the Earth. The assumption of rigid surface plates enables one to describe the surface kinematics in terms of two components: the horizontal divergence (ridge-trench system) and the radial vorticity (transform faults and plate spin). The horizontal diver-gence and the radial vorticity {{are directly related to}} the poloidal (vertical motion around <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>axis)</b> and toroidal (<b>lateral</b> motion around <b>a</b> vertical axis) scalar fields, respectively. Surprisingly, kinetic energy in present-day plate motions is partitioned approximately equally between horizontal divergence (poloidal) and radial vorticity (toroidal) parts. I work with a time-dependant 3 D spherical convective code where plates are coupled dynamically to the mantle. This method, which ensures the retrieval (to within ± 10 %) of the main global observables at the Earth’s surface (mean plate velocity, global heat flux and potential temperature under oceanic ridges), is unique and provides new opportunities to tackle questions such as the coupling between plates and the deeper mantle. I made experiments with different plate geometry on top of the 3 D spherical code. When I plot the degree variance of the poloidal and toroidal components of the surface velocity field, only a geometry close the observed present-day geometry shows almost the same toroidal to poloidal ratio that exists at present-day. It suggests that only...|$|R
50|$|P. ahipa is {{member of}} the Fabaceae and {{predominantly}} self-pollinating. The Andean bean is a perennial plant and can grow in erect, semierect or twining forms. The erect species can grow to 15-40 cm tall, the semierect one about 30-60 cm, and the twining forms 60-200 cm long. These plants are herbaceous and lignified depending on the genotype. They do not show <b>a</b> <b>lateral</b> <b>axis.</b> The leaves are trifoliate with stipules or pinnately arranged leaflets with caduceus stipels. The flowers, which grow on short stalks, are white blossoms or of a pale lavender colour. They show a tubular calyx and a papilionaceous corolla. Generally, the flowers exhibit an internally curved stigma {{in close contact with}} the anthers. This habitus is very unfavourable in connection with the pollination behaviour of insects, as they are not able to pollinate the flowers very effectively. Additionally, the pollen fertility is often not very high. It varies between 45 and 100%. The flowering pattern is not consistent. Each season, 100 - 800 flowers per plant can be produced. P. ahipa is a short-day plant, so flowering takes place under decreasing day length. The pods are 13-17 cm long and up to 16 mm wide. The seeds are black, lilac, maroon, or black and white mottled. They are round, kidney-shaped, and about 0.8-1 cm long. Seed production differs from plant to plant and lies between 20 and 100 per plant. The thousand grain weight is around 300 g.|$|R
