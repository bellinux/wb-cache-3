25|$|These militants – Ray Dunne, his {{brothers}} Miles and Grant, Carl Skoglund and later Farrell Dobbs – began by organizing coal drivers through a strike in the coldest part of 1933 that ignored both the cumbersome approval procedures established under the International's Constitution and the ineffective mediation procedures offered under the National Industrial Recovery Act.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to generalize the way <b>of</b> {{computing}} the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> outranking in a multiple criteria aggregation procedure, in view of taking into account two new ef-fects called reinforced preference and counter-veto. These effects concern only those cri-teria for which, as soon as action a is “judged very strongly preferred” to action b, one wishes that the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> outranking of a over b is greater than that for the case where (all things equal elsewhere) the preference is not “judged very strong”. To achieve this goal, we propose two complementary ways. The first one involves a reinforced pref-erence threshold which affects the concordance degree, and the second one involves a counter-veto threshold which affects the insertion of discordance degree in the calcula-tion <b>of</b> the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> outranking. The introduction of these two new effects remains compatible with the handling of purely ordinal preference scales.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that Spanish explorers arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century—200 years before Captain James Cook's first documented visit in 1778. Ruy López de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 bound for the Philippines with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe an encounter with either Hawaii or the Marshall Islands. If de Villalobos' crew spotted Hawaii, Gaetano would be considered the first European to see the islands. Some scholars have dismissed these claims {{due to a lack}} <b>of</b> <b>credibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stove {{notes that}} in part one he has only {{demonstrated}} how an irrational position might be expressed, {{in such a way}} as it had some appearance <b>of</b> <b>credibility,</b> not that such a position is actually held by the subjects of his study.

Stove presents examples of what he believes are the clearest statements of irrationalism in their writing. Ultimately he considers providing examples from Karl Popper suffices. He presents the quotes and paraphrases apparently in ascending order of irrationality.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, I take up {{the problem}} of how to enhance {{information}} credibility through design. I first situate my comments within the interactional approach of Value Sensitive Design. Then I emphasize four areas that warrant increased attention, in terms of research, design, and practice: (1) establishing theoretical frameworks <b>of</b> information <b>credibility,</b> (2) broadening the scope <b>of</b> information <b>credibility</b> beyond the Internet to engage people’s information interactions as they flow online and offline and back again, (3) broadening the scope <b>of</b> information <b>credibility</b> beyond web-based text, images, and links to account for emerging formats and interaction models, and (4) developing design theory, principles, and practices for information credibility. I conclude with a conundrum that involves the place <b>of</b> information <b>credibility</b> in a thriving democracy...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the loss}} of General Belgrano, the Argentinian fleet {{returned}} to its bases and played no {{major role in the}} rest of the conflict. British nuclear submarines continued to operate in the sea areas between Argentina and the Falkland Islands, gathering intelligence, providing early warning of air raids and effectively imposing Sea denial. A further effect was that the Argentinian Navy's carrier-borne aircraft had to operate from land bases at the limit of their range, rather than from an aircraft carrier at sea. The minimal role of the Navy {{in the rest of the}} campaign led to a considerable loss <b>of</b> <b>credibility</b> and influence within the Junta.|$|E

25|$|By early 2003, as Israel and the United States {{refused to}} {{negotiate}} with Yasser Arafat, {{it was thought that}} Abbas would be a candidate for the kind of leadership role envisaged by both countries. As {{one of the few remaining}} founding members of Fatah, he had some degree <b>of</b> <b>credibility</b> within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court). Abbas's reputation as a pragmatist garnered him favor with the West and some members of the Palestinian legislature. Under international pressure, on 19 March 2003, Arafat appointed Abbas Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority. According to Gilbert Achcar, the United States imposed Abbas on Arafat, the democratically elected leader, though the majority of Palestinians thought of the former as a Quisling.|$|E
25|$|As a {{retaliation}} for the attack in the Cauca, a military operation in Guapi, Cauca killed 26 guerrillas of the FARC's 29th front on May 22. Days later, guerrilla commander and general staff member Román Ruiz {{was killed in the}} Chocó. The FARC called off their unilateral ceasefire declared in December 2014. Although it had been agreed upon that negotiations would take place in the midst of continued conflict, the end of the FARC's unilateral ceasefire was seen as putting the peace process in a critical moment which would lead to its end if not handled cautiously. Combined with President Santos' historically low popularity, the negotiations' loss <b>of</b> <b>credibility</b> and the strength of Uribe's opposition to the peace progress, the Havana talks appeared to be in dire straits. The crisis worried Cuba and Norway, the two guarantor countries, who called on the two sides to continue efforts at a negotiated settlement including an agreement on a definite bilateral ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{during the}} {{testimony}} of a witness, the witness may be questioned about statements he previously made outside court on an earlier occasion, to demonstrate either {{that he has been}} consistent or inconsistent in his account of events. The Act did not change the circumstances in which such statements could become admissible in evidence (which are still prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Act 1865), but it did change the evidential effect of such statements once admitted. Formerly, such statements were not evidence of the facts stated in them (unless the witness agreed with them in court): they only proved that the witness had kept his story straight or had changed his story, and so were only evidence of his credibility (or lack of it) as a witness. They were not hearsay. Under the 2003 Act, however, such statements are now themselves evidence of any facts stated in them, not just <b>of</b> <b>credibility,</b> and so are now hearsay.|$|E

40|$|A website’s {{perceived}} {{credibility is}} a critical issue for consumers when making an online purchase. In general, customers prefer not to purchase items on websites until they feel confident in their credibility. This is critical for Egyptian users as they perceive {{a high level of}} risk when internet shopping in Egypt. Perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> websites vary based on an individual’s unique attributes and experiences (Lazar, Meiselwitz & Feng, 2007), and thus it seems logical that factors derived from one context might not be equally important for users in other contexts. Credibility is a crucial especially for airlines because booking airline ticket entails the disclosure of more personal and financial information than any other online transaction. Airline companies need to consider how they should improve the websites to make them credible for consumers. This study sought to develop an integrated model for the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> airline websites. The study had several aims. First, it aimed to explore the antecedents <b>of</b> airline website <b>credibility</b> as perceived by Egyptian online users. Second, it aimed to explore the extent to which users’ perceptions <b>of</b> website <b>credibility</b> is affected by their residence in an online-based country such as the UK compared with a face-to-face-based country such as Egypt. Third, it aimed to explore the relative importance of the antecedents <b>of</b> airline website <b>credibility</b> for Egyptian users and determine the relationship between Egyptian users’ demographics and perceptions of these antecedents. Fourth, by combining study finding, the study aimed to conceptualize a framework linking the antecedents <b>of</b> airline website <b>credibility</b> in the Egyptian context with the relationship between users’ perceptions of these antecedents and their demographics. To achieve the above objectives, this qualitative study adopts an interpretive approach mixed methods under the interpretive approach. An exploratory sequential strategy, in which 20 semi-structured interviews preceded a survey phase involving 200 respondents, was conducted to achieve the research objectives. The antecedents affecting perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> airline websites were identified as a combination of factors related to the online presence of the airline company, factors related to the physical presence of the airline company and infrastructure factors in Egypt. The findings also highlighted the fact that credibility antecedents are not all of equal importance for Egyptians. The findings also revealed that Egyptians who reside in Egypt perceive the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> airline websites differently from Egyptians who reside in the UK. The age, gender, income, education and internet experience of users was found to impact on perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> airline websites. The main contribution {{of this study is to}} enhance the understanding <b>of</b> the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> airline websites. This is important because there is inconclusive evidence about website credibility, especially with regard to airline websites...|$|R
40|$|A {{factorial}} experiment {{was developed in}} which {{the reputation of the}} advertising firm and the extremity of the advertising claim were manipulated. Two levels of advertiser reputation, focusing on the expertise and trustworthiness of the spon-soring firm, were developed. Claim extremity was structured on a rank-order scale with product claims as first, third, fifth, or twentieth best among 100 competing brands. Product evaluation was significantly influenced by both independent vari-ables and by the interaction between the two. Measures <b>of</b> ad <b>credibility</b> helped provide an explanation for the findings. W hat is the optimal level of advertising claim ex-tremity?
