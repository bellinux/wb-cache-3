50|$|A launch is an <b>open</b> <b>motorboat.</b> The forward part of {{the launch}} may be covered. Prior to the era of engines on small craft, a launch was the largest boat carried on a sailing vessel, powered by sail or by oars. In {{competitive}} rowing, a launch is a motorized boat used by the coach during training.|$|E
5000|$|Itty E {{was built}} as a private <b>open</b> <b>motorboat</b> {{of the same name}} in 1916 by Murray and Tregurtha at South Boston, Massachusetts. In 1917, the U.S. Navy - which had {{evaluated}} Itty E and concluded that she would be [...] "excellent as rescue boat or tender to the airplane at Naval Air Station" [...] - chartered her from her owner, F. H. Rawson of Chicago, Illinois, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned on 6 July 1917 as USS Itty E (SP-952).|$|E
5000|$|Father Bernard R. Hubbard was a Jesuit {{priest and}} {{professor}} of geology at Santa Clara University in California, who had been exploring Alaska's volcanoes and glaciers every summer season since 1927 and writing about them in best-selling books and in publications such as National Geographic and the Saturday Evening Post. Intrigued by the Alaska Peninsula's volcanoes, he first visited the Aniakchak region in 1930. Hubbard and four companions arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Aniakchak River in June 1930. They used a 15 ft <b>open</b> <b>motorboat</b> to boat up the river, then explored the caldera, finding fumaroles in the crater. They returned in 1931 in time to document (somewhat inaccurately) the aftermath of the May eruption. In 1932 Hubbard and pilot Frank Dorbrandt flew into the caldera and landed on Surprise Lake. Hubbard's dramatically written but mostly accurate descriptions of the region appeared in the New York Times and captured popular imaginations, publicizing the Aniakchak region for the first time. A follow-up article by Barrett Willoughby in the Saturday Evening Post entitled [...] "The Moon Craters of Alaska" [...] discussed Hubbard's expedition to Aniakchak and nearby Mount Veniaminof in greater detail. National Park Service director Horace M. Albright and his then-assistant Arno B. Cammerer saw the stories and started preparation of documents to proclaim a national monument under the Antiquities Act. After the proposed boundary was altered to exclude regions thought by the USGS to be potential oil sources, the proposed monument was circulated among other federal and territorial agencies for comment. Although there was no particular objection to the monument, there was no strong push for the designation, and the Aniakchak project was shunted aside in favor of a proclamation expanding Katmai National Monument.|$|E
40|$|My result {{address the}} problem that getting back up in the boat after one have fallen in can be very difficult. My {{research}} led me {{to focus on the}} very smallest boats, rowing boats and <b>open</b> <b>motorboats</b> under 6 meters in length. My solution to the problem is to provide an easily attached footstep that can be reached and pulled down from water level. The product can be adapted to different boats. For the smallest boats, manually activated flotation units can be integrated to prevent the boat from tipping...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe WRSC (World Robotic Sailing Championship) / IRSC (International Robotic Sailing Conference) is an {{international}} and annual competition and conference that aims at stimulating the development of autonomous marine robotics and its applications. The competition, originally designed for sailboats, is also <b>opened</b> to <b>motorboats</b> as a separate category since 2013. In this paper, we will present the competition through {{the example of the}} 2013 edition, and show its results, specificities, issues as well as improvements for the next edition...|$|R
5000|$|There are 121 mi {{of trails}} in the swamp, of which 70 are <b>open</b> to day-use <b>motorboat</b> [...] and under. Seven {{overnight}} shelters {{are available in}} the swamp's interior.The refuge has six different boating trails (Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, and Brown) giving users a choice of twelve different overnight canoe trips.|$|R
50|$|This {{provision}} {{is both an}} objective emission control and a subjective immission control.Because they are moving sources, objective controls are appropriate for measurements on <b>open</b> waterways. Many <b>motorboats</b> operate in bounding areas, such as small lakes or canals, with adjacent residential areas. In this case, immission controls are appropriate. California (Section 654.05), Portland OR (Section 18.10.040), and Seattle, WA (Section 25.08.485) require immission {{measurements to be made}} at the shoreline. Many states require emission measurements to be made at 50 feet.|$|R
