50|$|These {{mutations}} {{themselves are}} characterized by considerable variability in clinical outcome and typically only a subset of mutation carriers meet criteria for autism. For example, carriers of the 16p11.2 deletion have a mean IQ 32 points lower than their first-degree relatives that do not carry the deletion, however only 20% are below the threshold IQ of 70 for intellectual disability, and only 20% have autism. Around 85% have a neurobehavioral diagnosis, including autism, ADHD, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, gross motor delay, and epilepsy, while 15% have no diagnosis. Alongside these neurobehavioral phenotypes, the 16p11.2 deletions / duplications {{have been associated with}} macrocephaly / microcephaly, body weight regulation, and the duplication in particular is associated with schizophrenia. Controls that carry mutations associated with autism or schizophrenia typically present with <b>intermediate</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> <b>or</b> fecundity compared to neurodevelopmental cases and population controls. Therefore, a single mutation can have multiple different effects depending on other genetic and environmental factors.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{quantity}} and heterogeneity of structural {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (sMRI) studies in schizophrenia present a challenge to their meaningful interpretation. This thesis sought to synthesise the available literature on neuroanatomical alterations in people with schizophrenia, and explore brain volume differences among subgroups of schizophrenia defined {{on the basis of}} cognitive ability. The thesis also investigated whether analogous cognitive subgroups extending across the psychosis-mood spectrum (including bipolar-I disorder) may be differentiated by brain volume. Methods: Meta-review of the existing sMRI literature was conducted using electronic databases. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to statistically collate studies reporting insular cortex volume in schizophrenia. Subsequent analysis of structural imaging data from two separate samples explored differences in grey and white matter volume among cognitive subtypes of psychotic disorder relative to controls. Subgroups within a large schizophrenia sample were allocated to cognitively spared (CS;&# 894; N= 157) or cognitively deficit (CD;&# 894; N= 106), compared to healthy controls (N= 181). Subsequently, a mixed sample of schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder was stratified into executively spared (ES;&# 894; N= 38) and executively deficit subgroups (ED;&# 894; N= 32) to assess differences in grey and white matter volume. Results: Critical synthesis of the sMRI literature identified limited high quality evidence for widespread regional grey and white matter aberration in schizophrenia. Specific assessment of insular cortex identified moderate volume reductions, with large heterogeneity not explained by age, sex, illness duration, medication, whole brain volume, or hemisphere. Assessment of cognitive subtypes of schizophrenia identified distinct neuroanatomical profiles of each group relative to controls, with the cognitively impaired group showing more diffuse brain volume reductions. Assessment of the diagnostic specificity of these findings identified no differences between groups defined by bipolar-I disorder and schizophrenia diagnoses, but similarly diffuse volume deficits across the psychosis-mood spectrum in the executively impaired subgroup. Conclusions: Stratification according to <b>intermediate</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> identified trans-diagnostic subtypes that exhibited markedly discrepant brain aberrations and clinical features. These findings provide insight into potential neuropathological regions, and suggest the existence of discrete illness types who may be associated with divergent neurodevelopmental or genetic vulnerabilities...|$|R
40|$|Background There {{is limited}} {{research}} regarding {{the association between}} genes and <b>cognitive</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>phenotypes</b> in those at risk for psychotic disorders. Methods We measured the association between established psychosis risk variants in dopamine D 2 receptor (DRD 2) and cognitive performance in individuals at age 23 years and explored if associations between cognition and these variants differed {{according to the presence}} of familial or clinical risk for psychosis. The subjects of the Oulu Brain and Mind Study were drawn from the general population-based Northern Finland 1986 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1986). Using linear regression, we compared the associations between cognitive performance and two candidate DRD 2 polymorphisms (rs 6277 and rs 1800497) between subjects having familial (n= 61) and clinical (n= 45) risk for psychosis and a random sample of participating NFBC 1986 controls (n= 74). Cognitive performance was evaluated using a comprehensive battery of tests at follow-up. Results Principal components factor analysis supported a three-factor model for cognitive measures. The minor allele of rs 6277 was associated with poorer performance on a verbal factor (p= 0. 003) but this did not significantly interact with familial or clinical risk for psychosis. The minor allele of rs 1800497 was associated with poorer performance on a psychomotor factor (p= 0. 038), though only in those at familial risk for psychotic disorders (interaction p= 0. 049). Conclusion The effect of two DRD 2 SNPs on cognitive performance may differ according to risk type for psychosis, suggesting that <b>cognitive</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>phenotypes</b> differ according to the type (familial or clinical) risk for psychosis...|$|R

40|$|Alterations in the folate pathway {{have been}} related to both major {{depression}} and cognitive inflexibility; however, {{they have not been}} investigated in the genetic background of ruminative response style, which is a form of perseverative cognition and a risk factor for depression. In the present study, we explored the association of rumination (measured by the Ruminative Responses Scale) with polymorphisms of two distinct folate pathway genes, MTHFR rs 1801133 (C 677 T) and MTHFD 1 L rs 11754661, in a combined European white sample from Budapest, Hungary (n = 895) and Manchester, United Kingdom (n = 1309). Post hoc analysis investigated whether the association could be replicated in each of the two samples, and the relationship between folate pathway genes, rumination, lifetime depression and Brief Symptom Inventory depression score. Despite its functional effect on folate metabolism, the MTHFR rs 1801133 showed no effect on rumination. However, the A allele of MTHFD 1 L rs 11754661 was significantly associated with greater rumination, and this effect was replicated in both the Budapest and Manchester samples. In addition, rumination completely mediated the effects of MTHFD 1 L rs 11754661 on depression phenotypes. These findings suggest that the MTHFD 1 L gene, and thus the C 1 -THF synthase enzyme of the folate pathway localized in mitochondria, has an important effect on the pathophysiology of depression through rumination, and maybe via this <b>cognitive</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>phenotype</b> on other mental and physical disorders. Further research should unravel whether the reversible metabolic effect of MTHFD 1 L is responsible for increased rumination or other long-term effects on brain development...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to further refine the <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotype</b> of attention-deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD), with respect to the ability to sustain attention and executive functioning. Participants were 34 boys with ADHD (combined type) and 28 normal controls. The groups were closely matched for age and IQ. All participants were 12 years of age. Both groups performed a computerized sustained attention task and a response interference task. Measures related to speed, accuracy, and time on task were collected. We found that children with ADHD performed slower, less accurately, more impulsively, and with less stability than controls. Both groups produced more errors with increasing time on task, reflecting reduced vigilance. Importantly, no interaction with time on task was found. The overall pattern of results suggests that measures related to accuracy are more informative than measures related to speed of responding in refining the <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotype</b> of ADHD...|$|R

Twenty adults who had suffered moderate closed head injury (CHI) but now generated normal or close to normal neuropsychological test scores, yet continued to experience family, work, or other problems, were compared with matched controls. Comparisons of the patient and control group on simulation scores indicated no significant differences for single, well-structured task components or for information search activity. In contrast, the CHI sample was impaired on numerous tasks that require <b>intermediate</b> <b>or</b> complex <b>cognitive</b> efforts.

Thus, the purpose of this exploratory candidate gene association study was to examine relationships between variation in genes involved in oxidative stress (CAT, GPX 1, SEPP 1, SOD 1, and SOD 2) and DNA repair (ERCC 2, ERCC 3, ERCC 5, and PARP 1) and pre-adjuvant therapy CF in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{systematically}} analyze the associations between different TSC 1 and TSC 2 mutations and the neurologic and <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotype</b> in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Methods: Mutation analysis was performed in 58 patients with TSC. Epilepsy variables, including EEG, were classified. A cognition index was determined based on a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. On three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR images, an automated tuber segmentation program detected and calculated the number of tubers and the proportion of total brain volume occupied by tubers (tuber/brain proportion [TBP]). Results: As a group, patients with a TSC 2 mutation had earlier age at seizure onset, lower cognition index, more tubers, and a greater TBP than those with a TSC 1 mutation, but the ranges overlapped considerably. Familial cases were older at seizure onset and had a higher cognition index than nonfamilial cases. Patients with a mutation deleting or directly inactivating the tuberin GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain had more tubers and a greater TBP than those with an intact GAP domain. Patients with a truncating TSC 1 or TSC 2 mutation differed from those with nontruncating mutations in seizure types only. Conclusions: Although patients with a TSC 1 mutation are more likely to have a less severe neurologic and <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotype</b> than those with a TSC 2 mutation, the considerable overlap between both aspects of the phenotype implies that prediction of the neurologic and <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex should not be based on their particular TSC 1 or TSC 2 mutation...|$|R
40|$|Although much {{progress}} has been made in determining the cognitive profile of strengths and weaknesses that characterise individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), there remain a number of outstanding questions. These include how universal strengths and deficits are; whether cognitive subgroups exist; and how cognition is associated with core autistic behaviours, as well as associated psychopathology. Several methodological factors have contributed to these limitations in our knowledge, including: small sample sizes, a focus on single domains of cognition, and an absence of comprehensive behavioural phenotypic information. To attempt to overcome some of these limitations, we assessed a wide range of cognitive domains in a large sample (N = 100) of 14 - to 16 -year-old adolescents with ASDs who had been rigorously behaviourally characterised. In this review, we will use examples of some initial findings in the domains of perceptual processing, emotion processing and memory, both to outline different approaches we have taken to data analysis and to highlight the considerable challenges to better defining the <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotype(s)</b> of ASDs.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia {{has helped to}} re-define the impact of various subcortical neuropathologies on aging; however, state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques and autopsy studies suggest that not all structural brain alterations associated with vascular dementia are exclusive to this neurodegenerative process alone. Thus, {{a detailed analysis of}} the <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotype</b> associated with ischaemic vascular disease is key to our understanding of subcortical neuropathology and its associated behaviors. Over the past twenty years, we have operationally defined this <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotype</b> using the Boston Process Approach to neuropsychological assessment. This has led to both an empirical, as well as a theoretical understanding of three core constructs related to the dysexecutive syndrome associated with ischaemic vascular disease affecting periventricular and deep white matter as well as subcortical structures connecting these regions with the prefrontal cortex. Thus, difficulties with mental set, cognitive control and mental manipulation negatively impact executive functioning. This review will outline the subtle markers underlying this prefrontal dysfunction, i. e., the dysexecutive phenotype, associated with ischaemic vascular disease and relate it to fundamental impairments of gating subserved by basal ganglia-thalamic pathways within and across various dementia syndromes...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) {{can be used}} to {{quantify}} cognitive function in individuals as effective connectivity. However, ambiguity among subjects in the number and location of discernible active regions prevents all candidate models from being compared in all subjects, precluding the use of DCM as an individual <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotyping</b> tool. This paper proposes a solution to this problem by treating missing regions in the first-level analysis as missing data, and performing estimation of the time course associated with any missing region using one of four candidate methods: zero-filling, average-filling, noise-filling using a fixed stochastic process, or one estimated using expectation-maximization. The effect of this estimation scheme was analyzed by treating it as a preprocessing step to DCM and observing the resulting effects on model evidence. Simulation studies show that estimation using expectation-maximization yields the highest classification accuracy using a simple loss function and highest model evidence, relative to other methods. This result held for various dataset sizes and varying numbers of model choice. In real data, application to Go/No-Go and Simon tasks allowed computation of signals from the missing nodes and the consequent computation of model evidence in all subjects compared to 62 and 48 percent respectively if no preprocessing was performed. These results demonstrate the face validity of the preprocessing scheme and open the possibility of using single-subject DCM as an individual <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotyping</b> tool...|$|R

Place and Duration of Study: Saint Louis University Hospital, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States, between May 2011 and May 2012. Methodology: Six NF 1 pediatric patients underwent FDG PET/CT including the brain, for evaluation of extracranial neoplasm. Their brain PET images were compared with a pediatric comparison set (21 subjects) using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Significant differences between groups were examined at p< 0. 001, uncorrected for voxel height and p< 0. 05, corrected for cluster extent. Results: Compared with the comparison set, the 6 NF 1 patients showed the largest cluster of reduced FDG uptake (3966 voxels) in the medial dorsal nucleus of bilateral thalami. Additional clusters of metabolism in the range from 415 to 926 voxels were noticed in the right cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area (BA) 8 and 24), left occipital lobe (BA 17 and 18) and right fronto-parietal lobe (BA 43).

To date, cognitive-related changes in Parkinson's disease have never been explored with dense-EEG with the aim of establishing a relationship between the degree of cognitive impairment, on the one hand, and alterations in the functional connectivity of brain networks, on the other hand. This study was aimed at identifying altered brain networks associated with <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> in Parkinson's disease using dense-EEG data recorded during rest with eyes closed. Three groups of Parkinson's disease patients (N =  124) with different <b>cognitive</b> <b>phenotypes</b> coming from a data-driven cluster analysis, were studied: G 1) cognitively intact patients (63), G 2) patients with mild cognitive deficits (46) and G 3) patients with severe cognitive deficits (15). Functional brain networks were identified using a dense-EEG source connectivity method. Pairwise functional connectivity was computed for 68 brain regions in different EEG frequency bands. Network statistics were assessed at both global (network topology) and local (inter-regional connections) level. Results revealed progressive disruptions in functional connectivity between the three patient groups, typically in the alpha band. Differences between G 1 and G 2 (p <  0. 001, corrected using permutation test) were mainly frontotemporal alterations. A statistically significant correlation (ρ =  0. 49, p <  0. 001) was also obtained between a proposed network-based index and the patients' cognitive score. Global properties of network topology in patients were relatively intact. These findings indicate that functional connectivity decreases with the worsening of cognitive performance and loss of frontotemporal connectivity may be a promising neuromarker of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease...|$|R
