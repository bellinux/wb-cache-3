This stadium has a {{capacity}} of 1,800 and also hosts the matches <b>of</b> <b>club</b> sides FC Andorra and the Andorran Premier League.

5000|$|The {{object of}} each hand {{is to come}} up with the correct {{combination}} of cards to be able to Go Down, or [...] "lay out". The combination for each hand is different (see chart), and they become more difficult with each subsequent hand. The combinations for each hand are either group also called sets or runs or a combination of both. A set is a combination of three or more of a specific number of cards of the same rank, and the suit is not important. An example of a set is three cards that are all 8's, and the 8's can all be of different suits. A run is a combination of four cards in the same suit that have consecutive ranks. An example of a run is the 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 5 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and the 6 <b>of</b> <b>clubs.</b> As previously stated, an ace can be high or low, but it cannot be in between, a few examples. Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> is a run, and Jack <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> Queen <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> King <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> is a run, but King <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> is not a run. Jokers are wild cards and can be any card in the deck. In hands that require two runs, a player may chose to play the same suit for both runs, however connecting runs must have either a gap, and extra card or nine cards. Examples: Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 6 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 7 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 8 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 9 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> counts as two runs. Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 5 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 6 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 7 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> counts as two runs, but in order for Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 5 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 6 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 7 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 8 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> to be a run, the player must also have the 9 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> (played as part of the higher run).|$|R

5|$|A {{knee injury}} would limit Comminges to just two {{appearances}} during the 2009–10 season, missing {{nine months of}} first-team action {{as a result of}} the injury. He had suffered the injury during training at the club after teammate Jay Bothroyd fell awkwardly onto Comminges, causing his knee ligament to detach. Comminges originally attempted to continue training but was ordered not to by manager Dave Jones on the advice <b>of</b> <b>club</b> doctors, who later discovered the severity of the injury. Comminges' contract was initially due to expire at the end of the season but, having suffered the injury, he was offered a six-month extension by the club until January 2011 in order to regain fitness and improve his chances of finding a new club. His appearance as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away victory at Plymouth Argyle on 18 August 2009 would ultimately be his last for the club.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the possible differences of individual personality features between the members <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> <b>of</b> treated alcoholics and gamblers in the Union <b>Of</b> <b>Clubs</b> <b>Of</b> Treated Alcoholics And Gamblers “Dr. Vladimir Hudolin”, Mostar. The sample consisted of 19 members <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> <b>of</b> treated alcoholics and 7 members <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> <b>of</b> treated gamblers. For the purposes of the study, the Social-demographic Data Questionnaire, Five-factors Questionnaire, Plutchik’s Emotion Index (PIE-JRS) Alcohol History Questionnaire, Behavioral Evaluation Questionnaire, Gambling History Questionnaire and Diagnostic Instrument for Gamblers had been used. The data were analyzed using χ 2 Test and Mann-Whitney’s U-Test. The results obtained have shown that the two groups differ significantly in two personality dimensions on BFQ: openness to new experiences and thoroughness. The members <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> <b>of</b> treated alcoholics (KLA) achieved higher scores in dimensions: lying and responsibility, while the members <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> <b>of</b> treated gamblers (KLOK) achieved higher scores in dimensions: energy, dynamics and dominance, although the differences have not proved statistically significant. Also, we have noticed some differences in the emotional profile PIE-JRS among the members of the two groups, i. e. higher scores obtained in all of the dimensions. Generally, we might say that the results of this study have been in accordance with previous studies in this field...|$|R

Instead, he returned to the starting eleven that beat Arsenal 1–0 with a goal from Hughie Ferguson, being praised for his leadership of the team's defence during the match and earning plaudits from opposing captain Charlie Buchan. By winning the trophy, Cardiff had become the first team outside England to win the FA Cup and Keenor, as captain, was handed the trophy by King George V.|$|E

These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey <b>of</b> <b>club</b> goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the firm}} {{intention}} of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard {{to salvage the}} project, the recordings remained unfinished and untouched {{for more than two}} years due to lack of funding. While struggling with the long, complex and expensive production of the Blue Öyster Cult's album Club Ninja, Pearlman associated himself with Daniel J. Levitin, A director of the local punk label 415 Records, with whom shared academic interests in neuroscience. In 1986, Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco's Hyde Street Recording Studios, and dubbed it Alpha & Omega Studios. Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there, and Pearlman sub-leased the studio to other producers. In September 1986, when the poor sales <b>of</b> <b>Club</b> Ninja resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded, the lack of new material from the band for the foreseeable future prompted Pearlman to propose Imaginos to Columbia Records as a new Blue Öyster Cult album. He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and to add the vocals of Roeser and Bloom, singers of all the hits produced by Blue Öyster Cult.|$|E
