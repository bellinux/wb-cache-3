The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which {{is attached to}} the cylinder valve outlet, and an <b>outlet</b> <b>connection</b> in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the <b>outlet</b> <b>connection</b> of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
50|$|When the {{gas in the}} {{cylinder}} {{is to be used}} at low pressure, the cap is taken off and a pressure-regulating assembly is attached to the stop valve. This attachment typically has a pressure regulator with upstream (inlet) and downstream (outlet) pressure gauges and a further downstream needle valve and <b>outlet</b> <b>connection.</b> For gases that remain gaseous under ambient storage conditions, the upstream pressure gauge can be used to estimate how much gas is left in {{the cylinder}} according to pressure. For gases that are liquid under storage, e.g., propane, the outlet pressure is dependent on the vapor pressure of the gas, and does not fall until the cylinder is nearly exhausted although it will vary according to the temperature of the cylinder contents. The regulator is adjusted to control the downstream pressure, which will limit the maximum flow of gas out of the cylinder at the pressure shown by the downstream gauge. The <b>outlet</b> <b>connection</b> is attached to whatever needs the gas supply, such as a balloon for example. For some purposes, such as welding, the regulator will also have a flowmeter on the downstream side.|$|E

40|$|A {{solenoid valve}} is {{described}} in which both an inlet and an outlet of the valve are sealed when the valve is closed.

Inlet and outlet tubes extend through a plate into the chamber. A movable core in the chamber extends into the solenoid coil. The distal end of the core has a silicone rubber plug. Other than when the solenoid is energized, the compressed spring biases the core downward so that the surface of the plug is in sealing engagement with the ends of the tubes. A leak at either end increases the pressure in the chamber, resulting in increased sealing force of the plug...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{low-power}} microelectronics and sensor {{technologies have}} enabled {{the creation of}} sophisticated environmental monitoring systems capable of operating on battery power. Independence from a power <b>outlet</b> <b>connection</b> opens up many new potential applications, but limited battery life still imposes significant restrictions on a monitoring system’s capabilities {{and the number of}} systems that can be economically deployed and maintained. These restrictions have motivated much research into reducing monitoring system energy usage, increasing battery capacity, and harnessing alternative energy sources. While most of the research focuses on new system design, {{there is a need for}} techniques to extend the battery-powered operating time of existing environmental monitoring systems without compromising their sensor data quality. This thesis explores and develops methods for extending the operating time of an existing airquality monitoring system. The system contains seven environmental sensors that create a substantial energy demand and make long-term battery operation challenging. The resulting hardware and firmware modifications doubled the system’s battery-powered operating time without significantly reducing its environmental measurement data quality. The addition of an external battery sized to match the system’s form factor increased operating time well past the goal for the intended application. Although the modifications and results presented in this thesis are specific to one environmental monitoring system, the same techniques could be applied to other monitoring systems and to embedded systems in general...|$|E
40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} {{of a study}} of 83 necropsied hearts with atresia of the right atrioventricular orifice. It is emphasised that right atrial or atrioventricular orificial atresia is a better term to describe this anomaly than "tricuspid atresia". Use of the latter term can be confusing when the morphologically tricuspid valve is located beneath the left atrium. It is accepted that the definition employed may include {{cases in which the}} mitral valve may be atretic, blocking normal exit from the right atrium, but it is argued that such cases would present clinically as "tricuspid atresia" and therefore are correctly designated as right atrial orificial atresia. The results show that the majority of hearts with right atrial orificial atresia have the ventricular morphology of primitive ventricle, most with, but a few without an outlet chamber. However, in a minority of hearts an imperforate membrane interposes between the right atrium and a formed but hypoplastic right ventricle. In two of the hearts, the imperforate membrane showed features of Ebstein's malformation. The hearts could be further subdivided according to the ventriculoarterial connection. Most had normally connected arteries (66 of 83), and all but 2 also had normal relations between the arteries; in these 2 hearts there was "anatomically corrected malposition". Twelve hearts showed transposition, one had double-outlet outlet chamber, and another persistent truncus arteriosus. The remaining 3 hearts, all without outlet chamber, had by definition a double <b>outlet</b> <b>connection.</b> A segmental approach provides the best way of classifying this anomaly, and an embryological explanation is offered for the variations in anatomy observed...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} an optrode sensing device that utilizes a polymerized colloidal array (PCCA) photonic crystal material. This array diffracts {{light in the}} visible spectral region due to the periodic spacing of colloidal particles. The PCCA changes diffraction wavelength due to binding of Pb 2 + to an 18 -crown- 6 ether molecular recognition agent. This optrode consists of a probe assembly that contains the PCCA Pb 2 + sensing film. An inexpensive, commercial diode array spectrometer and a fiber-optic reflectance probe monitors the wavelength of light back diffracted by the PCCA. Liquid inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>connections</b> are provided to introduce the sample solution and to exchange out nonbinding ions. In low ionic strength solutions, diffraction wavelength shifts are actuated by the binding of the Pb 2 + to the crown ether to immobilize the Pb 2 + counterions. In these low ionic strength solutions, a Donnan potential forms to cause an osmotic pressure, which swells the PCCA {{in proportion to the}} number density of bound Pb 2 +. This Donnan potential disappears at high ionic strengths. Thus, no response of the PCCA occurs. Our optrode design allows for the fast removal of nonbound ions from the PCCA by washing with pure water. Since the bound Pb 2 + ions have a slow off rate from the crown ether, the bound Pb 2 + PCCA diffraction transiently red shifts during washing, directly in proportion to the sample Pb 2 + concentration. This transient diffraction red-shift can be used to quantitatively determine Pb 2 + concentrations in high ionic strength solutions such as bodily fluids...|$|R

40|$|Hydrologic {{connectivity}} among wetlands {{is poorly}} characterized and understood. Our inability to quantify this connectivity compromises {{our understanding of}} the potential impacts of wetland loss on watershed structure, function and water supplies. We develop a computationally efficient, physically based subsurface–surface hydrologic model to characterize both the subsurface and surface hydrologic connectivity of geographically isolated wetlands and explore the time and length variations in these connections to a river within the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Despite a high density of geographically isolated wetlands (i. e., wetlands without surface inlets or <b>outlets),</b> modeled <b>connections</b> show that these wetlands are not hydrologically isolated. Subsurface connectivity differs significantly from surface connectivity in terms of timing and length of connections. Slow subsurface connections between wetlands and the downstream river originate from wetlands throughout the watershed, whereas fast surface connections were limited to large events and originate from wetlands located near the river. This modeling approach provides first ever insight on the nature of geographically isolated wetland subsurface and surface hydrologic connections to rivers, and provides valuable information to support watershed-scale decision making for water resource management...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{remains one}} of the main causes of human death around the globe. The {{mortality}} rate for patients infected with active TB goes beyond 50 % when not diagnosed. Rapid and accurate diagnostics coupled with further prompt treatment of the disease is the cornerstone for controlling TB outbreaks. To reduce this burden, the existing gap between detection and treatment must be addressed, and dedicated diagnostic tools such as biosensors should be developed. A biosensor is a sensing micro-device that consists of a biological sensing element and a transducer part to produce signals in proportion to quantitative information about the binding event. The micro-biosensor cell considered in this investigation is designed to operate based on aptamers as recognition elements against Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted protein MPT 64, combined in a microfluidic-chamber with inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>connections.</b> The microfluidic cell is a miniaturized platform with valuable advantages such as low cost of analysis with low reagent consumption, reduced sample volume, and shortened processing time with enhanced analytical capability. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the flooding characteristics of the encapsulated microfluidic cell of an existing micro-biosensor using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. The main challenge in the design of the microfluidic cell lies in the extraction of entrained air bubbles, which may remain after the filling process is completed, dramatically affecting the performance of the sensing element. In this work, a CFD model was developed on the platform ANSYS-CFX using the finite volume method to discretize the domain and solving the Navier–Stokes equations for both air and water in a Eulerian framework. Second-order space discretization scheme and second-order Euler Backward time discretization were used in the numerical treatment of the equations. For a given inlet–outlet diameter and dimensions of an in-house built cell chamber, different inlet liquid flow rates were explored to determine an appropriate flow condition to guarantee an effective venting of the air while filling the chamber. The numerical model depicted free surface waves as promoters of air entrainment that ultimately may explain the significant amount of air content in the chamber observed in preliminary tests after the filling process is completed. Results demonstrated that for the present design, against the intuition, the chamber must be filled with liquid at a modest flow rate to minimize free surface waviness during the flooding stage of the chamber...|$|R
