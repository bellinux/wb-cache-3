Wireless communications has already radically changed the way not only Americans but people the world <b>over</b> <b>communicate</b> {{with each other and}} access and share information, and there appears no end in sight to this fundamental shift in communication markets. Although the wireless communications phenomenon is global, the US has played and will continue {{to play a major role}} in the shaping of this market. At the start of a new US Administration and important changes in the FCC, it is most appropriate that this proceeding be launched. ...|$|E

On average, 85 percent of a programmer's time is spent communicating with people, while only 15 percent is spent communicating with the computer. Maintenance programmers spend 50 to 60 percent of their time trying to understand the code they have to maintain and a software program will have, on average, 10 generations of maintenance programmers in its lifetime.|$|R

[...] The reasons for the change are disputed; but may reflect awareness of the reservations being expressed as to the capability of the German signatories to agree the provisions of the full text; or otherwise the continued uncertainty <b>over</b> <b>communicating</b> the 'dismemberment clause' to the French. [...] But that did mean that the text as signed at Reims had not been agreed in advance with the Soviet High Command.|$|R

One should be courteous while <b>communicating</b> <b>over</b> the web and should respect others' time and resources. Also, one should be considerate with a novice computer user.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} we {{address the issue of}} condentiality of {{information}} in the context of downgrading systems i. e. systems admitting information ow between se-crecy levels only through a downgrader. Inspired by the intuition underlying the usual de nition of admissible information ow, we propose an analogue based on trace equiv-alence as developed in the context of concurrency theory and on a modication of the usual denition of purge function. We also provide unwinding conditions to guarantee a consistent and complete proof method in terms of communicating transition systems. We take advantage of this framework to investigate its compositionality issues w. r. t. the main operators <b>over</b> <b>communicating</b> transition systems. We conclude the article with a short presentation of this work's most promising aspects in the perspective of future developments...|$|R
