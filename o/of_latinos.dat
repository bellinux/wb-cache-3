40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} and consequences <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> political {{representation in the}} field of K- 12 education. The first task is to examine the association between Latino population and the Latino presence on school boards. We then investigate if Latino representation is affected by the electoral structure of school boards, as scholars have reached differing conclusions on whether at-large and ward systems hinder or enhance minority descriptive representation. The next step exam-ines the consequences <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> representation, specifically whether board membership is associated with the share <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> school administrators and teachers. The regression results show that Latino population positively affects Latino board representation, but that at-large systems hinder descriptive representation. The primary determinant <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> administrators is Latino school board member-ship, and the primary determinant <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> teachers is Latino administrators. In sum, at-large elec-tions negatively influence Latino educational representation, which produces a ripple effect that ultimately reduces the share <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> teachers. Latinos are now the largest minority group in the United States, but numbers alone are no guarantee of political influence. The traditional view of how minori-ties gain access to the benefits of the U. S. political system is via education, bu...|$|R

5|$|The Latino {{community}} was deeply {{affected by the}} news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations <b>of</b> <b>Latinos</b> held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both {{the media and the}} Latino community. Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E

50|$|Debates on the {{academic}} and institutional location <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> Studies continue to present day: while some scholars strive to maintain Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs that explore the exceptionality of national experiences, in the context <b>of</b> a globalizing <b>Latino</b> diaspora and diversifying Latino student populations at U.S. universities, many others support the notion <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> Studies as an “umbrella” field designed to explore pan-Latino experiences and histories that transcend nation-bound analytical frameworks introduced by pioneering Chicano and Puerto Rican studies programs. Yet others advocate for the absorption <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> Studies into broader comparative disciplines such as ethnic studies, American studies, and Latin American Studies. Accordingly, the status <b>of</b> <b>Latino</b> Studies significantly differs from institution to institution in terms of nomenclature, pedagogical practice, and disciplinary location—with examples ranging from degree-granting autonomous departments to interdisciplinary (and multidisciplinary) programs to university-affiliated research centers.|$|R

Although in 2005 Latinos made up 28 percent of the New York City's total population, they made up 42 percent of its poverty population.

Because {{of the limitations of}} second-ary data, we also illustrate the growth <b>of</b> the <b>Latino</b> population with evidence from Nebraska and a selected area of the state. Data analysis suggests that population estimates <b>of</b> the <b>Latino</b> population generated by the US Bureau of the Census do not accurately reflect the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>Latino</b> population growth in the region.
