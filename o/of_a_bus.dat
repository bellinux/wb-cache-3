5|$|One day, while {{travelling}} {{around the}} city with his police officer-friend Balaji, Jagadish witnesses the explosion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bus</b> {{in which they had}} travelled. He manages to capture the man who laid the bomb, but he escapes from the hospital where he was kept under custody. Jagadish captures the bomber again, and also forces the police officer who helped the bomber's escape, to commit suicide. Jagadish soon learns that the bomber is a mere executor, a sleeper agent, whose only role was to plant the bomb. He also discovers that the Islamic terrorist group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, which the bomber belongs to, has planned various such attacks in the city in a couple of days. Enlisting the help of his fellow army men and Balaji, Jagadish manages to thwart these attacks and kill the sleeper cell leader's brother and eleven other terrorists, including the previously captured sleeper agent.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top deck <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bus</b> as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} after {{violence}} broke out in Benghazi, Owumi {{received a call from}} his teammate Moustapha Niang, who said that Elturki would attempt to help the two players escape the country. Elturki had arranged for a car to take them to an Egyptian refugee camp in Sallum, following Al-Nasr coach Sherif Azmy. Owumi passed through several rebel checkpoints and arrived at the Egyptian border in 12 hours. Both Owumi and Niang, due to their appearance, were suspected of being foreign mercenaries fighting for Gaddafi and were subject to harsher treatment. Without proper immigration papers, Owumi was held in Sallum for three days. He was arrested and then imprisoned in solitary confinement for two hours. When he was removed, he had to sleep outside for three days. Owumi and Niang finally escaped the camp {{in the middle of the}} night. They bribed the driver <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bus,</b> which only allowed Egyptian citizens, to help them leave. At around this time, Owumi received a call from Azmy, who wanted to meet him in his home in Alexandria. As a result, he convinced the driver, who was headed to Cairo, to lead them to another bus to Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Child labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4â€“16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child labour. The employers also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bus</b> transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated small amount of child labour in cottage and house hold industries.|$|E
