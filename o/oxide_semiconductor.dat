We used soft x-ray spectroscopy to fully determine the location {{and nature of the}} impurity levels responsible for the extraordinarily large (similar to 1 eV) band gap reduction of noncompensated codoped rutile TiO 2. It is shown that Cr/N codoping strongly enhances the substitutional N content, compared to single element doping. The band gap reduction is due to the formation of Cr 3 d(3) levels in {{the lower half of the}} gap while the conduction band minimum is comprised of localized Cr 3 d and delocalized N 2 p states.

40|$|THESIS 7463 Among {{various types}} of <b>semiconductors,</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>semiconductors</b> are the most {{promising}} host compounds to realise high Curie temperatures with transition metal doping. Room temperature ferromagnetism in dilute <b>oxide</b> <b>semiconductors</b> was first reported in anatase and rutile phases of Ti 02 doped with Co in 2001. Various other transition metal doped <b>oxide</b> <b>semiconductors</b> (SnO 2, ZnO) {{have been reported to}} be ferromagnetic at room temperature. High temperature ferromagnetism is not expected in these materials because the magnetic doping level is far below the cation percolation threshold Xp needed for long-range order based on superexchange or double exchange interactions. These reports were greeted with scepticism, and the belief that the data somehow reflected the presence of secondary ferromagnetic phases rather than intrinsic long range ferromagnetism. The possibility of an extrinsic origin for the ferromagnetism, such as ferromagnetic impurity segregation, could not be ruled out in some cases. To understand better the origin of the magnetism in these novel magnetic systems we have carried out careful systematic analysis of three systems; [...] 1.
