5|$|Engineers from AG Weser, UB-45s German builder, {{inspected}} the hulk {{and determined that}} repair of the wreck was feasible. A restoration of the submarine to <b>operating</b> <b>condition,</b> as either a training vessel or a military, would cost 21 million leva (about US$250,000 in 1936 dollars), significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ($680,000 to $790,000) that a comparable new submarine would cost. Ultimately, the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair UB-45. UB-45s deck gun was reused, however, {{and one of the}} U-boat's diesel engines was restored to <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> and used on the training ship Assen.|$|E
40|$|Keywords：Energy measurement; AC power meter; {{electronic}} type {{electric energy}} meter; <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> Abstract. The verification of electronic type electric energy meter is under strict reference conditions, but some special <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> at locale will exceed the standard scopes. In {{order to improve}} the calculation accuracy and operating reliability of electric energy meter under <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{it is necessary to}} study the <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> According to the working principle and the standard verification regulation of electronic type electric energy meter, this paper summarizes these operating conditions: low power factor, harmonic waves, dynamic impulsive load, voltage fluctuation and outside magnetic field of power frequency, then analyzes the causes of <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and their influence on electronic type electric energy meter, eventually lays foundation for thorough and systematic study of electric energy meter in the <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> and establishes measurement center database of <b>operating</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

The tramway opened for trials in 1973 and was officially opened in 1974 by Harry Bowey, mayor of Salisbury, and Frank Kneebone, Minister for Lands, to coincide with St Kilda's centenary. In 2001 a large additional museum building was completed to house the increasing number of donated trams.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy the Concorde at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E
40|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>conditions</b> in {{off-grid}} {{renewable energy}} systems (RES) vary significantly in different applications and locations. To describe RES and the <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> of their components {{it is useful}} to define categories of similar <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Categories can also be used for lifetime considerations of RES components, for making recommendations and for analysing the properties and performance of a RES and its components. Categories support system designers and an economic analysis. This paper describes the process and the results of creating RES categories of similar <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> for batteries. Categories are defined {{in such a way that}} batteries belonging to the same category are subjected to similar <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and a similar combination of stress factors. The results provide a comprehensive overview of battery <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> in existing off-grid renewable energy systems.

40|$|Practical {{aerodynamic}} design problems must {{balance the}} goal of performance optimization over a range of on-design <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> {{with the need to}} meet design constraints at various off-design <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Such design problems can be cast as multipoint optimization problems where the on-design and off-design <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> are represented as design points with corresponding objective/constraint functions. Two methods are presented for obtaining optimal airfoil designs that satisfy all design objectives and constraints. The first method uses an unconstrained optimization algorithm where the optimal design is achieved by minimizing a weighted sum of the objective functions at each of the <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> To address the competing design objectives between on-design and off-design <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> an automated procedure is used to efficiently weight the off-design objective functions so as to limit their influence on the overall optimization while satisfying the design constraints. The second method uses the constrained optimization algorithm SNOPT, which allows the aerodynamic constraints imposed at the off-design <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> to be treated explicitly. Both methods are applied to the design of an airfoil for a hypothetical aircraft where the problem is formulated as an 18 -point multipoint optimization. I...|$|R
40|$|Liberalisation of {{electricity}} markets, changing {{patterns in the}} generation and use {{of electricity}} and new technologies {{are some of the}} factors that result in increased uncertainty about the future <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> of our power system. In this context, planning for future investments in power system requires careful selection and assessment of future <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> This paper revisits the notion of power system adequacy and highlights the need for consideration of some factors that have hitherto tended not {{to be part of a}} transmission expansion planning process, in particular in respect of the credible range of possible values of system <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and transitions between successive operating states. Firstly, we present some definitions of power system operational regions. Secondly, we present a stochastic optimisation model that measures the adequacy of a transmission network for given future <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Uncertainties in demand and generation are modelled using a large number of scenarios. The optimisation model identifies the critical future <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> needing the special attention of a power system planner. The proposed model is simulated on a 39 -bus network, whereby it is shown that this model can identify critical <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> that need the attention of a system planner...|$|R
5|$|The {{landing craft}} used {{included}} twelve actual World War II examples, 10 LCVPs and 2 LCMs, standing {{in for the}} British LCAs that the Ranger Companies rode in to the beach during Operation Overlord. The filmmakers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect {{of blood in the}} seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive in <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> The Tiger I tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old, but functional, Soviet T-34 tanks. The two vehicles described in the film as Panzers were meant to portray Marder III tank destroyers. One was created for the film using the chassis of a Czech-built Panzer 38(t) tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III; the other was a cosmetically modified Swedish SAV m/43 assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.|$|E

40|$|The rotating-wall perfused-vessel (RWPV) bioreactor, {{used for}} both {{microgravity}} and Earth-based cell science experiments, is characterized {{in terms of}} the fluid dynamic and fluid shear stress environment.

The effects of changes in <b>operating</b> <b>conditions,</b> including rotation rates and fluid perfusion rates, are investigated with the numerical model. The <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> typically used for ground-based experiments (equal rotation of the inner and outer cylinders) leads to flow patterns with relatively poor mass distribution characteristics. Approximately 50 % of the inlet-perfused fluid bypasses the bulk of the fluid volume and flows to the perfusion exit.
