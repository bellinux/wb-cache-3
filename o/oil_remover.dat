30|$|Waste food (WF) was {{collected}} from a restaurant located in ChengDu, China. Waste cooking oil (hereby {{referred to as}} FOG) was separated using an <b>oil</b> <b>remover,</b> then precipitated FOG for 48  h to make particulate precipitation, after that filtered to remove bubbles and solid and then stored at 4  °C. The pretreated FOG with density of 0.928  g mL− 1 were used as the raw material for anaerobic fermentation. The seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic digester that was used for treating WF at 35  °C. Before being loaded into reactors, the sludge was filtered through a 2 -mm stainless steel sieve. The volatile solids (VS) concentration of sludge was 20 [*]±[*] 1  g VS L− 1.|$|E
40|$|A biosurfactant termed arthrofactin {{produced}} by Arthrobacter species strain MIS 38 was purified and chemically characterized as 3 -hydroxydecanoyl-D-leucyl-D-asparagyl-D-threonyl-D- leucyl-D-leucyl-D-seryl-L-leucyl-D-seryl-L-isoleucyl-L-isoleucyl-L-as paragyl lactone. Surface activity of arthrofactin was examined, with surfactin as a control. Critical micelle concentration values of arthrofactin and surfactin were around 1. 0 x 10 (- 5) M and 7. 0 x 10 (- 5) M at 25 degrees C, respectively. Arthrofactin {{was found to}} be five to seven times more effective than surfactin. The minimum surface tension value of arthrofactin was 24 mN/m at a concentration higher than the critical micelle concentration. According to the oil displacement assay, arthrofactin was a better <b>oil</b> <b>remover</b> than synthetic surfactants, such as Triton X- 100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Arthrofactin {{is one of the most}} effective lipopeptide biosurfactants...|$|E
40|$|Have {{you ever}} been to a general store in West Texas? They have {{everything}} from horse feed to can openers. The tough part is finding it. You approach the store manager and first ask him how everything is going and how his family is. Then he asks you about yours. Within a few minutes, he asks what he can do for you. When you ask for an <b>oil</b> filter <b>remover,</b> he responds, “I am sure we have one here somewhere. ” You get your <b>oil</b> filter <b>remover</b> and go on your way. I go to general stores because I like the culture there. It is one of respect for its customers and respect for its employees. Evidently, many other people like it too. Every Saturday, the place is packed. If you are in a hurry, they will surely slow you down, but they will demonstrate respect. Believe it or not, there is a business lesson here. It is a lesson on business culture, and here are some tips on how to turn your culture into a competitive advantage. Every Company Has a Culture Every company has a culture. It is reflected in the way people do business every day with customers, suppliers, and most importantly, with each other. Culture is the set of values that guide people’s behavior in the workplace. It drives how they determine if people are more important than profits, if profits are more important than people or if nobody cares one way or the other. For better or worse, a company culture will inevitably develop in your company. The question you must ask is whether you are developing your culture consciously or are backing into it by default. Culture Starts with Value...|$|R
40|$|Glauconite is a greenish ferric-iron {{silicate}} mineral with micaceous structure, characteristically {{formed in}} shallow marine environments. Glauconite {{has been used}} as a pigmentation agent for <b>oil</b> paint, contaminants <b>remover</b> in environmental studies and a source of potassium in plant fertilizers, and other industries. Koppeh-dagh basin is extended in Iran, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan countries and Glauconite units exist in this basin. In this research for enhancing and mapping glauconitic units in Koppeh-dagh structural zone in north east of Iran, remote sensing techniques such as Spectral Angle Mapper classification (SAM), band ratio and band composition methods on SPOT, ASTER and Landsat data in 3 steps were applied...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the high}} degree of {{toxicity}} (Smith 1968, Simpson 1968) of BP 1002, Gamlen <b>Oil</b> Spill <b>Remover,</b> Dasic Slickgone and other "detergents" used in Cornwall to combat pollution from Torrey Canyon oil, it was considered desirable to investigate the toxicity of a compound marketed as an oil dispersant under the brand name "Corexit 7664 ", claimed by the manufacturers to be non-toxic to marine fauna. It is produced by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and marketed in the U. K. by the Esso Petroleum Company. It is stated by the manufacturers to be a non-ionic surfactant, soluble in fresh water, 5 % NaCL solution and isopropanol, and dispersible in fuel and crude oils. It contains no organic halides or heavy metals. The investigations reported in this paper were made in two experiments. In the first, the toxic effects of straight dilutions of Corexit in seawater were assessed. In the second, the toxicity of Corexit-dispersed crude oil was compared with that of crude oil alone, with an attempt to imitate conditions at low tide on a polluted beach. The first experiment was carried out in Bantry, Co. Cork, using material collected locally. The second experiment was carried out in the laboratory of the Fisheries Division, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the material was collected at Sandycove, eight miles south of Dublin...|$|R
