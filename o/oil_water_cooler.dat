50|$|Five-stroke {{engine is}} {{currently}} a concept engine invented by Gerhard Schmitz in 2000. Schmitz's concept is being developed by Ilmor Engineering. Ilmor's prototype is an internal combustion engine uses a solid cylinder block with electric motors driving the <b>oil</b> and <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> pumps. The prototype uses two overhead camshafts with standard poppet valves. The Five-stroke prototype engine is turbocharged. The goal of the five-stroke engine is to have higher efficiency with lower fuel use. To increase efficiency a secondary cylinder is added as an expansion processor to extract more energy from the fuel.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 91 - 98 Two {{coatings}} {{have been}} developed for petrochemical compressor antifouling and corrosion resistance purposes. One is a multilayer composite coating with a modified polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) impregnated organic topcoat, which gives it superior antifouling performance to the similar coating that has been used by the compressor original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The other is a high-phosphorous electroless nickel plating, which has been widely used as a corrosion resistant coating, but newly been employed by the authors? companies for antifouling purpose. Both coatings have demonstrated excellent antifouling performance, while the electroless nickel has shown to be much more forgiving to the washing and cleaning injections that have caused erosion damage and chemical attack to the composite coating. Therefore, the electroless nickel is considered as a very attractive alternative coating to the PTFE impregnated composite coating system, especially in such cases where the <b>oil</b> washing, <b>water</b> <b>cooling,</b> and/or chemical cleaning injections have to be carried on in the process...|$|R
50|$|The BT3's design {{followed}} on from Motor Racing Developments' {{two previous}} Formula Junior cars. Although the monocoque-chassied Lotus 25 {{had been introduced}} by Team Lotus earlier in the 1962 season, designer Ron Tauranac erred {{on the side of}} strength and safety in the BT3's design and kept to established Formula One practice in almost all technical specifications. Tauranac based the car around an exceptionally stiff, steel-tubed spaceframe chassis, which he reasoned would be easier to repair than a monocoque, and was closer to what MRD were selling to customers at the time. Also in contrast to Lotus practice were the BT3's internal dimensions, which provided a comparatively comfortable and spacious driving environment for the pilot, with <b>oil</b> and <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> pipes run outside the cockpit to keep heat to a bearable level. The chassis was clothed in a fibreglass body shell, which was painted in a bright turquoise shade with a metallic gold stripe running down the centre.|$|R

A 6-bit byte, {{as opposed to the}} 8-bit byte in common use today, was common in IBM and other scientific computers of the time. The address space provided a maximum of 256K words. The prototype was equipped with 128k words (48 bits plus two parity bits) of memory that was <b>oil</b> and <b>water</b> <b>cooled.</b> Also considered as part of the memory subsystem in that they were addressed via fixed reserved memory addresses, were 4 48 position switch banks, in which a short program could be inserted, and a plug panel, similar to the one used in IBM Unit-Record equipment, that had the capacity of 32 words, so longer bootstrap or diagnostic programs could be installed in plug panels which could then be inserted into the receptacle and used as a primitive ROM. The memory had a cycle time of 2.5 microseconds, and the lack of memory management was a limitation in the computer.|$|R

5|$|In 1992, Caltrans {{released}} the first feasibility study detailing {{the possibility of}} electrifying the railroad between San Francisco and San Jose. The 1992 Feasibility Study proposed replacing the existing diesel-electric locomotives with either a fleet of EMD AEM-7 electric locomotives to move the existing gallery passenger cars or Metro North Budd M-2/M-4 EMUs. The primary benefits of an electrified railway would be improvements in air quality, noise, and acceleration, but would also save on other ancillary costs, such as lubricating <b>oil,</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water,</b> maintenance, and refueling. Because of the relatively close spacing between stops, the improved acceleration using electric locomotives compared to the existing diesel-electric locomotives would cut transit time between San Francisco and San Jose by up to twelve minutes, and using EMUs would cut the time over the same distance by up to 23 minutes, assuming the use of ten-car trainsets. The 1992 Feasibility Study recommended the use of electric locomotives and 25kV AC overhead lines as the most cost-effective alternative, since the gallery cars, which had been built in 1985, were then relatively new and could be reused.|$|R

500|$|Water-based lubricants, called emulsions, are {{the most}} [...] used type of lubricant, because of health, environmental, and safety reasons. Unlike {{solvent-based}} lubricants, if water is properly treated to remove all minerals from it, it will not leave any by-product in the dies. If the water is not properly treated, then the minerals can cause surface defects and discontinuities. There are four types of water-based lubricants: <b>oil</b> in <b>water,</b> <b>water</b> in <b>oil,</b> semi-synthetic, and synthetic. <b>Oil</b> in <b>water</b> is the best, because when the lubricant is applied, the <b>water</b> <b>cools</b> the die surface by evaporating while depositing the oil, which helps release the shot. A common mixture {{for this type of}} lubricants is thirty parts water to one part oil, however in extreme cases a ratio of 100:1 is used.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} poor machinability, {{titanium}} alloys {{need to be}} worked at low cutting speeds to prevent a fast tool failure caused by the very high temperatures that are reached at the tool-chip interface. As demonstrated by previous works by the authors, an improvement of productivity for Titanium alloys {{can be obtained by}} adopting cryogenic cooling during the machining operations. The present work shows the features of a toolholder specifically designed for cryogenic adduction in turning operations, following Hong’s design guidelines. The paper compares tool life results between traditional and cryogenic rough turning by adopting Grade 5 titanium as the working material. Rough turning is economically more relevant to the machining industry, especially in the aerospace field where generally a large quantity of rough material has to be removed due to the very high buy-to-fly ratio of aerospace components. A full factorial experimental plan was performed basing on typical rough turning parameters. Machining outputs such as forces, roughness, temperatures, friction coefficients were calculated in order to define statistical differences between cryogenic cooling method using the special toolholder and traditional <b>oil</b> <b>water</b> emulsion <b>cooling</b> system. Furthermore, thanks to tool life results the Taylor’s law for cryogenic and traditional cases was calculated and an hypothetical production scenario for Ti 6 Al 4 V parts was analysed. An analytical model to calculate production costs and time was built for both cooling methods. A 4 -turrets turning centre was considered and cooling methods and costs per hour of machine tool were taken into account in a cost model. The results show that the benefits in terms of tool life offered by liquid nitrogen cooling allows to improve productivity by adopting higher optimal cutting parameters. This improvement, coupled to an increase of tool life, is very significant and allows not only to reduce time of production but also to cover the major costs of liquid nitrogen and have a slight reduction of machining total costs...|$|R
