60|$|In {{the plant}} world, {{substitution}} often takes place far more rapidly. I doubt whether the stinging nettle, which renders picnicking a nuisance in England, is truly indigenous; certainly the two worst kinds, the smaller nettle and the Roman nettle, are quite recent denizens, never straying, {{even at the}} present day, far from the precincts of farmyards and villages. The shepherd's-purse and many other common garden weeds of cultivation are of Eastern origin, and came to us at first with the seed-corn and the peas from the Mediterranean region. Corn-cockles and corn-flowers are equally foreign and equally artificial; even the scarlet poppy, seldom found except in wheat-fields or around waste places in villages, has probably followed the course of tillage from some remote and ancient Eastern origin. There is a pretty blue veronica which was unknown in England some thirty years since, but which then began to spread in gardens, and {{is now one of}} the commonest and most troublesome weeds throughout the whole country. Other familiar wild plants have first been brought over as garden flowers. There is the wall-flower, for instance, now escaped from cultivation in every part of Britain, and mantling with its yellow bunches both old churches and houses and also the crannies of the limestone cliffs around half the shores of England. The common stock has similarly overrun the sea-front of the Isle of Wight; the monkey-plant, originally a Chilian flower, has run wild in many boggy spots in England and Wales; and a North American balsam, seldom cultivated even in cottage gardens, has managed to establish itself in profuse abundance along the banks of the Wey about Guildford and Godalming. One little garden linaria, at first employed as an ornament for hanging-baskets, has become so common on old walls and banks as to be now considered a mere weed, and exterminated accordingly by fashionable gardeners. Such are the unaccountable reverses of fortune, that one age will pay fifty guineas a bulb for a plant which the next age grubs up unanimously as a vulgar intruder. White of Selborne noticed with delight in his own kitchen that rare insect, the <b>Oriental</b> <b>cockroach,</b> lately imported; and Mr. Brewer observed with joy in his garden at Reigate the blue Buxbaum speedwell, which is now the acknowledged and hated pest of the Surrey agriculturist.|$|E

50|$|To thrive, {{cockroaches}} need a {{place to}} hide. They prefer warm places and a relatively high humidity; they also need a source of food/liquid. The optimum temperature for <b>oriental</b> <b>cockroaches</b> is between 20 and 29 C. Female <b>oriental</b> <b>cockroaches</b> have vestigial tegmina (reduced fore wings) and males have longer tegmina. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal. <b>Oriental</b> <b>cockroaches</b> can be elusive in that a casual inspection of an infested dwelling during the day may show no signs of roach activity. <b>Oriental</b> <b>cockroaches</b> can be found in usually damp places such as sewer pipes, sink drains, and any other form of damp areas in households.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oriental</b> <b>cockroaches</b> can {{be harder}} {{to get rid of}} than other roaches. Although adults can be fairly easily killed by the {{application}} of residual insecticide, the insecticides can get washed away, and two months later females can hatch new nymphs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Oriental</b> <b>cockroaches</b> tend {{to travel}} {{somewhat}} {{more slowly than}} other species. They are often called [...] "waterbugs" [...] since they prefer dark, moist places. They can often be found around decaying organic matter, and in sewers, drains, damp basements, porches, and other damp locations. They can be found outside in bushes, under leaf groundcover, under mulch, and around other damp places outdoors. They are major household pests {{in parts of the}} Northwest, Midwest, and Southern United States.|$|R

50|$|The Turkestan {{cockroach}} {{was first}} {{noticed in the}} US in 1978, around the former Sharpe Army Depot in California, followed shortly after by appearances at Fort Bliss in Texas and several other military bases. Researchers believe the species arrived on military equipment returning from central Asia, perhaps Afghanistan. Since then the species has been rapidly replacing the common <b>oriental</b> <b>cockroach</b> (Blatta orientalis) in urban areas of the southwestern US “as the most important peri-domestic species”, with advantages of laying more eggs and maturing more quickly than the <b>oriental</b> <b>cockroach.</b> “They typically inhabit in-ground containers such as water meter, irrigation, and electrical boxes, raises of concrete, cracks and crevices, and hollow block walls.” They are well established in the Southwest {{and parts of the}} Southeast, and {{have been reported in the}} Northeast.|$|E
60|$|The true Paradise Birds are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fruits and insects--of the former preferring the small figs; of the latter, grasshoppers, locusts, and phasmas, {{as well as}} {{cockroaches}} and caterpillars. When I returned home, in 1862, I was so fortunate as to find two adult males of this species in Singapore; and as they seemed healthy, and fed voraciously on rice, bananas, and cockroaches, I determined on giving the very high price asked for them--£100.--and {{to bring them to}} England by the overland route under my own care. On my way home I stayed a week at Bombay, to break the journey, and to lay in a fresh stock of bananas for my birds. I had great difficulty, however, in supplying them with insect food, for in the Peninsular and <b>Oriental</b> steamers <b>cockroaches</b> were scarce, and it was only by setting traps in the store-rooms, and by hunting an hour every night in the forecastle, that I could secure a few dozen of these creatures,--scarcely enough for a single meal. At Malta, where I stayed a fortnight, I got plenty of cockroaches from a bake-house, and when I left, took with me several biscuit-tins' full, as provision for the voyage home. We came through the Mediterranean in March, with a very cold wind; and the only place on board the mail-steamer where their large cage could be accommodated was exposed to a strong current of air down a hatchway which stood open day and night, yet the birds never seemed to feel the cold. During the night journey from Marseilles to Paris it was a sharp frost; yet they arrived in London in perfect health, and lived in the Zoological Gardens for one, and two years, often displaying their beautiful plumes to the admiration of the spectators. It is evident, therefore, that the Paradise Birds are very hardy, and require air and exercise rather than heat; and I feel sure that if a good sized conservators` could be devoted to them, or if they could be turned loose in the tropical department of the Crystal Palace or the Great Palm House at Kew, they would live in this country for many years.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oriental</b> <b>cockroach</b> (Blatta orientalis), {{also known}} as the waterbug, is a large species of cockroach, adult males being 18 - 29 mm and adult females being 20 - 27 mm. It is dark brown or black in color and has a glossy body. The female has a {{somewhat}} different appearance from the male, appearing to be wingless at casual glance, but is brachypterous, having non-functional wings just below her head. She has a wider body than the male. The male has long wings, which cover two-thirds of the abdomen and are brown in color, and has a narrower body. Both sexes are flightless. The female <b>oriental</b> <b>cockroach</b> looks somewhat similar to the Florida woods cockroach, and may be mistaken for it. Originally endemic to the Crimean Peninsula and the region around the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, its distribution is now cosmopolitan.|$|E
50|$|This wasp reproduces {{by laying}} {{eggs in the}} egg cases, or oothecae, of {{cockroach}}es. The wasp larvae use the cockroach eggs as a food source. Host cockroaches include the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), Australian cockroach (P. australasiae), brown cockroach (P. brunnea), <b>Oriental</b> <b>cockroach</b> (Blatta orientalis), whitemargined cockroach (Melanozosteria soror), and harlequin cockroach (Neostylopyga rhombifolia).|$|E

50|$|Males {{are dark}} brown; {{the sides of}} the thorax and the front half of the wings are margined with yellow. Adult males are fully winged, while females have {{conspicuous}} wing pads (actually short wings like that of the female <b>oriental</b> <b>cockroach),</b> which are functionless. Wings of the male are longer than its body, while wing pads of the female cover only one-third to two-thirds of the abdomen. The males fly swiftly but do not have the ability to sustain themselves in the air for long periods.|$|E
50|$|Signs of {{cockroaches}} {{are their}} oothecae, which are “egg cases”. The blackish-brown oothecae of the <b>oriental</b> <b>cockroach</b> are 10 - 12 mm long, with indistinct egg compartments housing 16-18 eggs. These oothecae are formed {{a day after}} mating, and typically deposited {{a day or two}} after formation, though can be deposited up to 7 days later, typically in a sheltered area or attached to a substrate by oral secretion. They are initially a yellow white, turning reddish- then blackish-brown. They lose viability at temperatures below 0 C. They hatch on their own in about 42 days at 29.5 C and 81 days at 21 C.|$|E

40|$|Crickets: identification, damage, and control. Crickets {{belong to}} the order Orthoptera, most members of which have {{enlarged}} hind legs, adapted for jumping. In addition, {{members of this group}} possess opaque, leather-like forewings that cover a pair of clear, membranous hindwings. Most crickets are nocturnal, whereas their grasshopper cousins are active only during the daytime. Members of the cricket family usually have very long antennae and their wings have the front margin folded sharply {{over the side of the}} body, giving them a 2 ̆ 2 boxlike 2 ̆ 2 appearance. Female crickets are characterized by having long, spear-shaped ovipositers, used for egg-laying. Crickets are sometimes confused with cockroaches, especially the <b>Oriental</b> <b>cockroach,</b> often referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 water bug. 2 ̆ 2 Crickets may be distinguished from cockroaches by their enlarged hind legs and the fact that their bodies are not flattened from top to bottom like those of cockroaches...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two mixed-age (semi-natural) {{populations of}} the <b>Oriental</b> <b>cockroach</b> Blarra orienralis were {{established}} in identical artificial domestic environments contained in steel freight containers. Each population was allowed a 10 week period of acclimation, during which the populations were monitored using Roatel traps. Subsequently, one population was treated with two point sources (filter papers) impregnated with 750 mg of the insect juvenile hormone analogue S-hydroprene and 150 mg of the anti-oxidant butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT). The other (control) population was exposed to point sources impregnated with BHT only. Each source was suspended from the ceiling under a cockroach-proof guard to ensure that physical contact with cockroaches could not occur. Treatments were repeated at six monthly intervals throughout the experiment. Changes in these populations were monitored for approximately two years by trapping every two weeks with live catch Roatel traps. On each occasion, trapped cockroaches were counted, the sexes of adults determined, and adults were examined for external deformities. Trapped nymphs were assigned to 1 of 3 arbitrary size catagories (small, medium or large). Subsequently all trapped insects were released back into their respective containers. In addition, at monthly intervals, 20 adult females {{were randomly selected from}} the trapped insects and confined with several trapped males until ten oothecae had been produced. The viability and numbers of nymphs emerging fro...|$|E
