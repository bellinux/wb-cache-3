5|$|In 1887, {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted <b>on,</b> <b>then</b> passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton {{was president of the}} new organization, but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.|$|E
5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied <b>on,</b> <b>then</b> observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E
5|$|Former Indian player Prabhakaralso {{publicly}} {{claimed that}} Kapil wanted {{to throw away}} a match against Pakistan. Prabhakar's allegations against an unknown team member was not new as he made these allegations to a magazine The Outlook in 1997 based on which BCCI instituted the Chandrachud Inquiry, a one man commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Prabhakar did not reveal names or provide evidence of his charges (match fixing and phone tapping allegation <b>on</b> <b>then</b> cricket manager Ajit Wadekar). When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The reaction of the Indian public resulted in PILs and International Cricket Council and the BCCI were called to respond in the Delhi and Calcutta High Courts. In response to the crisis, the Indian government initiated a CBI inquiry on 28 April 2000. Former BCCI President Inderjit Singh Bindra revealed on 4 May 2000 that Prabhakar told him that Kapil asked him to throw away the match. During the ensuing exchanges between various parties, Kapil Dev broke down {{in an interview on}} BBC's Hard Talk with Karan Thapar.|$|E

25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents.
