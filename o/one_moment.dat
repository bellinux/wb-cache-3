5|$|I now intervened {{to settle}} this dispute, at <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> quite heated. I told the fire-brigade officer on my {{authority}} as Home Secretary {{that the house was}} to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to prevent the conflagration from spreading.|$|E
5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at <b>one</b> <b>moment,</b> Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Reso made a {{one night}} return to TNA at Slammiversary {{pay-per-view}} under his old ring name, Christian Cage, {{to announce the}} number <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> in TNA history as voted by the TNA fans (Sting's 2006 return in the aforementioned Final Resolution tag team main event). This {{was part of a}} deal, which, in return, WWE were able to use Ric Flair in programming and induct him into the WWE Hall of Fame {{as a member of the}} Four Horsemen stable.|$|E

5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that <b>one</b> <b>moment.</b> So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E
6000|$|Almost {{at the end}} of the volume, in a {{very brief}} chapter, called ``Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation,'' Marx allows <b>one</b> <b>moment's</b> glimpse of the hope that lies beyond the present horror:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My daughter,' {{answered}} the emperor, 'what {{you say is}} true. Never have you given me <b>one</b> <b>moment's</b> pain. Yet now you cannot help me. Ah! why {{is not one of}} you a boy!' ...|$|R

25|$|On January 3, Noriega {{attended}} Holy Mass in the Nuncio's {{chapel and}} took communion; where Laboa's homily {{was about the}} thief on the cross who in <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> asked God to change his life, and reportedly brought tears to Noriega's eyes.|$|E
25|$|The non-Euclidean planar algebras support {{kinematic}} geometries in the plane. For instance, the split-complex number z = eaj {{can represent}} a spacetime event <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> {{into the future}} of a frame of reference of rapidity a. Furthermore, multiplication by z amounts to a Lorentz boost mapping the frame with rapidity zero to that with rapidity a.|$|E
25|$|In {{all this}} his {{ultimate}} purpose remained mysterious. At <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> he secretly encouraged {{the demands of}} the Royalist City of London, at another he urged submission to the existing parliament, then again he refused to swear an oath abjuring the House of Stuart and further he hinted to the Rump of the Long Parliament the urgent necessity of a dissolution.|$|E

25|$|The Ekavyāvahārika sect {{emphasized}} the transcendence of the Buddha, asserting {{that he was}} eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavyāvahārika, {{the words of the}} Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> of insight. According to the Mahīśāsaka sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Each unique {{character}} {{requires a}} master piece of type {{in order to}} be replicated. Given that each letter has uppercase and lowercase forms, and the number of various punctuation marks and ligatures (e.g. the sequence 'fi' combined in one character, commonly used in writing) the Gutenberg Bible needed a set of 290 master characters. It seems probable that six pages, containing 15600 characters altogether, would be set at any <b>one</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whether Adam is the personage that {{we should}} {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many. I do not care for <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> how that is; it is no matter whether we are to consider Him our God, or whether His Father, or his Grandfather, for in either case we are of one species of one family and Jesus Christ is also of our species.|$|E

25|$|During the {{capsizing}} and {{the subsequent}} reporting, the government's announcements, {{as well as those}} from the media, were inconsistent and inaccurate. An editorial in The Huffington Post stated that the governmental reports were like a rubber band, 'increasing at <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> and decreasing at another.' Newspapers such as The JoongAng Ilbo, MBN, and JTBC later made corrections and apologies concerning their earlier reports. Conspiracy theories were also present {{in the aftermath of the}} sinking.|$|E
25|$|Heine's mode was satirical attack: {{against the}} Kings of Bavaria and Prussia (he never for <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> shared {{the belief that}} Frederick William IV might be more liberal); against the {{political}} torpor of the German people; and against the greed and cruelty of the ruling class. The most popular of Heine's political poems was his least typical, Die schlesischen Weber ("The Silesian Weavers"), based on the uprising of weavers in Peterswaldau in 1844.|$|E
25|$|Box to box midfielders {{help with}} almost {{every aspect of}} the game. They need immense stamina as they need to cover most areas of the pitch, as well as some degree of passing skills. They would be up one end of the pitch {{assisting}} the attack <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> then back helping to defend around their own penalty area the next. They normally play as central midfielders but any of the midfield players may have this attribute.|$|E

25|$|He is {{the almighty}} ruler of Avalon. He is never {{referred}} to as anything but his Highness, the king, etc.. {{so it can be}} supposed that he doesn't have a name, just his royal title. The King has varying character traits; he can be annoying and comic at <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> then change to cunning and serious the next. He seems to have a pique interest in Fanta though it has not been fully disclosed as to what interests him so.|$|E
25|$|At <b>one</b> <b>moment,</b> indeed, Charles (then in Bewdley) rose to {{the idea}} of marching north to join Rupert and Newcastle, but he soon made up his mind to return to Oxford. From Bewdley, therefore, he moved to Buckingham, the distant threat on London, {{producing}} another evanescent citizen army drawn from six counties under Major-General Browne. Waller followed him closely. When the King turned upon Browne's motley host, Waller appeared in time to avert disaster, and the two armies worked away to the upper Cherwell.|$|E
25|$|One {{informant}} who {{was close}} to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance. The walls of his home were lined with mirrors and as DeStefano talked to people he continually watched his reflection in those mirrors as he walked across the room. He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E
