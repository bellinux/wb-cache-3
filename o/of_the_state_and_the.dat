5|$|Dairy farming {{has been}} a major sector of Israeli {{agriculture}} since the founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> yield of local milk cows is amongst the highest in the world. Initially, the moshavim (farming cooperatives) and kibbutzim produced mainly soft white cheese as it was inexpensive and nutritious. It became an important staple in the years of austerity and gained a popularity that it enjoys until today.|$|E

5|$|It is {{very rare}} for snow to fall in the U.S. state of Florida, {{especially}} in the central and southern portions of the state. With {{the exception of the}} far northern areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Jacksonville area, most of the major cities of Florida have never recorded measurable snowfall, have only recorded trace (T) amounts, or have only reported flurries in the air, usually just a few times each century. In the Florida Keys and Key West there is no known occurrence of snow flurries since the settlement of the region.|$|E

5|$|The College of Arms {{is a part}} of the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom, as such {{they serve}} the monarch by {{accompanying}} her on various state occasions. These occasions are centred on the institution of the monarchy as the symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> expression of majesty and power through public pomp and ceremony. Presently the heralds turn out their full uniforms only twice a year; during the State Opening of Parliament and during the early summer at the Garter Service at Windsor Castle. The organisation and planning of all State ceremonies falls within the prerogative of the Earl Marshal, the College's chief. As a result, the heralds have a role to perform within every significant royal ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Himalayas lies in {{the north}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bay of Bengal is at the south.

The Siliguri Corridor, which connects North-East India with rest of the India, {{lies in the}} North Bengal region of the state. Geographically, West Bengal is divided {{into a variety of}} regions—Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, Terai and Dooars region, North Bengal plains, Rarh region, Western plateau and high lands, coastal plains, Sunderbans and the Ganga Delta.|$|E

50|$|According to Mark Blyth, <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> {{austerity}} {{emerged in}} the 20th Century, when large states acquired sizable budgets. However, Blyth argues that the theories and sensibilities about <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> capitalist markets which underline austerity emerged from the 17th Century onwards. Austerity is grounded in liberal economics' view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> sovereign debt as deeply problematic.|$|R

5|$|The {{party is}} {{strongly}} individualistic, wanting {{to reduce the}} power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public sector. It believes that the public sector should only be there to secure a minimum standard of living, and that individuals, businesses and organisations should take care of various tasks instead of the public sector, in most cases. The party also generally advocates the lowering of taxes, various duties, as well increased market economy.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Bob flooded {{roads and}} downed trees in Florida. Rough seas broke over sea walls in southwestern parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{combination}} of high tides and heavy rain caused forced {{the closure of}} causeways to Sanibel Island and Marco Island, leaving the islands temporarily isolated. They were re-opened when the waters receded, though the causeway to Sanibel Island sustained some damage. Florida Power & Light Co. reported that 1,200 to 1,500residences were without power on July 23. In Palm Beach County, rainfall from the storm caused agricultural damage.|$|E

5|$|Andrei (Anatoly Solonitsyn), Daniil (Nikolai Grinko) and Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) are {{wandering}} monks and religious icon painters, looking for work. The three represent different creative characters. Andrei is the observer, a humanist who {{searches for the}} good in people and wants to inspire and not frighten. Daniil is withdrawn and resigned, and not as bent on creativity as on self-realization. Kirill lacks talent as a painter, yet still strives to achieve prominence. He is jealous, self-righteous, very intelligent and perceptive. The three have just left the Andronikov Monastery, where they have lived for many years, heading to Moscow. During a heavy rain shower they seek shelter in a barn, {{where a group of}} villagers is being entertained by a jester (Rolan Bykov). The jester, or skomorokh, is a bitterly sarcastic enemy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Church, who earns a living with his scathing and obscene social commentary and by making fun of the Boyars. He ridicules the monks as they come in, and after some time Kirill leaves unnoticed. Shortly, a group of soldiers arrive to arrest the skomorokh, whom they take outside, knock unconscious and take away, also smashing his musical instrument. As the rain has stopped the three monks thank the villagers for allowing them to shelter and continue on their way. As they walk on the heavy rain starts again.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 Albany was {{declared}} the official capital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Legislature made city hall its home {{until the first}} state capitol was opened in 1809. In an effort to move public buildings away from the bustling and expanding waterfront, the new capitol was located atop the State Street hill, on the same land the current building now stands. City surveyor Simeon De Witt, in his , set aside this land as a public square. Also included on this map are depictions of city hall and the new city jail, located at State and Eagle Streets. In 1809, Albany city government moved with the Legislature into the new capitol and remained there until a new city hall was opened in 1832. The old Stadt Huys was eventually demolished after a fire in 1836.|$|E
5|$|In N'Djamena, the {{simultaneous}} presence of two armies—Prime Minister Habré's FAN and President Malloum's FAT—set {{the stage for}} the battle of N'Djamena, which was to bring about the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ascent to power of the Northern elite. A minor incident escalated on 12 February 1979 into heavy fighting between Habré and Malloum's forces, and the battle intensified on 19 February when Goukouni's men entered in the capital to fight alongside Habré. By 16 March, when the first international peace conference took place, an estimated 2,000–5,000 people had been killed and 60,000–70,000 forced to flee. The greatly diminished Chadian army left the capital in the rebels' hands and reorganized itself in the south under the leadership of Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué. During the battle, the French garrison stood passively by, even helping Habré in certain circumstances, as when they demanded that the Chadian Air Force stop its bombings.|$|E

5|$|M-102 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that {{runs along the}} northern boundary of Detroit following 8Mile Road. The highway follows the Michigan Baseline, {{a part of the}} land survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roadway is also called Base Line Road in places. As a county road or city street, 8Mile Road extends both east and west of the M-102 designation, which leaves 8Mile on the eastern end to follow Vernier Road. The western terminus of M-102 is at the junction of 8Mile Road and M-5 (Grand River Avenue) and the opposite end is at Vernier Road and Interstate94 (I-94). The 8Mile Road name extends west to Pontiac Trail near South Lyon with a discontinuous segment located west of US Highway23 (US23). The eastern end of 8Mile Road is in Grosse Pointe Woods near I-94.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{is a state}} {{located in}} the north-central United States. It is usually {{considered}} {{to be in the}} Midwestern region of the country. The state can generally be divided into three geographic regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. Eastern South Dakota is lower in elevation and higher in precipitation than the western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Black Hills are a low, isolated mountain group in the southwestern corner of the state. Smaller sub-regions in the state include the Coteau des Prairies, Coteau du Missouri, James River Valley, the Dissected Till Plains, and the Badlands. Geologic formations in South Dakota range in age from two billion-year-old Precambrian granite in the Black Hills to glacial till deposited over the last few million years. South Dakota is the 17th-largest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the new state was quite small at first {{and there was a}} strong mix between the English-speaking American settlers that dominated in the eastern/northeastern portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Spanish-speaking former Mexicans that dominated in the southern and western portions of the state. Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of Longhorn cattle that roamed the state. Hardy by nature but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity that many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous. While {{in the early days of}} the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the American diet).|$|E
