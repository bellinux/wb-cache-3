50|$|<b>Oblique</b> <b>illumination</b> {{dispersion}} staining {{is the result}} of refraction and the convex shape of most particles. With <b>oblique</b> <b>illumination</b> the beam of light illuminating the sample is directed at an oblique angle through the sample. This enhances the resolution of structural details in the particle that are oriented at right angles to the incident beam of light while sacrificing some of the resolution of features parallel to the direction of the beam. Because of this orientation of the beam the relative refractive index of the particle and the mounting liquid becomes apparent. The wavelengths for which the liquid has the higher refractive index are refracted into the front lens of the objective {{from the side of the}} particle nearest the side from which the light is coming. If the particle has a higher refractive index for all visible wavelengths then this side of the particle is dark. The side farthest from the source of the light shows all the wavelengths for which the particle has the higher refractive index. These effects are seen with the particle in sharp focus. This is a significant advantage over the Becke` line method because the particle doesn’t have to be defocus to see the colors and generally the colors are more distinct than are the Becke` line dispersion colors. The colors seen with this type of {{dispersion staining}} are about the same as those with the Becke` Line method shown in Chart 1. Examples of this type of dispersion staining and the colors shown for different λo’s can be seen at microlabgallery.com site for Becke` Line Dispersion Staining. The presence of two colors helps to bracket the wavelength at which the refractive index matches for the two materials.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{microscopy}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the biological sciences for its ability to enable visualization of biological samples at sub-cellular levels. Many imaging subdivisions exist under this umbrella of general microscopy, and each are tailored towards specific design, contrast, and visualization constraints. Standard examples that have found widespread use include dark-field, phase-contrast, holographic, and fluorescent microscopies. However, a critical factor that physically limits the optical resolution of general microscopy is diffraction. Unfortunately, this “diffraction-limit” can prevent visualization of significant biologically relevant structures, which in turn can limit biological insights. In response to such a limit, several works have advanced the field of sub-diffraction resolution imaging, which consist of optical imaging techniques that seek to achieve imaging resolutions beyond that which is allowed by the diffraction-limit. This set of techniques can largely be divided into two classes. The first class of sub-diffraction techniques is targeted towards cases where the sample is coherently illuminated and diffracts into the imaging system’s aperture. For such cases, synthetic aperture (SA) is a popular choice and operates by using <b>oblique</b> <b>illuminations</b> to spatiotemporally synthesize a wider frequency support into the image than allowed by the diffraction limit. The second class of sub-diffraction techniques, often referred to as "super-resolution" techniques, typically utilize specialized fluorophores with either photoswitching or depletion capabilities. Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) is a super-resolution example that localizes photoswitchable fluorophores to sub-diffraction resolutions per acquisition, before combining into a final super-resolved image. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) is another super-resolution example that spatially modulates its excitation to narrow its optical point-spread-function. Unfortunately, SA and fluorescent super-resolution techniques are generally incompatible for sub-diffraction resolution fluorescent and coherent imaging, respectively – thus, a multimodal sub-diffraction imaging solution compatible with both coherent and fluorescent imaging has remained elusive. 	In this dissertation, we demonstrate that structured illumination (SI) is a sub-diffraction technique compatible with both diffractive and fluorescent imaging. We first develop the theoretical framework that extends SI to coherent imaging and experimentally demonstrate SI’s capabilities for 2 D sub-diffraction resolution imaging of coherently diffractive samples. Sub-diffraction resolution imaging based on scattering intensity and transmission-based quantitative-phase (QP) are shown. In addition, we show extend SI to 3 D coherent imaging, and show applications of this towards 3 D QP and refractive-index (RI) tomography. Finally, we show multimodal applications of SI that allow sub-diffraction resolution fluorescent and coherent imaging, which has great potential utility for the biological sciences.

40|$|Abstract — The spatial {{resolution}} of state-of-the-art {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) sensors enables the structure analysis of urban areas. The appearance of buildings in magnitude images in settlements is dominated by effects of the inherent <b>oblique</b> scene <b>illumination,</b> such as layover, radar shadow and salient lines of bright scattering caused by direct reflection or multipath signal propagation. For example, in urban residential districts often salient pairs of parallel lines of bright magnitude are caused by gable-roofed buildings.

The second line {{can be related to}} signal caused by a dihedral corner reflector built between ground and building wall. In this paper an approach is presented aiming at reconstruction of gable-roofed buildings by knowledge based analysis considering the mentioned SAR-specific effects. The estimation of building height is carried out by the extracted geometric parameters from the amplitude image. The resulting geometric model ambiguity can be solved by comparing simulated and real interferometric phases at the building location.

Such non-periodic and random surfaces can open doors for the design of blazing surfaces beyond typical periodic gratings and their limitations, e. g. reducing and flattening of side-lobe levels, as well as other scattered beam characteristics such as beam-splitting. The theoretical method is verified by full-wave electromagnetic simulations at X-band, and measurements. In the second part, a novel leaky waveguide is proposed which is assisted by metasurfaces. This waveguide can support a half TE 10 mode using a perfect magnetic conductor for one wall, and therefore is more compact in size. The principle of operation and the dispersion diagram are then presented. The structure has the advantage of being simple, low cost, easy to fabricate, and requiring no vias, pins, or dielectric blocks.

40|$|Abstract — The {{improved}} {{ground resolution}} of state-of-the-art {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) sensors suggests utilizing this technique {{for the analysis of}} urban areas. However, building reconstruction from SAR or InSAR data suffers from the consequences of the inherent <b>oblique</b> scene <b>illumination,</b> such as layover, occlusion by radar shadow and multipath signal propagation. Especially in built-up areas, building reconstruction is therefore often impossible from a single SAR or InSAR measurement. But, the reconstruction quality can be significantly improved by a combined analysis of multi-aspect data. In this paper, an approach for the detection and reconstruction of buildings from multi-aspect high-resolution InSAR data sets is proposed. The InSAR data have a spatial resolution of about 30 cm and were taken from two flight directions spanning a difference of about 90 °. The building recognition is supported by knowledge based analysis concerning the SAR-specific effects in urban areas. Frequently observable are lines of bright scattering resulting from dihedral corners between ground and building wall. These lines are part of the building footprint and can be distinguished from other lines of bright scattering using the InSAR heights. They are extracted from the magnitude images in slant geometry and projected into the world coordinate system. Here, due to the orthogonal flight directions, they can be fused to L-structures as base for building recognition. Simulation results are compared with real imagery. The approach is demonstrated for an InSAR data set of a building group in an urban environment...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is known}} that each spinal cord segment {{receives}} thin-fibre inputs from several segmental dorsal roots, it remains unclear how these inputs converge at the cellular level. To study whether C- and Aδ-afferents from different roots can converge monosynaptically on to a single substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurone, we performed tight-seal recordings from SG neurones in the entire lumbar enlargement of the rat spinal cord with all six segmental (L 1 –L 6) dorsal roots attached. The neurones in the spinal cord were visualized using our recently developed <b>oblique</b> LED <b>illumination</b> technique. Individual SG neurones from the spinal segment L 4 or L 3 were voltage clamped to record the monosynaptic EPSCs evoked by stimulating ipsilateral L 1 –L 6 dorsal roots. We found that one-third of the SG neurones receive simultaneous monosynaptic inputs from two to four different segmental dorsal roots. For the SG neurones from segment L 4, the major monosynaptic input was from the L 4 –L 6 roots, whereas for those located in segment L 3 the input pattern was shifted to the L 2 –L 5 roots. Based on these data, we propose a new model of primary afferent organization where several C- or Aδ-fibres innervating one cutaneous region (peripheral convergence) and ascending together in a common peripheral nerve may first diverge at the level of spinal nerves and enter the spinal cord through different segmental dorsal roots, but finally re-converge monosynaptically on to a single SG neurone.

Based on these previous results, we developed a high-resolution X-ray laminography system which uses an optimized thin-film X-ray transmission target together with a modified electron probe micro analyzer. Unlike conventional axial computed tomography (CT), 3 D laminography imaging involves a linear translation of both detector and object {{with respect to a}} stationary point source. In this contribution we present a detailed characterization of the setup concerning especially the laminographic imaging mode. The quality of the volume reconstruction is assessed by simulating an ideal setup with an analytical model including features down to 200 nm which are resolved in the setup given a high enough SNR in the projections. We further address the issue of a drop in the detector resolution under <b>oblique</b> X-ray <b>illumination</b> which is a common problem to such systems. The finite penetration depth of the X-rays into the detector pixels causes an anisotropic blurring of the detector point spread function (PSF) under oblique irradiation.

Our measurements are supported by numerical simulations of the detector MTF.
