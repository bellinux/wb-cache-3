5|$|A grand {{funeral was}} held for the Prince Imperial two days after his death. The streets were crowded with {{ordinary}} people who greatly mourned the prince's death. So remarkable was the event that tourists paid for the privilege <b>of</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> funeral procession from a hotel in downtown Rio de Janeiro.

5|$|In November 1941 the LRDG, {{now under}} {{command of the}} newly formed Eighth Army, moved from Kufra to Siwa (central Libya). The patrols were given the task <b>of</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> desert tracks south of Jebel Akhdar and report any signs of {{reinforcements}} and withdrawals. 'R1' Patrol was to pick up Captain David Stirling and 30 men who had parachuted behind the lines to raid airfields {{to the west of}} Tobruk. Only 21 men arrived at the rendezvous and were returned to the British lines, later becoming the nucleus of the Special Air Service (SAS). One of the other roles assigned to the LRDG was to transport SAS units behind enemy lines; this continued until the SAS were issued with their own transport in 1942. In early November 'T2' Patrol took four British officers to the Gebel and was to return and collect them three weeks later. The officers were the advance land party of Operation Flipper, which had planned to kill General Rommel.|$|E

Sander would be a judge of some competitions between the two such as dancing but on a negative note, he collects tapes of Marc and Amanda and is making a collection of the two fooling around.|$|E

25|$|Murphy dropped one {{suitcase}} bomb each {{on his first}} two bombing runs, both of {{which turned out to}} be duds, and it was his third pass before managed to hit anything: the Mexican custom house near where the crowd of American spectators had formed. The resulting explosion sent small bits of shrapnel and other fragments into the crowd of spectators and caused the American patrons of the bars and clubs on the Mexican side of the border to rush back to their side of the line. Among the casualties were a reporter and a photographer, along with many others, but nobody was killed and all of the injuries were considered minor. After realizing the danger <b>of</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> battle from such a short distance away, the crowd dispersed and went home, some to Fry and Buena.|$|E

500|$|The {{thematic}} {{focus of}} the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote that the experience <b>of</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> film was similar to reading high quality fan fiction; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different. Although {{in both cases the}} story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different. Levi said that [...] "Jones uses Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer in a fairytale format to tell a story about challenging class and gender expectations, Miyazaki uses the same characters to tell a story about personal loyalty, love, and war." ...|$|E
