5|$|The {{impact of}} meat ants on other species varies, {{depending}} on the habitat and type of food source, and the ecological role the ant plays. The deliberate exclusion of meat ants show that not only can they alter the amount of sources available, but the dynamics of resource use on entire outcrops. If present, meat ants rely on rapidly discovering food sources and retain their dominance so other ants cannot collect them, as well as exploitation and interference which helps displace other ants. The habitat meat ants live in may affect their dominance among the fauna. They are less successful in complex habitats and more successful in open areas, allowing workers to forage efficiently; for example, workers forage around rocks and collect food sources more successfully in contrast to those in vegetation. Meat ants are even more dominant than <b>other</b> <b>I.</b> purpureus species group members in non-complex habitats. Meat ants are normally larger than other Iridomyrmex species and can displace or even kill those trying to compete for food sources. The similar behaviours among meat ants and certain Iridomyrmex species have increased the level of conflict among each other, especially those in open habitats.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each <b>other,</b> <b>I</b> lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{notion of}} {{duplicated}} work relies on noticing {{that after the}} first reduction of I I is done, {{the value of the}} <b>other</b> <b>I</b> I can be determined, because they have the same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting II terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of II can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the II term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.|$|E

25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each <b>other.</b> <b>I</b> thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six: [...] " [...] so sweet and honest. And I think, hopefully, when people see our scenes that they’ll get that feeling, too. [...] are so incredibly real with each <b>other.</b> <b>I</b> was really grateful that I got to play those scenes and Libby got to sort of express herself in ways that she hasn’t been able to." ...|$|E

[...] He went on to say, [...] "I just wanted to explore the conflicts between gays and Latinos and gays and blacks ... the real feelings [...] misapprehensions of each <b>other.</b> <b>I</b> realized it wouldn't all be nice and politically correct. If blacks (and Latinos) want my respect, they have to deal with their own homophobia. I'm not playing guilty liberal anymore".|$|E
500|$|Although Waters {{was born}} in Pembrokeshire, Wales, she {{considers}} herself a London writer because of her intense affection for the city, {{due in part to}} her immigration to it. Specifically, Waters is moved by walking through London and seeing remnants of many historical eras: [...] "It's ... almost like it's peopled with ghosts—again, jostling up against each other or passing through each <b>other.</b> <b>I</b> find that very exciting." [...] Her love for the city is apparent to many reviewers. In the Lesbian Review of Books Donna Allegra writes, [...] "he summons the era's attitudes and ambiance projecting them onto the screen of the reader's mind with Dolby wrap-around sound such that you feel you're vacationing on all points between Chelsea and the East End." ...|$|E
500|$|Oh said of Yang's {{expressions}} of emotions during season eight: [...] "You see her express her emotions {{with only two}} people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart {{and then you have}} to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each <b>other.</b> <b>I</b> hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show.

500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected. I mean, we had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year... And then, suddenly, a live date, New York City, Carnegie Hall, the cat pulls two cats who never even saw each <b>other.</b> <b>I</b> mean, you gotta say, 'Is the man mad or is he – he's either mad or extremely subtle." ...|$|E

Still in a rage, he turned to Diệm, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he looked back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Diệm nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied.” ...|$|E

All residents of their Karora village belong to the same clan of Banwala, a Jat community, and marrying within the clan is considered incest. Chanderpati recalled, [...] "We knew about Babli long before they decided to marry each other. She would call up often and I would sermonise to her about staying away from Manoj, fearing the fallout of such an alliance. They were, however, unconcerned and chatted for hours together.

500|$|The band set {{off from}} Macon for New York City in August 1969, and faced {{setbacks}} along the way, {{such as their}} equipment truck breaking down in South Carolina. In addition, they had arranged to work with Cream producer Tom Dowd, who was unavailable; Atlantic Records house engineer Adrian Barber recorded the sessions instead, and was credited as producer. Recalled Dowd, [...] "I {{was supposed to have}} done the first album with the band up in New York, but some way or <b>other</b> <b>I</b> got detoured. Jerry Wexler made a deal to keep them in the studio for three or four days when {{they were supposed to be}} with me." [...] The band had no commercial success in mind, having had troublesome experiences individually in the past with producers and labels that pushed for radio hits. The band felt that with time they would develop a small, devoted following and be strong enough to collect $3–4,000 dollars per night.|$|E
