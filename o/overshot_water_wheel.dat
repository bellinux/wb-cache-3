500|$|Samuel Pratt Winter {{was sent}} to Tasmania by his father, at Bryan's request, {{to act as an}} {{overseer}} of the mill. He managed the mill from 1834, when Bryan went to London {{in the midst of a}} dispute with Governor Arthur, and leased it from 1837 onwards. A post office opened in November 1841, and at the end of the year the village had also four dwellings, a blacksmith shop, a police station, the flour mill and an adobe hotel built by John Archer. While passing through the town Louisa Anne Meredith took note of the buildings. In her guidebook, published in 1843, she referred to the [...] "crazy weather board mill". At the time the mill's motive power came from an <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> supplied with water from the Liffey River via a long wooden trough. St Andrew's church was built in 1843 by Thomas Reibey as a school. The initial church grounds of [...] were donated by Thomas Reibey. [...] Winter was living at the mill cottage in 1846, when he arranged for the old wooden mill to be removed and, with John Kinder Archer, began building the blue-stone mill. The town greatly expanded in the late 1850s, fueled by the efforts of those returning from the Victorian gold fields. Over time many cottages in Carrick were built for workers on the Reibey's Entally House outside nearby Hadspen.|$|E
2500|$|On Dartmoor, blowing {{houses were}} {{rectangular}} buildings between around [...] {{in length and}} around half this in width. They were made of unmortared granite blocks with walls often [...] or more thick and probably had turf or thatch roofs which were periodically burnt to retrieve the particles of tin {{that would have been}} driven into the roof through the blast from the bellows. Blowing houses are typically located on or near the bank of a stream where the fall of water was enough for a leat to be built to work a small (...) diameter <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> which developed around [...] to operate the bellows.|$|E

25|$|Renwick's {{original}} design {{seems to have}} been to have double tracks on all inclined planes, with the descending caisson holding more water, thus, the system would not have needed (theoretically) external power. Nevertheless, the inclined planes were built with <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> to supply power.|$|R
50|$|The mill {{features}} two <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> arranged {{one after}} the other powering the milling machinery in the brick mill building. The main portion of the mill is two stories, with two loft levels under the roof. It is flanked by a one-story section on the east and a two-story portion to the west. The village of Aldie grew up around the mill following its construction.|$|R
2500|$|By 1860, {{the canal}} had been {{progressively}} enlarged {{to allow for}} boats of 70 tons. [...] Traffic reached a peak in 1866, when the canal carried 889,220 tons of freight (equivalent to nearly 13,000 boat loads). Between 1848 and 1860, the original <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> that powered the inclined planes were replaced with more powerful water turbines. The locks and inclines planes were also renumbered, since some had been combined/eliminated.|$|R
50|$|The mill is a {{national}} monument (nr 33588) since 1967. Of the original mill only the millhouse, wooden <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> of 3.9m diameter and 1.2m width, and the mill race remain.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} mill burned {{some time}} during the Civil War. The present mill was constructed in 1863 by Samuel Hardenbergh. In 1887, Hardenbergh sold the mill to Martin Lewis, who replaced the <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> with a more efficient turbine.|$|E
50|$|The Stierbergsteich was artificially {{created in}} order to impound water for an <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> sited further downstream. The wheel drove pumps that lifted pit {{water out of the}} shafts of nearby mines in which red iron ore (haematite was mainly extracted.|$|E
50|$|The roughly 300-year-old {{watermill}} from Iselsberg-Stronach near Lienz in the Tyrol is {{also one}} of the first three mills of the museum and was built here in 1979. It used to stand by a mountain stream in the Lesachtal valley in East Tyrol and is driven on the museum site by a pond. The mill, made of solid larch logs, has two <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> that drive two milling gears.|$|R
5000|$|In 1807/08, Baader {{installed}} another {{machine in}} the Johannis tower of the Palace's northern wing feeding the fountain {{in front of the}} palace (...) [...] It is a comparatively powerful, but compact installation consisting of a series of three <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> in one large frame operating six beams and twelve pumps mounted on this frame. The pressure vessels are rectangular metal boxes put in between the beams and rods.|$|R
25|$|<b>Water</b> <b>wheel</b> {{technology}} {{was developed to}} a high level during the Roman period, a fact attested both by Vitruvius (in De Architectura) and by Pliny the Elder (in Naturalis Historia). The largest complex of <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> existed at Barbegal near Arles, where the site was fed by a channel from the main aqueduct feeding the town. It is estimated that the site comprised 16 separate <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> arranged in two parallel lines down the hillside. The outflow from one wheel became the input {{to the next one}} down in the sequence.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 Daniel Bowman, {{the then}} {{owner of the}} flour mill, built a wooden dam across Canagagigue Creek to create the Floradale mill pond. Because the dam was too high, causing {{flooding}} problems upstream, it was replaced in 1914 by a crescent-shaped cement dam, one of the first. A millrace was constructed under the road to direct the water to the flour mill to operate the <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> In 1964, the millrace was filled in when water {{was no longer the}} major source of power. Although the mill is no longer in operation, a hole in the building’s north wall allows visitors to view the working equipment of what is thought to be Ontario’s last <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> The mill is located at 2239 Floradale Road.|$|E
5000|$|Wassermühle Eilhausen: {{the rubble}} stone {{building}} with timber-framed gables {{may have been}} built in 1698. The <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> has a diameter of 2.6 metres. In the 19th century there were many such mills in Lübbecke. The mill is a waypoint on the Westphalian Mill Route.|$|E
5000|$|Bohrman's Mill is a water-powered {{gristmill}} {{built in}} 1815 in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The mill was located {{outside the town}} of Orwigsburg, along Mahonney Creek, which flows from Second Mountain. The mill was primarily used for grinding corn meal and hulling oats, using a 20-foot <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> later switching to a turbine system.|$|E
25|$|The Scotch (reaction) turbines, {{which later}} {{replaced}} the <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> were 12½ feet in diameter, {{were made of}} cast iron, and could pull the boats up an 11% grade (11 foot rise over 100 feet). The longest plane was the double-tracked Plane 9 West which was 1,510 feet long and lifted boats 100 feet up (i.e. 6% grade) in 12 minutes. The total weight of the boat, cargo, and cradle was about 110-125 tons.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{concentration of}} mechanical power was the Barbegal water mill complex in southern France, {{constructed in the}} early 2ndcenturyAD. Sixteen <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> fed by an arcaded aqueduct branch from the main conduit to Arles produced an estimated 4.5t of flour per 24 hours – an output sufficient to feed 12,500 people or {{the majority of the}} population of Arles. Water mill batteries are also known from Amida in Asia Minor, the Janiculum hill in Rome, and a number of other places throughout the empire.|$|R
25|$|It {{is thought}} that the <b>wheels</b> were <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> with the outflow from the top driving the next one down and so on, {{to the base of}} the hill. Vertical water mills were well known to the Romans, being {{described}} by Vitruvius in his De Architectura of 25 BC, and mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia of 77 AD. There are also later references to floating water mills from Byzantium and to sawmills on the river Moselle by the poet Ausonius. The use of multiple stacked sequences of reverse overshot water-wheels was widespread in Roman mines.|$|R
5000|$|The Steffturbine {{is driven}} by the {{potential}} energy of the water, it operates like an <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> It comprises a conveyor chain equipped with profiled paddles circulating around two wheels. These wheels are arranged so that the flowing water drives the conveyor chain on an inclined plane. [...] Different turbine inclinations are possible.|$|E
50|$|Priston Mill {{was given}} by the monks of Bath Abbey in 931. It {{is powered by a}} 25 ft <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> The present {{building}} dates from the late 18th or early 19th century and is maintained in working condition. The associated tithe barn was built around 1700 and is currently used as a wedding and conference venue.|$|E
5000|$|Construction on {{the first}} mill on this site was begun in 1835. However, the {{construction}} was abandoned until 1842, when a new owner completed the building and installed an <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> [...] A small community, known as Pike's Peak, grew up around the mill. In addition to the mill, Pike's Peak boasted a blascksmith's shop, printing shop, general store, and post office.|$|E

ABSTRACT: The fascinating mechanical inventions aiming at {{the welfare of the}} human kind started from ancient Egyptians and continued development through different eras. In the medieval centuries, the Islamic civilization paid wonderful attention to mechanical engineering. Banu Mosa invented 100 ingenious devices including automatic fountains and automatic feedback level control systems. Al-Jazari invented 50 mechanical devices including automatic fountains, clocks, positive displacement pumps and robotics. Taqi Al-Din invented a 6 -cylinder positive displacement pump. Those great inventers used clean-energy prime movers in the form of windmills, <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> and undershot <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> (turbines). This paper focuses only on windmills, <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> and automatic fountains...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} mill dated from 1732 when James Balguy of Stannington {{leased land}} from the Duke of Norfolk to build a cutlers wheel on the site. Balguy operated the wheel until 1743 when Tobias Andrews took over. The rental records show numerous names as tenants in the ensuing years with the more long standing being the Hawley family, James Colley, J.W. Armitage and J. Shaw. Arnold Wilde was the occupant in 1801 and by 1806 he had purchased the mill outright. In {{the early part of}} the 19th century the mill consisted of three workshops with two <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> which drove two pairs of tilt hammers, two forge hammers and a plating hammer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} was first documented in 1577 as [...] "kleine Müllel im Haslach". Today's {{building was}} constructed in 1688 und was expanded during the last centuries. The mill {{is also known as}} Flocknermuhle (Flöcknermühle) and is private property of the family with the same name since the mid of the 19th century. It was powered by an <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{present day}} {{structure}} {{was built in}} 1882 on {{the foundations of the}} old buildings being constructed from squared gritstone with a slate roof. The building re-opened as a rolling mill being driven by a single <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel.</b> The mill remained water driven until 1956 when it was converted to electricity under the ownership of Kenyon Brothers and Co, Ltd.|$|E
50|$|The {{undershot}} {{water wheel}} and <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheel,</b> both animal- and water-driven, and with either a compartmented body (Latin tympanum) or a compartmented rim, were used by Hellenistic engineers between the 3rd and 2nd century BC. Around 300 AD, the Romans replaced the wooden compartments with separate, attached ceramic pots that were tied {{to the outside of}} an open-framed wheel, thereby creating the noria.|$|E
40|$|Thanks {{to a new}} {{sensibility}} to {{renewable energy}} and to local and smart electricity production, traditional <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> are regarded again as a clean and accessible way for pico-micro hydro electricity generation, especially in presence of very low heads and small flowrates. In particular, among {{the different kinds of}} <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> the <b>overshot</b> ones exploit the lowest flowrates with the highest efficiency (efficiency up to 85 - 90 %). Therefore, {{in order to determine the}} performance characteristics and to estimate the power losses and the output power for <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels,</b> theoretical and experimental analyses are here developed. By a numerical optimization process, the power losses and the mechanical output power are theoretically quantified. A critical angular velocity is also identified (about 65 % of the runaway speed). When the wheel rotation speed approaches the critical velocity, volumetric losses at the top of the wheel begin to increase linearly with the rotational velocity, while the other power losses start to decrease, due to the lower amount of water available to the whee...|$|R
50|$|The Romans {{improved}} crop {{growing by}} watering growing plants using aqueducts. An increasing amount of {{evidence suggests that}} {{some parts of the}} industry were mechanised. For example, extensive sets of mills existed in Gaul and Rome at an early date to grind wheat into flour. The most impressive extant remains occur at Barbegal in southern France, near Arles. Sixteen <b>overshot</b> <b>water</b> <b>wheels</b> arranged in two columns were fed by the main aqueduct to Arles, the outflow from one being the supply to the next one down in the series. The mills apparently operated {{from the end of the}} 1st century AD until about the end of the 3rd century. The capacity of the mills has been estimated at 4.5 tons of flour per day, sufficient to supply enough bread for the 12,500 inhabitants occupying the town of Arelate at that time.|$|R
50|$|Warm Springs Mill, {{also known}} as Miller Mill and Inn at Gristmill Square, is a {{historic}} grist mill complex and national historic district located at Warm Springs, Bath County, Virginia. It was built in 1901, and is a three-story, gable-roofed frame building with an iron <b>overshot</b> Fitz <b>water</b> <b>wheel</b> with the originalmill race.
