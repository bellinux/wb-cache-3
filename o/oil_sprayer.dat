The development of technology biokonversi to produce the vegetable fuel (biofuel) from resources could be renewed now was the main priority. The government announced the plan to reduce the Indonesian dependence on fuel oil (FUEL OIL) by publishing PP Nomor 5 in 2006 about the policy of Nasional Energy. Several researches showed that the sum cetana (CN) biodiesel higher than diesel oil (diesel fuel). The figure cetana in general diesel oil 45, whereas biodiesel 62 to that was based on the oil palm, 51 for the distance of the fence and 62. 7 to that was based on the vegetables coconut [Soerawidjaja, 2003]. His difference that is coconut oil had more oxygen and the value calorie him was lower than diesel fuel, so as to make the process of the burning to coconut oil more perfect and clean. Beside the surplus on coconut oil also had the weakness that is in the use of coconut oil could come closer together so as menyumbat the pipe channel, the filter and especially to the sprayer or nosel. The burning of oil also was able to be not burnt perfect, so as to cause many smokes and to enable the occurrence of carbon sediment on the end the <b>oil</b> <b>sprayer.</b> The success parameter of early of the research pembakaan diffusion of coconut oil was miyak the coconut could be burnt, from results of the research menunjukan that in the pressure 25 C coconut oil could have been burnt but just a few coconut oil that was burnt, that was caused because the low temperature will result in oil that dikabutkan by nosel too few and finally seldom also oil that reacted with oxygen from air that was the condition for the occurrence of the burning. From results of the research could be concluded that coconut oil could be burnt in the temperature of space or the temperature of 25 C.

2500|$|The King George Vs {{were the}} first British battleships to {{alternate}} engine rooms and boilers in the machinery spaces, which reduced the likelihood of one hit causing the loss of all power. The machinery was arranged in four engine (turbine) rooms and four boiler rooms, with the 8 machinery compartments alternating in pairs of engine or boiler rooms. Each pair of boiler rooms formed a unit {{with a pair of}} engine rooms. Nominal full power was 110,000 shaft horsepower at 230 rpm with [...] steam at [...] The machinery was designed to operate at an overload power of 125,000 shp and Prince of Wales [...] "...main machinery steamed at overload powers of 128,000 to 134,000 shaft horsepower with no difficulties..."

The Admiralty boilers operated very efficiently and similar boilers of nearly identical power, fitted to [...] during her rebuilding in 1937, achieved a full power specific fuel consumption [...] of 0.748lb per shp on trials which compared favourably with contemporary battleships. During full power trials on 10 December 1940, King George V at 41,630 tons displacement achieved 111,700 shp at 230 rpm and a specific fuel consumption of 0.715lb per shp. [...] After 1942 the Royal Navy was forced to use fuel oils with considerably higher viscosity and greater seawater content than these boilers could efficiently use. The poor quality of the oil fuel combined with the seawater contamination to reduce the efficiency of the steam power plant and increased the maintenance required. [...] By 1944 the specific full power fuel consumption had increased to 0.8lb per shp and boiler maintenance was becoming increasingly difficult. The Admiralty had been aware of this problem and were designing new types of <b>oil</b> <b>sprayers</b> and burners that could burn the available fuel oil much more efficiently, and sometime after 1944, Duke of York and Anson were fitted with new, higher pressure, <b>oil</b> <b>sprayers</b> and burners that restored the boilers to full efficiency. These same <b>oil</b> <b>sprayers</b> and burners were used in [...] along with other detail improvements so that Vanguard achieved a full power specific fuel consumption of 0.63lb per shp while using the same steam pressures and temperatures as used on the King George V class.|$|R

The Russians did not believe that superfiring turrets offered any advantage, discounting the value of axial fire and believing that superfiring turrets could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast problems. They also believed that distributing the turrets, and their associated magazines, over the length of the ship improved the survivability of the ship. Sixteen 4.7 in 50-caliber Pattern 1905 guns were mounted in casemates as the secondary battery intended to defend the ship against torpedo boats. She completed with only a single 3 in 30-caliber Lender anti-aircraft (AA) gun mounted on the quarterdeck. Other AA guns were probably added during the course of World War I, but details are lacking. Conway's says that four 75 mm were added to the roofs of the end turrets during the war. Four 17.7 in submerged torpedo tubes were mounted with three torpedoes for each tube.|$|R
40|$|This Bureau of Mines {{investigation}} addressed {{two primary}} issues of air velocity measurement in mines: the determination {{and use of}} correction factors, {{and the development of}} guidelines for the selection of a suitable site at which the measurements should be taken. Other facets of the investigation included a comparison of measurement methods and devices, and aircourse cross-sectional area measurement. The study consisted of theoretical, laboratory, and in- mine investigations. The measurement devices included in the experimental phase were vane anemometer, vortex shedding anemometer, a prototype thermoanemometer, smoke tube, and <b>oil</b> of wintergreen <b>sprayer.</b> The measurement methods included single-point centerline, timed-point traverse, continuous traverse for the anemometers, and various distances and cloud positions for the smoke tube and oil of wintergreen devices. The study resulted in guidelines for measurement site selection that are applicable to most in-mine situations. It also showed that the use of correction factors is problematic. There are many potential pitfalls and there are cogent arguments against using certain correction factors. However, generalized correction factors were developed that can be successfully applied in routine ventilation work, provided that their use is properly understood.
