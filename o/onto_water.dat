5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated {{from an area}} of convection that emerged <b>onto</b> <b>water</b> after sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an {{area of low pressure}} that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved slowly to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.|$|E
500|$|Contrastingly, {{the climactic}} musical {{sequence}} during which [...] "I See the Light" [...] is performed by Rapunzel and Flynn, {{commonly referred to}} as the [...] "lantern sequence", has fared significantly better than the song itself, garnering widespread acclaim from film critics. Keith Uhlich of Time Out described the scene as [...] "especially wonderful", while Digital Spys Simon Reynolds similarly hailed it as one of the film's most [...] "striking moments". Although Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies wrote that, lyrically, [...] "I See the Light" [...] is [...] "nothing special", she went on to praise the scene, describing it as a [...] "treat ... that will clinch it for romantics and 3D tech-heads alike." [...] Radio Times Alan Jones labeled the sequence one of the film's [...] "most beautifully uplifting moments". Similarly, Christian Blauvelt of Slant Magazine highlighted the scene as one of Tangleds [...] "few moments of otherworldly beauty". A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, [...] "A scene of paper lanterns descending through mist <b>onto</b> <b>water</b> is especially breathtaking, partly because it departs from the usual 3-D insistence on deep focus and sharply defined images, creating an experience that is almost tactile in its dreamy softness." ...|$|E

2500|$|The roadway, {{which was}} {{formerly}} part of MD 806, continues north as municipally-maintained Frederick Road through a commercial area. [...] Frederick Road intersects Thurmont Boulevard, which heads west to a diamond interchange with US 15. [...] The old highway crosses Hunting Creek and turns north <b>onto</b> <b>Water</b> Street {{to pass through}} downtown Thurmont. [...] At MD 77 (Main Street), the old alignment becomes a state highway again as part of MD 550, which heads east with MD 77 along Main Street and north along Church Street, which passes under the Maryland Midland Railway. [...] The Church Street portion of MD 550 is also signed as MD 806. [...] The next official segment of MD 806 (officially MD 806R) begins at MD 550 and follows Emmitsburg Road northeast to the northern border of Thurmont. At this point, MD 806R ends and Emmitsburg Road continues north as a county road.|$|E

50|$|Oviposition {{site and}} behavior: females oviposits alone but with male in attendance. Eggs are laid in flight by dipping abdomen <b>onto</b> <b>water</b> surface. They hatch after {{five or six}} weeks and the larvae live {{partially}} hidden by bottom debris. They emerge {{after two or three}} years.Larvae prefer bottom areas rich in vegetation and decaying plant material. The main flight period is June and July.Males characteristically perch horizontally on exposed surfaces. They fly swift and low, skimming the water surface, while defending their territories. Mating can occur in flight or on land.|$|E

50|$|The {{scene where}} Sarah pushed Walker was filmed {{at the top}} floor of the London Ark; the {{producers}} thought that particular building was suitable to carry out the scene. The stunt took three hours to set up. To use Protheroe as much as possible, a breakaway balcony was used. The stunt was performed by Gordon Seed, who performed an 80-foot fall before, but <b>onto</b> <b>water.</b> Because of the building's layout, it was impractical to use wires, so Seed had to perform a free fall onto an air bag at the bottom. Beforehand, a weights were dropped down until the crew were satisfied Seed would survive the fall. Four separate camera angles were used to shoot the scene.|$|E

25|$|While Bartlett {{continued}} his desperate manoeuvre, the ship listed more and more. The other crew members began {{to fear that}} the list would become too large, and {{so they decided to}} put the first lifeboat <b>onto</b> the <b>water</b> without waiting for the order to do so. Bartlett then decided to stop the ship and her engine. However, before he could do so, two lifeboats were put <b>onto</b> the <b>water</b> on the port side. The still-turning propellers sucked the two lifeboats into it, crushing them along with their passengers. Bartlett was then finally able to stop the propellers before they could suck in another lifeboat.|$|R

5000|$|Slavic folk {{religious}} {{festivals and}} rites reflect {{the times of}} the ancient Pagan calendar. For instance, the Christmas period is marked by the rites of Koliada, characterised by the element of fire, processions and ritual drama, offerings of food and drink to the ancestors. Spring and summer rites are characterised by fire- and water-related imagery spinning umbe the figures of the gods Yarilo, Kupala and Marzanna. The switching of seasonal spirits is celebrated through the interaction of effigies of these spirits and the elements which symbolise the coming season; for instance by burning, drowning or setting the effigies <b>onto</b> <b>water,</b> and the [...] "rolling of burning wheels of straw down into rivers".|$|E

50|$|Atahensic (also called Ataensic) is an Iroquois sky goddess {{that fell}} to the earth {{at the time of}} creation. According to legend, on earth a tree broke and left {{a hole in the ground}} leading to the centre of the earth. Atahensic fell from the sky and before falling into the hole left by the tree, she was carried down by the wings of birds. After her fall the birds brought her down the hole <b>onto</b> <b>water.</b> A giant turtle then emerged from the water {{underground}} and carried her to the surface on the hole. She then gave birth to Earth Mother. Earth Mother gave birth to Hahgwehdiyu and Hahgwehdaetgah, twin sons. (Good Twin and Evil Twin, Evil twin killed Earth mother by bursting out of her side during child birth.) Atahensic is associated with marriage, childbirth, and feminine endeavors in general.|$|E

From then until 1922, the Society manufactured medicinal and pharmaceutical products at their Hall, and sold some of their products from a retail outlet opening <b>onto</b> <b>Water</b> Lane (now Blackfriars Lane). Much of the manufactured drugs were to supply clients of the Society which included the Navy, the Army, the East India Company and the Crown Colonies.A major restoration and (external) building programme was carried out in the 1780s. Although the hall underwent further redevelopment in the 1980s, its appearance has altered little since the late-eighteenth century.|$|E

50|$|Mining {{becomes a}} very {{energy-intensive}} activity {{as soon as}} excavation extends any significant distance underground. In the Upper Harz, vein mining (Gangerzbergbau) was the main form of extraction, with excavation following the near-vertical lodes straight down into the earth. Only a few metres down the ingress of water increased the difficulty of excavation considerably. Initially it was mopped up using men standing on ladders, the so-called Wasserknechten ("water servants"), with their leather buckets. Later, the introduction of horses and whims (Göpel) enabled larger quantities of water to be lifted. But horses were expensive {{and had to be}} changed every few hours. As a result, mines - particularly the richer, deeper ones - started to use hydropower systems, able to work continuously, 24 hours a day. To do this, streams were diverted <b>onto</b> <b>water</b> wheels that drove reciprocating pumps in order to raise water from greater depths and in greater quantities. The principle was to raise water with water.|$|E
