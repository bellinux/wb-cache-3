5|$|Bennett was {{selected}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1999 National Football League Draft. As a rookie in 1999, Bennett missed seven games due to a knee injury. After undergoing surgery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> he missed all of the 2000 season. In 2001, New York expected Bennett to work in tandem with Tiki Barber but after suffering a hamstring injury, he was released on September 3, 2001. After multiple injuries to their running backs, the Giants became interested in re-signing Bennett but because of NFL rules {{they were unable to}} do so until January 2002. During this time period, he was offered contracts by the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins but rejected both hoping to return to the Giants. He re-signed with the Giants on January 16, 2002. During the season, Bennett was returned to the wide receiver position he played in high school, due to multiple injuries suffered by the Giants players in that position. He was waived on December 4, 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 1967–68, {{his second}} season, {{injuries}} limited Orr to just 46 {{games in which}} he scored 11 goals and had 20 assists. Prior to the season, Orr had injured his right knee during a charity game in Winnipeg during the summer requiring five weeks in a cast. In December, a Frank Mahovlich check caused a fracture of Orr's collar bone and a shoulder separation. Orr returned in January in time {{to play in the}} NHL All-Star Game, his first of eight appearances overall. Orr had to sit out five games afterwards due to soreness in his left knee. In February, he had to leave a game against Detroit after his left knee went stiff. He would receive the first of his many operations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> repairing ligament and removing cartilage. Orr did return to finish the season, but required an operation during the off-season to remove a bone chip. Despite the injuries, Orr won the first of a record eight consecutive Norris trophies and was named to the NHL's First All-Star team and finished fourth in the voting for the Hart Trophy.|$|E

25|$|The Blue Jays opened August with a 7–6 {{loss to the}} Royals. Ben Revere and Mark Lowe {{made their}} debuts with Toronto, with the latter {{allowing}} 3 runs in 1 inning pitched to take the loss. To close out the series, the Blue Jays and Royals played a heated game on August 2. Royals starter Edinson Vólquez intentionally hit Josh Donaldson with a pitch in the first inning, and both benches were warned by home plate umpire Jim Wolf. In his next at-bat, Volquez narrowly missed hitting Donaldson in the head, but was not ejected. Later, Troy Tulowitzki was hit by Royals reliever Ryan Madson, who followed with another pitch that just missed hitting Donaldson in the face. Manager John Gibbons was ejected for arguing with Wolf, while Madson remained in the game. In the following inning, Aaron Sanchez hit Alcides Escobar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> with an inside pitch and was ejected, which lead to a bench-clearing argument on field, with Blue Jays bench coach DeMarlo Hale also being ejected. The Blue Jays would win the game, 5–2, taking 3 of 4 from the AL-leading Royals.|$|E
25|$|Giants backup catcher Ken Kato was at {{the center}} of a {{controversial}} call the next inning. With a runner on first base, Kato was preparing to lay down a sacrifice bunt. After Tadano's first pitch, Kato dropped to the ground holding his head, apparently indicating that he had been hit. Home plate umpire Koichi Yanada awarded Kato first base and ejected Tadano for a dangerous pitch. He was the first player in Japan Series history to be removed from a game for a dangerous pitch. Replays clearly showed, however, that the pitch did not hit Kato, who sold the umpire on a hit by pitch in a move similar to simulation in football, flopping in basketball, or embellishment in ice hockey, all of which are punishable in their respective sports. The game taking place in Hokkaido, Fighters fans booed intensely during Kato's remaining two at bats later in the game. Fighters manager Hideki Kuriyama ran onto the field and argued with Yanada that Kato had not been hit, but the call stood. In the top half of the fifth inning, a pitch hit Hisayoshi Chono <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and he had to leave the game.|$|E
25|$|Tebow started against Kentucky despite {{suffering}} from a respiratory illness and taking two bags of intravenous fluids before the game. He ran for two touchdowns {{to put him in}} 2nd place on the all-time SEC touchdown list and he also threw for a touchdown. Late in the third quarter, he was hit in the chest by Kentucky defensive end Taylor Wyndham, fell backwards, and hit {{the back of his head}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> of Florida tackle Marcus Gilbert, who was wearing a hard knee brace. Upon impact, Tebow briefly displayed a prominent fencing response with his left arm, indicating that a concussion had taken place. He lay motionless for several minutes before being helped to the sidelines, where he vomited. He was taken by ambulance to the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center. A CT scan showed no bleeding in the brain, with the injury described as a mild concussion. Coach Urban Meyer stayed the night in the hospital with Tebow, who was discharged in the morning. Coincidentally, Florida did not have a game scheduled for the following Saturday, and Tebow was cleared to play in the Gators' next contest at LSU on October 10, two weeks after the incident.|$|E

She was with the Bundesliga club TV Langen for five years, and the Germany women's national basketball team for nine years, playing 204 international games. She injured her right knee in a game in Saarlouis in 1995. After a series of X-rays, scans and MRIs, she had surgery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> at [...] in Berlin.

500|$|In the {{painting}} Virgin and Child with St. Anne the composition again {{picks up the}} theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as [...] "breathtakingly beautiful" [...] and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle.

She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.|$|E
500|$|In 1968–69, Orr {{skipped the}} {{pre-season}} {{to rest the}} knee but was in uniform for the season start. He required an ice pack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> after every game and missed nine games after he caught a skate in {{a crack in the}} ice, twisting his knee. He returned to the lineup and finished the season playing through the pain, sometimes struggling to get up to speed and relying on teammates instead of making the plays himself. In other games, Orr was outstanding, scoring his first career NHL hat trick on December 14 against Chicago, adding two assists for a five-point night. He scored 21 goals on the season, breaking the goal scoring record for a defenceman, and totalled 64 points to set a new point scoring record for one season for a defenceman. [...] He again won the Norris Trophy while nabbing a First-Team All-Star selection and finishing third in the Hart Trophy balloting.|$|E

500|$|Bosanquet {{is remembered}} as the {{inventor}} of the googly, a delivery designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, {{it appears to be a}} leg break, but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to that expected, behaving as an off break instead. However, Bosanquet was a pace bowler in his university days. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his bowling from this period as [...] "very useful... but that was all, and had he kept to his original style real distinction at cricket would only have come to him through his batting". Furthermore, he disliked bowling quickly, believing he was destined only to be used as a last resort and that he would have little success as a fast bowler. Consequently, Bosanquet decided to change his style. According to his own account, his inspiration came in the mid-1890s, from a table-top game he often played called Twisti-Twosti; the object was to bounce a tennis ball on a table so that it could not be caught by an opposing player. Bosanquet began to experiment with ways of throwing the ball so that, after pitching, it turned and spun in an unexpected direction, without his opponent detecting any difference in the delivery. Finding he could do this successfully, he began to practise using the same method to bowl in a form of soft-ball cricket and then in the cricket nets with a hard ball, but did not at the time take his discovery seriously. It was not until 1899 or 1900 that Bosanquet began to practise in earnest, and developed an orthodox leg break in the nets to complement his new style of delivery, which spun in the same direction as an off break. During the lunch breaks in Oxford matches, he would often bowl to the best opposing batsmen in the nets, delivering several leg breaks, followed by an off break, without changing his bowling action; the ball would sometimes hit the bemused batsman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> to the amusement of spectators. A slightly different version of events was provided by the son of Louise Bosanquet, Bernard's cousin, who claimed in 1965 that Bosanquet conceived the idea in 1890 and practised bowling to Louise with a tennis ball from 1893 onwards. There were later suggestions that other cricketers invented the googly before Bosanquet. In 1935, Jack Hobbs wrote that Kingsmill Key, a former captain of Surrey, told him that the googly was invented by an Oxford student, Herbert Page, in the 1880s. Key claimed that Page bowled the delivery regularly, but never used it in a first-class match.|$|E
