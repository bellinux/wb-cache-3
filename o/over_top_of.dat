25|$|Around 500 {{million years}} ago, {{a chain of}} {{volcanic}} islands shaped like an arch collided with proto North America. The islands rode <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the North American plate. This created the highlands in western Morris County and the eastern section of Morris County.|$|E
25|$|Around 400 {{million years}} ago, a small {{continent}} {{that was long}} and thin collided with proto North America. This created the Kittatinny Mountains, as the land was compressed from the collision. The quartzite that was lying in a shallow sea <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Martinsburg shale, folded and faulted due to pressure and heat. The quartzite lifted, thus the Kittatinny Mountain was born.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Revolution {{brought with}} it the {{expansion}} of the railroad, and great palatial urban terminals sprang up in major cities. Architect F. H. Kimbal of the Wilson Brothers Architecture & Engineering firm designed the Reading Railroad's headhouse terminal in 1891, prior to its opening in 1893. The rails were elevated to reach the train shed platform built <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the new consolidated market, which opened a year earlier. George McKay was chosen to be the market's first superintendent while the building was undergoing its final phase of construction.|$|E

25|$|Three plays {{after the}} kickoff, Eagles quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 75-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Donté Stallworth to give his team a 7–6 lead. The Saints responded with a 78-yard drive, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown run by Bush to retake the lead at 13–7. However, the Eagles stormed right back, driving 80 yards in 11 plays. On third down and goal, running back Brian Westbrook took a handoff and jumped <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the defensive line and fell {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown, giving them a 14–13 lead with 50 seconds left in the half. New Orleans returner Michael Lewis returned the kickoff 25 yards to their 35-yard line. With two seconds left, quarterback Drew Brees threw a Hail Mary pass to the end zone. Wide receiver Marques Colston initially caught the ball, but it squirted out of his arms as he fell to the ground, and was ruled an incompletion.|$|E

500|$|With the {{increased}} popularity of ransomware on PC platforms, ransomware targeting mobile operating systems has also proliferated. Typically, mobile ransomware payloads are blockers, {{as there is}} little incentive to encrypt data since it can be easily restored via online synchronization. Mobile ransomware typically targets the Android platform, as it allows applications to be installed from third-party sources. The payload is typically distributed as an APK file installed by an unsuspecting user; it may attempt to display a blocking message <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> all other applications, while another used a form of clickjacking to cause the user to give it [...] "device administrator" [...] privileges to achieve deeper access to the system.|$|E

2500|$|Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) started {{operation}} of its mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted {{on a commercial}} scale from the Athabasca Oil Sands by surface mining. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden muskeg (peat bog) <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically [...] deep, {{sitting on top of}} flat limestone rock. Originally, the sands were mined with draglines and bucket-wheel excavators and moved to the processing plants by conveyor belts.|$|E

In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden muskeg (peat bog) <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically [...] thick deposits of crude bitumen embedded in unconsolidated sandstone, {{sitting on top of}} flat limestone rock. Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) started operation of the first large-scale oil sands mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale and the volume has grown at a steady rate ever since.|$|E
2500|$|The Miami and Erie canal became {{obsolete}} as a {{means of}} transportation, and was abandoned by the city in 1877. The canal was like an open sewer within the city, as sanitation systems were limited. In 1920 the city drained the canal and began construction of the Cincinnati Subway in the canal bed. Central Parkway, which follows the path of the canal, runs <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the subway system's tunnels. [...] Construction of the subway stalled halfway through the project, as the city was overcome by unexpected inflation following World War I. Distractions by the Great Depression, World War II, and subsequent popularity of the automobile prevented the city from ever gaining enough local support to finish it.|$|E

The artwork was created by the band's longtime collaborator Kamikene of the group Hatos, who coincidentally was in Germany when the band asked him to create the artwork. The German translation was offered by a German contact Kamikene had, after letting them listen to the song. The photo of Yamaguchi was taken late at night in Yamaguchi's own apartment, an idea which came from the photographer, who wanted to take candid photos of Yamaguchi to create a documentary-like and everyday feel. The photo was taken of Yamaguchi asleep, after an all-night long drinking party that Yamaguchi held.|$|E
2500|$|British {{political}} writer George Monbiot decried Sierra's treatment, citing it as {{an example}} of state persecution and the erosion of civil liberties in the United States, while journalist Amy Goodman characterized it as evidence of [...] "a new McCarthyism". Charles C Haynes, senior scholar at the First Amendment Center, also situated the controversy {{in the context of the}} freedom of expression debate, criticising the school for allowing a [...] "heckler's veto" [...] to censor Sierra and the school district for spending [...] "more than US$75,000 fighting to keep her quiet". A New York University drama project investigating post-9/11 America composed a theater piece, United We Stand, inspired by Sierra's actions. The Thomas Jefferson Center, an organization dedicated to the protection of freedom of expression, highlighted the controversy in 2002 and awarded the Kanawha school board and principal Forest Mann with their annual [...] "Jefferson Muzzle" [...] award. Highlighting a quote by Katie Sierra ("There are many types of anarchy. I want us to unite as one instead of having some government <b>over</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> us.") the center wrote, [...] "While school officials have the authority to prevent disruption of school activities, such authority should not be used as a pretext to stifle expression with which they disagree. Moreover, a high school student who shows an active interest in the important issues of the day and who takes the initiative to form a club to pursue that interest should be commended." ...|$|E
