5|$|The Norwegian trade peaked {{during the}} 1890s, {{with a million}} tons (900 million kg) of ice was being {{exported}} from Norway by 1900; the major Leftwich company in Britain, importing much of this, kept a thousand tons (900,000kg) <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> store at all times to meet demand. Austria entered the European ice market behind Norway, with the Vienna Ice Company exporting natural ice to Germany {{by the end of}} the century.|$|E
5|$|By {{four days}} after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 meals to {{displaced}} families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 pounds <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the first few days, and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and 180,000liters of water for the following week for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By about {{one month after the}} hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Subsequent disaster declarations ultimately declared 47 North Carolina counties as disaster areas. By 12weeks after the hurricane passed through the state, 54,425 residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling $155.2million (2003USD, ($ USD)).|$|E

40|$|This {{indicator}} {{tracks the}} extent and age <b>of</b> sea <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the Arctic Ocean. The extent of area covered by Arctic sea ice is considered a particularly sensitive indicator of global climate because a warmer climate will reduce the amount <b>of</b> sea <b>ice</b> present. The proportion <b>of</b> sea <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> each age category can indicate the relative stability of Arctic conditions as well as susceptibility to melting events. Components of this indicator include: Changes in the September average extent <b>of</b> sea <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the Arctic Ocean since 1979 (Figure 1) Changes in the proportion <b>of</b> Arctic sea <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> various age categories at the September weekly minimum since 1983 (Figure 2...|$|R
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy <b>of</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>in</b> the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{supplying}} this demand, the ice trade increasingly shifted north, {{away from}} Massachusetts and towards Maine. Various factors contributed to this. New Englands' winters became warmer during the 19th century, while industrialisation {{resulted in more}} of the natural ponds and rivers becoming contaminated. Less trade was brought through New England as other ways of reaching western US markets were opened up, making it less profitable to trade ice from Boston, while the cost of producing ships in the region increased due to deforestation. Finally, in 1860 there {{was the first of}} four ice famines along the Hudson-warm winters that prevented the formation <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> New England-creating shortages and driving up prices.|$|E
5|$|When Elsa turns twenty-one, {{she is to}} be crowned {{queen of}} Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's {{citizens}} might find out about her powers and fear for her. The castle gates {{open to the public}} and visiting dignitaries {{for the first time in}} years. Amongst them is the scheming Duke of Weselton, and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls head-over-heels in love. Elsa’s coronation happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the kingdom, but her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Reaching the North Mountain, Elsa discards her crown and creates a palace <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> which to live a solitary life.|$|E

5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} {{of ice cream}} also resulted from the ice trade. Ice cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the light texture associated with ice cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new ice cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice cream with the general public.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing the meat to breathe, while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process.|$|E
