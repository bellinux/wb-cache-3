5|$|After an {{incomplete}} pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies {{got their first}} big offensive break <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> On a designed play, Taylor scrambled for 31yards, the largest play in the game for the Hokies. Two successful runs by running back Branden Ore followed, earning the Hokies 23more yards and pushing the offense deep into Boston College territory. A false-start penalty set the Hokie offense back, but on the next play, quarterback Sean Glennon connected with wide receiver Eddie Royal on a 24-yard strike for a touchdown. The touchdown and extra point were the first points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> and gave Virginia Tech a 2316 lead with 6:30 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final and it {{was their}} local rivals who had {{taken the lead in}} the 14th minute.

5|$|Because Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech returned the kickoff to its 25-yard line, where the Hokie offense began the first drive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> The Tech offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first downs and drive into Air Force territory. But once on the Falcons' side of the field, Tech proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back into its own territory by a penalty. Tech was forced to punt, and Air Force began its first offensive possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> at its 20-yard line after a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Because Georgia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Wake Forest {{received the}} ball to begin the second half.

5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Boston College {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's kickoff was returned to the Eagles' 35-yard line, and Boston College's offense began the first possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> An incomplete pass by Davis {{was followed by a}} short rush and another incomplete pass, and the Eagles were forced to punt after going three and out. The kick went out of bounds at Virginia Tech's 32-yard line, and the Hokies' offense had their first possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> Tech likewise went three and out, then returned the ball to the Eagles with a punt. The kick went out of bounds, and following the exchange, Boston College's offense started from its 31-yard line.|$|E

5|$|Boston College, {{in their}} first {{possession}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half,</b> fared even worse than Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard delay of game penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession {{that resulted in a}} punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, thanks in part to an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{struggled}} to regain fluency {{in the second}} half, as their opponents dominated play. In the 53rd minute, United scored to make it 4–3; Charlie Mitten's flick in the area was diverted into the Arsenal net by Lionel Smith for an own goal. United fashioned further chances through Burke and Rowley, but for large periods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> the Arsenal defence stood firm. Jones' headed goal was rule out for offside, after which the match descended into a contest between United's attack and Arsenal's defence. Jimmy Delaney came closest to equalising late on, when he darted forward and missed by inches.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{then made}} their second substitution, {{bringing}} on Van Persie {{in place of}} Cesc Fàbregas.
