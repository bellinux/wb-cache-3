5|$|After {{an attack}} across the Ilebbe Creek by the 2/13th Infantry Battalion, which cost the Australians 80casualties on 1 <b>October,</b> <b>the</b> Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw.

Once the 20th Brigade was established in Finschhafen, it linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion. This unit had cleared the coastal area {{in the south of}} the peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. Meanwhile, the Japanese that had been around Finschhafen withdrew back into the mountains around Sattelberg. Allied air operations from the airfield at Finschhafen commenced on 4 <b>October.</b> <b>The</b> following day, the 2/17th Infantry Battalion was sent to Kumawa to follow up the retreating Japanese forces, and {{for the next couple of}} days minor clashes resulted before it established itself at Jivevaneng again on 7 October.|$|E

Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 <b>October.</b> <b>The</b> momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance. On 25 <b>October</b> <b>the</b> first Chinese prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops.

5|$|In late September, Izetbegović and Tuđman {{met again}} and {{attempted}} to create military coordination against the VRS, but to no avail. By <b>October,</b> <b>the</b> agreement had collapsed and afterwards Croatia diverted delivery of weaponry to Bosnia and Herzegovina by seizing a significant amount for itself. Boban had abandoned a Bosnian government alliance and ceased all hostilities with Karadžić. The dominant Croatian–Bosnian defense of Posavina fell apart after Tuđman and/or Gojko Šušak ordered {{the withdrawal of the}} Croatian Army (HV), enabling the Serbs to gain control of the corridor and connect their captured territories in western and eastern Bosnia. On 8 <b>October,</b> <b>the</b> town of Bosanski Brod was abandoned by the HVO and left to the VRS. By that time, the HV and the HVO had sustained approximately 7,500 casualties, out of 20,000 troops committed to the battle to control Posavina. The pullout appeared to be a quid pro quo for the JNA withdrawal from Dubrovnik's hinterland that took place in July. Still, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements. On 9 <b>October,</b> <b>the</b> HVO signed a cease-fire with the VRS in Jajce in exchange for providing electricity.|$|E
