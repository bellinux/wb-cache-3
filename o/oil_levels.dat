In order to observe the impact of storage tank displacement on tank gage table, the author, on the premise of the displacements parameters, to detect the corresponding values of <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and volume and analyze the law of change of the tank gage table through modeling and provided a revised tank gage table. The above belongs to direct problem. 2. Based on the data from practical detection, the paper will identify how the displacement occurred and the level of the displacement. Meanwhile, the measure and result of calibration will be offered. All the above belongs to inverse problem. 1. Topic Background Usually, gas stations are equipped with several underground storage tanks for oil, and a corresponding <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> measurement system, through whose flow meter and level meter, can give an updated measurement for such data as volume of oil inflow/outflow and the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> in the tank according to the tank gage table set beforehand (i. e. the corresponding relationship between height of <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and the <b>oil</b> quantity), so as to get changes of the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> and quantity...|$|R

The tank, along with any filters, gauges, valves or ancillary equipment, must be contained within a secondary unit or bund which has at least 110% of the capacity of the inner tank.

5000|$|Recycled: Used {{paper is}} {{collected}} and sorted and usually mixed with virgin fibres {{in order to}} make new material. This is necessary as the recycled fibre often loses strength when reused; the added virgin fibres enhance strength. Mixed waste paper is not usually deinked (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the pulp may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards. Health risks have been associated with using recycled material in direct food contact.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to develop an engine <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> {{monitoring}} system that will replace the current dipstick method during vehicle testing for Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, Inc. (MBRDNA). Currently, MBRDNA test drivers check the engine <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> twice a day after two eight hour shifts each day. To measure the <b>oil</b> <b>level,</b> the driver parks on a level surface, waits five minutes for the oil to cool, and then manually checks the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> with the dipstick. The goal of this project {{is to have a}} reliable, physical, working prototype that MBRDNA can use for vehicle testing by spring. MBRDNA wants a prototype built {{by the end of this}} year that is capable of reading <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> without the need of a test driver to measure the oil. It is very easy for a driver to get distracted and forget to check the oil at precisely 5 minutes after the engine has been shut off. This leads to inconsistent results. Drivers are also susceptible to reading the dipstick incorrectly due to the small amount of increments on the end of the dip stick that must be read. Occasionally dipsticks will even break because they are not designed to with stand fatigue loading cycles that are seen during this testing. This leads to an expensive engine tear down to recover broken parts out of the crankcase. The prototype will consist of the following features: a SICK fiber optic cable connected to a SICK optic sensor, a clamp, a microcontroller, a digital display and a data acquisition. This project is being continued from the previous senior project group from 2011 / 2012 academic year...|$|R

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has recommended “in-tank monitoring systems,” like The Verifier, stating that “electronic systems which automatically measure tank inventories and continuously record changes…supply all of the information needed to perform daily reconciliations.” [...] These inventory records are also encouraged by major oil companies and the American Petroleum Institute. Moreover, accurate inventory measurement and tracking enables fuel consumption analysis to be performed and charted, by building, hourly, weekly and monthly; by square footage, by unit; and by degree-days. Additionally, consumption comparisons to prior periods, over specified times, and to other buildings in an entire database of portfolios can be performed as well.|$|E

The breech of the gun is semi-automatic and fitted with a vertical sliding wedge breech block. The firing mechanism utilises a mechanical firing pin which was prone to sticking and malfunction in dusty climates. There is also a recoil control mechanism consisting of a single cylinder with a constant stress spring and a hydropneumatic recuperator designed to return the GT-2 to its original firing position. This process entailed releasing oil into a nitrogen reservoir as the gun recoiled upon firing. <b>Oil</b> <b>levels</b> and the nitrogen pressure had to be monitored frequently; if neither was sufficient turret crews were forced to physically manhandle their gun back into position.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a misprint on the dipstick and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.|$|R
