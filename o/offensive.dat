Trestman also hired Andy Bischoff and Michael Sinclair as tight ends and defensive line coaches, respectively; both coaches had worked with Trestman in Montreal. Alouettes <b>offensive</b> coordinator Pat Meyer also joined the Bears as <b>offensive</b> line coach, along with Purdue defensive coordinator and colleague of Trestman, Tim Tibesar, as linebackers coach. Former Alouettes coaches Brendan Nugent and Carson Walch were hired as <b>offensive</b> quality control assistants.|$|E

25|$|In Soviet historiography, Stalin's ten blows {{were the}} ten {{successful}} strategic <b>offensives</b> {{conducted by the}} Red Army in 1944 during World War II. The Soviet <b>offensives</b> drove the Axis forces from Soviet territory and precipitated Nazi Germany's collapse.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven <b>offensives</b> on the Isonzo front {{along the}} Isonzo (Soča) River, {{northeast}} of Trieste. All eleven <b>offensives</b> were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, {{who held the}} higher ground. In the summer of 1916, after the Battle of Doberdò, the Italians captured the town of Gorizia. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian <b>offensives,</b> centred on the Banjšice and Karst Plateau east of Gorizia.|$|R

5|$|In September 1944, Adolf Hitler {{resolved}} to recover Germany′s deteriorating fortunes by launching an <b>offensive</b> in the West. On 16 September, Hitler directed Generalleutnant Werner Kreipe—Chief of the General Staff—to prepare the necessary aircraft for the <b>offensive.</b> On 21 October, Kreipe ordered the air fleet defending the Greater German Reich (Luftflotte Reich) {{to hand over}} seven Jagdgeschwader and Schlachtgeschwader to Air Command West (Luftwaffenkommando West) for a future <b>offensive.</b>|$|E
5|$|In mid-July the {{companies}} of the 6th Machine Gun Battalion were ordered into reserve in preparation {{to support the}} 5th and 6th Marine Regiments and the <b>offensive</b> they would be conducting.

5|$|John Shaw {{and other}} historians, {{military}} and civilian, have based {{the conclusions of}} their work on the incursion {{on the premise that}} the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia had been so badly damaged that it was rendered ineffective. The next large-scale North Vietnamese <b>offensive,</b> the Nguyen Hue <b>Offensive</b> of 1972 (called the Easter <b>Offensive</b> in the West) would be launched out of southern North Vietnam and western Laos, not from Cambodia, was cited as proof positive that the Cambodian operations had succeeded. The fact that PAVN forces were otherwise occupied in Cambodia and had no such <b>offensive</b> plan (so far as is known) was seemingly irrelevant. The fact that logistically, a northern <b>offensive</b> (especially a conventional one backed by armour and heavy artillery) would be launched closer to its source of manpower and supply also seemed to be of little consequence.|$|E

5|$|Molk {{was one of}} 54 <b>offensive</b> linemen, and the fourth-ranked center—behind Peter Konz, Garth Gerhart, and Ben Jones—, that {{participate}}d in the 2012 NFL Scouting Combine. However, he tore the peroneal longus tendon in his foot at the 2012 Sugar Bowl, and he had surgery on January 13. As a result, he was only {{able to participate in}} one Combine event. His 41 reps in the bench press ranked first among <b>offensive</b> linemen and second at the entire combine, behind only nose tackle Dontari Poe. Molk's total was most by a center and ranks third among <b>offensive</b> lineman since 2000, behind only Mitch Petrus and Scott Young, who were both <b>offensive</b> guards.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1945 Hitler and his generals {{launched}} Operation North Wind (Unternehmen Nordwind).

50|$|In June 1915, the Allied {{countries}} met in {{the first}} inter-Allied conference. Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Serbia and Russia agreed to coordinate their attacks but the attempts were frustrated by German <b>offensives</b> on the Eastern Front and spoiling <b>offensives</b> at Ypres and in the hills west of Verdun.|$|R
5|$|The failed <b>offensive</b> was {{investigated}} by the HV in 1991 and researched later by retired HV Brigadier Vlado Hodalj. He concluded that the <b>offensive</b> failed because of overall poor planning and preparation, specifically citing the lack of reconnaissance and reserves. Furthermore, Hodalj cited inadequate leadership by the Sisak OG {{as a cause of}} the failure, pointing to inaction in respect of the 10th Brigade's failure to advance and improper employment of the 2nd Guards Brigade in an auxiliary role, protecting the flank of an inexperienced brigade that was committed to the <b>offensive</b> with little, if any, training. Finally, the <b>offensive</b> itself had no clear goal. Croatian Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo also criticised the <b>offensive</b> as an unnecessary, purely tactical and politically counterproductive move, likely unauthorised by appropriate authorities.|$|E
5|$|The <b>offensive</b> {{line was}} another {{uncertainty}} for the 1997 team. Three linemen from the 1996 team {{had been selected}} in the 1997 NFL Draft: center Rod Payne (3rd round, 76th overall), <b>offensive</b> guard Damon Denson (4th round, 97th overall) and defensive tackle William Carr (7th round, 217th overall). As a result, Michigan began the season with only one <b>offensive</b> lineman, <b>offensive</b> tackle Jon Jansen, who had started a game. Jansen, a junior, had 25 consecutive starts entering the season. The <b>offensive</b> line was further weakened when left tackle, Jeff Backus, suffered a ruptured appendix. In spring practice, <b>offensive</b> line coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting, searching for talent to fill in on the line. To fill the holes on the <b>offensive</b> line, two defensive linemen, Steve Hutchinson and Chris Ziemann were moved to the <b>offensive</b> line.|$|E
5|$|The <b>offensive</b> team must {{line up in}} a legal {{formation}} {{before they}} can snap the ball. An <b>offensive</b> formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the <b>offensive</b> line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior <b>offensive</b> linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|E
