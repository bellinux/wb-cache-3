40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} using a composite blast shield for hardening an <b>overhead</b> <b>bin</b> compartment of a commercial aircraft. If {{a small amount of}} explosive escapes detection and is brought onboard and stowed in an <b>overhead</b> <b>bin</b> compartment of a passenger aircraft, the current bins provide no protection against a blast inside the compartment. A blast from the <b>overhead</b> <b>bin</b> will certainly damage the fuselage and likely lead to catastrophic inflight structural failure. The feasibility of using an inner blast shield to harden the <b>overhead</b> <b>bin</b> compartment of a Boeing 737 aircraft to protect the fuselage skin in such a threat scenario has been demonstrated using field tests. The blast shield was constructed with composite material based on the unibody concept. The design was carried out using LS-DYNA finite element model simulations. Material panels were first designed to pass the FAA shock holing and fire tests. The finite element model included the full coupling of the <b>overhead</b> <b>bin</b> with the fuselage structure accounting for all the different structural connections. A large number of iterative simulations were carried out to optimize the fiber stacking sequence and shield thickness to minimize weight and achieve the design criterion. Three designs, the basic, thick, and thin shields, were field-tested using a frontal fuselage section of the Boeing 737 â€“ 100 aircraft. The basic and thick shields protected the integrity of the fuselage skin with no skin crack. This work provides very encouraging results and useful data for optimization implementation of the blast shield design for hardening overhead compartments against the threat of small explosives...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a crash simulation of a 30 -ft/s vertical drop test of a Boeing 737 (B 737) fuselage section. The drop test of the 10 -ft. long fuselage section of a B 737 aircraft was conducted in November of 2000 at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ. The fuselage section was outfitted with two different commercial overhead stowage bins. In addition, 3, 229 - 1 bs. of luggage were packed in the cargo hold to represent a maximum take-off weight condition. The main objective of the test was to evaluate the response and failure modes of the overhead stowage bins in a narrow-body transport fuselage section when subjected to a severe, but survivable, impact. A secondary objective of the test was to generate experimental data for correlation with the crash simulation. A full-scale 3 -dimensional finite element model of the fuselage section was developed and a crash simulation was conducted using the explicit, nonlinear transient dynamic code, MSC. Dytran. Pre-test predictions of the fuselage and <b>overhead</b> <b>bin</b> responses were generated for correlation with the drop test data. A description of the finite element model and an assessment of the analytical/experimental correlation are presented. In addition, suggestions for modifications to the model to improve correlation are proposed...|$|E

50|$|The <b>overhead</b> <b>bins</b> {{are used}} for stowing carry-on baggage and other items. While the {{airliner}} manufacturer will normally specify a standard version of the product to supply, airlines can choose to have bins of differing size, shape, or color installed. Over time, <b>overhead</b> <b>bins</b> evolved out of what were originally overhead shelves that were used for little more than coat and briefcase storage. As concerns about falling debris during turbulence or in accidents increased, enclosed bins became the norm. Bins have increased in size to accommodate the larger carry-on baggage passengers can bring onto the aircraft. Newer bin designs have included a handrail, useful when moving through the cabin.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the history of}} the Endeavor folding wheelchair. In its current incarnation, it is an adjustable folding manual wheelchair conceptually based on a diamond shaped truss (similar to a bicycle). By disconnecting this truss at two points, the chair is able to fold flat enough to fit in the <b>overhead</b> <b>bin</b> of an airplane. It also features "airplane wheels" for maneuvering down the aisle of an airplane, taking the place of a boarding chair. The main part of the study was a clinical trial to gain feedback on the current chair design. The first phase of the study involved users performing obstacles encountered on a daily basis using the Endeavor and their personal chair. In the second phase, users took the chair home to see how the chair would function in their everyday lives. Because participants were comparing the Endeavor to their personal chairs, much of the feedback received was based primarily on the differences between the geometry and options of the Endeavor and their personal chairs. Based on the clinical results, the most important features that the Endeavor is lacking are: a more forgiving seatpan, and a more effective range of adjustability. In the future, a more organized approach based on product development methods should be used to develop better design criteria. The results of this study showed that in its current form, the Endeavor folding wheelchair may best be a special-purpose chair. By addressing all of the safety concerns, improving the ranges of adjustability to match the dimensions of the users in our focus group, and adding usability related options the chair may be able to function as an everyday wheelchair for many users. When our take-home participants were asked if they would like their chair better if they had "airplane wheels" five of the nine agreed. With some redesign to increase ease of use and decrease weight they could be marketed as their own product...|$|E
