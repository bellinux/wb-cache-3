40|$|Tenant Purchase Scheme (TPS) {{is one of}} {{scheme that}} the Hong Kong Housing Authority {{responses}} to low-income families’ need for buying their <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>flat.</b> There are policy, social, economic and political objectives that TPS aims to achieve. This paper aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of TPS by evaluating its objective, and find the satisfactory level from user’s perspective by conducting on street opinion survey in three estates namely Lei Tung Estate, Chuk Yuen North Estate and Kin Sang Estate. TPS has objectives such as incremental of home ownership rate (policy objective), provide affordable housing to low-income families (social objective), achieve efficiency in allocation of public housing (economic objective) and achieve accountability to the public (political objective). However, the objectives are not very well achieved by this scheme. Also, from the tenure choice resulted in an on-street opinion survey, more than half of interviewees indicated they would not buy TPS flat. From user’s perspective, although there are several reasons that may affect their purchase behaviour, it attributes that TPS is not so successful at the time of implementation as it cannot achieve its’ objectives nor attract potential buyers to buy TPS flat. At the end, recommendations for improving the effectiveness of TPS would be suggested. Examples such as provide affordable housing to PRH tenant by adjusting its selling price and mortgage repayment, improving the living quality of TPS estates, provide incentives to potential buyers to buy the flat and facilitate two-way communication so that the official could understand potential buyer’s concern and willingness to buy subsidized housing in the next housing scheme were suggested. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E

Some 19% of Norwegian homes are condominiums, as approximately 50% of the <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>flats</b> and duplexes, approximately 30% of the rowhouses and 2.5% of the detached houses are organised as condominiums.|$|R

It will rehouse welfare services: the hospice, Berinchem, Halderhof and Breukelderhof old-people’s homes There will also be <b>owner-occupied</b> and rented <b>flats.</b> The first accommodation will be available in 2010 or 2011.|$|R
40|$|Several factors {{bring about}} a rise in old age poverty in Germany, {{especially}} in East Germany. Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP) we examine causes and extent of old age poverty in Germany. We begin our inquiry with a cross section regression {{in order to determine}} the impact of several factors on retirement incomes in Germany. In the second step we perform an income projection of today’s 50 to 55 year-old people for the year 2023. In doing so, we take into account different sources of income, including several forms of capital income and the calculated rent of <b>owner-occupied</b> houses and <b>flats.</b> We find a significant rise in old age poverty especially in East Germany as a consequence of rising unemployment after the German unification. old age poverty, pension, old age income...|$|R
40|$|The iNSPiRe project {{addresses}} {{the need for}} energy efficiency measures by focussing on making so called deep renovations using multifunctional, industrialised kits in order {{to speed up the}} on-site installation process and reduce costs. Energy renovation investment is a multi-factor decision and many of these factors are not technical, which is why this report analyses the non-technical barriers to this investment decision. The study focusses on the kits developed within the iNSPiRe project, but many of the findings are relevant for other single stage deep renovation projects. Both the planning and implementation phases are considered. The aim was to develop suggestions for overcoming these non-technical barriers so that the iNSPiRe kits can more easily be deployed in the market. The report is based on a study of policy documents, the experiences of European umbrella organisations for architects, property owners and local governments as well as on a large number of in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders. Many of the 60 participants were made in conjunction with stakeholder workshops that were organised for specific focus groups such as architects, private property owners, public procurers and the stakeholders of the European Housing Forum. The non-technical barriers have been split into economic, political and social barriers, with most interviewed stakeholders emphasising the economic aspects. Subsidies are considered by most as essential for property owners to take the decision to make a deep renovation, but stability of the subsidy programs is essential to have a good impact. Low-interest loans are not as favoured. Other key economic issues are the increase in the asset value of the property after such a renovation and the green value of the resulting low energy building. These are both difficult to quantify, partly {{due to the fact that}} such renovated buildings are not as yet so common, and vary in the different property markets. The EU has many policies on energy efficiency that are relevant for renovation of buildings, with the 2010 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD recast) and the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) being the most important. Many member states were late in implementing these and most have problems with forcing compliance with them. National tenancy laws can also make energy renovations difficult by restricting the possibility of raising rents for. For the iNSPiRe kits, regulations and standards are seen as a barrier in the short term as the kits combine several different functions into one product that are covered by several different regulations and/or standards. The social barriers are mostly concerned with the tenants, while architectural considerations are also important. In buildings with <b>owner-occupied</b> <b>flats,</b> the decision process for renovation is difficult and even more so when deep renovation is to be considered. In rental properties the owners and tenants have different interests and incentives, leading to possible conflicts. All have uncertainties about the use of multifunctional kits and how well they will perform technically as well as about how much they will save economically. The report makes a number of suggestions for overcoming these barriers. Especially important for the iNSPiRe kits is training of relevant installers and planners and use of Life Cycle Cost calculations to show the expected benefits over the lifetime of the products. In each section of the report, in addition to the analysis of the specific barrier, there are sections with specific comments from the interviewed stakeholders. iNSPiR...|$|R
40|$|House {{and flat}} {{prices have been}} through a {{tremendous}} bust and boom cycle in Denmark. From 1986 to 1993 real prices for houses and flats dropped by one third on average, foreclosures accounted for around 1 / 6 {{of the house and}} flat turnovers in numbers, and in reality the market for <b>owner-occupied</b> houses and <b>flats</b> was in a crisis. Initiated by a strong interest rate drop and by an expansive finance policy, the market turned. From 1993 H 1 to 2004 H 1 real house prices increased 76 % and real flat prices 128 %. Moreover, Denmark has a leading position in the international household debt race and as in many other countries the fear of the consequences of a strong interest rate increase for the housing market is widespread. Therefore, in order to examine the financial stability among owner-occupiers, a sample of approx. 40, 000 owner-occupier families with data at household level has been drawn from the tax statistics for each year from 1987 to 2003. Through the analysis it is shown that the distributions of the owner-occupiers’ capital structure, measured by the net liability/housing wealth ratios, have more or less been the same throughout the 16 years, even during the long-lasting steep house and flat price rise. Moreover, since 1994 the median value of the net liability/income ratio has increased by 71 % for all owner-occupiers and by 54 % for owner-occupiers between 30 - 39 years of age. Finally, one last, important aspect of the financial stability of owner-occupiers, namely, their capacity to service their debt has been analysed. The owner-occupiers’ net interest expenditures/ income ratios before tax have been nearly halved from 1987 to 2003. Most of the drop happened during the years of the "housing market failure". From 1994 on the ratios were more slightly reduced and were in 2003 at 8. 8 % (median value) for all owner-occupiers and 12. 2 % for owner-occupiers between 30 - 39 years of age. However, if the reductions of the tax rates for deducting interest expenditures are taken into account, the 2003 after-tax-ratios are only about 2 percentage points below the 1987 after-tax ratios. At March 2005, a new challenge facing Danish owner-occupiers is that 50 % of their mortgages carry interest adjustment.
