40|$|SummaryObjectiveTotal hip (THR) {{and knee}} (TKR) {{replacements}} increasingly are performed on younger people making {{return to work}} a salient outcome. This research evaluates characteristics of individuals with early and later return to work following THR and TKR. Additionally, at work limitations pre-surgery and upon returning to work, and factors associated with work limitations were evaluated. Methods 190 THR and 170 TKR of a total 931 cohort participants were eligible (i. e., working or on short-term disability pre-surgery). They completed questionnaires pre-surgery and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-surgery that included demographics, type <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Workplace</b> Activity Limitations Scale (WALS). Results 166 (87 %) and 144 (85 %) returned to work by 12 months following THR and TKR, respectively. Early (1 month) return to work was associated with, male gender, university education, working in business, finance or administration, and low physical demand work. People with THR returned to work earlier than those with TKR. For both groups, less pain and every day functional limitations were associated with less workplace activity limitations at the time return to work. ConclusionsThe majority of individuals working prior to surgery return to work following hip or knee replacement for osteoarthritis (OA) and experience fewer limitations at work than pre-surgery. The changing workforce dynamics and trends toward surgery at younger ages mean that these are important outcomes for clinicians to assess. Additionally, this is important information for employers in understanding continued participation in employment for people with OA...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{attitude}} theory, {{this study}} investigates <b>the</b> drivers <b>of</b> employees' expression of favorable opinions about their workplace. Despite its theoretical and managerial importance, the marketing literature largely ignores the topic. This study advances prior research by developing, and empirically testing, {{a conceptual framework}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between workgroup support and favorable external representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace,</b> mediated by emotional responses to this support. The present research investigates four new relationships: between workgroup support and emotional exhaustion, workgroup support and organizational commitment, workgroup support and job satisfaction, and emotional exhaustion and external representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> Based on a sample of over 700 frontline service employees, this study finds that workgroup support affects favorable external representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> through various emotional responses (i. e., emotional exhaustion, organizational commitment and job satisfaction). In addition, the results identify employees' organizational commitment {{as the most important}} determinant of favorable external representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace,</b> followed by job satisfaction and reduced emotional exhaustion. These results suggest that companies should develop practices that encourage workgroup support and organizational commitment to achieve favorable external representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace...</b>|$|R

40|$|The central {{argument}} {{in this thesis}} is that <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> environment has an impact upon users and that perceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment are related to overall satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>workplace,</b> stimulation and perceived productivity. In addition, it is proposed that changing the environment can influence users’ perceptions and stimulation levels. To test this argument a methodology was developed to allow <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> both objective and subjective data relating to a range <b>of</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> environment. A questionnaire was developed to test users’ attitudes towards aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> environment including <b>the</b> internal climate, spatial layout, interior design and workplace features. These user perceptions were analysed in relation to corresponding objective measures of these workplace aspects. Data was collected in 16 workplaces and analysed to determine the relationship between user perceptions and objective measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> and establish how these were related to overall satisfaction, stimulation and perceived productivity. The results revealed that users {{were satisfied with the}} more quantitative aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workplace: internal climate and spatial layout, but were not satisfied with <b>the</b> qualitative aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workplace: decoration, furniture, personal control and choice, window provision and break areas. All aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> were significantly correlated with satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> and stimulation. There was also an effect on perceived productivity. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> evaluations were tested to determine whether changing the environment in the afternoon could affect stimulation. The results revealed some evidence of a positive impact upon stimulation levels through variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> environment. Implications for <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> future <b>workplaces</b> and further research in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings are discussed.

40|$|Privacy {{has become}} the law 2 ̆ 7 s chameleon, {{simultaneously}} everywhere and nowhere. This is particularly true <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> where employees often seek some private space but where the law, particularly the formidable employment-at-will rule, typically frustrates that search. As <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> has expanded both in its scope and importance, additional concerns have been raised about an employer 2 ̆ 7 s potential reach outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> In this symposium contribution, I explore the privacy issue by asking a fundamental question: what do employees deserve? My answer is that, {{as a matter of}} policy, we ought to concede privacy issues as the employer 2 ̆ 7 s domain at <b>the</b> specific <b>workplace.</b> This is, in part, because for most employees workplace privacy is not a central concern and the justifications for broad protections of workplace privacy are often quite weak. While conceding <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> as <b>the</b> employer 2 ̆ 7 s domain, I also advocate creating a strict barrier to employer encroachments outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> so that employers {{would not be able to}} interfere with <b>the</b> off-work activity <b>of</b> their employees absent some compelling justification.
