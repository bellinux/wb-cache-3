25|$|William Blake {{was born}} on 28 November 1757 at 28 Broad Street (now Broadwick St.) in Soho, London. He was the third of seven children, two of whom died in infancy. Blake's father, James, was a hosier. He {{attended}} school <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> learn reading and writing, leaving {{at the age of}} ten, and was otherwise educated at home by his mother Catherine Blake (née Wright). Even though the Blakes were English Dissenters, William was baptised on 11 December at St James's Church, Piccadilly, London. The Bible was an early and profound influence on Blake, and remained a source of inspiration throughout his life.|$|E

25|$|The various {{branches}} {{in the above}} course, {{with the exception of}} Latin and French, were obligatory for the English course, for the satisfactory fulfillment of which, an English diploma was bestowed by the faculty. A satisfactory knowledge of the iEneid of Virgil was necessary for receiving a Latin diploma. The annual number of graduates never exceeded seven, as it was arduous. The majority remained <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be thoroughly drilled in the various branches of a common school education. Music was one of the special features of the school, but all students were made aware that the highest achievement of a female student was not a musical triumph or a marvel of embroidery.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the plethora}} of parties and the {{defection}} to the majority party were typical of Somali parliamentary elections. To register for elective office, a candidate merely needed either the support of 500 voters or the sponsorship of his clan, expressed through a vote of its traditional assembly. After registering, the office seeker then attempted to become the official candidate of a political party. Failing this, he would remain on the ballot as an individual contestant. Voting was by party list, which could make a candidate a one-person party. (This practice explained not only the proliferation of small parties but also the transient nature of party support.) Many candidates affiliated with a major party <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> use its symbol in the election campaign and, if elected, abandoned it for the winning side {{as soon as the}} National Assembly met. Thus, by the end of May 1969 the SYL parliamentary cohort had swelled from 73 to 109.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as a Rifle Platoon Commander of Company H, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 27 October 1952. With his platoon subjected to an intense mortar and artillery bombardment while preparing to assault a vitally important hill position on the main line of resistance which had been overrun by a numerically superior enemy force on the preceding night, Second Lieutenant O'Brien leaped from his trench when the attack signal was given and, shouting for his men to follow raced across an exposed saddle and up the enemy-held hill through a virtual hail of deadly small-arms, artillery and weapon fire. Although shot through the arm and thrown to the ground by hostile automatic-weapons fire as he neared the well-entrenched enemy position, he bravely regained his feet, waved his men onward and continued to spearhead the assault, pausing <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> go to the aid of a wounded Marine. Encountering the enemy at close range, he proceeded to hurl hand grenades into the bunkers and, utilizing his carbine to best advantage in savage hand-to-hand combat, succeeded in killing at least three of the enemy. Struck down by the concussion of grenades on three occasions during the subsequent action, he steadfastly refused to be evacuated for medical treatment and continued to lead his platoon in the assault for a period of nearly four hours, repeatedly encouraging his men and maintaining superb direction of the unit. With the attack halted, he set up a defense with his remaining forces to prepare for a counterattack, personally checking each position, attending to the wounded and expediting their evacuation. When a relief of the position was effected by another unit, he remained to cover the withdrawal and to assure that no wounded were left behind. By his exceptionally daring and forceful leadership in the face of overwhelming odds, Second Lieutenant O'Brien served as a constant source of inspiration to all who observed him and was greatly instrumental in the recapture of a strategic position on the main line of resistance. His indomitable determination and valiant fighting spirit reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the product}} was not {{publicly}} released, many questioned whether [...] "Microsoft had lost its senses" [...] and {{the product was}} widely derided. Critics contended that the product {{was a waste of}} money and doomed to fail. Concerns were raised about how the iLoo would serve to extend waiting lines, how hygienic it would be to share keyboards in a public loo, and {{what would happen if the}} keyboard were to be urinated upon. Critics also questioned whether users would spend enough time in the loo to make use of the internet facilities, noting that [...] "most port-a-potty users stay <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> relieve themselves without having to inhale." ...|$|E

If a claim was deemed as low-value—as most were—miners would abandon the site in search for a better one. In the case where a claim was abandoned or not worked upon, other miners would [...] "claim-jump" [...] the land. [...] "Claim-jumping" [...] meant that a miner began work on a previously claimed site. Disputes were often handled personally and violently, and were sometimes addressed by groups of prospectors acting as arbitrators. This often led to heightened ethnic tensions. In some areas the influx of many prospectors {{could lead to a}} reduction of the existing claim size by simple pressure.|$|E

500|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Minnesota Territory in 1848 and the treaty of 1851 waves of immigrants from the U.S. and Europe came to the territory rapidly changing the demographics. Even as these changes occurred in many areas the vagueness of the racial divisions between [...] "Indians" [...] and [...] "whites" [...] persisted. As late as 1857 it was common practice in some jurisdictions for men to be allowed to vote based on {{whether or not they were}} wearing European clothing.

2500|$|The {{cochineal}} disperses in {{the first}} nymph stage, called the [...] "crawler" [...] stage. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later, they move {{to the edge of}} the cactus pad, where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the insects to a new host. These individuals establish feeding sites on the new host and produce a new generation of cochineals. Male nymphs feed on the cactus until they reach sexual maturity. At this time, they can no longer feed at all and live <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fertilise the eggs. They are, therefore, seldom observed. In addition, females typically outnumber males due to environmental factors.|$|E

2500|$|After the exhibit, he {{continued}} on to Vitebsk, where {{he planned to}} stay <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> marry Bella. However, after a few weeks, the First World War began, closing the Russian border for an indefinite period. A year later he married Bella Rosenfeld and they had their first child, Ida. Before the marriage, Chagall had difficulty convincing Bella's parents {{that he would be}} a suitable husband for their daughter. They were worried about her marrying a painter from a poor family and wondered how he would support her. Becoming a successful artist now became a goal and inspiration. According to Lewis, [...] "he euphoric paintings of this time, which show the young couple floating balloon-like over Vitebsk—its wooden buildings faceted in the Delaunay manner—are the most lighthearted of his career". His wedding pictures were also a subject he would return to in later years as he thought about this period of his life.|$|E
2500|$|Short selling is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "negative income investment strategy" [...] because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called [...] "going long") has a very different risk profile from selling short. [...] Furthermore, a [...] "long's" [...] losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but gains are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go. [...] On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit. [...] For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a hedge strategy to manage the risks of long investments.|$|E
2500|$|After pausing in Würzburg <b>only</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{capture the}} fortress, the Archduke {{arrived at the}} Lahn on 11 September. [...] His {{determined}} pursuit prevented the French from turning south to join with [...] Moreau's sizable force crossing the Black Forest. [...] Recognizing Jourdan's established position and superior numbers, Charles decided to feint toward the French left, at Paul Grenier's division at Giessen and Lefebvre's division at Wetzlar, creating a distraction; he would actually attack at the French right flank. To achieve this goal, he ordered Paul Kray’s and Anton Sztaray’s divisions to create as much noise and confusion as possible to convince Jourdan that the Austrian main army was on its left flank and the attack would come from the left. The divisions were so successful that, by 15 September, the French had concentrated most of their strength on their left. Marceau was posted between the Rhine and Limburg, with his advance guard at Mensfelden, [...] southeast of the city. Bernadotte was [...] to the east, at Runkel, Jean Étienne Championnet was [...] further to the northeast, at Weilburg.|$|E

It was to be the first in a projected four-album set, but Quorthon <b>only</b> lived <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> finish the first two volumes (2003's Nordland II being the second).|$|R
2500|$|Within three minutes, the Greene Street {{stairway}} became unusable in both directions. Terrified employees crowded {{onto the}} single exterior fire escape, which city officials had allowed Asch to erect {{instead of the}} required third staircase. It was a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure {{which may have been}} broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly [...] to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that [...] "I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture -- the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk".
