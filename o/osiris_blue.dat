2500|$|Halo 5: Guardians {{takes place}} in the year 2558, and is set eight months after the events of Halo 4. The game follows the human fireteams Blue Team and Fireteam <b>Osiris.</b> <b>Blue</b> Team is led by Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 (Steve Downes) and is {{composed}} of the Spartan-II teammates he fought alongside in the timeframe before Halo: Combat Evolved: Linda-058 (Brittany Uomoleale), an elite sniper; Kelly-087 (Michelle Lukes), a scout known for her incredible speed and John's closest friend; and Frederic-104 (Travis Willingham), who is Blue Team's highest-ranking officer, but defers to Master Chief. The members of Blue Team are all Spartan-IIs, augmented super soldiers who were abducted and trained as children; they are among the last Spartan-IIs left alive. Fireteam Osiris comprises Spartan-IVs, a newer generation of Spartans who joined the program as adult members of the military. Fireteam Osiris is led by Jameson Locke (Ike Amadi), a former agent of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and skilled tracker. The other members of Fireteam Osiris are: Holly Tanaka (Cynthia McWilliams), a survivor of a Covenant attack on her world; Olympia Vale (Laura Bailey), who can speak many of the Covenant's dialects; and Edward Buck (Nathan Fillion), a veteran former Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, who was a main character in [...]|$|E

500|$|Blue Team finds a dormant Guardian, an {{autonomous}} Forerunner ship. [...] After a brief fight with Locke, Blue Team boards {{the ship and}} is transported to the Forerunner World of Genesis. [...] Upon reaching Genesis, Blue Team learns that Cortana did not perish, but came across the Domain, a Forerunner computer network that serves as [...] "the fountain of youth" [...] for artificial intelligence. [...] Suspicious about Cortana's nature and aware of the damage Cortana had caused, Blue Team attempts to meet with Cortana {{in an attempt to}} return her back to the UNSC. [...] Fireteam <b>Osiris</b> reaches <b>Blue</b> Team's location and attempts to assist them, only for the two SPARTAN fireteams to get separated. [...] After fighting through scores of Promethean forces, Master Chief attempts to negotiate with Cortana and asks her to return to the UNSC, only for Cortana to refuse and imprison Blue Team in a Forerunner prison called the Cryptum with the intent of preserving them while Cortana enforces a forced peace across the galaxy.

40|$|We {{present the}} first direct {{image of the}} high-metallicity gas {{component}} in a planetary nebula (NGC 6778), taken with the <b>OSIRIS</b> <b>Blue</b> Tunable Filter centered on the O II 4649 + 50 angstroms optical recombination lines (ORLs) at the 10. 4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We show that the emission of these faint O II ORLs is concentrated in the central parts of the planetary nebula and is not spatially coincident either with emission coming from the bright [O III] 5007 angstroms collisionally excited line (CEL) or the bright H alpha recombination line. From monochromatic emission line maps taken with VIMOS at the 8. 2 m Very Large Telescope, {{we find that the}} spatial distribution of the emission from the auroral [O III] 4363 line resembles that of the O II ORLs but differs from nebular [O III] 5007 CEL distribution, implying a temperature gradient inside the planetary nebula. The centrally peaked distribution of the O II emission and the differences with the [O III] and H I emission profiles are consistent with the presence of an H-poor gas whose origin may be linked to the binarity of the central star. However, determination of the spatial distribution of the ORLs and CELs in other PNe, and a comparison of their dynamics is needed to further constrain the geometry and ejection mechanism of the metal-rich (H-poor) component and hence, understand the origin of the abundance discrepancy problem in PNe.
