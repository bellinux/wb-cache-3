5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals <b>only</b> <b>look</b> for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old <b>only</b> <b>look</b> within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
25|$|Face: The face {{category}} is about {{who has a}} classically beautiful face. Judges examine the eyes, the nose, the teeth, the lips {{and the structure of}} the face. While the category may call for an effect, ultimately the judges will <b>only</b> <b>look</b> at the face of a competitor, which should not have much makeup and should appear flawless.|$|E

25|$|Staring {{at others}} is {{generally}} discouraged by most nudist and naturist groups, and {{could result in}} eviction if someone complains that it made them uncomfortable. In {{the early days of}} naturism in the U.S. (1930s-1950s), the rules at many resorts stipulated that when conversing, you must <b>only</b> <b>look</b> at each other face to face. On the other hand, staring has been acceptable at the largely abandoned female beauty contests (see below).|$|E
25|$|In Of a Fire on the Moon Mailer {{discusses}} {{that the}} space flight was an exclusive action {{on the part of}} white America, as they have left African Americans behind on earth. African Americans can <b>only</b> <b>look</b> on as whites move even farther past them in not just society, but their earthly constraints. Mailer uses African Americans to criticize the moon landing, as he reflects on the fact that many problems still exist on earth, and within America.|$|E
25|$|The {{standards}} {{are intended to}} reduce acceleration to (and within) the head due to impact, as a stiff liner made of expanded polystyrene is crushed against the head. However, both the CPSC and the EN 1078 standards <b>only</b> <b>look</b> at linear accelerations and ignore rotational accelerations. The rotational accelerations that arise in bicycle accidents can {{be large enough to}} cause concussions, diffuse axonal injury and subdural haematoma. A few new helmets are designed to reduce rotational accelerations in accidents.|$|E

25|$|One Stone, called Elendil's Stone, {{was placed}} in the tower of Elostirion in the Tower Hills, just west of the Shire. Its {{location}} was only known to a few and it remained hidden there until it was taken back to the West with the three Elven Rings. It was unique among the stones brought to Middle-earth, in that it did not communicate with the others and would <b>only</b> <b>look</b> west along the Straight Road to the Master-stone of Avallónë.|$|E
25|$|Admission offers {{are made}} by {{individual}} medical schools, generally {{on the basis of}} a personal statement, undergraduate record (GPA), scores on the Medical College Admission Test , and interviews. Volunteer work is often an important criterion considered by admission committees. All four medical schools in Quebec and two Ontario schools (University of Ottawa, Northern Ontario School of Medicine) do not require the MCAT. McMaster requires that the MCAT be written, though they <b>only</b> <b>look</b> for particular scores (6 or better) on the verbal reasoning portion of the test.|$|E
25|$|The CTU {{insisted that}} it would refuse to talk with {{individual}} contractors, and would talk only if all the contractors were present. The first meeting between the Union of Hong Kong Dockers and contractors were held under the mediation of the Labour Department on 10 April but broke off without any immediate progress. The representative of the Beijing-loyalist Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) which did not join the strike and the rival union of the pro-democratic Confederation of Trade Unions said they would <b>only</b> <b>look</b> for a 12-percent rise, compared to the 23 percent increase demanded by the Confederation of Trade Unions as they claimed.|$|E

25|$|An example can {{be found}} in {{personality}} or temperament models. For example, a model that was derived from linguistic expressions of individual differences is subdivided into the Big Five personality traits, where everyone can be assigned a score along each of the five dimensions. This is by contrast to models of 'personality types' or temperament, where some have a certain type and some do not. Similarly, in the classification of mental disorders, a dimensional approach, which is being considered for the DSM-V, would involve everyone having a score on personality trait measures. A categorical approach would <b>only</b> <b>look</b> for {{the presence or absence of}} certain clusters of symptoms, perhaps with some cut-off points for severity for some symptoms only, and as a result diagnose some people with personality disorders.|$|E
25|$|In March 2004, Target Corporation {{announced}} that they planned to put the Mervyn's and Marshall Field's divisions up for sale to focus on Target stores. Target Corporation was approached by many buyers for both stores {{but many of the}} potential buyers saw value only in the real estate. Target refused to sell to the groups which wanted to buy the property only, and said they would <b>only</b> <b>look</b> at deals that would not close the company and put the then 30,000 employees out of work. In July 2004, Target Corporation {{announced that}} Mervyn's had been sold to a group of investors that included private investment firm and turnaround specialist Sun Capital Partners, Cerberus Capital Management, and real estate investment company Lubert-Adler Management Inc. Rick Leto was named the new president and chief merchandising officer in January 2005.|$|E
25|$|Many other figures, like a {{great part}} of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, Menelaus, and the {{historical}} pugilist Cleomedes of Astupalaea, were also believed to have been made physically immortal, but without having died in the first place. Indeed, in Greek religion, immortality originally always included an eternal union of body and soul. The philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a later invention, which, although influential, never had a breakthrough in the Greek world. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, traditional Greek believers maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that for the rest of us, we could <b>only</b> <b>look</b> forward to an existence as disembodied and dead souls.|$|E

25|$|Unknown to the explorers, ngardu sporocarps {{contain the}} enzyme thiaminase, which depletes {{the body of}} vitamin B1 (thiamin). It is {{probable}} {{that they were not}} preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary:My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and bone. I can <b>only</b> <b>look</b> out like Mr Micawber for something to turn up, but starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|After the {{destruction}} of Arnor and its successor states by the Witch-King of Angmar, the stones of Amon Sul and Annuminas were lost in Arvedui's shipwreck in the Bay of Forochel. The stone of Elostirion remained at the Emyn Beriad throughout the Second and Third Age but was aligned only with the Master Stone on Tol Eressëa. It could <b>only</b> <b>look</b> to the West. The stone of Osgiliath was lost during the Kin-strife when the Dome of the Stars was among the places sacked and burned in the city. The stone fell into the Anduin River and was not recovered. As for the other stones of Gondor, Sauron captured the palantír of Minas Ithil in 2002 T.A when the Ring-wraiths assailed Minas Ithil and took it a second time. Saruman found the palantir of Orthanc when he was given possession of the Angrenost by Beren the Steward. The Anor-stone was used seemingly only by the Steward Denethor when he inherited his father's position in Minas Tirith.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2012, Ryan Richards {{announced}} that he was leaving the band. He cited his family as the reason, saying: “I’ve always put music first in my life – but the time has come now for my family to take the top spot”. It was the band's initial intention that Richards would not be replaced instantly and that the band would <b>only</b> <b>look</b> for a touring member to play for the band. However, it was announced on that Pat Lundy would be joining the band as Richards' replacement. Lundy is the former drummer of London-based heavy metal band Rise to Remain, having left the band in January 2012. After being contacted by the band to come to audition in Cardiff for the role, Pat learned their whole setlist in 7 days for the audition. Whilst the line up change occurred the band was recording and mixing their follow up to their fifth studio album. Across the year the band made few live appearances as they were working on the album, performing at Wakestock in North Wales, both the northern and southern dates of Slam Dunk Festival 2012 and the UK Warped Tour festival at the Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012.|$|E

25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can <b>only</b> <b>look</b> forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E
25|$|As {{the teams}} {{returned}} up the pavilion steps Sir Donald Bradman called Richie Benaud {{to one side}} and reminded him that England's only chance of retaining the Ashes was it they were forced to follow on and made a lot of runs. Benaud agreed with him, but excused himself as he had to go and tell Peter May {{that he was going to}} bat again. When he reached the dressing room he consoled May with what Sir Donald had said. This was repeated by cricket commentators when a Test side in this situation must win, notably when Allan Border's Australians followed on at The Oval in 1985. Watson (40) returned with Richardson (43) and together they saw off the new ball to end the day on 43/0, and produced the highest England opening stand of the series, staying for almost three hours and adding 89. Davidson could not bowl after his injury, Rorke opened the bowling with Lindwall and Benaud had to bowl himself for a spell of four hours. The partnership ended when Watson pulled a full toss from the captain and Les Favell ran in to take the catch on the boundary. Richardson fell to Benaud (4/84) padding up against a ball that didn't move having survived a l.b.w. appeal the ball before. May (59) and Graveney looked set for big scores, and the England captain struck Benaud for three successive fours before he was leg before by a torpedo from Rorke (2/78). Bailey was caught by Grout off Lindwall (2/70) on the last ball of the day, though he and Graveney thought the ball had come off the top of his pad. At 198/5 England's cause looked lost and Graveney could <b>only</b> <b>look</b> on as the lower order collapsed before him. Lock (9) stayed in for an hour as did Tyson, who made 33 in a stand of 46, but the other three tailenders only lasted 20 minutes and Graveney ended with 53 not out, having batted for over five hours. England's total of 270 put them only 34 runs ahead.|$|E
