5|$|<b>Onion</b> <b>powder</b> is a {{seasoning}} {{widely used}} when the fresh ingredient is not available. It {{is made from}} finely ground, dehydrated onions, mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions, and has a strong odour.

5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and <b>onion</b> <b>powder</b> to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
25|$|Heinz tomato ketchup’s {{ingredients}} are: {{tomato concentrate}} from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, <b>onion</b> <b>powder,</b> and natural flavoring. Tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes {{is the first}} ingredient on the list, which means it has {{the highest percentage of}} weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles. The second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure water and twenty percent acetic acid. Next is high fructose corn syrup, which is made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other polysaccharides and sugars. Corn syrup is 100% glucose. Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, <b>onion</b> <b>powder,</b> and natural flavoring are the last ingredients on the list, meaning that they have the least percent weight. These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, <b>onion</b> <b>powder,</b> or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} aimed at evaluating {{the effect of}} drying on the antioxidant properties of three varieties of <b>onion.</b> <b>Onion</b> <b>powders</b> were prepared after solar or electric dryings. The total phenolic compounds (TPC), flavonoids, tannins, and vitamin C were assayed at time in the fresh and powdered samples of these varieties. The total reducing power (TRP) and scavenging capacity (ABTS and DPPH) were also evaluated. Results showed a significant decrease (P _ 0. 05) in the parameters evaluated during drying and a significant positive correlation (P _ 0. 05) between ABTS and DPPH (R 2 = 0. 602) and between TPC and TRP (R 2 = 0. 77), and between TPC and the scavenging capacity (R 2 = 0. 88, R 2 = 0. 71 for ABTS and DPPH respectively). The Violet of Galmi variety appeared to have the strongest antioxidant activity even after drying. In general, drying reduced the antioxidant activity of onion. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{detection}} technique for adulterated powder products using Raman spectroscopy. While conventional methods for food quality analysis require time and pretreatment procedures, Raman spectroscopy can be used to detect a food component rapidly and nondestructively without pretreatment.
