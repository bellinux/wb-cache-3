Fractals are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that {{the shape of the}} pattern does not depend <b>on</b> <b>how</b> closely <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at it. Self-similarity is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their formation can be simple (e.g. Lindenmayer systems describing tree shapes).|$|R

But looking at the matter as they did, I am not so sure about it. To Granny and Reddy Fox those hens were simply big, rather stupid birds, splendid eating if they could be caught, and bound to be eaten by somebody. The fact that they were in Farmer Brown's henhouse didn't make them his any more than the fact that Mrs. Grouse was in a part of the Green Forest owned by Farmer Brown made her his.|$|E

The following two questions we intend to answer is: How do secondary- and high school students in different socioeconomic environments, experience gender patterns, gender and equality in the school environment? As well as the potential impact the factors of age and gender on students' experience? An interview was conducted in two schools, one secondary school and one high school. The areas where students experience these differences in expectations and demands most obvious is the physical education, classroom space situations, expectations regarding school performance, attitudes toward girls and boys, as well as requirements <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> should <b>look.</b> The school shall promote democratic values and equality between women and men.

40|$|The {{focus of}} Broken Conventions is {{experimental}} cinema, that big body of film existing outside the limiting {{boundaries of the}} mainstream cinema industries. The goal {{is to provide a}} broad view of this abstract and hard-to-define area of film studies, by searching for an answer to the question; what is experimental cinema and can it be viewed as a genre of its own? In doing so, I will explore the theoretical discourse surrounding the topic, as well as provide case studies of several experimental films. I will also suggest a genre theory, as a way of determining whether or not experimental cinema {{can be seen as a}} genre, but more importantly to use it as a way of further examining the individual films and to deepen the understanding of this type of film. The topic at hand is however extremely subjective and there is no generally accepted definition, or term for that matter, concerning what experimental cinema really is. This essay will simply attempt to show the reader what it might be, depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> choose to <b>look</b> at it. I am not attempting to find a precise definition for the term experimental cinema, only to provide an overview on the matter as well as a different perspective...|$|R

Kain is basically screwed by his own character flaws - which is more interesting than the idealized hero figure. —Amy Hennig, Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, September 2002 ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} was to explore if staff in high school {{experience}} if youth suffer of mental health. If it was so then I wanted to see <b>how</b> it appears <b>on</b> the youth according to the staff, and what it hangs on? I used a qualitative inquiry method in my study, because I {{wanted to go to}} the depth with my questions and to be able to make supplementary questions on the interview occasions. The interviews carried out with staff on the four high schools because I wanted to find out how the staff in the school experiences the youths mental health, when they have contact with them and see the youths on their weekday. Youth today are subjects to a lot of impressions and choices that they have to make a decision in. On the school they have demands on them to perform well, to have good grades so they can select the school they want to go when they have decided what they want to become in life. Several of the informants tell about the demands that youths have from the society today. There are demands <b>on</b> <b>how</b> they <b>look,</b> <b>you</b> have to <b>look</b> good, <b>you</b> have to be a good friend, they always have to be connected with the mobile and “to be connected with the out of space” (internet) as one informant explains it. Then they also have to make well in the school with homework and examinations. In addition to that they even have activities after school. There are a lot of research that shows that youth starts to suffer of mental health when they start in upper secondary school and then mainly on the nine grade and forward. The staff on the schools experience that a lot of high school students are suffering of mental unhealthy and have anxiety and are depressed. They do their best to help students who show mental unhealthy, but it’s not always easy to get help. It can be difficult to get a time to a psychologist. What also comes to light in this study is that the staffs in the school are also stressed. They have also a lot to do and in the same time, they have to see the students and the students who start to feel mental unhealthy. It’s important to the students to get help in time before it gets worse. Validerat; 20150614 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
