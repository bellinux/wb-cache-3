5|$|Half-Life: Source {{has been}} criticized for not fully {{utilizing}} many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> of the Source engine found in Half-Life 2, as it still uses textures and models from the original game. In response to this, a third-party mod remake called Black Mesa was developed. The first part of the Black Mesa modification was released on September 14, 2012, with the second promised to be coming later.|$|E

5|$|An initial demo of {{the game}} was made {{available}} in August 2007 for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. This demo included cutscenes to introduce the player to Rapture, the game's tutorial section, and its first levels; the demo also included weapons, plasmids, and tonics {{that would otherwise be}} introduced later in the full title, as to give the player more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> that would be found in the published game. The Xbox demo was the fastest demo at that time to reach one million downloads on the Xbox Live service. The full game was released for these platforms on August 21, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Features that {{differentiate}} {{an animal}} from {{most or all}} others are called a diagnosis. Some, but not all, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Xu (2010), Sinoceratops can be distinguished based on the following diagnostic characteristics: {{there are at least}} ten robust, strongly curved hornlike processes along the rear margin of the combined parietals, {{while at the same time}} at least four hornlike processes on the combined squamosals are present; there is a large accessory fenestra in front of the antorbital fenestra (differing from all other known centrosaurines); the external margin of the parietals is only weakly undulating (differing from all other known centrosaurines); and the presence of broad-based epoccipitals (differing from all other known centrosaurines).|$|E

Through <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above three steps, each feature point detected contains three messages ((x,[*]y),[*]σ,[*]θ). That is, position, scale, and direction. Because <b>the</b> descriptor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point {{is related to}} <b>the</b> scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point, <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point descriptor needs {{to be carried out}} in the Gaussian pyramid space <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding scale [14]. First, the neighborhood centered on <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point is divided into BP[*]×[*]BP sub-blocks, and <b>the</b> edge size <b>of</b> each sub-block is mσ pixels. <b>The</b> construction process <b>of</b> <b>feature</b> point descriptors is as follows: first, taking <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point as <b>the</b> center, <b>the</b> rotation angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image in <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ([...] mσ(B_p+ 1)√(2)× mσ(B_p+ 1)√(2)) [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point is θ to <b>the</b> main direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point. Then, take <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point as <b>the</b> center, select the mσBp[*]×[*]σBp size image block, and divide the interval into the BP[*]×[*]BP sub block, then use the gradient histogram to calculate the gradient accumulating value of all pixels in each sub block in eight directions, and form the seed point. A 128 dimensional feature vector is formed. In addition, in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> constructing <b>feature</b> point descriptors, all the pixels in <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> point need to be weighted by Gaussian, and all the pixels in <b>the</b> neighborhood range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> points need to be normalized two times in order to remove <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> illumination and other factors [15].|$|R

5|$|Following Walt Disney's passing, Wolfgang Reitherman {{continued}} as both producer and director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features.</b> The studio began the 1970s {{with the release}} of The Aristocats, the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney. In 1971, Roy O. Disney, the studio co-founder, died and Walt Disney Productions was left in the hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker, who alternated as chairman and CEO in overlapping terms {{for the rest of the}} decade. The next feature, Robin Hood (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features. Both The Aristocats and Robin Hood were minor box office and critical successes.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} was still marred by {{technical}} difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the Warcraft II engine within two months to ensure that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to burrow and cloak, could be implemented. Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, constructed using 3D Studio Max. An isometric in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to Warcraft IIs 3/4s birdseye perspective. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> {{found in}} sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to}} the change in body size. The {{greatest}} regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E

5|$|Mobius Final Fantasy is a {{role-playing}} game {{designed for}} mobile phones. The player controls the game's protagonist Warrior of Light (Wol) while navigating Palamecia. Players can customize settings, graphical quality, and adjust controls for their dominant hand. During local navigation {{on the field}} map, the player taps a location on a map and the character travels to that location. In some self-contained areas, the player can directly control the character. Along with standard navigation, the player can navigate the game world using a fast-travel system, progressively unlocked as the player progresses through the story. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> in the game, such as the leveling system and exploration, {{are similar to those}} from previous home console Final Fantasy games.|$|E
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore shape is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> {{that makes the}} species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue stain. In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will stain slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped basidia, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of numbers}} and {{political}} {{isolation of the}} country at the time caused {{the creation of a new}} breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> of the classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of many of her royal Merina predecessors, the queen ruled from the royal Rova compound in Antananarivo. Between 1839 and 1842, Jean Laborde built the queen a new residence called Manjakamiadana, which became the largest structure on the Rova grounds. The residence was made entirely from wood and bore most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>features</b> of a traditional home of the Merina andriana (aristocratic class), including a central pillar (andry) to support the roof. In other ways it showcased distinctly European innovations, as it contained three floors entirely surrounded by wooden verandas and incorporated dormers in the shingled roof. The palace would eventually be encased in stone in 1867 by James Cameron of the London Missionary Society {{during the reign of}} Ranavalona II. The original wooden palace of Ranavalona and virtually all other structures of the historic Rova compound were destroyed in a 1995 fire, leaving only the stone shell to mark where her palace had once stood.|$|E
