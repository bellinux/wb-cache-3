50|$|Since most roadway {{improvements}} are funded by taxes or user fees, {{it is important}} that safety improvements pay for themselves. <b>On</b> <b>low</b> <b>speed,</b> low volume local roads, expensive {{improvements are}} likely to produce less in savings than they cost, and thus divert scarce resources from locations where they could be better used.

50|$|During a constant-bank level turn, {{increasing}} airspeed {{decreases the}} rate of turn, and increases the turn radius.

50|$|Generally, the Kaplan {{turbine works}} <b>on</b> <b>low</b> {{pressure}} heads (H) and high flow rates (Q). This {{implies that the}} Specific speed (Ns) on which Kaplan turbine functions is high as Specific speed (Nsp) is directly proportional to Flow (Q) and inversely proportional to Head (H). On the other hand, Francis turbine works <b>on</b> <b>low</b> Specific <b>speeds</b> i.e., high pressure heads.|$|R
50|$|Multi-lobe {{cam ring}} types (e.g. Rexroth, Hägglunds Drives, Poclain, Rotary Power or Eaton Hydre-MAC type) have a cam ring with {{multiple}} lobes and the piston rollers push outward against the cam ring. This produces a very smooth output with high starting torque {{but they are}} often limited in the upper speed range. This type of motor is available in a very wide range from about 1 litre/rev to 250 litres/rev. These motors are particularly good <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> applications and can develop very high power.|$|E
50|$|Van Jacobson TCP/IP Header Compression is a data {{compression}} protocol described in RFC 1144, specifically designed by Van Jacobson to improve TCP/IP performance over slow serial links. Van Jacobson compression reduces the normal 40 byte TCP/IP packet headers down to 3-4 bytes {{for the average}} case. It does this by saving the state of TCP connections {{at both ends of}} a link, and only sending the differences in the header fields that change. This makes a very big difference for interactive performance <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> links, although it will not do anything about the processing delay inherent to most dialup modems.|$|E
5000|$|T-tail - The {{horizontal}} stabiliser {{is mounted}} {{on top of the}} fin, creating a [...] "T" [...] shape when viewed from the front. T-tails keep the stabilisers out of the engine wake, and give better pitch control. T-tails have a good glide ratio, and are more efficient <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> aircraft. However, T-tails are more likely to enter a deep stall, and are more difficult to recover from a spin. T-tails must be stronger, and therefore heavier than conventional tails. T-tails also have a larger radar cross section. Examples include the Gloster Javelin, Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.|$|E

40|$|Urban regions {{contain a}} {{hierarchy}} of roadways, ranging from a dense network of <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> local roadways to sparser networks of higher speed roadways. Because minimizing travel time is usually more important than minimizing travel distance, vehicles may detour from the route of shortest distance {{to gain access to}} higher speed roadways. This paper uses continuous space models to analyze several urban travel decisions in which a driver must select between the shortest route <b>on</b> relatively <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> roadways and a longer route which includes travel on higher speed roadways. Results are presented graphically for deciding when to detour to faster roadways. Parallel and intersecting high speed roadways and limited access highways are considered. ...|$|R
50|$|Supporting {{the wire}} in the {{drainage}} table area {{are a number}} of drainage elements. In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage, the elements de-flocculate the sheet. <b>On</b> <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> machines these table elements are primarily table rolls. As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation. To prevent this drainage foils are used. The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action. Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine.|$|E
50|$|PFC {{mixtures}} must {{be placed}} {{on top of a}} pavement that is structurally sound and relatively impermeable. A surface treatment (under seal) or level-up layer may be needed prior to placing the PFC. When used <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> roadways, PFC mixtures can clog up more quickly thus negating the beneficial drainage characteristics. PFC mixtures tend to freeze faster and thaw slower (similar to a bridge) compared to conventional mixtures. PFC mixtures are not as resistant to high shearing forces therefore, they should be avoided on pavements where there are hard turning motions combined with braking such as short radius exit ramps, turnouts, etc.Generally speaking, it is not good to place any type of hot mix in cool or cold weather. PFC mixtures can be particularly difficult to place in cool weather because they are placed in thin lifts and they contain a high amount of polymer modified binder. They also do not lend themselves well to applications that require a significant amount of hand work.|$|E

Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E

Because the number of teeth on the ring gear is different from that on the fixed ground gear, the ring gear rotates at a fraction of a revolution and simultaneously rotates the output gear in one eccentric cycle in the opposite direction.

40|$|Low-speed {{wireless}} {{is becoming}} a popular way to connect mobile computers to the Internet and other networks. Users will desire the same services <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> links as they already have on higher speed networks. Since bandwidth will probably always be a limitation on wide area wireless links, protocol mechanisms {{need to be developed}} to use the available bandwidth <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> networks efficiently. In the face of growing address sizes, such as those in IPv 6, we offer a header compression scheme that enables efficient use of bandwidth when packets are small. The scheme uses soft state, works over simplex links, supports multicast transmission for real time applications, and besides providing more usable bandwidth on wireless links, allows better utilization of gateways and servers attached to wireless networks. 1 Introduction In the future, many end systems will be attached to the global Internet over relatively low-speed wireless links.

Combining such sensor information with Global Positioning System (GPS) {{is a practical}} solution for reducing the accumulated errors from encoders and moving the navigational base into global coordinates with high accuracy. This thesis presents integration methods of GPS and optical encoders for a mobile vehicle that is controlled by microcontroller. The system analyzed includes a commercial GPS receiver, dsPIC microcontroller and mobile vehicle with optical encoders. Extended kalman filtering (EKF), real time curve matching, GPS filtering methods are compared and contrasted which are used for integrating sensors data. Moreover, computer interface, encoder interface and motor control module of dsPIC microprocessor have been used and explained.
