5|$|The electoral {{conditions}} were announced as such: The election 67 districts {{were reduced to}} 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing no one who held a post recently was banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his would {{have the money to}} enter candidates. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair.|$|E
25|$|Minimal UTR length: UTRs contain {{specific}} {{characteristics that}} may impede transcription or translation, {{and thus the}} shortest UTRs <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all are encoded for in optimal expression vectors.|$|E
25|$|The back vowels /y/ and /ъ/ {{as well as}} front vowels {{other than}} /i/ do not occur word-initially: the two back vowels take prothetic /v/ and the front vowels prothetic /j/. Initial /a/ may take either prothetic {{consonant}} <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E
5000|$|Every citizen may confess any {{religion}} <b>or</b> profess <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. [...] Every legal restriction {{connected with}} the profession of no faith is now revoked.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{surrogate}} used and the complexity of the problem, the process may converge on a local or global optimum, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, {{outsourcing}} negates {{the need}} for an in-house team, thus reducing overhead - clients can literally operate with a bare bones marketing team, <b>or</b> even <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|R
25|$|A {{landmark}} {{study published}} Oct. 6 in The Journal of the American Medical Associationfound that bystanders who applied hands-only CPR {{were able to}} boost survival to 34% from 18% for those who got conventional CPR <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. In addition, {{the percentage of people}} willing to provide CPR rose from 28% in 2005 to 40% in 2009.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} the National Audit Office found that the Coalition had been interfering in the $328million {{regional}} grants program, with a bias toward their marginal seats, where projects under the Regional Partnerships Program were apparently approved without proper assessment, <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, {{and that there was}} an increase in approvals prior to the 2004 election.|$|E
25|$|The {{two major}} {{divisions}} of hadrosaurids are differentiated by their cranial ornamentation. While {{members of the}} Lambeosaurinae subfamily have hollow crests that differ depending on species, members of the Saurolophinae (Hadrosaurinae) subfamily have solid crests <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. Lambeosaurine crests had air chambers that may have produced a distinct sound and meant that their crests {{could have been used}} for both an audio and visual display.|$|E

50|$|Members of Chelidae have unique shell morphology. The {{carapace}} {{often has}} reduced surface exposure of neural bones, <b>or</b> even <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. This {{is due to}} less requirement for enlarged longissimus dorsi muscles in side-necked turtles.|$|R
60|$|So far as I know, {{there is}} no {{monograph}} on the subject, <b>or</b> there was <b>none</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|R
25|$|Both {{officers}} and enlisted wear rank insignia on each collar, which is affixed like a pin and not sewn on {{as in the}} Army/Air Force. Enlisted insignia is always black, while officers wear bright metal insignia in garrison and subdued insignia (<b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all) in the field. Most badges and breast insignia are authorized for wear on the utility uniform, shined or subdued as appropriate. Landing Support Marines also wear the Red Patch insignia.|$|E
25|$|Neoprene drysuits have {{a similar}} {{construction}} to wetsuits; these are often considerably thicker (7–8mm) and have sufficient inherent insulation to allow a lighter-weight undersuit (<b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all); however on deeper dives the neoprene can compress to as little as 2mm, losing some of its insulation. Compressed or crushed neoprene may also be used (where the neoprene is pre-compressed to 2–3mm) which avoids the variation of insulating properties with depth. These drysuits function more like a membrane suit.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Comfort (preferring a date c. 150–175) notes {{indications}} that the scribe's exemplar made limited use of nomina sacra <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. In several instances, the word for Spirit is written out in full where the context should require a nomen sacrum, suggesting that the scribe was rendering nomina sacra where appropriate for the meaning but struggling with Spirit versus spirit without guidance from the exemplar. Further, the text inconsistently uses either the short or the long contracted forms of Christ.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to find if someone is dressed in an animal costume, a black nose will be added alone to give the {{impression}} of an animal face and not just body. Sometimes, a full face is added <b>or</b> sometimes <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|R
50|$|Special {{abilities}} are special characteristics pertaining to generals which give them added advantages or abilities, {{and which are}} not affected by enemy spells or statuses. A general can have up {{to a maximum of}} three Special Abilities, <b>or</b> have <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|R
30|$|Every 〈n,f〉 {{system has}} a maximum relative-resilience factor {{that it can}} sustain. For n=f+ 1, any factor (c) is valid either for any MT (τmax=∞) <b>or</b> for <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all (τmax= 0). For the other {{illustrated}} systems, any c> 0 is valid only for a finite duration.|$|R

25|$|A {{branch of}} the U.S. mint (Manila Mint) was {{established}} in 1920 in Manila in the Philippines, which was then a U.S. colony. To date, the Manila Mint is the only U.S. mint established outside the continental U.S. and was responsible for producing coins for the colony (one, five, ten, twenty and fifty centavo denominations). This branch was in production from 1920 to 1922, and then again from 1925 through 1941. Coins struck by this mint bear either the M mintmark (for Manila) <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, similar to the Philadelphia mint at the time.|$|E
25|$|Living {{amphibians}} {{typically have}} small teeth, <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, since they commonly feed only on soft foods. In reptiles, teeth are generally simple and conical in shape, {{although there is}} some variation between species, most notably the venom-injecting fangs of snakes. The pattern of incisors, canines, premolars and molars is found only in mammals, and to varying extents, in their evolutionary ancestors. The numbers {{of these types of}} teeth vary greatly between species; zoologists use a standardised dental formula to describe the precise pattern in any given group.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand's European {{settlers}} {{also had}} to adapt to local circumstances, building with whatever materials were available, and employing tools of poor quality, <b>or</b> even <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. Settlers tended to use the Maori word whare (house), instead of 'hut', for a temporary or pioneer dwelling.|$|R
50|$|McEwen {{was known}} as a {{particularly}} cunning and tactical sprinter. Where many teams would use 'Lead-Out Trains' to secure a stage win for their selected sprinter, McEwen achieved many of his victories either with one lead-out man, <b>or</b> often <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, by aggressively and intelligently positioning himself within the peloton in the final kilometres.|$|R
50|$|Students of RSHSs {{receive a}} monthly stipend {{from the local}} {{government}} of its respective region. This monthly stipend is intended to support the academic expenses of the students such as research projects. Stipend of students vary from every RSHSs <b>or</b> maybe <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all like in Regional Science High School III, X as well as NCR.|$|R
25|$|Nudity, or nakedness, is {{the state}} of wearing no {{clothing}}. The wearing of clothing is a predominantly human characteristic arising from functional needs such as protection from the elements and from cold temperatures, after the loss of body hair, and migration to colder regions. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations, such as a need for warmth, as well as social circumstances. In some situations, a minimum amount of clothing <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all may be considered socially acceptable, while in others much more clothing may be expected. Social considerations involve cultural issues of modesty, subjective decency and social norms, besides other considerations, and these may depend on the context. There may also be legal considerations.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, college administrators urged its undergraduate members to stay in school. However, many were eager to enlist. The first Phis {{to fight in the}} war were members of the chapters at the University of Toronto and McGill University, the fraternity's only Canadian chapters during that period. By the time the United States entered the war in 1917, over 5000 Phis served in the conflict with 155 of them losing their lives. Because many of the undergraduate Phis put their studies on hold, many chapter houses either had limited occupants <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. To prevent losing houses pending the return of Phis from the war, many housing corporations consented to having the houses used as barracks or for YMCA programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{autonomous}} communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, {{with their own}} parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution {{was intended to be}} asymmetrical. Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy. Aside of fiscal autonomy, the nationalities—Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were devolved more powers {{than the rest of the}} communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: Ertzaintza, Mossos d'Esquadra and the Policía Foral respectively. Other communities have more limited forces <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, like the Policía Autónoma Andaluza in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{interfaces}} {{can contain}} many methods they may contain only one <b>or</b> even <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all. For example, the Java language defines the interface [...] {{that has the}} single [...] method; various implementations are used for different purposes, including , , , , and [...] Marker interfaces like [...] contain no methods at all and serve to provide run-time information to generic processing using Reflection.|$|R
50|$|In {{distribution}} ray tracing, at {{each point}} of intersection, multiple rays may be spawned. In path tracing, however, {{only a single}} ray <b>or</b> <b>none</b> is fired <b>at</b> each intersection, utilizing the statistical nature of Monte Carlo experiments.|$|R
25|$|The loincloth {{continues}} to be worn by {{people around the world}} – it is the traditional form of undergarment in many Asian societies, for example. In various, mainly tropical, cultures, the traditional male dress may still consist of only a single garment below the waist <b>or</b> even <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, with underwear as optional, including the Indian dhoti and lungi, or the Scottish kilt.|$|R
25|$|The given probabilities {{depend on}} {{specific}} assumptions {{about how the}} host and contestant choose their doors. A key insight is that, under these standard conditions, there is more information about doors 2 and 3 that was not available {{at the beginning of}} the game, when the door 1 was chosen by the player: the host's deliberate action adds value to the door he did not choose to eliminate, but not to the one chosen by the contestant originally. Another insight is that switching doors is a different action than choosing between the two remaining doors at random, as the first action uses the previous information and the latter does not. Other possible behaviors than the one described can reveal different additional information, <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, and yield different probabilities.|$|E
25|$|If {{a player}} bets {{and all other}} players fold, then the {{remaining}} player is awarded the pot and {{is not required to}} show their hole cards. If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a showdown occurs. On the showdown, each player plays the best poker hand they can make from the seven cards comprising their two-hole cards and the five community cards. A player may use both of their own two hole cards, only one, <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, to form their final five-card hand. If the five community cards form the player's best hand, then the player is said to be playing the board and can only hope to split the pot, because each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand.|$|E
25|$|Based in {{a survey}} with about 10,000 respondents, IFOP {{estimated}} that 90% of French people are heterosexual, 3% identify as bisexual, and 4% consider themselves homosexual. Two percent say they have not embraced a definition for their sexuality, and 1% {{did not wish to}} respond. More women than men are heterosexual (93% v. 86%), whereas more men than women identify as homosexual (7% v. 1%) {{and to a lesser extent}} bisexual (4% v. 2%). A homosexual or bisexual identity was more common in people aged 18–49 (9%) than among those aged 50–64 (6%) or over 65 (4%). More singles than people in relationships identified as homo- or bisexual (11% v. 6%). An LGB identity is also more common among people who said they have had more than 10 sex partners <b>or</b> <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all compared to those who have had intermediary levels of sexual experience. Catholics are more likely to identify as heterosexual (91%) than people who said they had some other religion or no religion whatsoever (88% each).|$|E
50|$|Humidity has {{a highly}} {{negative}} effect on camera traps and can result in camera malfunction.This can be problematic since the malfunction is often not immediately discovered, so {{a large portion of}} research time can be lost. Often a researcher expecting the experiment to be complete will trek back to the site, only to discover far less data than expected - <b>or</b> even <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|R
50|$|Teenage {{girls were}} {{unlikely}} to be taking the pill, and did not seek doctors' prescriptions for it. This was because they knew doctors {{would be unlikely to}} provide them with it as it was against the policy of the New Zealand Medical Association to do so, and because it was expensive for young women likely to be earning a low wage, <b>or</b> even <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|R
50|$|The loincloth {{continues}} to be worn by {{people around the world}} - it is the traditional form of undergarment in many Asian societies, for example. In various, mainly tropical, cultures, the traditional male dress may still consist of only a single garment below the waist <b>or</b> even <b>none</b> <b>at</b> all, with underwear as optional, including the Far-Eastern dhoti and lungi, or the Scottish kilt.|$|R
