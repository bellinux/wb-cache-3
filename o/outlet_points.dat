40|$|Tunnel {{wash water}} is {{frequently}} {{released to the}} river Årungselva through a sedimentation pond. This tunnel wash water may cause harm to the fish through intrinsic and extrinsic toxic effects. A reduction in growth have previously been observed for 0 + brown trout at downstream locations of the sedimentation pond, where fish located below <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> of the sedimentation pond had a 21 % lower length than fish located above the sedimentation pond. As no reduction in growth were observed prior {{to the establishment of}} the sedimentation pond, the author suggested that the reduced growth could be due to the toxic effect from the tunnel wash water. Since migration and density was not accounted for, it remains enigmatic whether the observed difference was solely due to the suggested toxic effect. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate differences in survival, growth and migration of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) caught above and below the <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> of the Vassum sedimentation pond in Årungselva. The study was conducted using capture-mark-recapture methodology in combination with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT) telemetry with two antennas. This set-up allowed for estimation of survival, individual growth and migration. In total, 520 individuals were caught by electric fishing. Out of these, 253 individuals were PITtagged from which 75 were resighted at least once during the November 2014 -October 2015 study period. The results show a lower size-adjusted survival in both species for individuals caught below the <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> compared to those caught above the <b>outlet</b> <b>point.</b> Further, a lower length-at age among 0 + parr of brown trout and 1 + parr of Atlantic salmon, as well as lower length at first-winter for Atlantic salmon parr, were observed for below-individuals compared to above-individuals. The reduced survival and growth rate observed in this study occur despite the fact that fish density is lower at below-sites of the <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> of the sedimentation pond. Water chemistry variables generally did not vary between above and below sites, apart from chloride, sulphate and uranium that all attained higher below-values. However, other physiochemical variables that vary between above and below <b>outlet</b> <b>point</b> sites may influence growth and survival.

50|$|Membrane {{air dryers}} depress the {{incoming}} dew point. Most dryers have a challenge air dew point and pressure specification. So if the inlet dew point {{is lower than}} the specified challenge air then the <b>outlet</b> dew <b>point</b> is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F dew point with a challenge of +70 °F dew point and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet dew point of only 32 °F, the <b>outlet</b> dew <b>point</b> will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the <b>outlet</b> dew <b>point</b> will be lowered. This lowering of the <b>outlet</b> dew <b>point</b> is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower <b>outlet</b> dew <b>point</b> than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent {{on the nature of the}} membrane and could vary among manufacturers.|$|R

Catchment attributes are utilised to obtain values for conceptual model parameters. This way modelling can take place in an ungauged catchment without the need for stream gauge data to perform calibration. Two hydrological models were used {{as a starting point for}} model development. These were a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model (IHACRES) (Jakeman & Hornberger 1993) and a physics-based conceptual groundwater discharge model (Sloan 2000). The modelling aims to appropriately disaggregate the catchment in order to improve on previous catchment or sub-catchment hydrology models, so that hydrological modelling can be carried out at the management scale. SCALE OF CATCHMENT DISAGGREGATION AND MODELLING To disaggregate the catchment into meaningful hydrological units requires manipulation of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using a number of steps within a Geographic Information System (GIS). These steps include (in order) : estimation of flow direction and flow accumulation surfaces; stream links based on a threshold flow accumulation; and, stream ordering. Once the stream orders were determined, <b>outlet</b> <b>points</b> are estimated based on the maximum flow accumulation of each stream order link. Using these <b>outlet</b> <b>points</b> sub...|$|E

Other than gas transfer, oxygenators also provide a gas/air trapping protective function. The inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>points</b> of an oxygenator are specifically at its base to enable any air within the circuit, which would ‘rise’, to be removed via the outlet {{at the top of the}} oxygenator and hence eradicated from the circuit. Whilst the comparative buoyancy properties of Definity® microspheres in normal saline versus blood are not known, these microspheres are buoyant and will rise to the surface in a liquid [26].

Typical long and large tunnel (LLT) systems consist of a gasification channel, two auxiliary holes, and two auxiliary tunnels (Figure 2). The auxiliary holes are arranged between the injection and production wells and are used as malfunction holes for the injection of air and water vapor, or to discharge gas for added gasifier control. LLT also includes an auxiliary tunnel constructed of bricks, which is an auxiliary installation for air injection that prevents blockage in the gasification channel. The mined tunnels are isolated by sealing walls to prevent leakage of combustible gases from the gasifier [35]. The location and height of the oxidant injection points and gas <b>outlet</b> <b>points</b> can be adjusted, allowing for two-dimensional control of oxidant injection and gas production [28].|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} some theoretical {{aspects of}} the optimal design of multi-scale fluid distributors or collectors, built on a binary or quaternary branching pattern of pores. The design aims to distribute uniformly a fluid flow over a specified square surface (uniform irrigation) while simultaneously minimizing the residence time, the residence-time distribution, the pressure drop and the viscous dissipation, leading to an optimization problem of the pore-size distribution, for both length and diameter. For the binary branching, the uniform distribution of <b>outlet</b> <b>points</b> requires a particular, non-monotonous scaling law for pore lengths, and this distinguishes the structure from fractal branching patterns that have been studied previously. The quaternary branching allows a fractal-type structure (constant scale ratios for both pore length and radius). An important general result is established: in the optimal pore-size distribution, the density of viscous dissipation power (Wm- 3) is uniformly distributed over the volume at all scales...|$|E

Estimation of the volume of water collected in these tanks, and determining the spatial and temporal distribution of the available water at various locations in the watershed are the two main aspects in agricultural land-use management. While, geographic information systems (GIS) -based approaches are used in estimating the volumes of water, routing is carried out in passing these volumes through the channels to the outlet of the main watershed. Extraction or determination of the location of the outlets of these tanks therefore. becomes essential to know the points where the water is available and where from it could be distributed appropriately. An algorithm was developed for automatic identification or location of tank outlets as well as tank boundaries, wherein the advantages of digital elevation models (DEM), that have become an essential and integral part of distributed, i. e. GIS-based approaches in hydrological modelling, are used beneficially and to overcome the difficulty in locating these tank outlets manually. The details of the algorithm are reported in this paper.

For that specific application we simulated the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets with an existing 3 -D thermomechanical ice sheet model, which calculates changes in topography due to changes in ice cover and isostatic adjustment, as well as the evolution of freshwater fluxes resulting from surface ablation, iceberg calving and basal melt. The continental runoff model takes this input, calculates the drainage pathways and routes the freshwater fluxes to the surface grid points of an existing ocean model. This results in a chronology of temporally and spatially varying freshwater fluxes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present day.
