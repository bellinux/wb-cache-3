40|$|DE 102006047197 B 3 UPAB: 20080306 NOVELTY - The device has a weigher (10) for {{weighing}} sub-band signal with a weighing factor (C-k) that is specified for the sub-band signal around a subband-signal (11) {{to hold a}} weight. A corrected determinator (12) is provided for calculating a correction term. The correction term determinator calculates the correction term under application of another sub-band signal (X-l) and under application of another weighing factor (C-l), which is provided for the other sub-band signal. The <b>other</b> <b>weighing</b> factor is different from weighing factor and a combiner (13) for combining the weighted sub-band signal. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for processing a real sub-band signal (2) an analysis filter bank has a mechanism for producing multiple sub-band signals from a time-discrete signal (3) a synthesis filter bank (4) a method for filtering a time-discrete signal (5) a method for synthesizing a signal (6) a computer program has a program code for execution of the method. USE - Device for processing a realistic sub-band signal of multiple realistic sub-band signals, particularly audio or video signals, which are the representation of realistic time discrete signals that are produced by an analysis filter bank. ADVANTAGE - The corrected determinator is provided for calculating a correction term. The correction term determinator calculates the correction term under application of another sub-band signal and under application of another weighing factor, which is provided for the other sub-band signal. The <b>other</b> <b>weighing</b> factor is different from weighing factor and a combiner for combining the weighted sub-band signal, and thus ensures an efficient and highly qualitative processing of signals...|$|R

40|$|Background: Monthly {{weighing}} {{session in}} Posyandu {{is an important}} activity for growth monitoring and promotion escpecially for children below five years old. By knowing weight every month, growth trajectory can be assessed and nutrition intervention and education can be applied. However, {{there has been a}} tendency of decreasing coverage of Posyandu in Indonesia during recent years. Objectives: To determine the coverage of children below five years old attending Posyandu or other weghing post. Methods: Data used for the analysis was from Susenas Modul (VSEN. 2004. MPK). Samples were children aged 0 – 59 months weighted in Posyandu or <b>other</b> <b>weighing</b> post one month prior to data collection. Analysis of weighing coverage was based on some variables including province, urban rural area, age of children, frequency of visit to health facilities, and household expenditur. Results: Out of a total 21, 932 children included in the analysis, 50. 4 % attended Posyandu or <b>other</b> <b>weighing</b> session, 47. 9 % not attended, and 2. 1 % did not know. The figure was lower than the target of 80 % coverage set by MOH. The coverage varied among provinces, the lowest was found in North Sumatra (29. 6 %) and the highest in DI Yogjakarta (77. 3 %). The coverage was higher in urban areas (56. 9 %) than that in rural areas (45. 3 %). There was a trend of decreasing coverage by increasing age of children. The coverage of weighing participation of babies aged less than 6 months old was 68. 2 % and continued to decrease especially after the age of 24 months old to only 33. 0 % among children aged 48 months old or older.
