Methods: Twenty rabbits were randomly divided into normal group (n= 5), 7 h group, 24 h group, 1 week after model establishment Group.

25|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen is more {{difficult}} to calculate, as it is derived from two sources, the added oxygen and the air top-up. However, all of the nitrogen is provided by the air top-up, so the partial pressure of the nitrogen is calculated in a similar way as for helium, which allows the pressure of the air to be calculated, assuming nitrogen to be 79% of the air. In the Tx 20/40 example, the fraction of nitrogen is 100% - (20% + 40%) = 40%. The required partial pressure of nitrogen is therefore 230bar x 40% = 92bar, so the air top-up pressure is 92bar/79% = 116bar (for a 3,000psi fill this would be 3,000 x 40% / 79% = 1,500psi of air). The remaining pressure of 230bar - 92bar - 116bar = 22bar is the added <b>oxygen</b> <b>pressure</b> required for the mix (for a 3,000psi fill this would be 3,000 - 1,200 - 1,500 = 300psi of oxygen).|$|E
500|$|In some diver {{training}} courses for {{these types of}} diving, divers are taught to plan and monitor {{what is called the}} oxygen clock of their dives. This is a notional alarm clock, which ticks more quickly at increased <b>oxygen</b> <b>pressure</b> and is set to activate at the maximum single exposure limit recommended in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Diving Manual. For the following partial pressures of oxygen the limits are: 45 minutes at , 120 minutes at , 150 minutes at , 180 minutes at [...] and 210 minutes at , but it is impossible to predict with any reliability whether or when toxicity symptoms will occur. Many nitrox-capable dive computers calculate an oxygen loading and can track it across multiple dives. The aim is to avoid activating the alarm by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas or by reducing the time spent breathing gas of greater oxygen partial pressure. As the partial pressure of oxygen increases with the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas and the depth of the dive, the diver obtains more time on the oxygen clock by diving at a shallower depth, by breathing a less oxygen-rich gas, or by shortening the duration of exposure to oxygen-rich gases.|$|E

50|$|Typically, fetal {{arterial}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>pressures</b> {{are lower}} than adult arterial <b>oxygen</b> <b>pressures.</b> Hence higher affinity to bind oxygen is required at lower levels of partial pressure in the fetus to allow diffusion of oxygen across the placenta. At the placenta, there is a higher concentration of 2,3-BPG formed, and 2,3-BPG binds readily to beta chains rather than to alpha chains. As a result, 2,3-BPG binds more strongly to adult hemoglobin, causing HbA to release more oxygen for uptake by the fetus, whose HbF is unaffected by the 2,3-BPG. HbF then delivers that bound oxygen to tissues that have even lower partial pressures {{where it can be}} released.|$|R
