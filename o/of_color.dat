40|$|For each prime p > 7 we {{obtain the}} {{expression}} for an {{upper bound on}} the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> needed to non-trivially color T(2, p), the torus knots of type (2, p), modulo p. This expression is t + 2 l - 1 where t and l are extracted from the prime p. It is obtained from iterating the so-called Teneva transformations which we introduced in a previous article. With the aid of our estimate we show that the ratio "number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> needed vs. number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> available" tends to decrease with increasing modulus p. For instance as of prime 331, the number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> needed is already one tenth of the number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> available. Furthermore, we prove that 5 is minimum number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> needed to non-trivially color T(2, 11) modulo 11. Finally, as a preview of our future work, we prove that 5 is the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> modulo 11 for two rational knots with determinant 11.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} greedy T-colorings of graphs, i. e.  T-colorings {{produced}} by the greedy (or first-fit) algorithm. We study their parameters, such as the number <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> the span, the edge span and the values <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> they use. In particular, we show that these T-colorings have three nice properties: (1) their span and edge span are equal; (2) the number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> they use is independent of T; (3) the set <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> they use {{is a function of}} T and the number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> used, only. As a result of these considerations we receive some necessary and sufficient conditions for a greedy T-coloring to be optimal. The paper ends with some considerations concerning greedy algorithms with color interchange...|$|R
