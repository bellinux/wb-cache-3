5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects a different kind <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to each parent {{as well as to}} alternate caregivers. Pattern <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In implant {{retained}} {{soft tissue}} supported type dentures functioning <b>of</b> <b>attachments,</b> presented bytheir producers as mechanically bio-compatible {{because of the}} ensured freedom of rotational displacements isaccompanied by numerous problems {{that seem to be}} caused by excessive bearing of occlusal loads. Design/methodology/approach: For the purposes <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> loadings evaluation, built was a threedimensionalFEM model of a denture situated on an atrophic prosthetic foundation with joint supports assumed inthe area <b>of</b> denture <b>attachment</b> to implants. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> loadings has been carried out under unilateraloblique occlusal forces of 100 N in molars and incisors zones. Findings: Used methodology made it possible to determine attachments loading in a quantitative manner. Inspite of free rotational movements implantological supports bear significant part of horizontal occlusal forcescomponents, which reach the value of 66 N during chewing processes. Research limitations/implications: Examined was only the most commonly used type <b>of</b> <b>attachments.</b> Hence,further studies, apart from constrains enabling rotational movements introduced should be also an axial compliancewhich is already offered by some types <b>of</b> <b>attachments,</b> and which additionally enables sedimentation of thedenture towards the axes of implants. Practical implications: Analysis of loadings related to implantological <b>attachments</b> in case <b>of</b> assuming onlya vertical component of occlusal forces leads to a significant underestimation of implantological supports loadsvalues. In the presented analysis, taking into account the influence of the obliquely acting occlusal forces that occurin real chewing conditions, it has been proved that freedom of rotational movements of overdenture`s attachmentsdoes not allow to use the natural supports of mucous membrane. That explains the reason <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> andacrylic resin dentures damages, as well as the significant number of lost implants of upper denture resultingfrom biomechanical causes. In clinical practice, achieved should be the most anterior implants’ placement, andespecially in case of flat ridges {{because of the lack of}} any bearing surface. Originality/value: Determined loadings of supports might constitute a starting point for further biomechanicalevaluation <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> solutions that function according to similar principles, without the necessity of buildingcomplex models of the whole system...|$|R

5|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{to the notion of}} the universality <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of amae plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where amae is practiced.

Most recently a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.|$|E

5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> theory, there are many significant differences between the two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E

5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one <b>of</b> <b>Attachment</b> (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become attached to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory was}} {{extended}} to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> {{have been identified in}} adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E

5|$|The {{pathological}} {{absence of}} a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as styles or patterns. There are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, (all organized) and disorganized. The latter three are characterised as insecure. These are assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, designed to assess the quality <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> rather than whether an attachment exists at all.|$|R
50|$|Attachment style can {{impact the}} {{relationships}} <b>of</b> people. <b>Attachment</b> is established {{in early childhood}} and attachment continues in adulthood. An example <b>of</b> secure <b>attachment</b> continuing in adulthood would be when the person feels confident {{and is able to}} meet their own needs. An example <b>of</b> anxious <b>attachment</b> during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.|$|R

These polyphagan beetle groups can be identified {{by the presence of}} cervical sclerites (hardened parts of the head used as points <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> for muscles) absent in the other suborders.|$|E
5|$|Principles <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> theory {{have been}} used to explain adult social behaviours, {{including}} mating, social dominance and hierarchical power structures, in-group identification, group coalitions, and negotiation of reciprocity and justice. Those explanations {{have been used}} to design parental care training, and have been particularly successful in the design of child abuse prevention programmes.|$|E
5|$|Research {{from the}} late 1990s {{indicated}} there were disorders <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD. Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We studied {{post-mortem}} 9 nonsmokers' {{lungs and}} 9 smokers' lungs {{as well as}} 14 surgical smokers' lungs to examine the possible relationship of the number <b>of</b> alveolar <b>attachments</b> with airways inflammation and with lung function. Alveolar attachments are the alveolar walls radially attached to the small airways, and any discontinuity or rupture of these alveolar walls was considered abnormal. Normal and abnormal attachments were counted in nonsmokers and smokers and expressed as number <b>of</b> <b>attachments,</b> distance between <b>attachments,</b> and percentage <b>of</b> abnormal <b>attachments.</b> Although internal small airways diameter and mean linear intercept {{were not significantly different}} between smokers of either group and nonsmokers, significant differences in number <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> (p less than 0. 001), distance between attachments (p less than 0. 01), and percentage <b>of</b> abnormal <b>attachments</b> (p less than 0. 01) were found. The 3 indexes <b>of</b> alveolar <b>attachments</b> correlated significantly with the score for airways inflammation and with the elastic recoil pressure in smokers. No significant correlation with any other lung function test was found. We conclude that smokers have fewer alveolar attachments than do nonsmokers, and that the loss <b>of</b> alveolar <b>attachments</b> represents an early stage in the destruction of lung parenchyma, and is probably linked to inflammation of the small airways. Because of the strategic situation of this lesion, it could be responsible in part for the loss of elastic recoil seen in the initial stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|R
