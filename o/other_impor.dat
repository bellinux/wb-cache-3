Congress has been situated on the outside edge of the subfield of American Political Development (APD) despite the institution’s centrality both to the political his-tory of the United States and to political science as a dis-cipline. Apart from an important but limited number of works—including a long-term research enterprise on the role of sectionalism conducted by Richard Bensel, a study of the antebellum Senate by Elaine Swift, an assessment of the alliance between farmers and workers in the half-century after 1877 by Elizabeth Sanders, a major work on institutional transformations in the House and Senate by Eric Schickler, and a small number of emergent inquiries 1 —“scholars in the American Political Develop-ment tradition, ” as Keith Whittington has noted, “have never fully integrated Congress, as they have <b>other</b> <b>impor...</b>|$|E

However, it is less well understood how this manifests {{at the level of the}} heart where chamber geometry and the extracellular matrix are also deter-minants of diastolic stiffness. Titin isoform switching will not only alter titin’s stiffness, but it could also impact <b>other</b> <b>impor...</b>|$|E
