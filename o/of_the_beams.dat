5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} theory is that it was named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local people say that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may have been broken up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another theory is that it was named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
25|$|Severely damaged {{building}} of Agriculture Development Bank of China after 2008 Sichuan earthquake: most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> and pier columns are sheared.

25|$|However {{this effort}} was not {{successful}} for Heavy Ion Fusion, {{due to lack}} of sufficient focusing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams,</b> despite the high power used. It had been {{known for a long time}} that the Lorentz forces were radial but the current flow was highly unstable and rotated along the cylinder which causes twisting of the imploding tube therefore decreasing the quality of the compression.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are provided {{for determining the}} strain developed in a coated surface. A beam with a coating on a surface thereof is mounted as a cantilever and a {{force is applied to}} <b>the</b> free end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> to cause deflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> until <b>the</b> coating on <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> fails. <b>The</b> strain in <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> and hence in the coating at <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> failure, is determined based on <b>the</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> <b>the</b> point along <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> where failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coating occurs and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> deflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> and this determination is made independently <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> and <b>the</b> material from which <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> is made. <b>The</b> determination is made based on the equation E= 1. 5 hdx/l(exp 3), where E is strain, h is <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> thickness, d is <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> deflection, x is the distance from <b>the</b> free end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> to <b>the</b> point where failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coating occurred, and l is <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|R
30|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} of circularly symmetric Gaussian beams with increasing distance and turbulence strength.

30|$|Supplemental {{strengthening}} {{for this}} beam consisted of placing CFRP sheets parallel (at 0 °) to <b>the</b> longitudinal axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> {{in areas where}} there was no initial strengthening (Figure  3). Then, a CFRP sheet was placed perpendicular (at 90 °) to <b>the</b> longitudinal axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> with <b>the</b> left corner positioned 1, 447.8 mm (4 ft 9 in.) from <b>the</b> left end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> This sheet covered the bottom and two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> Next, seven sheets of CFRP fabric were placed over the existing layers, at 135 ° (− 45 °) to <b>the</b> longitudinal axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> <b>The</b> placement <b>of</b> these sheets started with the upper right corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first sheet placed 914.4 mm (3 ft) from <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> Subsequent sheets were butted up to the sheets placed earlier. Finally, six additional sheets were applied to <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> at 45 ° with <b>the</b> longitudinal axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> Placement <b>of</b> these sheets began with the first sheet being placed at right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> As shown in Figure  7, the similar strengthening pattern was kept on the opposite face side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> also. Diagonal shear failure modes observed in each test are also indicated in this figure.|$|R

25|$|Illumination of the {{phosphor}} {{is achieved}} using UV light. Most thermographic phosphors absorb {{light in a}} broad band in the UV and therefore can be excited using a YAG:Nd laser. Theoretically, the same light can be used both for PIV and temperature measurements, but this would mean that UV-sensitive cameras are needed. In practice, two different beams originated in separate lasers are overlapped. While one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> is used for velocity measurements, the other is {{used to measure the}} temperature.|$|E
25|$|Among the First Class cabins {{there were}} only four luxury suites, this being {{considered}} enough for even a premiere liner on the South American route. But First Class facilities did include a Grand Hall with a stage and a dance floor, an Observation Lounge, writing rooms, a library that could double as a chapel, and the smokeroom complete with stone fireplace, timber beams, stone corbels supporting some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams,</b> wood panelling, and even some Gothic Revival stone tracery.

40|$|A circularly {{polarized}} electromagnetic beam is considered, which is absorbed by a plane, and the mechanical stress {{produced in the}} plane by <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> is calculated. It is shown that <b>the</b> central part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> produces a torque at <b>the</b> central region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane due to <b>the</b> spin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam,</b> and <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> produces an additional torque due to orbital angular momentum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> <b>The</b> total torque acting on the plane equals twice <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> divided by <b>the</b> frequency. This fact contradicts the standard electrodynamics, which predicts the torque equals power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> divided by frequency, and means the electrodynamics, {{as well as the}} whole classical field theory, is incomplete.

30|$|A {{total of}} six LVDTs were used to {{continuously}} monitor and measure <b>the</b> vertical deflections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam.</b> LVDTs were placed under each beam support (North and South ends) on either sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> (West and East). Two pairs of LVDTs were positioned under <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> at each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two loading points.

25|$|Due to {{limitations}} in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, {{it has not}} been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, {{solely on the basis of}} the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{inaccuracy}} {{of celestial}} navigation for night navigation and target finding in a fast moving aircraft, the Luftwaffe developed radio navigation devices and relied on three systems: Knickebein (Crooked leg), X-Gerät (X-Device), and Y-Gerät (Y-Device). This led the British to develop countermeasures, which {{became known as}} the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beams.</b> Bomber crews already had some experience with the Lorenz beam, a commercial blind-landing aid for night or bad weather landings. The Germans adapted the short-range Lorenz system into Knickebein, a 30–33MHz system, which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signals. Two aerials at ground stations were rotated so that their beams converged over the target. The German bombers would fly along either beam until they picked up the signal from the other beam. When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and dropped their bombs.|$|E
25|$|If, {{instead of}} hitting a {{detector}} screen, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> of atoms {{coming out of}} the Stern-Gerlach apparatus is passed into another (inhomogeneous) magnetic field oriented in the same direction, all of the atoms will be deflected the same way in this second field. However, if the second field is oriented at 90° to the first, then half of the atoms will be deflected one way and half the other, so that the atom's spin about the horizontal and vertical axes are independent of each other. However, if one of these beams (e.g. the atoms that were deflected up then left) is passed into a third magnetic field, oriented {{the same way as the}} first, half of the atoms will go one way and half the other, even though they all went in the same direction originally. The action of measuring the atoms' spin with respect to a horizontal field has changed their spin with respect to a vertical field.|$|E

25|$|Radio galaxies, and to {{a lesser}} extent, radio-loud quasars display a wide range of {{structures}} in radio maps. The most common large-scale structures are called lobes: these are double, often fairly symmetrical, roughly ellipsoidal structures placed {{on either side of the}} active nucleus. A significant minority of low-luminosity sources exhibit structures usually known as plumes which are much more elongated. Some radio galaxies show one or two long narrow features known as jets (the most famous example being the giant galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster) coming directly from the nucleus and going to the lobes. Since the 1970s, the most widely accepted model has been that the lobes or plumes are powered by beams of high-energy particles and magnetic field coming from close to the active nucleus. The jets are believed to be the visible manifestations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams,</b> and often the term jet is used to refer both to the observable feature and to the underlying flow.|$|E
25|$|In circularly {{polarized}} light {{the direction of}} the electric field rotates at the frequency of the light, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. In a material, this electric field causes a force on the charged particles comprising the material (because of their low mass, the electrons are most heavily affected). The motion thus effected will be circular, and circularly moving charges will create their own (magnetic) field in addition to the external magnetic field. There will thus be two different cases: the created field will be parallel to the external field for one (circular) polarization, and in the opposing direction for the other polarization direction – thus the net B field is enhanced in one direction and diminished in the opposite direction. This changes the dynamics of the interaction for each beam and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams</b> will be slowed down more than the other, causing a phase difference between the left- and right-polarized beam. When the two beams are added after this phase shift, the result is again a linearly polarized beam, but with a rotation in the polarization direction.|$|E
25|$|The main door {{is made of}} double-leafed {{timber and}} painted with phoenixes. The two side doors {{flanking}} the main door are painted with door gods. The main door is usually kept barred except on important occasions. The roof ridges and eaves of the temple have chien nien ornamentation and plaster relief-work. Chen nien ornamentation is the tradition southern Chinese art of creating figures, flowers, leaves and other images with small pieces of colourful porcelain. Another key feature of traditional Chinese building is exposed structural elements. Traditionally constructed without nails, {{the weight of the}} roof is supported on the columns on which rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beams.</b> Walls in Chinese temples do not bear the weight of the roof. The exposed structure shows off the ingenious carpentry. The roof of the main hall is a two-tiered xie shan roof with curved swallow tail ridge ends. In the centre of the roof ridge are two prancing dragons on either side of a blazing pearl. At the ends of the lower-tier roof are Minnan spirals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>The</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> and its engineering applications is obvious, and it undergoes {{different kinds}} of loading.
