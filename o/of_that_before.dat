5|$|The Allied {{submarine}} {{campaign and}} the mining of Japanese coastal waters had largely destroyed the Japanese merchant fleet. With few natural resources, Japan was dependent on raw materials, particularly oil, imported from Manchuria {{and other parts of}} the East Asian mainland, and from the conquered territory in the Dutch East Indies. The destruction of the Japanese merchant fleet, combined with the strategic bombing of Japanese industry, had wrecked Japan's war economy. Production of coal, iron, steel, rubber, and other vital supplies was only a fraction <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> the war.|$|E
25|$|The first Test of the three-match {{series in}} South Africa, at Newlands, was over inside {{three days after}} Stuart Clark claimed nine for 89 on Test debut to be named Man of the Match in Australia's seven-wicket win. South Africa batted first, making 205 with Nicky Boje's 31 from number nine the highest score, and Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting then brought Australia within 30 <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> Ponting was caught off the bowling of Jacques Kallis. Another half-century, from Andrew Symonds, took Australia to a lead of 103, and Clark was leading wicket-taker in the second innings to bowl South Africa out for 197, and despite three wickets from Makhaya Ntini, Australia {{made it to the}} target and won their third {{successive}} Test against South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{transport}} {{made it impossible}} to supply a garrison west of El Agheila, the most favourable position for a defensive line and restricted the 2nd Armoured Division to movement between supply dumps, reducing its limited mobility further. In February, Lieutenant-General Philip Neame took over Cyrcom and predicted that the armoured division would lose many tanks through breakdowns if it had to move far. Neame asked for a proper armoured division, two infantry divisions and adequate air support to hold the area; he was told that there was little to send and none <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> April. In early March, the 9th Australian Division began to relieve the 6th Australian Division (Major-General Iven Mackay) at Mersa Brega for shipment to Greece, which demonstrated the difficulty of tactical moves with insufficient transport and it was withdrawn to the area east of Benghazi.|$|E

500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E
2500|$|The V Corps {{bombardment}} {{was intended}} to create tactical surprise, by the heavy artillery firing on the German front line thirty minutes before dawn each morning, for an hour of intense fire joined by the field artillery. It was hoped that the German garrisons would become accustomed to the routine and not react, when the opening bombardment for the attack began at [...] No man's land [...] back from the front trench was to be bombarded by 25 percent of the 18-pounders, to cover the infantry as it advanced from the British line. After six minutes the bombardment would creep forward at [...] in five minutes, pausing on the reserve line of the German front trench system before moving on. The infantry had [...] to reach the first objective {{and then move on}} after a pause of an hour. After five minutes of silence a lifting bombardment beginning with intense fire, would signal the infantry to begin their advance. The attack by the 63rd Division on Beaucourt was to begin [...] after zero, preceded by a bombardment from all available artillery. A few tanks were available and the bombardment was twice the weight <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> 1 July. A machine-gun barrage (first tried at the Battle of Thiepval Ridge, [...] September) was to be laid on the German machine-guns dug in along the ridge behind Beaumont Hamel.|$|E
2500|$|Sir John Cokayne first {{appearance}} {{in the history of}} his region was as a bandit leader in the reign of Richard II. On 26 February 1388, while John of Gaunt was abroad and the Lords Appellant, including Gaunt's son, [...] Henry Bolingbroke, were at the height of their power, Cockayne's name headed the list of a group of young landed gentry accused of [...] "divers enormous offences in the county of Derby, against the ministers, officers and servants of the king's uncle John, duke of Lancaster." [...] It was alleged that they had set an ambush to kill Gaunt's officials. A substantial party of Midlands landowners, headed by Robert de Ferrers, 4th Baron Ferrers of Chartley, was deputed to bring Cockayne and his gang to justice. Among the posse were Sir Walter Blount, a justice of the peace, a veteran of Gaunt's campaigns and his main representative in the region, John Ipstones and Thomas Beek, both rewarded by Gaunt for their service in his campaign for the Crown of Castile. Ipstones had a reputation for violence and had besieged Blount's home with an armed band the previous year during a dispute over a bond that Blount had taken from John Moston, a tenant of Ipstones. This internecine warfare among Gaunt's affinity was a principal part of the wave of violence afflicting the north Midlands, a major embarrassment for Gaunt, who had been arguing in parliament that the great lords' affinities were a force for order. Cokayne's main disruptive activity seems to have been breaking into Gaunt's enclosures. Despite his family links with Gaunt, Cockayne was not at this time part of the duke's affinity: Simon Walker, the historian of the affinity, found no clear evidence <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> 1398, the year of Gaunt's death. The commission to arrest him named nine accomplices and he was said to have a retinue of twenty. However, he soon made friends with some of the very Lancastrian affinity members who had been commissioned to arrest him.|$|E
