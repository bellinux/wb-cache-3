5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E

She was secretary of the corporation, although this may have been a nominal position as Louis and his lawyer prepared most of the corporation's correspondence and its filings. She also probably helped her husband decide to provide more than one million dollars toward achieving the Roeriches' spiritual and cultural ambitions. She met with the Roeriches and their other supporters in making plans for the Roerich Museum, Master Institute, Corona Mundi, and the other organizations housed in the Master Building. She was active as president of the Roerich Society and, after its demise, directed the Riverside Museum for many years.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{would like to}} show the {{importance}} of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> as the foundation of ethics in times of crisis in particular in the fields of politics and economics in the modern civilisation marked by globalization and technological progres. I consider the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> as the key notion {{in order to understand the}} ethical duty in a modern technological civilisation. We can indeed observe a moralization of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> going beyond a strict legal definition in terms of imputability. The paper begins by discussing the humanistic foundations of such a concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> It treats the historical origins <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> and it relates this concept to the concept of accountability. On the basis of this historical determination of the concept I would like to present the definition of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> as fundamental ethical principle that has increasing importance as the foundation of the principles of governance in modern welfare states. In this context the paper discusses the extension of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> towards institutional or corporate responsibility where responsibility does not only concerns the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> individuals but also deals with the <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> institutional collectivities. In this way the paper is based on the following structure : 1) The ethical foundation of the concept <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> 2) Responsibility in technological civilisation 3) Political responsibility for good governance in the welfare state 4) Social <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> business corporations in times of globalization 5) Conclusion and discussion : changed conditions <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> in modern times...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 55 - 57) This study <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> as {{an aspect}} of moral judgment focuses on the instruments {{that have been used}} to assess the construct <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> operationally. The philosophical definitions <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> range from duty or obligation to personal assumption <b>of</b> moral <b>responsibility.</b> Psychological theories and their assumptions regarding responsibility and moral judgment are presented from Piaget, Heider, Kohlberg, and Rest. Piagetian empirical studies center on intentionality as evidence of an underlying cognitive organization and its relationship to attribution <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Other studies <b>of</b> attribution <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> focus on Heider's continuum <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> and seek to take into account factors such as foreseeability and environmental justifications as well as intentionality. Kohlberg's emphasis has been on judgments of justice, but Rest points out that the concept of justice or fairness at each stage of the development of moral judgment indicates the way rights and responsibilities are determined.

30|$|The {{researchers}} in the present paper recommended {{that the notion of}} autonomy is best meaningful when accompanying the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to better depict the characteristics of learners in academic settings. The notion <b>of</b> tolerance <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> could be best defined by the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> but as the existing realm is the span <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> the researchers recommended the term tolerance. That is why the {{researchers in}} the present paper would suggest the term “tolerance” rather than the “coefficient” <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to be used. All in all, having accompanied the notion of “tolerance of responsibility” along with that of the “learner autonomy” would vividly depict a better transparent picture of the learners who are called autonomous learners.|$|R

5|$|The rise {{of provincial}} {{men to the}} senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social {{mobility}} {{in the first three}} centuries of the Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later European nobility, a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands. Admission to the higher ordines brought distinction and privileges, but also a number <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services (munera), rather than on tax revenues, which primarily supported the military. Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures. Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged by the central government to give up their seats and return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.|$|E

In the event that Austria entered the war France would act against its naval forces, and would at minimum prevent them passing the Strait of Otranto.|$|E
5|$|In 1905–06, the Armenian-Tatar massacres {{broke out}} {{during which the}} ARF became {{involved}} in armed activities. Some sources claim that the Russian government incited the massacres in order to reinforce its authority during the revolutionary turmoil of 1905. The first outbreak of violence occurred in Baku, in February 1905. The ARF held the Russian authorities responsible for inaction and instigation of massacres {{that were part of}} a larger anti-Armenian policy. On May 11, 1905, Dashnak revolutionary Drastamat Kanayan assassinated Russian governor general Nakashidze, who was considered by the Armenian population as the main instigator of hate and confrontation between the Armenians and the Tatars. Unreliable protection from government is attributed to the Armenian bourgeoisie to turned to the ARF for protection. The Dashnak leaders argued that, given employment discrimination against Armenian workers in non-Armenian concerns, the defence provided to the Armenian bourgeoisie was essential to the safekeeping of employment opportunities for Armenian laborers. The Russian Tsar's envoy in the Caucasus, Vorontsov-Dashkov, reported that the ARF bore a major portion <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for perpetrating the massacres. The ARF, however, argued that it helped to organize the defence of the Armenian population against Muslim attacks. The blows suffered {{at the hands of the}} Dashnakist fighting squads proved a catalyst for the consolidation of the Muslim community of the Caucasus. During that period, the ARF regarded armed activity, including terror, as necessary for the achievement of political goals.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> in a dynamic {{policy-making}} environment modeled as a principal-agent relationship. We show that, with dynamic policy making, {{the two components}} <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> are negative complements: taken together, unified agency and observability of agent actions can reduce the principal’s welfare. In particular, the equilibrium retention rule used by the principal is characterized by “What Have You Done for Me Lately ” (WHYDFML) behavior and induces the agent to allocate too much effort to the late stages of the policy-making process relative to early stages. Eliminating either institutional feature <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> eliminates WHYDFML-driven inefficiencies, but at a cost. Without action observability, the principal {{is not able to}} give the agent as powerful incentives. Without unified agency, each agent controls fewer resources, making rent seeking more attractive. Whether complete clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> or some more limited form of it is optimal depends on the relative magnitudes of these competing effects. Although eliminating both aspects <b>of</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> is never optimal for the principal, it is possible for the principal to prefer no clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to complete clarity <b>of</b> <b>responsibility...</b>|$|R
