5|$|Sir Walter Hungerford died in 1516, leaving Farleigh Hungerford Castle to his son, Sir Edward. Edward was a {{successful}} member of Henry VIII's court and died in 1522, leaving the castle to his second wife, Agnes. After Edward's death, however, it emerged that Agnes had {{been responsible for the}} murder of her former, first husband, John Cotell: two of her servants had strangled him at Farleigh Hungerford Castle, before burning his body in the castle <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> destroy any evidence. Agnes appears to have been motivated by a desire for the wealth that would follow her second marriage to Sir Edward, but in 1523 Agnes and the two servants were hung for murder in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims are}} {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E
5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have shared ownership of an <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E

5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E

25|$|Where possible, a {{cleaned and}} freshly oiled Dutch oven should {{be stored in}} a clean, dry {{location}} with the lid ajar or off to promote air circulation and to avoid the smell and taste of rancid oil.

25|$|A {{biscuit cutter}} {{a tool to}} cut out a biscuit from bread dough in a {{particular}} shape before they are put into an <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> bake. On May 11, 1875, Alexander P.

It was later issued on November 30, 1875.|$|E

25|$|Snyder died November 14, 1945, {{with his}} son, Robert, {{when they were}} {{overcome}} with natural gas poisoning, or carbon monoxide, or both, in their cottage in Babylon, New York. Apparently, upon retiring for the evening, the Snyders had lit the burners on the range <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> heat the rooms; but during the night the flame had been extinguished, possibly by a draft. The elder Snyder was 85, the son was 51. They both are buried in a family plot in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.|$|E
25|$|The pavlova has a {{crisp and}} crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in {{contrast}} to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour {{is responsible for the}} marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid. The consistency also makes the pavlova significantly more fragile than meringue. Because the pavlova is notorious for deflating if exposed to cold air, when cooking is complete it is left in the <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> fully cool down before the oven door is opened.|$|E
25|$|A {{solar oven}} is turned towards {{the sun and}} left until the food is cooked. Unlike cooking on a stove or over a fire, which may require {{more than an hour}} of {{constant}} supervision, food in a solar oven is generally not stirred or turned over, both because it is unnecessary and because opening the solar oven allows the trapped heat to escape and thereby slows the cooking process. If wanted, the solar oven may be checked every one to two hours, to turn the <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> face the sun more precisely and to ensure that shadows from nearby buildings or plants have not blocked the sunlight. If the food is to be left untended for many hours during the day, then the solar oven is often turned to face the point where the sun will be when it is highest in the sky, instead of towards its current position.|$|E

25|$|Besides the {{descriptions}} of Theophilus and Agricola, the only depiction of an early forest glasshouse is from Bohemia in abpproximately 1380 (The Mandeville Miniature). This shows a furnace where all the high temperature processes of glassmaking were performed in the one structure containing several ovens whose varying temperatures might be controlled to the necessary extent by constant attention. The raw materials are mixed at a pit nearby and carried down in pans to be fritted {{in one of the}} ovens, optimum temperature up to 1100°C. The frit is melted at high temperature up to 1400°C in crucibles in a second oven, and when ready, the glass is being blown into objects. These are placed in the annealing <b>oven</b> <b>to</b> cool. The whole structure is enclosed in a wooden building, and it is likely that wood was stored and dried above the furnace. Remains of a similar structure from the late fifteenth century have been found in Eichsfeld in Germany. Another design found archaeologically from the seventeenth century is the 'butterfly furnace'. These furnaces were made from stone and the crucibles from imported, highly-refractory clay. They differ in style from the Islamic furnaces of the east, and those of southern Europe, the 'beehive' style where the annealing chamber is above the main oven rather than on the same level.|$|E
