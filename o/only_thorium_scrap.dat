Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table—and transplutonium elements, which follow plutonium.

40|$|A source release {{model was}} {{developed}} to quantify time dependent liquid phase releases of radioactive material to the vadose zone from a disposal site. The model has been implemented to evaluate the source terms in the Performance Assessment for the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) Disposal Facility at Area G, {{an analysis of the}} long term post-closure impact of disposal operations required by the USDOE orders. Analytic solutions describe transport through the model compartments: the solid phase waste package, the liquid phase within each waste package and the liquid phase within the disposal unit. The model accounts for elemental solubility limits and retardation coefficients (Rf) separately in the waste package and in the disposal unit. Several parameters define the site specific aspects of the disposal unit. In our case for example, the disposal unit is waste buried with crushed volcanic tuff, and a small net infiltration rate is determined from independent numerical studies. The analytic solution allows efficient explorations of the sensitivity to the input parameters. Numerical solutions extend the model to account for decay product ingrowth which may have different transport properties than the parent nuclides. Results show source release rates verses package or disposal unit Kd, and effects of solubility limits. At the LANL LLRW disposal site, <b>only</b> <b>thorium,</b> uranium and some low-level nuclides are solubility limited. Otherwise, a {open_quote}rapid rinse{close_quote} waste package category dominates the peak disposal unit efflux which occurs for the LANL disposal site at about 100 years for nuclides with Kd= 0 (Rf= 1) and for proportionately longer times as Kd or Rf increases. Additional simple analytic models or detailed numerical codes can be coupled to these results to predict groundwater concentrations...|$|R

40|$|The global {{distribution}} of the radioactive elements (U, K, Th) at the lunar surface is an important parameter for an understanding of lunar evolution, because they have provided continuous heat over the lifetime of the Moon. Today, <b>only</b> the <b>thorium</b> distribution is available for the whole lunar surface [1]. Another key parameter that characterize {{the surface of the}} Moon is the presence of mare basalts.

30|$|Models that {{consider}} the combined thermal, magmatic, and tectonic evolution of Mercury (Hauck et al. 2004) suggest a bulk core sulfur content between 6.5 and 7.5  wt.% and a late {{formation of the}} inner core since 1  Ga.

The more recent models of Grott et al. (2011) and Tosi et al.

Combined, the results of thermochemical evolution models suggest that dynamo action in Mercury to produce the present field is recent and that the observed early magnetic field episode was likely brief.|$|R

Although the system was characterized by UV-vis and XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure) spectra, its structure and properties remain unknown. In this work we used the density functional calculations to identify molecular and electronic structure of the Th@C- 84. Series of molecular structures satisfying the ThC 84 stoichiometric formula were studied comprising 24 IPR and 110 non-IPR Th@C- 84 isomers as well as 9 ThC 2 @C- 82 IPR isomers. The lowest energy structure is Th@C- 84 -C-s(10) with the singlet ground state. Its predicted electronic absorption spectra are in agreement with the experimentally observed ones. The bonding between the cage and Th was characterized as polar covalent with Th in formal oxidation state IV.

The complex geological structure of Wzgórza Niemczansko-Strzelinskie (south-west Poland) enabled this problem to be studied in various geological conditions. The eU and eTh content in rocks and soil was measured by gamma-spectrometer GR- 320. Uranium content of bedrock reached its maximum value of 15 ppm {{in the case of}} quartz-graphite schist. Thorium reached its maximum value of 35 ppm in the case of granodiorite. Radon activity was measured by means of long-term exposure of LR- 115. The mean value of atmospheric radon activity was 21 Bqm- 3 in the air 2 m above the ground surface.

Our theoretical studies can help people more clearly understand the thermodynamic behaviors of ThO$_ 2 $ at different temperatures. In addition, we have also studied possible defect formations and diffusion behaviors of helium in ThO$_ 2 $, to discuss its structural stability. It is found that in intrinsic ThO$_ 2 $ without any Fermi energy shifts, the interstitial Th$_i^{ 4 +}$ defect other than oxygen or thorium vacancies, interstitial oxygen, and any kinds of Frenkel pairs, is most probable to form with an energy release of 1. 74 eV.

For helium diffusion, we find that <b>only</b> through the <b>thorium</b> vacancy can it happen with the small energy barrier of 0. 52 eV. Otherwise, helium atoms can hardly incorporate or diffuse in ThO$_ 2 $.

40|$|An iridium alloy doped {{with small}} amounts of cerium and thorium is being {{developed}} as a potential replacement for the iridium-based DOP- 26 alloy (doped with <b>thorium</b> <b>only)</b> that is currently used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for cladding and post-impact containment of the radioactive fuel in radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) heat sources which provide electric power for interplanetary spacecraft. This report summarizes results of studies conducted to date under the Iridium Alloy Characterization and Development subtask of the Radioisotope Power System Materials Production and Technology Program to characterize {{the properties of the}} iridium-based alloy (designated as DOP- 40) containing both cerium and thorium. Included within this report are data on grain growth of sheet material in vacuum and low-pressure oxygen environments, grain growth in vacuum of the clad vent set cup material, weldability, and the effect of grain size and test temperature on tensile properties. Where applicable, data for the DOP- 26 alloy are included for comparison. Both grain size and grain-boundary cohesion affect the ductility of iridium alloys. In this study it was found that cerium and thorium, when added together, refine grain size more effectively than when thorium is added by itself (especially at high temperatures). In addition, the effect of cerium additions on grain-boundary cohesion {{is similar to that of}} thorium. Mechanical testing at both low ({approx} 10 {sup - 3 }s{sup - 1 }) and high ({approx} 10 {sup - 3 }s{sup - 1 }) strain rates showed that the Ce/Th-doped alloys have tensile ductilities that are as good or better than the DOP- 26 alloy. The general conclusion from these studies is that cerium can be used to replace some of the radioactive thorium currently used in DOP- 26 while maintaining or improving its metallurgical properties. The current DOP- 26 alloy meets all requirements for cladding the radioactive fuel in the RTG heat source, but the new DOP- 40 alloy could serve as a back-up alloy to be used if the costs of refining, handling, and transporting DOP- 26 become prohibitively high...|$|R

While UO{sub 2 } and ThO{sub 2 } both have the fluorite structure Fm 3 m, they differ in that uranium has two dominant oxidation states, U{sup 4 +} and U{sup 6 +}, while <b>thorium</b> <b>only</b> has one, Th{sup 4 +}. Furthermore, UO{sub 2 } is an intrinsically weak p-type semi-conductor with a band gap of 2. 14 eV (Killeen, 1980), while ThO{sub 2 } is an insulator. Dissolution and spectroscopic studies indicate that UO{sub 2 } and ThO{sub 2 } have different solubilities (Sunder and Miller, 2000). We use the quantum mechanical program, CASTEP (CAmbridge Scientific Total Energy Package) to perform surface and adsorption energy calculations on the (111) surface of both materials, with specific attention to O, H{sub 2 }O, and combined adsorption cases. UO{sub 2 } and ThO{sub 2 } bulk unit cells were optimized {{to find the most}} stable configuration of atoms. Surface slabs were ''cleaved'' from the relaxed bulk for each orientation, placed in a 10 {angstrom} vacuum gap in order to simulate a free surface and were optimized. Relative surface energy trends and atomic relaxation were compared between the surfaces of UO{sub 2 } and ThO{sub 2 }. The (111) surface is found to have the most energetically stable configuration of atoms in both cases, although ThO{sub 2 } has higher surface energy values than UO{sub 2 } on all three surfaces. The (111) surface slab is doubled in width in order {{to increase the number of}} surface sites, and different starting positions for adsorbates are tested in order to calculate the most energetically favorable adsorption sites. Adsorption energy results indicate that adsorption is more favorable on the UO{sub 2 } (111) surface than the ThO{sub 2 } (111) surface. Adsorption calculations are accompanied by partial density of state (PDOS) and bandstructure analyses in order to understand the role of electrons during adsorption on semi-conducting versus insulating mineral surfaces...|$|R
