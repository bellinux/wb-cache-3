5|$|Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and {{political}} figure. After achieving {{success in the}} Western TV series Rawhide, he rose to international fame with {{his role as the}} Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of Spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon <b>of</b> <b>masculinity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} of Sarah, {{one of the}} most enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth <b>of</b> <b>masculinity,</b> and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E
5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, are central to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study <b>of</b> <b>masculinity</b> is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E

This dissertation mainly {{questions the}} constructions <b>of</b> different <b>masculinities</b> in politics in Turkey. It re-reads the different representations of political manhood {{with reference to}} the AKP, the CHP and the MHP between 2000 and 2008. In order to reveal the embeddedness <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> and politics, this dissertation analyzes not only gendered discourses of the given political parties but also their leaders, namely, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Deniz Baykal and Devlet Bahçeli. With the guidance of Pierre Bourdieu’s analytical tools, especially, {{on the basis of the}} congruent relation between habitus and the field, this dissertation questions different representations <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> and identifies typologies <b>of</b> <b>masculinities,</b> namely; (1) Neo-Muslim, (2) Kemalist/Secular, and, (3) Nationalist. With reference to the patterns <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> in Turkish political culture, this study argues that the gendered nature of the politics, in general, political parties in particular, use and reproduce dominant masculinist strategies. In politics as a field, leaders experience the praxis of being man rather than their ideological engagements; leftist, rightist or Islamist. Akyüz, SelinPh. D...|$|R
5|$|Restrictions {{were imposed}} on the {{advertisement}} of tobacco products, enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression <b>of</b> <b>masculinity</b> were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as {{was the use of}} advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{styles of}} play have {{recently}} emerged, pushing {{the bounds of}} what the gandingan was traditionally used for. One type of play called kulndet requires players to perform highly dense, complicated rhythmic patterns upon the gandingan. This type of play unlike the olden (kamamatuan) style of gandingan playing requires assistants to hold the gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound. Because of the strenuous type of play, male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity, considered a sign <b>of</b> <b>masculinity,</b> on the gandingan. During a gandingan contest, two expert gandingan players (pagagandings) would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other. This type of play {{is said to have}} evolved from the spread of virtousic style on the agung.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense <b>of</b> <b>masculinity</b> that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E
40|$|This article {{contributes}} to recent debates between {{supporters of the}} concept <b>of</b> hegemonic <b>masculinity,</b> as exemplified by R. W. Connell, and {{a new generation of}} gender scholars, as to how best explain the dynamic and fluid relationships between men, and men and women, in the early 21 st century. Here, the author concurs with many of Connell’s critics and proceeds by arguing that recent feminist extensions of Bourdieu’s original conceptual schema—field, capital, habitus, and practice—may help reveal more nuanced conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>masculinities,</b> and male gender reflexivity, in contemporary sport and physical culture. This author examines the potential of such an approach via an analysis <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> in the snowboarding field. In so doing, this article not only offers fresh insights into the masculine identities and interactions in the snowboarding field but also {{contributes to}} recent debates about how best to explain different generations and cultural experiences <b>of</b> <b>masculinities...</b>|$|R

5|$|Taiko {{performance}} {{was an important}} part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents in North America, who are called sansei. During World War II, second-generation Japanese residents, called nisei faced internment in the United States and in Canada {{on the basis of their}} race. During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming ethnic communities. Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities. There were also prevailing stereotypes of Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert. During the 1960s in the United States, the Civil Rights Movement influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance. Groups such as San Jose Taiko were organized to fulfill a need for solidarity and to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans. Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature. Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, {{performance was}} meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States it was meant to be an explicit representation <b>of</b> <b>masculinity</b> and power in Japanese-American men.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} a body of literature that looks for effective responses to the gendered performance gap, the research into the effects of single-sex education, and the social construction <b>of</b> <b>masculinities.</b> This qualitative inquiry focuses on a bounded group of male students who graduated from New England single-sex high schools and matriculated into Boston-area colleges and universities. While {{there have been a}} few studies that have examined men as men within the context of higher education, none have explored explicitly graduates of boys 2 ̆ 7 schools or their conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>masculinities.</b> This qualitative phenomenological study examines the gendered socialization that occurs within single-sex secondary schools and the socio-cultural forces that impact the conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> that male graduates 2 ̆ 7 have and the anticipated threats that these men feel in regard to their prior gender socialization upon entering a coeducational postsecondary institution. This study answers the following questions: (1) What are the conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> with which male student graduates of single-sex high schools enter coeducational postsecondary institutions? (2) What forces in boys 2 ̆ 7 schools shape students 2 ̆ 7 conceptualizations <b>of</b> <b>masculinities?</b> (3) Upon entering coeducational colleges and universities, what do graduates of boys 2 ̆ 7 schools anticipate will be threats to their prior gender socialization? This research adds to the literature that provides positive representation of men and an alternative to the deficit narrative prevalent in much of the research into the lives of boys and men. This study has implications for parents, secondary and postsecondary educators. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{interpretation}} and reception of Genesis 9 : 25 - 27 {{and how the}} so-called ‘curse of Ham’ contributed to the construction <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> in South Africa. The impact of the Ham ideology on black people and on the construction <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> is explored {{from the perspective of}} a contemporary theological anthropology as ‘embodied sensing’. The Ham ideology also has a remarkable longevity, especially in South Africa with remnants of the curse still visible and alive in the minds (and bodies) of people. Because of the unique way in which this ideology was employed in South Africa from the time of slavery and during apartheid, it is reasonable to conceive that it also played a vital role in the construction <b>of</b> the <b>masculinities</b> <b>of</b> males in South Africa.

50|$|Feminist {{concern has}} been {{primarily}} with women; however, emerging concern with the exploration and intricacies <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> in archaeology is rising.

This area of study in general, however, remains relatively unexplored.|$|R
25|$|Males {{are portrayed}} in the media as having to have strong, muscular, chiseled bodies {{in order to be}} {{successful}} in life. Competitive sports have also taken on this depiction by building a sense <b>of</b> <b>masculinity</b> within each male sporting event, as well as providing a venue for violence and aggression that is not frowned upon as {{it would be in the}} public eye. The magnitude of success a man has is what measures their amount <b>of</b> <b>masculinity,</b> which is then glorified in the media.|$|E
25|$|How a child {{develops}} {{gender identity}} is also debated. Some believe that masculinity {{is linked to}} the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with male genitalia. Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Recent research has been done on one's self concept <b>of</b> <b>masculinity</b> and its relation to testosterone; the results have shown that masculinity not only differs in different cultures, but the levels of testosterone do not predict how masculine or feminine one feels. Proponents of this view argue that women can become men hormonally and physically, and many aspects <b>of</b> <b>masculinity</b> assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven. On the nurture side of the debate, it is argued that masculinity does not have a single source. Although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form <b>of</b> <b>masculinity,</b> it does not create it. Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.|$|E

50|$|In one of {{the most}} widely cited works {{analyzing}} the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory <b>of</b> hegemonic <b>masculinity</b> in light <b>of</b> certain criticisms.

40|$|Increasingly in {{international}} research and popular media a {{growing interest in}} men and fatherhood is discernible. These changes occur as {{other aspects of the}} socio-economic world shift, necessitating the need to re-address how caring and paid work responsibilities are configured and practised. However, interest in men’s experiences as fathers has emerged in ways which reflect cultural assumptions and practices associated with dominant understandings <b>of</b> <b>masculinities.</b> Consequently, research and evidence of changing behaviours has been culturally and geographically uneven. In this paper, two qualitative studies are drawn upon to examine how men living in Australia and the UK engage in/narrate experiences of preparation for first-time fatherhood. These studies compare men’s in-depth accounts of preparing for first-time fatherhood in cultures where understandings <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> overlap, but where differences are also discernible. The findings illuminate the ways in which biology, gender, temporality and histories <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> frame men’s preparation activities and service provision...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the socially and culturally defined character <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> through {{a case study}} of the heroic legacy of Michael Collins. Utilising a mu ltidisciplinary methodology the study investigates; both biographical and prominent written historical material, Neil Jordan’s movie, Collins’ contribution to the Treaty debates o f 1921 - 22, his private correspondence with Kitty Kiernan and a selection of remembrance rhetoric pertaining to him {{over the course of the}} twentieth century. This treatise interprets Michael Collins from a different perspective than previous analyses. The methodology is fashioned by a desire to develop a more substantial and comprehensive body of material that addresses the histories <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> in Ireland. Priority is given to determining the influence of socially and culturally defined expectations <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> on conceptualisations and perceptions of the heroic image and conversely for the influence and relevance this image has for the historical identity of Michael Collins. The dissertation addresses the complex and socially determined political nature of that composition, where politics is understood firstly as the social and cultural intricacies that influence gender configuration, and secondly as the ideology of political power. In six chapters, an outline, contextualisation and examination of the selected sources are undertaken incorporating the use of contemporary theories <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> and comparative histories o f masculinities studies. The application of prominent interdisciplinary theoretical and comparative material that informs the composite nature <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> is also employed. These are discussed and set in context in the specific methodologies of the relevant chapters. Careful consideration is directed towards discovering definable male characteristics that appear so obvious as to render their gendered significance invisible to conventional historical analysis...|$|R

25|$|Research on beer-commercial content by Lance Strate yielded results {{relevant}} to a study <b>of</b> <b>masculinity.</b> In beer commercials, masculine behavior (especially risk-taking) is encouraged. Commercials often focus on situations in which a man overcomes an obstacle in a group, working or playing hard (construction or farm workers or cowboys). Those involving play have central themes of mastery (of nature or each other), risk and adventure: fishing, camping, playing sports or socializing in bars. There is usually an element of danger and a focus on movement and speed (watching fast cars or driving fast). The bar is a setting for the measurement <b>of</b> <b>masculinity</b> in skills such as billiards, strength, and drinking ability.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{and critically}} analyses literary representations of what I have called “alternative masculinities” within {{a selection of}} texts by male writers {{from the turn of}} the millennium. The novels chosen for this analysis are Last Drinks by Andrew McGahan (2000), World of Chickens (2001) by Nick Earls and Sushi Central by Alasdair Duncan (2003). The work of R. W. Connell, Doreen Massey and Bruce Bennett will inform a framework blending theories <b>of</b> <b>masculinities,</b> spatiality theories and critical regionalism, providing the tools to conduct a reading of the spaces fictional representations <b>of</b> alternative <b>masculinities</b> engage with. Applying Connell’s hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> (1995) I examine the emerging textual constructions <b>of</b> alternative <b>masculinities</b> that correspond with the changing cityscape of Brisbane. Within the above texts I argue there is a strong emphasis on the connections between identity and place. This is expressed through references to Brisbane’s social and historical identity and the gendered alignment of Brisbane spaces with particular masculinities...|$|R
40|$|Argentine {{director}} Lucía Puenzo’s {{feature films}} have attracted {{the interest of}} film critics and audiences alike. Her first film, XXY (2007), won the prestigious Goya Award for Best Foreign Film in Spanish and her following productions, The Child Fish (2009) and The German Doctor (2013), received positive reviews by the critics as well. Up until now, most analyses of her films have focused their attention on her characters’ search of identity due to their physical, social, and sexual positions of marginalization. What {{is yet to be}} done, however, is to examine her male characters and the way they represent different types <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> and the hierarchical order that exists within the sphere <b>of</b> multiple <b>masculinities.</b> Thus, I aim to start a conversation in regards to the manifold strategies that Puenzo’s three feature films utilize to explore the topics <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> and, simultaneously, to destabilize and displace hegemonic masculinities which are clearly personified by some of her main male characters. I also examine the importance of the diverse social and historical contexts in her films as these are fundamentally connected to the themes <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> that appear in her productions...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, we {{have sought}} to develop an {{analysis}} of the representation <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> through fifty works of made in Spain video art during {{the first decade of the}} 21 st Century. In order to do this, we have selected those works of video art whose main subject is the questioning <b>of</b> hegemonic <b>masculinity</b> or the disclosure <b>of</b> subversive <b>masculinities</b> through the representation of the body. We have chosen pieces widely and currently accessible, which have been previously shown in the Spanish art scene. The heterogenic selection aims at representing the wide range <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> and works <b>of</b> video art. The applied methodology has been the critical analysis of audiovisual texts and the hermeneutic of images. We {{have sought to}} build up a multidisciplinary theoretical approach, following the recent principles developed by Visual Studies, Audiovisual Communication Studies and Film Theory, and based on the epistemology contrived by Queer Theory and Men’s Studies. Through the images shown in these works, we will be able to discover what are the mechanisms used in the construction of the male identity, in addition to the elements and attributes characteristic <b>of</b> the hegemonic <b>masculinity</b> model, a model which conditions the rest <b>of</b> the <b>masculinities</b> that exist within the social spectrum. We will be able to visualize the extensive range <b>of</b> <b>masculinities</b> constituting the current masculine identity through the different formats, styles and narratives that shape the contemporary Spanish video art. Such identity does not only include a single gender and a single sexuality, this new masculinity is made from different bodies with different status, races, genders and sexualities. Our dissertation shows the possibilities of video art as a critical tool against the patriarchal system and as a display for all these non-heteronormal masculinities...|$|R
