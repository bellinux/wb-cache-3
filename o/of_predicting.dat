5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance <b>of</b> <b>predicting</b> and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim <b>of</b> <b>predicting</b> the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E
5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods <b>of</b> <b>predicting</b> the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E

Aim of the work: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate pulmonary function among patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) undergoing hemodialysis and patients with kidney transplant. Patients and methods: This study was conducted on 60 subjects. They were classified into 3 groups: Hemodialysis group (HDG) included 20 patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular hemodialysis for at least six months and were clinically stable. Transplant group (TG) included 20 patients who had undergone kidney transplant at least six months earlier and were also clinically stable. Control group (CG) included 20 apparently healthy subjects. All subjects underwent pulmonary function testing; including resting spirometry included flow volume loop and Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV), measurement of lung volumes and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) using single breath technique, Six Minute Walking Test (6 MWT) and arterial blood gases (ABG). Results: There was a significant difference between HDG, TG and CG regarding FVC% <b>of</b> <b>predicted,</b> FEV 1 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted,</b> FEF 25 – 75 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted,</b> PEFR% <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> and MVV% <b>of</b> <b>predicted.</b> Also there was a statistically significant difference between HDG, TG and CG regarding RV% <b>of</b> <b>predicted,</b> TLC% <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> and RV/TLC%. Although FVC% <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> and FEV 1 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> were within the normal range in the 3 studied groups, there was a statistically significant reduction in these spirometric parameters in HDG more than that in the TG and CG, also reduction in TG more than CG. FEF 25 – 75 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> was less than normal in HDG and was within the normal range in TG and CG, also RV% <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> and TLC% <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> were increased in HDG more than that in TG and CG. Regarding DLco% <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> we found significant differences between the 3 studied groups. It was lower in HDG than in TG and CG.

Regarding ABG although all values were within normal levels, Pao 2 in HDG was less than that in TG and CG. Conclusion: There is impairment of lung function in patients with CRF undergoing hemodialysis. The main changes are small airway obstruction, reduction in carbon monoxide transfer and diminished 6 MWT that were not completely improved in the kidney transplant patients...|$|R

40|$|Impairment of {{pulmonary}} {{function is}} a major prognostic indicator in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) decline linearly and are commonly used to assess disease progression. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the usefulness of testing respiratory muscle strength in ALS with a novel test, sniff nasal pressure (Pn(sn)), in parallel with more classic tests such as maximal inspiratory pressure (PI(max)) and maximal expiratory pressure (PE(max)). Sixteen patients with ALS were examined monthly over a period of 18 +/- 10 months. At the time of inclusion in the study, values were normal for FVC (107 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> value) and MVV (87 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> value) but abnormally low for Pn(sn) (67 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> value), PI(max) (69 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> value), and PE(max) (54 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> value). Late in the course of ALS, all patients could perform Pn(sn) whereas 6 could not perform PI(max) and 7 could not perform PE(max). The rate of deterioration was most often linear and similar for FVC (- 4. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> value per month), MVV (- 4. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> value per month), and Pn(sn) (- 4. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> value per month). We conclude that Pn(sn) was the single respiratory test combining linear decline, sensitivity in mild disease, and feasibility in advanced disease. Being easy to perform and inexpensive, Pn(sn) appears well suited to assess the decline of respiratory muscle strength in ALS...|$|R
5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility <b>of</b> <b>predicting</b> these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent studies {{described}} a progressive decline in lung volumes in adult bron-chiectasis. Interstitial lung disease {{is also a}} feature of bronchiectasis, but whether this {{is associated with a}} decline in lung diffusing capacity (measured as the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) is not well known. OBJECTIVE: To assess longitudinal decline in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in adult bronchiectasis. METHODS: Sixty-one subjects had a detailed baseline clinical and laboratory assessment, then were followed regularly with clinical and lung-function assessment for a median 7 years. RESULTS: Baseline spirometry demonstrated mild obstructive lung disease, with a mean FEV 1 of 72 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted,</b> mean forced vital capacity 87 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted,</b> and normal DLCO (mean DLCO 88 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted,</b> and mean DLCO adjusted for alveolar volume [DLCO/VA] 100 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted).</b> There was an accelerated decline in DLCO and DLCO/VA over the 7 -year period. The median DLCO decline was 2. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> per year (95 % CI 2. 3 – 4. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> per year). The median DLCO/VA decline was 2. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> per year (95 % CI 2. 1 – 4. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> per year). There was a significant relationship between DLCO decline and age and decline in FEV 1. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of patients with bronchiectasis there was a progressive DLCO decline.

40|$|Single breath {{pulmonary}} diffusing {{capacity for}} carbon monoxide (DLCQ) was examined {{as a predictor}} of all-cause mortality among 4, 333 subjects who were aged 25 - 74 years at baseline in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) conducted from 1971 to 1975. The relation of the percentage <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> DLCO to all-cause mortality was examined in a Cox proportional hazard model that included age, sex, race, current smoking status, systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, alcohol consumption, body mass index, percentage <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> forced vital capacity (FVC), and the ratio of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV.,) to FVC. Mortality had a linear association with the percentage <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> FVC (rate ratio (RR) = 1. 12, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) 1. 08 - 1. 17, for a 10 % decrement) and a significantly nonlinear association with the percentage <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> DLCO with an adverse effect that was clearly evident for levels below 85 % <b>of</b> those <b>predicted</b> (RR = 1. 24, 95 % Cl 1. 12 - 1. 37 for a 10 % decrement). The relative hazard for the percentage <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> DLCQ below 85 % was not modified by sex, smoking status, or exclusion of subjects with clinical respiratory disease on the initial examination. This association with the percentage <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> DLCO was present among 3, 005 subjects with FEV, levels above 90 % <b>of</b> those <b>predicted.</b> Thus, pulmonary diffusing capacity below 85 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted</b> levels is a significant predictor of the all-cause mortality rate within the general US population independent of standard spirometry measures and {{even in the absence of}} apparen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether a six-minute walk distance (6 MWD) of 80 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted.</b> The occurrence <b>of</b> acute exacerbations of COPD over 2 years was identified by analyzing medical records and contacting patients by telephone. Results: In the sample as a whole, there was moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction (mean FEV 1 = 41 ± 12 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted)</b> {{and the mean}} 6 MWD was 469 ± 60 m (86 ± 10 % <b>of</b> <b>predicted).</b> Over the 2 -year follow-up period, 25 patients (50 %) experienced acute exacerbations of COPD.
