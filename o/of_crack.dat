De Mauro could exercise his skills as a successful investigative reporter. He wrote on drug trafficking and the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s {{that led to the}} destruction of the city's green belt and ancient villas. He also published articles about the collusion between the Mafia and politics.

40|$|Cracks in {{a cracked}} gear may further {{propagate}} by a tiny length {{in a very}} short time for several reasons, such as material fatigue and load fluctuations. In this paper, this dynamic process is defined as transient propagation <b>of</b> <b>cracks.</b> This research aims to calculate the time-varying mesh stiffness of gears when transient propagation <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> arises, which has not been extensively studied in existing literatures. The transient propagation <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> is modelled. An improved potential energy method is proposed by incorporating the propagation model into the potential energy method. The improved method can also be utilised to calculate the mesh stiffness of gears when transient propagation <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> arises. Different transient propagation models are considered to simulate the propagation <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> in a short amount of time. Different deterioration levels <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> before transient propagation and different lengths and models of transient propagation are also examined. The variation rules of mesh stiffness caused by the transient propagation <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> are summarised. The influence of the deterioration level <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> on mesh stiffness variation when transient propagation arises is obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed method accurately calculates time-varying mesh stiffness when transient propagation <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> arises. Furthermore, the method improves the monitoring of further propagation <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> in gears from the perspective of time-varying mesh stiffness...|$|R

Yet the capability of predicting the effect <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> on slope performance is still limited. This paper studies the hydraulic properties <b>of</b> random <b>cracks</b> in soil. First, the statistical parameters for the geometry <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> in soil are reviewed. Next, a method of generating a random crack network based on the statistical parameters is presented. Then water flow through the generated random crack network is studied through a numerical model. Finally the hydraulic properties <b>of</b> the random <b>crack</b> network are investigated. Results show that a random <b>crack</b> network consisting <b>of</b> two orthogonal sets <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> behaves like an isotropic porous medium as expected when the two sets <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> have similar mean length, mean aperture and density. If the relative orientation is not orthogonal, then the permeability <b>of</b> the random <b>crack</b> network will be anisotropic. The anisotropic ratio increases as the relative orientation decreases. The directional permeability increases with the mean crack aperture and length as expected. On the other hand, the changes in aperture do not affect the shape of permeability ellipses and the equivalent porous medium assumption. Copyright ASCE 2007...|$|R

25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate <b>of</b> <b>crack</b> growth {{depending on the}} load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E
25|$|By 1978, {{there were}} 45 Crips gangs, called sets, {{operating}} in Los Angeles. They were {{heavily involved in}} the production of PCP, marijuana and amphetamines. On March 11, 1979, Stanley Tookie Williams, a member of Westside Crips, was arrested for four murders and then on August 8, 1979, Raymond Washington was gunned down. Washington had been against Crip infighting and after his death several Crip sets started fighting against each other. The Crips leadership was dismantled prompting a deadly gang war between the Rollin' 60 Neighborhood Crips and Eight Tray Gangster Crips which began causing nearby Crip sets to choose sides and align themselves with either the Gangster Crips or Neighborhood Crips waging an all out war in South Central and other cities. The East Coast Crips and the Hoover Crips directly severed their alliance after Washington's death. By 1980 the Crips were in turmoil, warring with the Bloods and against each other. The growth and power of the gang really took off in the early 1980s when crack cocaine hit the streets. In the early 1980s Crips sets began distributing crack cocaine in Los Angeles.
