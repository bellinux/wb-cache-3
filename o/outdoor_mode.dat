He introduced the Burmese cat to the West by the importation of a female, Wong Mau, from Burma in 1930. Dr. Thompson's established place in the history of the fancy is attributed to his untiring efforts over the years to obtain recognition of the Burmese, with the result that the Burmese cat was accepted and permitted to compete in the championship classes.

The GPS signal quality can be extracted from the $GGA section of the NMEA string. The fix quality ranges from 0 – 8, for example 2 means DGPS fix, 4 means Real Time Kinematic, and 5 means float RTK. The user can define the standard (i.e., which fix quality is deemed as qualified) in the hardware configuration file. When a qualified GPS signal is available, the geographical location is extracted from the $GPGGA section. Otherwise, a preset pseudo-location is used, and this pseudo-location can be controlled by user input.|$|E

The presented study focuses on an experimental non-ventilated solar type of façade exposed to solar radiation {{both in the}} laboratory and in outdoor tests. Due to the high solar absorbance level of the façade, high- and low-emissivity contributions were primarily analysed. All of the implemented materials were contrasted from the thermal and optical point of view. An analysis was made of both thermodynamic and steady state procedures affecting the proposed solar façade concept. Experimental full scale tests on real building components were additionally involved during summer monitoring. An indicator of the temperature response generated by solar radiation exposure demonstrates the outdoor performance of the façade {{is closely related to}} overheating phenomena. From the thermal point of view, the proposed transparent insulation and selective absorber concept corresponds to the performance of conventional thermal insulation of identical material thickness; however, the non-selective prototype only provides 50 % thermal performance. The results of the solar-based experiments show that with a small-scale experimental prototype, approximately no significant difference is measured when compared with a non-selective absorber type. The only difference was achieved at the maximum of 2. 5 K, when the lower temperature was obtained in the solar selective concept. At the full-scale <b>outdoor</b> <b>mode,</b> the results indicate a maximum of 3. 0 K difference, however the lower temperature achieves a non-selective approach.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of mobile smart devices {{has led to}} a rapid increase of location-based services, many of which are amassing large datasets of user trajectory information. Unfortunately, current trajectory information is not yet sufficiently rich to support classification of user transportation modes. In this paper, we propose a method that employs both the Global Positioning System and accelerometer data from smart devices to classify user <b>outdoor</b> transportation <b>modes.</b> The classified modes include walking, bicycling, and motorized transport, in addition to the motionless (stationary) state, for which we provide new depth analysis. In our classification, stationary mode has two sub-modes: stay (remaining in the same place for a prolonged time period; e. g., in a parked vehicle) and wait (remaining at a location for a short period; e. g., waiting at a red traffic light). These two sub-modes present different semantics for data mining applications. We use support vector machines with parameters that are optimized for pattern recognition. In addition, we employ ant colony optimization to reduce the dimension of features and analyze their relative importance. The resulting classification system achieves an accuracy rate of 96. 31 % when applied to a dataset obtained from 18 mobile users...|$|R

In this study, green alga Chlorella sp. A 2 was cultivated by using a minimal nitrogen supply strategy under both laboratory and outdoor cultivation conditions to evaluate biomass accumulation and lipid production. Results showed that minimal nitrogen supply could promote neutral lipid accumulation of Chlorella sp. A 2 without a significant negative effect on cell growth. In laboratory cultivation mode, alga cells cultured with 18 mg L- 1 d- 1 urea addition could generate 74 % and 416 % (w/w) more neutral lipid productivity than cells cultured with regular BG 11 and nitrogen starvation media, respectively. In <b>outdoor</b> cultivation <b>mode,</b> lipid productivity of cells cultured with 18 mg L- 1 d- 1 urea addition is approximately 10 % and 88 % higher than the one with regular BG 11 and nitrogen starvation media, respectively.

Additionally, a new approach and methodology for testing the influence of gimbals on the exterior orientation parameters of UAV acquired images is presented. The main motive {{of this study is to}} examine the possibility of obtaining better geometry and favorable spatial bundles of rays of images in UAV photogrammetric surveying. The subject is a 3 -axis brushless gimbal based on a controller board (Storm 32). Only two gimbal axes are taken into consideration: roll and pitch axes.

Within these tests the change of the exterior orientation parameters without the use of a gimbal is determined, as well as the potential accuracy of the stabilization with the use of a gimbal.

Significantly, smaller discrepancies between data are noticed when a gimbal is used in flight simulation mode, even four times smaller than in other test modes. In this test the potential accuracy of a low budget gimbal for application in real conditions is determined...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{predicts the}} {{reductions}} in the indoor mass concentrations of particles attainable from use of filters in building supply airstreams and also from use of stand-alone fan-filter units. Filters with a wide efficiency range are considered. Predicted concentration reductions are provided for indoor-generated particles containing dust mite and cat allergen, for environmental tobacco smoke particles, and for outdoor-air fine mode particles. Additionally, this paper uses a simple model and available data to estimate the energy and total costs of the filtration options. Predicted reductions in cat and dust-mite allergen concentrations range from 20 % to 80 %. To obtain substantial, e. g., 50 %, reductions in indoor concentrations of these allergens, the rate of airflow through the filter {{must be at least}} a few indoor volumes per hour. Increasing filter efficiencies above approximately ASHRAE Dust Spot 65 % does not significantly reduce predicted indoor concentrations of these allergens. For environmental tobacco smoke particles and <b>outdoor</b> fine <b>mode</b> particles, calculations indicate that relatively large, e. g., 80 %, decreases in indoor concentrations are attainable with practical filter efficiencies and flow rates. Increasing the filter efficiency above ASHRAE 85 % results in only modest predicted incremental decreases in indoor concentration. Energy costs and total costs can be similar for filtration using filters {{with a wide range of}} efficiency ratings. Total estimated filtration costs of approximately $ 0. 70 to $ 1. 80 per person per month are insignificant relative to salaries, rent, or health insurance costs...|$|R

The heat gains from <b>outdoor</b> in convection <b>mode</b> and the heat released during maturation and fermentation phases are the main contributors for the cooling requirements at a winery.

Nevertheless, the accuracy of these measurements should be evaluated, {{taking into account the}} requirements of the Building Information Model (BIM). This paper analyzes the uncertainty in outdoor/indoor three-dimensional coordinate measures and point clouds (using Spherical Accuracy Standard (SAS) methods) for Eyes Map, a medium-cost tablet manufactured by e-Capture Research & Development Company, Mérida, Spain. To achieve it, in outdoor tests, by means of this device, the coordinates of targets were measured from 1 to 6 m and cloud points were obtained. Subsequently, these were compared to the coordinates of the same targets measured by a Total Station. The Euclidean average distance error was 0. 005 – 0. 027 m for measurements by Photogrammetry and 0. 013 – 0. 021 m for the point clouds. All of them satisfy the tolerance for point cloud acquisition (0. 051 m) according to the BIM Guide for 3 D Imaging (General Services Administration); similar results are obtained in the indoor tests, with values of 0. 022 m. In this paper, we establish the optimal distances for the observations in both, Photogrammetry and 3 D Photomodeling <b>modes</b> (<b>outdoor)</b> and point out some working conditions to avoid in indoor environments.

40|$|The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and its {{applications}} are growing for both {{civilian and military}} purposes. The operability of an UAV proved that some tasks and operations can be done easily and at a good cost-efficiency ratio. Nowadays, an UAV can perform autonomous missions. It is very useful to certain UAV applications, such as meteorology, vigilance systems, agriculture, environment mapping and search and rescue operations. One {{of the biggest problems}} that an UAV faces is the possibility of collision with other objects in the flight area. To avoid this, an algorithm was developed and implemented in order to prevent UAV collision with other objects. “Sense and Avoid” algorithm was developed as a system for UAVs to avoid objects in collision course. This algorithm uses a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), to detect objects facing the UAV in mid-flights. This light sensor is connected to an on-board hardware, Pixhawk’s flight controller, which interfaces its communications with another hardware: Raspberry Pi. Communications between Ground Control Station and UAV are made via Wi-Fi or cellular third or fourth generation (3 G/ 4 G). Some tests were made in order to evaluate the “Sense and Avoid” algorithm’s overall performance. These tests were done in two different environments: A 3 D simulated environment and a real <b>outdoor</b> environment.

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between the physical activity (PA) participation levels {{of men and women}} is well documented. Indeed, in the UK at least, women’s levels of inactivity are a serious concern, particularly given the effects of inactivity on long-term health. With recent shifts in the UK public health rhetoric recommending the attainment of daily PA levels via <b>outdoor</b> physical activity <b>modes,</b> such as walking and cycling, this paper seeks to explore the possible implications of such policy change on women’s PA participation and, specifically, the potential for gender-related barriers to be reduced. The paper features an empirical analysis of PA participation patterns among a sample of female respondents from a University in the South West of England. Data were collected via survey (n[*]=[*] 131, employees, n[*]=[*] 57, students: n[*]=[*] 74) and follow-up group and individual interviews (n[*]=[*] 45, employees: n[*]=[*] 25, students: n[*]=[*] 20). Findings acknowledge the various and diverse experiences of women with regards to social and cultural aspects of fear and risk and how this shapes PA participation. Specifically, the complex relationships women share with outdoor space are uncovered, and how access to, and patterns of exercise are influenced as a consequence. The paper concludes by reaffirming the need for links between public and personal health, well-being and the environment to be integral to the development of future policy and practice, whilst calling for further research to be carried out with different population groups across more varied geographical landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafine {{particles}} (UFPs, diameter < 100 nm) {{have been}} a significant health concern because of their adverse health effects. Since UFPs primarily origin from traffic emissions in urban environment, previous research efforts have dedicated to study UFPs in near-freeway and on-freeway environments. Despite improved understanding of UFPs in last two decades, UFPs in the in-cabin environment, whereby passenger exposures occur, has been largely overlooked. Although modern passenger vehicles are commonly equipped with cabin air filters, in-cabin UFP reduction is low (i. e., 40 - 60 %) in <b>outdoor</b> air (OA) <b>mode</b> and commuting exposure alone can account for a significant level of total daily exposure (i. e., up to 45 - 50 %). Although setting the ventilation system to recirculation (RC) mode can reduce in-cabin UFPs by 80 - 95 %, carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the exhaled breath of passengers can quickly accumulate in the passenger cabin. In order to reduce passenger exposures to UFPs and CO 2, this dissertation work investigated the in-cabin environment experimentally and quantitatively. From experimental measurements, this work quantified automotive envelope leakage and ventilation systems across {{a wide range of}} vehicle models / types from various manufacturers. The infiltration was found specific to location and also conditionally occurred as a result of two competing pressures: in-cabin pressure and aerodynamic pressure on vehicle envelope. The aerodynamic pressure also changed as a function of driving speed. To extend the findings, this dissertation work developed a quantitative model to simulate in-cabin air quality and evaluated the effects of infiltration and passive ventilation in wide range of driving speed and ventilation conditions. Parametric analysis using the model elucidated the fractional significance of in-cabin UFP gain/loss mechanisms affected by driving speed. Finally, the dissertation work proposed a novel simultaneous control method and demonstrated in-cabin concentration reduction of 93 % on average for UFPs in filed conditions while reducing CO 2 level by a factor of 3 - 4...|$|R
