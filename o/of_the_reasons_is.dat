25|$|On July 24, 2009, the Prosecutor General Valeriu Gurbulea said no {{policeman}} who maltreated protesters {{had been identified}} yet. Neither is it known who killed Boboc. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that policemen were wearing masks.|$|E
25|$|Izzard {{keeps his}} romantic life private, saying one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> {{due to the}} wishes of his companions not wanting to become content for his show. He dated Sarah Townsend, the {{director}} of the documentary Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story, whom he first met while she was running a Fringe venue at the Edinburgh Festival in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale dealing, production, import {{and export}} are prosecuted {{to the fullest}} extent of the law, {{even if it does}} not supply end users or coffeeshops with more than the allowed amounts. Exactly how coffeeshops get their {{supplies}} is rarely investigated, however. The average concentration of THC in the cannabis sold in coffeeshops has increased from 9% in 1998 to 18% in 2005. This means that less plant material has to be consumed to achieve the same effect. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> plant breeding and use of greenhouse technology for illegal growing of cannabis in Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> feeling between {{contract}} servicemen, conscripts, and officers.|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} new {{journals}} specializing in machine learning (e.g., Journal of Machine Learning) and many older journals {{that are now}} routinely sprinkled with machine learning papers (e.g., Journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Statistical Association). So far, however, applications in criminology are hard to find. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> time; {{it takes a while}} for new technology to diffuse. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> software; <b>the</b> popular statistical packages can be at least five years behind recent developments. Yet another part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> need for a dramatic attitude adjustment among criminologists. Empirical research in criminology is thoroughly dominated by a culture of causal modeling in which the intent is to explain in detail the mechanisms by which nature generated <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> a response variable as a particular function of designated predictors and stochastic disturbances.a Machine learning comes from a different culture characterized by an “algorithmic” perspective.|$|R
25|$|According to {{a survey}} by the {{regulatory}} body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also common}} for {{competitive}} swimmers to shave hair off their legs, arms, and torsos, to reduce drag {{and provide a}} heightened [...] "feel" [...] for the water by removing the exterior layer of skin along with the body hair. [...] Some professional soccer players also shave their legs. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that {{they are required to}} wear shin guards and in case of a skin rash the affected area can be treated more efficiently.|$|E
2500|$|According to the study, Christians in North America, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and Asia-Pacific {{regions are}} highly educated {{since many of}} the world {{universities}} were built by the historic Christian Churches, in addition to the historical evidence that [...] "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic". According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of gender equality in educational attainment, and the study suggests that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> the encouragement of the Protestant Reformers in promoting the education of women, which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{earned a}} LEED Gold certification. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> building was built from <b>the</b> recycled remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building it replaced, the Letterman Army Hospital.|$|R
50|$|Argentines, Brazilians and Europeans are {{gradually}} choosing Punta del Este as their permanent residence. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> peace in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> nature and increasing educational offerings.|$|R
25|$|The {{turnout was}} {{relatively}} low according to Al Jazeera, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> Egyptians {{were not given}} a day off as they were given on 28–29 November.|$|R
2500|$|The {{territory}} of Slovenia mainly ( [...] , i.e. 81%) {{belongs to the}} Black Sea basin, and a smaller part ( [...] , i.e. 19%) belongs to the Adriatic Sea basin. These two parts are divided into smaller units in regard to their central rivers, the Mura River basin, the Drava River basin, the Sava River basin with Kolpa River basin, and the basin of the Adriatic rivers. In comparison with developed countries, water quality in [...] Slovenia {{is considered to be}} among the highest in Europe. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> undoubtedly that most of the rivers rise on the mountainous {{territory of}} Slovenia. But {{this does not mean that}} Slovenia has no problems with surface water and groundwater quality, especially in areas with intensive farming.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you know}} it isn't! You know it's nothing. Oh! One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> what I told you once before, {{that as long as}} father is in trouble I can't let you think of me. Now that he's lost everything--?" [...] She bent her eyes inquiringly upon him, as if for the effect of this argument.|$|E
6000|$|I {{think one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that I have so allowed silence and {{separation}} to accumulate--the effort of {{breaking through the}} mass becomes in that case so formidable; the mass being thus the monstrous mountain that blocks up the fair scene and {{that one has to}} explain away. I am engaged in that effort at the present moment, however--I am breaking through the mass, boring through the mountain, I feel, as I put pen to paper--and this, too, though I don't, though I shan't, though I can't particularly [...] "explain." [...] And why should I treat you at this time of day--or, to speak literally, of night--as if you had begun suddenly {{not to be able to}} understand without a vulgar demonstration on the blackboard? As I should never dream of resorting to that mode of public proof that I tenderly and unabatedly love you, so why should I think it necessary to chalk it up there that there was, all those strange weeks and months during which I made you no sign, an absolute inevitability in the graceless appearance? I call them strange because of the unnatural face that they wear to me now--but they had at the time the deadliest familiar look; the look of all the other parts of life that one was giving up and doing without--even if it didn't resemble them in their comparative dismissability. From them I learned perforce at last to avert my head, whereas there wasn't a moment of the long stretch during which I never either wrote or wired you for generous leave to come down to tea or dinner or both, there wasn't a moment when I hadn't, from Chelsea to Windsor, my eyes fondly fixed on you. You seemed rather to go out of their reach when I was placed in some pretended assurance that you had left Qu'acre for Scotland, but now that I hear, by some equally vague voice of the air, that you are still at home--and this appears more confirmed to me--I have you intensely before me again; yes, and so vividly that I even make you out as sometimes looking at me. I think in fact it's a good deal the magnanimous sadness I so catch from you that makes me feel to-night how little longer I can bear my own black air of having fallen away while I yet really and intensely stick, and therefore get on the way to you again, so far as this will take me.|$|E
5000|$|Eastman {{has said}} of his own work [...] "Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for making (in fact a very large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason)</b> <b>is</b> to see things that I have never seen before - to build {{something}} that I can not fully understand or explain." ...|$|R
30|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> black-box {{manner in}} {{a very large number}} of new {{predictors}} are generated as a component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> search process. A new linear basis can be defined for each predictor and various sets of predictors. Another part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> that tree-based methods capitalize on regions in which associations with the response are weak. One by one, such regions do matter much, and conventional regression approaches bent on explanation might properly choose to ignore them. But when a large number of such regions is taken seriously, forecasting accuracy can dramatically improve. There is important predictive information in <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> regions, not in each region by itself.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{documentary}} evidence remains scarce; as some suggest, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that scholars in Russia working on archival material {{have tended to}} treat issues of sexuality with some caution and homosexuality remains a taboo subject for Russian readers and students.|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} of Ace {{has been cited}} as the first [...] "modern" [...] companion for the Doctor. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that her character was written to be more realistic, three-dimensional and to grow as a person throughout her run on the show.|$|E
50|$|The last {{execution}} in Hong Kong {{was carried out}} on 16 November 1966 when Wong Kai-Kei, age 26, was hanged at Stanley Prison. Following this, the death penalty <b>was</b> suspended. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> United Kingdom also de facto abolished the capital punishment the following year.|$|R
25|$|The Rest House {{has been}} in debates many times {{over whether or not}} it should be preserved. In 1995, the city decided to {{demolish}} the building, but the plan was put aside. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> announcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A-bomb Dome as a World Heritage site.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Youth Code {{authored}} by City Councilor Ray-an Cydrick Rentoy and co-{{authored by}} Sangguniang Kabataan Federation President Dan Paolo Morales, the City Youth Officials Program, being member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SKF President, recognition of various youth orgranizations, the Naga City Council for Youth Affairs, etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{exact number}} of Ju 388s built is {{difficult}} to determine. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that various pre-series aircraft were used as prototypes, and some were damaged or destroyed by Allied bombs before completion. Furthermore, several official records terminate {{before the end of}} production or contradict each other.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, Shanxi cuisine is less {{known to}} {{people outside the}} region. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that Shanxi is less {{populated}} as compared to other provinces in China. Being a very traditional region where the lifestyle of locals has not been modernised, many outsiders find Shanxi cuisine too authentic and traditional.|$|E
50|$|The {{situation}} is somewhat different for aquaria, where - although {{an increasing number}} of fish and invertebrates can be bred in human care - still newly acquired animals are predominantly wild-caught. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> that reproduction in aquaria just has not been possible yet or is - still - too expensive.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> out <b>of</b> Asia theory later {{fell into}} decline, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> because Franz Weidenreich merged the Asia {{hypothesis}} into <b>the</b> multiregional origin <b>of</b> modern humans, extending many other regions into his theory from the Old World with gene flow between various populations which influenced many anthropologists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|R

50|$|He {{was never}} {{selected}} for the German national football team, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> outstanding Franz Beckenbauer fulfilled <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> libero there at the time.

50|$|Umkirch is a {{separate}} community; it has still maintained its village-like character. However, this idyll {{is influenced by the}} freeway which leads through 20.000 cars a day through the city, which create often traffic jams. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> possibly the location of the industrial area just opposite the freeway connection. Also, the creation of high-riser restroyed much of the village atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The Zig Zag Railway {{have plans}} to extend the railway from Clarence to Newnes Junction, using the Dargans Deviation. They are {{currently}} halfway in relaying the track to Narrow Gauge. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> because Newnes Junction will provide a much better interchange with Blue Mountains Line services than Zig Zag Bottom Points, and this indicates that the Newnes Junction station will be restored in future.|$|E

50|$|During his {{departure}} into front-line army (1805) emperor Aleksander I left Vyazmitinov as the commander-in-chief in St.Petersburg. 13 January 1808 he <b>was</b> dismissed (one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> large scale <b>of</b> abuses by <b>the</b> commissariat officials). On 20 April 1811 he was newly accepted to the service, and with appointment {{as a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Council.|$|R
50|$|Despite these successes, de Moivre {{was unable}} to obtain an {{appointment}} to a chair of mathematics at any university, which would have released him from his dependence on time-consuming tutoring that burdened him more than it did most other mathematicians <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. At least a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> a bias against his French origins.|$|R
