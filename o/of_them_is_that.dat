25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{hypothesis}} as to how Ithaca Chasma formed. One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it formed as Tethys' internal liquid water ocean solidified, causing the moon to expand and cracking its surface to accommodate the extra volume within. Earlier craters made before Tethys solidified were probably all erased by geological activity before then.|$|E

Several Scottish officers were among the dead, including David Murray, Jacob Murray and George Michell. About 70 Scots escaped to the Russian forces in Wesenberg, the last historical record <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were subsequently brought to Moscow.|$|E

Sharing the same name as the television series, the book became another best-seller in the UK, and was outselling television chef Jamie Oliver by 100,000 copies, according to Waterstone's. It was reported that over 490,000 copies had been sold by mid-December in the UK. Furthermore, the book was number one for a period on Amazon UK's bestselling books, and was ninth on their overall list of Christmas bestsellers in any category. Paul Levy of The Guardian wrote that {{the tone of the}} recipes was [...] "just right. One of the appealing things about Nigella's brief introductions to each <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she thinks not just as cook, but as eater, and tells you whether they're messy, sticky or fussy." [...] In January 2008, Lawson was estimated to have sold more than 3 million books worldwide. Her Christmas book {{was released in}} October 2008 and the television show in December of the same year. An American edition of the book [...] "Nigella Christmas" [...] with a different cover photograph was released in November 2009 with an accompanying book tour of several US cities and a special on the USA's Food Network.|$|E
2500|$|As a Jewish Socialist, London’s {{position}} on Zionism further complicated his political situation. [...] Although he upset socialist Labor Zionists {{by refusing to}} introduce a resolution endorsing the Balfour Declaration into the House of Representatives, London did not oppose the right of Jews to live “a separate and distinct national existence fortified by a Jewish state…All that I ask <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they should not speak {{in the name of}} all Jews.” [...] Further, London believed in the possibility of a specifically socialist Jewish state, so long as it “can be accomplished without violating the Socialist principle which forbids forcible annexation.” [...] However, London's refusal to introduce the resolution united many Zionists against him. The Jewish community was further fragmented in opposition to London, with Orthodox Jews advocating his defeat because he was not religious while rich and powerful Jews worked against him because he was a socialist. Uptown Jews like Jacob Schiff, Louis Marshall, Nathan Straus, and Rabbi Stephen S. Wise urged the Jews to redeem themselves by rejecting London.|$|E
