5|$|In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Tom Ewell {{as a woman who}} becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In the shoot, Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E
5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
500|$|Her major {{breakthrough}} came in 1953, when she starred in three pictures: the film noir Niagara, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire. Sarah Churchwell, Monroe's biographer, notes that [...] "unconscious, rather than conscious, sexuality {{would become the}} Marilyn hallmark after 1953", and the actress {{became one of the}} most popular and recognizable people in America. In 1955 Monroe appeared in the Billy Wilder–directed comedy The Seven Year Itch, in which she becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. In it, Monroe stands on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career.|$|E
5000|$|Maugham is best-remembered for the {{all white}} music room {{at her house}} at 213 King's Road in London. For the grand {{unveiling}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> all <b>white</b> room, Maugham went to the extreme <b>of</b> dipping <b>her</b> <b>white</b> canvas draperies in cement. The room was filled with massive white floral arrangements and the overall effect was stunning. [...] Although she was known for <b>white</b> rooms, <b>her</b> own drawing room was the only all-white room she ever did.|$|R

500|$|In May 1923, Coolbrith's friend Edwin Markham {{found her}} at the Hotel Latham in New York, [...] "very old, ill and moneyless". He asked Lotta Crabtree to gather help for her. Crippled with arthritis, Coolbrith was brought back to California where she settled in Berkeley {{to be cared for}} by her niece. In 1924, Mills College conferred upon her an honorary Master of Arts degree. Coolbrith {{published}} Retrospect: In Los Angeles in 1925. In April 1926, she received visitors such as her old friend, art patron Albert M. Bender, who brought young Ansel Adams to meet her. Adams made a photographic portrait of Coolbrith seated near one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> Persian cats and wearing a large white mantilla on her head.|$|E
500|$|Less than a {{week after}} Vera's cub was removed from the polar bear enclosure, the zoo {{dedicated}} a website to the cub. [...] It provided frequent updates on her health and development, as well as exclusive photographs and videos. [...] The website also showcased a competition in which fans could vote for the cub's name. [...] The official name was announced on 18 January 2008 by Ulrich Maly, mayor of Nuremberg, and broadcast live on television. [...] Despite the overwhelming number of e-mailed suggestions from across the world (including [...] "Stella", [...] "Knutschi", [...] "Sissi" [...] and [...] "Yuki Chan"), the zoo officially named her Flocke, German for [...] "flake", as in [...] "snowflake". [...] "Flocke", used widely by the media previous to her official naming, was the nickname originally given to her by zookeepers because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> fur.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{problems}} Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> neighbors. Although Mamma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store {{at the heart of}} Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these [...] "powhitetrash" [...] girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from Ku Klux Klan raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the Depression. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of Joe Louis's championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.|$|E

2500|$|Lena Baker (June 8, 1900 [...] March 5, 1945) was an African American maid in Cuthbert, Georgia who {{was convicted}} of capital murder <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> employer, Ernest Knight. She was {{executed}} by the state of Georgia in 1945. Baker was the only woman in Georgia to be executed by electrocution.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah-h-h!' came her strange, intaken cry, as, on the reflex, she started, {{turned and}} fled, {{scudding}} with an unthinkable swift beating <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> feet and fraying <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white</b> garments, towards the church. Like a hound {{the young man}} was after her, leaping the steps and swinging past her father, his supple haunches working like those of a hound that bears down on the quarry.|$|E

60|$|Although brown, Sally's face is {{extremely}} pretty, {{by reason of}} the regularity <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little features, the beauty <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little <b>white</b> teeth, and the brilliancy <b>of</b> <b>her</b> large black eyes, to say nothing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> luxuriant hair and the gleeful insolence <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sweet expression.|$|R

60|$|She {{rose to her}} feet, {{and he saw the}} dim {{outline of}} her graceful figure, even a vision <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white,</b> tear-stained face.|$|E
60|$|She wildly {{clutched}} his knees. Jean was conscious only <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>white,</b> agonized {{face and the}} dark eyes with their look of terrible strain.|$|E
5000|$|According to legend, the Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia {{promised not}} to change her {{underwear}} until the city of Ostend had been conquered. The long duration of the siege led to the colour <b>of</b> <b>her</b> clothes <b>white</b> to dark.|$|R
60|$|She made a {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> big, <b>white</b> hand, {{with the result}} that Godfrey felt like a spring which had been suddenly released. Next instant, still pursued by that gurgling laughter, he was running hard towards the diligence.|$|R

60|$|Dominey swung around. On a mound {{a little}} {{distance}} away in the park, Rachael Unthank was standing. In her rusty black clothes, unrelieved by any trace <b>of</b> colour, <b>her</b> <b>white</b> cheeks and strange eyes, even {{in the morning light}} she was a repellent figure.
