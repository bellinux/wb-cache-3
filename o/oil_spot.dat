After firing a torpedo at the cutter that passed close the Senecas bow, the submarine submerged. Seneca attacked with depth charges and may have sunk the submarine, but they could not remain in the area to investigate further.|$|E

50|$|Today, most potters are {{familiar}} with tenmoku glaze in a reduction firing. But to get <b>oil</b> <b>spot</b> effects, stiff tenmokus need to be fired in oxidation. This relies on a very simple chemical principle that, once understood, leads to successful firings. Red iron oxide (Fe2O3) acts as a refractory in oxidation but it can easily be changed to a flux {{in the form of}} black iron oxide (FeO), in reduction. Most potters {{are familiar}} with this property but for oil spots, we are interested in iron’s ability to self-reduce. At approximately cone 7 (2250 °F or 1232 °C), ferric iron (Fe2O3) cannot maintain its trigonal crystalline structure and rearranges to a cubic structure, magnetite (Fe3O4), which further reduces to become ferrous (FeO). This is called thermal reduction, and what this means in layman’s terms is that, when it is sufficiently heated, the red iron oxide used in the glaze recipe will naturally let go of an oxygen atom. As the liberated oxygen bubbles rise {{to the surface of the}} glaze, they drag a bit of the magnetite with them and deposit it on the surface. A rough black spot is left on the glaze surface that is a different color than the surrounding glaze, due to the larger concentration of iron oxide in that small area and its subsequent re-oxidization during cooling.|$|E

5000|$|From 1999 til mid 2008, {{the price}} of oil rose significantly.

Based on Brent crude <b>oil</b> <b>spot</b> and futures daily prices from July 2007 to June 2009, our empirical analysis shows both <b>oil</b> <b>spot</b> and futures prices are STUR series and have time-varying autoregressive coefficients, which is consistent with excess volatility of oil prices. Moreover, stochastic cointegration relationship does exist between <b>oil</b> <b>spot</b> and futures prices, revealing the long term equilibrium relationship under the influence of financial crisis.
