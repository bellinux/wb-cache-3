40|$|AbstractIPCC AR 4 {{reported}} that the emission of the anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) increase the CO 2 concentration in atmosphere after the Industrial Revolution, and increasing of CO 2 concentration caused the global warming. Moreover, it is shown that CO 2 dissolution into the ocean causes the acidification in the surface layer. The buffering effect of the ocean can suppress the change of the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, {{the rise of the}} CO 2 concentration in the ocean surface means the pH of seawater decreases. This phenomenon continues until the difference of CO 2 partial pressure between the atmosphere and the ocean disappears if the emission of CO 2 is stopped. But, the acidification of the ocean progresses as long as it keeps CO 2 emission. It is feared that the ocean acidification has crises influence on various organisms and entire ocean ecosystem. Carbon Capture and Storage is one of the mitigation measure technologies of CO 2 emission. Famous carbon storage technology of the CCS using ocean region is Sub-seabed Geological Storage and dilution type <b>Ocean</b> <b>Sequestration.</b> These CCS Technologies has been developed in RITE. Especially, Research and development project of <b>ocean</b> <b>sequestration</b> technology was established the core technologies for example CO 2 injection and dilution technology, prediction of drop and diluted CO 2 and evaluation methods of biological influence of CO 2. These core technologies were enabled a feasibility study of <b>Ocean</b> <b>Sequestration</b> technology as total system. These studies showed constructions of <b>ocean</b> <b>sequestration</b> system, and estimated sequestration costs and additional CO 2 amount. Furthermore, in this evaluation, the <b>ocean</b> <b>sequestration</b> system without the influence on the marine organism was shown by scientists of the <b>Ocean</b> <b>Sequestration</b> Project of Japan. This evaluation and comparison study for atmospheric CO 2 decreasing measure and ocean acidification mitigation measure was based on above results, and it was carried out using three dimensional numerical model with ocean circulation model (MOM: Modular Ocean Model), global carbon cycle model based on a lower trophic ecosystem model and one box atmospheric model. And the several scenarios were selected for evaluation of CCS efficiency. These scenarios ware targeted over CO 2 emission based on S 550 scenario and over emission were allocated to Geological Storage, <b>Ocean</b> <b>Sequestration,</b> other measure and no measure.

In CO 2 <b>ocean</b> <b>sequestration,</b> dilution process of injected CO 2 plays an important roll on biological impact. In this study, we investigated a turbulent wake flow behind a circular cylinder at Reynolds number(Re) = 5 x 105, which simulates the wake flow behind the CO 2 releasing pipe in CO 2 <b>ocean</b> <b>sequestration.</b> By using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV), we examined flow behaviour as well as turbulent properties of the wake flow over the critical Reynolds number. Figure 1 a) shows a snapshot of measured two-dimensional velocity field at Re= 5 x 105. In the figure, the result at Re= 6 x 104 (Fig. 1 b)) is also displayed for comparison. Wake width at Re= 5 x 105 is narrower than that at Re= 6 x 104. It was also revealed that turbulent intensities normalised by mean flow velocity in case of the flow at Re= 5 x 105 was about one-half to the flow at Re= 6 x 104. At Re= 5 x 105, vortex marching was limited in narrow region behind the wake and vortex size was small compared to that at Re= 6 x 104. Thus, turbulent motion in the wake was restricted {{in the case of the}} high Reynolds number flow.

40|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>sequestration</b> {{of carbon}} dioxide is {{considered}} to be a potentially important method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (US DOE, 1999). Oceans are currently the largest atmospheric carbon dioxide sink; and certainly, enough storage capacity exists in the oceans to hold all of the CO 2 that we can emit for many years. Additionally, technologies exist that allow us to pump liquid CO 2 into the oceans at depths between one and two kilometers for extended periods of time and five times that deep for shorter durations.

40|$|Ocean {{disposal}} of CO 2 {{continues to be}} of great interest as a possible mitigation strategy for reducing atmospheric emissions of anthropogenic CO 2.

40|$|To {{have better}} {{understandings}} of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) in northern South China Sea(NSCS), the pCO 2 readings from 1999 - 2012 were reviewed. Both the pCO 2 in NSCS and in the atmosphere also showed an increasing trends and the pCO 2 in NSCS varied across the seasons. There are many important processes that influenced the pCO 2 in NSCS, which were {{the rise of the}} temperature, biological production, seasonal upwelling, Pearl River discharge, increase in the concentration of atmospheric pCO 2 and the rate of calcification. These six mechanisms extend different strengths on the resultant sea surface pCO 2 in NSCS. The impact of induced sea water acidification on the marine phytoplankton by the high pCO 2 in NSCS would also be discussed. The drop of pH in the seawater would change the community of phytoplankton from diatom to dinoflagellate as a resistance to the change of pH of dinoflagellate that was better than the diatom. DMS, {{which was one of the}} climatically important gases, would also affected by the high pCO 2 induced seawater acidification. Hong Kong (HK) was studied as a case to estimate whether NSCS also faced the same impacts upon by the marine phytoplankton. The study showed that the diatom was relatively sensitive to the drop of pH in HK waters. The DMS producing marine phytoplankton was also affected by the drop of pH in HK waters. It was concluded that the NSCS might also face the same situation with HK.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{evaluates the}} {{expected}} {{environmental impact of}} several promising schemes for <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration</b> by direct injection of CO 2, {{and serves as a}} major update to the assessment by Auerbach et al. (1997) and Caulfield et al. (1997) of water quality impacts and the induced mortality to zooplankton. The impact assessment methodology from the earlier studies has been updated to incorporate the extended probit methodology of Sato et al. (2004), and revised mortality relationships based mainly on copepods were developed after a thorough review of publicly available CO 2 toxicity data for zooplankton and fish. The impact assessment is conducted for three discharge approaches, each designed to maximize dilution over the water column: a point release of negatively buoyant CO 2 hydrate particles from a moving ship; a stationary point release of CO 2 hydrate particles forming a sinking plume; and a long, bottom-mounted diffuser discharging buoyant liquid CO 2 droplets. Two of these scenarios take advantage of the enhanced dilution offered by CO 2 hydrate particles, and are based on ongoing laboratory and field studies on the formation and behavior of such particles (Chow et al., 2008). Overall, results suggest that it is possible with present or near present technology to engineer discharge configurations that achieve sufficient dilution to largely avoid acute impacts. In particular, the moving ship hydrate discharge is identified as the most promising due to its operational flexibility. In addition to lethal effects, sub-lethal and ecosystem effects are discussed qualitatively, though not analyzed quantitatively. The main conclusion from our analysis is that <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration</b> by direct injection should not be dismissed as a climate change mitigation strategy on the basis of environmental impact alone.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{workshop}} was to bring together the principal investigators of all the projects that were being funded under the DOE <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration</b> research program. The primary goal of the workshop was to interchange research results, to discuss ongoing research, and to identify future research priorities. In addition, we hoped to encourage the development of synergies and collaborations between the projects and to write an EOS article summarizing {{the results of the}} meeting. The primary outcome of the meeting was a decision to write two papers for the reviewed literature on carbon sequestration by iron fertilization, and on carbon sequestration by deep sea injection and to examine the possibility of an overview article in EOS on the topic of <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration.</b> There has been significant progress on several of these goals since the meeting: (1) Review of carbon sequestration by iron fertilization: One of the most interesting results of the meeting was a presentation by John Marshall of iron fertilization simulations carried out at MIT that suggested a much higher efficiency of CO 2 uptake from the atmosphere with a newer generation model (since published by Dutkiewicz, et al., 2006]) than earlier studies had found with an older generation model (cf., Gnanadesikan, et al., 2003). The decision was made that this finding should be investigated with a new set of simulations using other newer generation models with realistic parameterization of biological processes. This research has progressed considerably, with the modeling groups of MIT, Princeton University, UCLA, Stanford University, and Los Alamos National Laboratory participating. A follow up meeting of the principal participants was held on September 11 - 15, 2006, using remaining funds from the original grant, and three manuscripts are now in an advanced state of preparation: Chavez, F., et al., in preparation.

Maltrud, and J. Dunne, in preparation. Iron fertilization models revisited. The new iron fertilization simulation confirms some of the MIT results of higher efficiency, while also drawing attention to several additional processes not considered in previous studies such as the effect of eddies in an eddy resolving model (Jin et al., in preparation), and the effect of including a realistic atmospheric reservoir in the models as in Gnanadesikan, et al. [2003], which leads to a significant reduction in the overall efficiency (cf., Sarmiento et al., in preparation). (2) Review of carbon sequestration by deep sea injection: An outline of paper was completed by J. Barry, but this project has not progressed beyond this point. (3) Overview article for EOS on <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration.</b> This idea was put on hold until the issues raised by the MIT study of iron fertilization had been resolved.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{strategies for}} producing negatively buoyant CO[subscript 2] hydrate composite particles for <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration.</b> Our study {{is based on}} recent field observations showing that a continuous-jet hydrate reactor located at an ocean depth of 1500 m produced curved negatively buoyant cylindrical particles with diameters ~ 2. 5 cm and lengths up to ~ 1 m. Accordingly we performed new laboratory experiments to determine the drag coefficient of such particles and, {{based on the measured}} drag coefficient and the initial settling velocity observed in the field, have concluded that the reactor efficiency (percentage of liquid CO[subscript 2] converted to hydrate) in the field was ~ 16 %. Using the dissolution rates observed in the field, we conclude that such particles would ultimately sink to depth below discharge of ~ 115 m. We have also predicted the sinking depth of particles potentially produced from various scaled-up reactors and have shown that, for example, a 10 cm diameter particle produced with a hydrate conversion of 50 % could reach the ocean bottom before completely dissolving. In a real sequestration scenario, we are interested in following large groups of hydrate particles released continuously. We have previously shown that increasing particle size and hydrate conversion efficiency enhances the sinking of hydrate particle plumes produced by the continuous release of CO[subscript 2] in a quiescent ambient, but that a sufficiently strong current will cause the entrained particles to separate from the plume and settle discretely. In the latter case, particles of different sizes and hydrate conversions (hence different settling velocities) will follow different settling trajectories as they dissolve. This particle fractionation, if employed deliberately, spreads the discharged CO[subscript 2] in the down current and vertical directions, enhancing mixing, while turbulent diffusion helps spread the CO[subscript 2] in the third direction. A numerical model that incorporates these processes is used to predict the downstream concentrations and changes in pH from such particle plumes in a ‘strong’ current. An extension of this model simulates hydrate particles that are released continuously from a moving ship. Because of the ship speed, such particles would never form a coherent plume, but the combination of particle fractionation and advection due to the ship motion produces excellent dilution of the discharged CO[subscript 2].

40|$|Physical, {{chemical}} and biological processes can mediate carbon transfer from surface ocean waters to below the permanent pycnocline and so promote <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration.</b> Passive sinking of organic and carbonate-rich biogenic particles - the ‘biological pump’ -has been estimated to account for a sequestration flux of 2 - 8 gC m- 2 yr- 1 at around 1000 m depth. Here we identify a comparably important mechanism for sequestering carbon in the North Atlantic and other sub-polar seas. We estimate {{that as a result}} of the annual vertical migration of overwintering copepods, between 2 and 6 gC m- 2 yr- 1 are actively transported to below the permanent pycnocline as lipids. Only 25 - 50 % of these lipids are carried back to the surface in spring with the surviving copepods, resulting in a sequestration flux of 1 to 4 gC m- 2 yr- 1. This ’lipid pump’ has gone largely un-recorded in either direct measurements of carbon sequestration, or estimates based on surface production and export flux. In addition, elemental ratios of nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon and iron to carbon are extremely low or zero in lipids, so the lipid pump does not strip the surface ocean of limiting nutrients, and decouples the carbon sink from nutrient replenishment rates...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAmong {{possible}} {{carbon capture}} and storage methods {{to mitigate the}} global warming, the direct injection of CO 2 into the deep ocean by the moving ship method, {{is considered to be a}} feasible way and expected to minimize its environmental impacts on ma rine organisms in the vicinity of the injection points. In this study, a simple but effective numerical model for the given practical scenario of very large system was developed with adopting moving and nesting grid technique and low-wavenumber forcing technique. The calculated results show that the maximum change of additional p CO 2 is lower than a non-observed effect concentration, + 5, 000  μatm, in the both small and mesoscale domains. This indicates that the scenario of 30 ships with different length of injection pipes injecting total CO 2 of 50 million t/yr and moving in the 111 km × 333 km operation area is efficient and effective. The developed techniques demonstrated its efficiencies and applicability to give an outline for the optimization of the CO 2 <b>ocean</b> <b>sequestration</b> system, by which biological impacts should be minimized and insignificant...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{injection}} of CO 2 into the ocean, a radical idea suggested 25 years ago (Marchetti 1977), is among several carbon sequestration alternatives under consideration {{to offset the}} accelerating rise in anthropogenic greenhouse gases (Reichle et al 1999, Brewer et al. 1999). This issue raises important questions concerning the impacts of pH changes and elevated CO 2 levels for marine ecosystems and the role, if any, <b>ocean</b> <b>sequestration</b> should play in a national or global carbon management strategy. While there is uncertainty concerning physical responses to greenhouse gas forcing (Caldeira et al 2003), {{there is no doubt}} that oceanic CO 2 levels have risen significantly (Keeling and Whorf 2002, Barnola et al. 2003) and will continue to do so (Marland et al. 2001). Roughly 1 / 3 rd of current fossil fuel CO 2 emissions (~ 7 GtCO 2 y- 1) enter the sea surface through air-sea exchange (Houghton et al. 1990, McNeil et al 2003), thereby acidifying the upper ocean (Sabine et al. 2002). Continued acidification by air/sea CO 2 exchang...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four separate studies which explore the use of random walk particle tracking (RWPT) in simulating environmental mass transport. Two of the studies also consider the efficacy and marine impact of <b>ocean</b> CO 2 <b>sequestration</b> by direct injection. The first study compares RWPT to two other simple Lagrangian techniques (forward and backward Gaussian puff tracking) to simulate mixing beyond the near field of a pollutant discharge. RWPT {{is found to be}} more accurate, but also more computationally expensive, thus motivating hybrid approaches where Lagrangian calculations transition to Eulerian schemes in the far field. The second study considers 1 D RWPT when strong gradients in ambient diffusivity exist. For step profiles, the work of past investigators is unified and extended, and the Thomson et al. (1997) particle reflection approach is recommended. For piecewise linear profiles, a novel and efficient particle reflection with probability translation approach is proposed. The third study implements RWPT to emulate the tracer transport of an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) using the OGCM's flow and diffusivity fields. A high level of agreement between RWPT and OGCM results is achieved. Particle reflection with probability translation successfully handled sharply varying vertical diffusivities. However, precisely mimicking OGCM calculations proved difficult due to complications in specifying the subgrid scale variation of isopycnal slope and diffusivity in steeply sloped or convectively unstable regions, and in accurately implementing the Gent-McWilliams eddy-induced transport. (cont.) Further development is recommended to resolve spurious upwelling occurring mainly in the Southern Ocean. The utility of RWPT is demonstrated by calculating domain-wide CO 2 sequestration efficiencies using a novel book-keeping method. Additional RWPT benefits to oceanographic investigation are also proposed. The fourth study updates the Auerbach et al. (1997) and Caulfield et al. (1997) joint assessment of acute environmental impact to zooplankton resulting from ocean CO 2 discharges. Acute toxicity data are used to estimate the cumulative harm accrued by passive organisms drifting through idealized CO 2 plumes generated by three promising discharge methods. Results suggest that discharges can be engineered to largely avoid acute impacts, and that <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration</b> should not be dismissed on the basis of environmental impact alone. by Peter Hampus Israelsson.

40|$|Plumes of {{negatively}} buoyant hydrate particles, {{formed by}} reacting liquid CO[subscript 2] with seawater at ocean depths of 1000 – 1500 m, {{have been suggested}} {{as a way to}} help sequester CO[subscript 2]. The vertical flux of CO[subscript 2] can be increased by constructing a shroud around the hydrate particle source to shelter the plume from effects of ambient stratification and current. The shroud also serves as an inverted chimney, inducing a down draft that will transport the dissolving particles to a depth of lower ambient disturbance. Laboratory PIV measurements are compared to an analysis of an idealized shroud that is long, frictionless and driven by a single phase source of buoyancy distributed uniformly over the shroud base. Results indicate that induced draft, and hence dilution of dissolved CO[subscript 2], increases with plume buoyancy, and shroud length and diameter, but efficiency decreases with increasing ratio of particle slip velocity divided by the characteristic induced draft velocity. While larger particles show reduced plume-like behavior and hence are less efficient in inducing draft, they still generated about half of the theoretically predicted flow. United States.

Workshop 2 The impact of anthropogenic perturbations on open <b>ocean</b> carbon <b>sequestration</b> via the dissolved and particulate phases of the biological carbon pump, 28 - 31 January 2013, Goa, IndiaThe complex marine carbon cycle as known at present may suffer alterations from the pressure of changing environmental conditions resulting from anthropogenic activities. The biological pump and the resulting sequestration of CO 2, that is, the production in the surface ocean of biological particles that ultimately sink and carry to depth a significant quantity of carbon, may be altered by a number of factors: increase of the amount of CO 2 entering the surface ocean from the atmosphere, decrease of CO 2 dissolution associated to increasing seawater temperature, increase of acidity of the seawater (decreasing pH) associated to increasing CO 2 concentration and its implication in several biological compartments and marine aggregate dynamics. Considering these factors, a review of a two decade time-series of downward flux of particles and carbon export is done and the major factors governing particulate carbon sink are reconsidered in the prospect of future predictable changes in the environment. Special attention will be given to the possible consequence of changing water temperature and acidity on carbon exportPeer Reviewe...|$|R
