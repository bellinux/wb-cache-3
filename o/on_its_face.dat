5|$|The face appears wide due to ruffs of {{extended}} hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils. The {{nose of the}} bobcat is pinkish-red, {{and it has a}} base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face,</b> sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the book}} is <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face</b> an {{adventure}} story, a major theme {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face,</b> and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E

25|$|In this {{particular}} decision, which arose {{from a federal}} child pornography prosecution, the Court ruled that a warrant that was predicated on the undercover delivery of a videotape to the defendant's home, but did not state this <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face,</b> was properly issued and executed because it described {{the place to be}} searched and the objects to be seized, and the search was conducted after the delivery was made. Evidence seized from the defendant's house from that search was therefore admissible in court against him.|$|E

The pieces of the two sides do not differ in color, but instead each piece is shaped like a wedge, and faces forward, toward the opposing side. This shows who controls the piece during play.|$|E
25|$|In such a way, Waldman asserted: {{defying the}} law is <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face</b> {{generally}} a bad thing because defiance would weaken respect for the law in most cases, especially if the legal system is basically decent; therefore, {{in order to meet}} this objection, those who advocated civil disobedience must have legitimate justifications to defy the law. Answering Waldman's objections, King often used such a particular argument: the evils being opposed were so serious, so numerous, and so difficult to fight that civil disobedience was a justifiable last resort. Although the means were regrettable, the end justified the means.|$|E
25|$|<b>On</b> <b>its</b> <b>face,</b> {{quantum field}} theory allows {{infinite}} numbers of particles, and leaves {{it up to the}} theory itself to predict how many and with which probabilities or numbers they should exist. When developed further, the theory often contradicts observation, so that its creation and annihilation operators can be empirically tied down. Furthermore, empirical conservation laws like that of mass-energy suggest certain constraints on the mathematical form of the theory, which are mathematically speaking finicky. The latter fact both serves to make quantum field theories difficult to handle, but has also lead to further restrictions on admissible forms of the theory; the complications are mentioned below under the rubrik of renormalization.|$|E

25|$|We have {{no doubt}} that if the Legislature of this State should {{undertake}} to proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, it is not so <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face,</b> for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; {{it is a question of}} fact whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.|$|E
25|$|The court first {{considered}} clause 2.1 in the Development Agreement. They noted that, while <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face</b> {{it seemed}} to create in Burger King a right to terminate {{in the event of}} non-compliance by Hungry Jack's, it was actually subject to a number of qualifications, and that there were other procedures within the agreement for dealing with situations of non-compliance. The court disagreed with Burger King's broad reading of the consequences of a breach of clause 2.1, concluding that such an interpretation would mean that Hungry Jack's could not take advantage of the grace period, and that a narrower view should be preferred. Accordingly, they found that since Burger King had not allowed the 12-month grace period to expire, its termination was not effective.|$|E
25|$|Tactile imaging is {{a medical}} imaging {{modality}} that translates the sense of touch into a digital image. The tactile image {{is a function of}} P(x,y,z), where P is the pressure on soft tissue surface under applied deformation and x,y,z are coordinates where pressure P was measured. Tactile imaging closely mimics manual palpation, since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face</b> acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination, slightly deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern. Figure on the right presents an experiment on a composite tissue phantom examined by a tactile imaging probe illustrating the ability of tactile imaging to visualize in 3D the structure of the object.|$|E

25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the severable arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and voidable contracts where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face.</b> One justice of that court, Raoul Cantero, dissented, saying that the majority was ignoring the actual language of the FAA.|$|E
25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case an easy one. But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face,</b> as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, {{it would seem that the}} Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, it would seem that the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E
25|$|Of course, {{if in the}} {{exercise}} of his discretion under s 6FA the Commissioner imposed a condition that had no reasonable connection with his function under the Act or the Letters Patent, that would not be a valid exercise of power. To take an extreme example, a direction that leave to cross-examine would not be granted unless an applicant made a donation to a political party would be plainly invalid. But par 12 <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>face</b> seems rationally and reasonably related to the efficient performance of the obligations of the Commissioner. Paragraph 12 is a means of ascertaining whether or not an applicant has demonstrated a sufficient interest in challenging the evidence of a particular witness. Further, a statement under par 12 will alert the Commissioner and all others concerned as to the true extent of factual disputes and thus promote the efficient resolution of those disputes. In a large and complex administrative enquiry where there is no equivalent to the pleadings and particulars used in civil litigation, the par 12 procedure has an obvious utility.|$|E
