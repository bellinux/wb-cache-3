40|$|For {{university}} students, the availability, {{convenience and}} low cost of mobile applications (apps) present new opportunities to fit learning into their busy lives <b>outside</b> <b>class.</b> <b>Studies</b> of teacher-led mobile learning in universities abound while few studies explore students’ own use of mobile apps and their perspectives on how these apps can benefit their learning. As we consider learning for the future, {{it is crucial}} to partner with students to build a picture of emergent technology practices beyond our classrooms and institutions. However, discipline-specific studies are required to gain an understanding of the ways apps are used to acquire specific disciplinary knowledge and skills. This paper reports on how 134 language learners used mobile apps to profit from their available learning time <b>outside</b> of <b>class.</b> It provides insights into student perspectives on the benefits of using mobile apps for foreign language learnin...|$|R
50|$|Homework is {{time the}} student spends {{applying}} the class material without {{supervision of the}} professor: this includes studying notes, supplementary reading, writing papers, or other unsupervised activities such as labwork or field work. Because students are generally expected to spend three hours <b>outside</b> <b>class</b> <b>studying</b> and doing homework for every hour spent in class, 15 SCH is the typical full course load, although many colleges consider 12 SCH a minimum full-time load for financial aid and other purposes. Some schools set a flat rate for full-time students, such that a student taking over 12 or 15 credit hours will pay the same amount as a student taking exactly 12 (or 15). A part-time student taking less than 12 hours pays per credit hour, on top of matriculation and student fees.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} a multi-stage research project described through the narratives of the two authors. The research project investigated what students thought were effective (i. e., Good) and less effective (i. e., Bad) ways to learn English. The paper presents {{some of the main}} findings of the various components of the studies. One important finding relevant to educators working in self-access centres is that students responding to the open-ended portions of the study did not mention electronic, online or multimedia resources, or self-access learning centres (SALCs). Follow-up closed-response questionnaire findings indicated that students evaluated electronic resources and SALCs positively as good ways to learn <b>outside</b> of <b>class.</b> The authors suggest that a questionnaire-based list of ways to learn English out of class is an effective way to raise students’ awareness of alternatives for learners.

40|$|Hampel, RobertResearch {{has shown}} that {{undergraduate}} students benefit from participating in peer study meetings in which they voluntarily work together on academic material <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> time. Such productive peer interactions can help students persist in college to the completion of their undergraduate degrees (academic achievement), and develop transferable skills that are essential for success in life after college (professional development). These ways of supporting students align with the main goals of the NUCLEUS program. Therefore, providing better support for NUCLEUS {{students to participate in}} productive <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> peer <b>study</b> meetings is one way NUCLEUS staff can foster the mission of the NUCLEUS program. The NUCLEUS program is an undergraduate academic support program in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Delaware. Historically, NUCLEUS staff have encouraged students to work on course material with classmates <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> time and class requirements. However, a survey of NUCLEUS students’ engagement in voluntary peer <b>study</b> meetings <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> <b>time</b> has never been carried out. This Executive Position Paper describes the findings of a descriptive study that used mixed methods to investigate the extent to which NUCLEUS students were involved in <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> peer <b>study</b> meetings during the fall 2012 semester. Furthermore, to ascertain how NUCLEUS staff can better support NUCLEUS students’ participation in productive, <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> peer <b>study</b> meetings (the organizational improvement goal of this Executive Position Paper), the study explored the factors that helped and hindered student participation in peer study meetings as well as the factors that helped and hindered productivity in peer study meetings. Implications from these findings, in addition to NUCLEUS students’ suggestions, informed the implementation of several program activities to better support NUCLEUS students’ participation in productive peer study meetings. Additionally, further recommendations for the NUCLEUS program and recommendations for ways the university may better support all students’ participation in <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> peer <b>study</b> activities are described.

40|$|In {{this era}} of globalisation, many bilingual {{teachers}} of English are pursuing their postgraduate degrees in English-speaking contexts. However, most teacher training programmes concentrate on providing academic qualifications to these in-service teachers of English, while neglecting their expectations and lived experiences <b>outside</b> <b>class.</b> The current <b>study</b> examines this gap by interviewing and emailing Asian in-service teachers of English who were enrolled in a Master of TESOL programme in Australia. It explores how these in-service teachers' expectations to improve their spoken English influenced their experiences <b>outside</b> <b>class.</b> This <b>study</b> seeks to understand how these in-service teachers developed as users and teachers of English. Findings suggest that when the participants were in Australia, they actively connected their expectations and their pursuit of content knowledge inside class with their experiences <b>outside</b> <b>class.</b> They also exercised agency {{in order to achieve}} their expectations of increasing their English proficiency. Moreover, the participants demonstrated how they developed as users and teachers of English through their strategic thinking and actions.

The findings showed that the highest motive for students to use it was because ‘using YouTube has been beneficial to their English, followed by ‘using YouTube is interesting’, then, ‘using YouTube motivated them to study English’ and ‘the YouTube material was relevant to what was studied in class”. The lowest motive included ‘using YouTube in class motivated them {{to use it to}} themselves to <b>study</b> English <b>outside</b> of <b>classes.</b> Furthermore, some students’ open responses to YouTube were: they can practice their English by watching native speakers; it has pictures so it is easy for students to understand the topic, and the materials were relevant since they were practicing listening. Yet, negative responses were also found such as they did not have internet connection at home, were not motivated to do it alone and were not assigned homework to use it.

By the middle of the 20 th century, the NCAA was more focused on upholding the amateur ideal of college sports than the safety of players. Today, defining the organization’s primary function depends on who you ask. The NCAA’s stated mission is to, “govern competition in a fair, safe, equitable and sportsmanlike manner, and to integrate intercollegiate athletics into higher education so that the educational experience of the student-athlete is paramount ” (NCAA, 2005 c). Student-athletes and faculty wonder if academics are really an important concern of the Association, as athletes register for bogus classes in an attempt to stay eligible and miss untold hours of <b>class</b> and <b>study</b> <b>time</b> practicing, traveling, and playing.

30|$|The role {{of media}} {{multitasking}} on comprehension {{is dependent on}} self-regulation and self-awareness. Students who are particularly metacognitive or self-aware recognized deficits in comprehension upon returning to the primary task and subsequently re-read portions of the article after interruption. Although this increases reading time, it can make up for deficits in comprehension. While this is acceptable for academic tasks which are not completed under time-constraints such as homework assignments, multitasking during time-contingent academic tasks such as an essay or in-class lecture is problematic; the student cannot make up for deficits in comprehension via repeated exposure to the text without costs to performance. Thus, the type of work matters when examining the impact of media multitasking on performance. Some research suggests that regardless of context, whether learning in <b>class,</b> <b>studying</b> <b>outside</b> <b>class,</b> or engaging in homework alone or in collaboration, most students tend to multitask with smartphones (Jacobsen & Forste, 2011; Junco, 2012). Although media, such as smartphones, provide access to educational resources and facilitate collaboration, studies indicate that technology-related distractions are negatively related to homework effort and environment (Chan, Walker, & Gleaves, 2015; Hawi & Samaha, 2016; Xu, 2015).|$|R
