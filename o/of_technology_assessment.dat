In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office <b>of</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} make {{important}} contributions, energy <b>technology</b> <b>assessments</b> must be large, interdisciplinary projects, generally becoming very time consuming and expensive. This small project does not involve a large assessment, but instead combines several different types of investigations aimed at exploring the potential for, and significance of, uncertainty in the energy <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> process. First, a survey and discussion is presented <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>assessments,</b> primarily from a methodological viewpoint. A general ideal methodology is developed and the potentials for incorporating uncertainties are described. Second, there is a detailed development of meteorology, demographic and health impact components, the key components in energy <b>technology</b> <b>assessments.</b> There is particular emphasis on the impacts of assumptions and potential methods for incorporating concepts of uncertainty. Finally there are included three small examples <b>of</b> energy <b>technology</b> <b>assessments.</b> These have been tailor-made to demonstrate the possibilities and importances {{of the concept of}} uncertainty in these assessments...|$|R

2500|$|In 1986, the U.S. Defense Department funded {{a two-year}} {{study by the}} RAND Corporation, a private {{organization}} with a long and {{close relationship with the}} U.S. government. This study found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have little or no effect on cocaine trafficking and might in fact raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, [...] "Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction," [...] was prepared by seven researchers, mathematicians and economists at the National Defense Research Institute. The study noted that seven prior studies in the past nine years, including one by the Center for Naval Research and the Office <b>of</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment,</b> had come to similar conclusions. Interdiction efforts using current armed forces resources would have almost no effect on cocaine importation into the United States, the report concluded.|$|E

40|$|The roles <b>of</b> the <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> are to give inputs {{in terms}} of not only {{technical}} efficiency and economic rationality but also social and ecological consequences of the introduction <b>of</b> a specific <b>technology.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> {{is to determine the}} risk as early as possible before any decision making in technology purchased is made. Despite the <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> basic concept evolution, <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> can be applied in various sectors but it is most prevalent in the health, environmental if compared to the defense sector.
