5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} {{that results in}} pain in the heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> following a period of rest. Pain is also frequently brought on by bending the foot and toes up towards the shin and may be worsened by a tight Achilles tendon. The condition typically comes on slowly. In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm.

Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E

5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten at any time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of}} the water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation stated that it wished to run up to four multichannels at different times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> alternatively offer a high-definition television service. The corporation claimed that up to A$100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded.|$|E
25|$|The {{third and}} final stage {{involves}} drastic measures of water rationing to all businesses and homes in the United Kingdom in an emergency drought order. The measures are brought in only in exceptional conditions of extended periods {{with little or no}} rainfall. These actions include rationing of water, with no water supplies for certain times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>or</b> allowing water for a specific amount of time. Also standpipes and water tankers {{can be used as a}} last resort to have only set amounts of water given to each household in a neighbourhood.

25|$|Many of Caragiale's {{writings}} reproduce {{discussions between}} clerks on their time off, which usually take {{the shape of}} generic and awkward forays into culture or politics. Several {{of the characters in}} his sketches spuriously claim to be personal friends of major political figures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>or</b> to have access to the back-rooms of politics and journalism. Although often alarmed by political or social developments, they tend to accommodate them quickly, and often encourage each other during very long stays at the beer garden. Gravitating in this environment are the petty journalists, who boast access to unlikely scoops, such as Bulgaria having decided to invade Romania. In one instance, Caragiale invents Caracudi, a newspaperman who writes his sensationalist articles while relaxing in the park.|$|E

DJs and bands may play a range of music from the 1920s to today, tending to concentrate on big band music from the 1930s and 1940s. Live bands play a wide variety of music for lindy hoppers, from big band standards and blues to original compositions. There are ongoing debates about the types of music most appropriate for lindy hop and other swing dances, with the discussions focusing on whether the music should be historically accurate (i.e. matching a dance style with the popular music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day)</b> <b>or</b> include other musical styles and forms.|$|E

25|$|A {{black bear}} has better {{eyesight}} {{and a better}} sense of hearing compared to humans. Their keenest sense is the sense of smell, which is about seven times greater than a dog's. Black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, doing so for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies, and hibernate. Half of bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. Black bears may be active at any time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> night although they mainly forage by night. Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal, and bears living near brown bears tend to be more extensively diurnal. Their social behavior is somewhat similar to that of canids.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the uniforms}} {{worn by the}} Australian Army have changed {{significantly}} over the past century, the accoutrements worn over this period have remained relatively similar. In the British Army regiments have traditionally often worn their own distinctive uniforms. However, in contrast {{there is very little}} practical difference between the dress of each unit in the Australian Army, with the majority of personnel wearing the same basic uniform (although there are some minor exceptions, worn on general duties and ceremonial uniforms—but not DPCU when worn as dress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> in the field—for instance with some units wearing black badges of rank, unit badges and other accoutrements, instead of the usual gold and yellow or silver and white worn respectively by all corps, while a number of Scottish companies and pipes and drum bands wear distinctive tartans and other items of traditional dress, including headdress, highland dress jacket, kilt, sporran, hose-top socks, and gaiters). Instead, the main uniform distinctions between corps and units include corps and regimental badges, berets, lanyards, and unit colour patches.|$|E
500|$|Crocodilians are ectotherms, {{producing}} {{relatively little}} heat internally and relying on external sources {{to raise their}} body temperatures. The sun's heat is the main means of warming for any crocodilian, while immersion in water may either raise its temperature by conduction, or cool the animal in hot weather. The main method for regulating its temperature is behavioural. For example, an alligator in temperate regions may start the day by basking in the sun on land. A bulky animal, it warms up slowly, but at some time {{later in the day}} it moves into the water, still exposing its dorsal surface to the sun. At night it remains submerged, and its temperature slowly falls. The basking period is extended in winter and reduced in summer. For crocodiles in the tropics, avoiding overheating is generally the main problem. They may bask briefly in the morning but then move into the shade, remaining there for the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>or</b> submerge themselves in water to keep cool. Gaping with the mouth can provide cooling by evaporation from the mouth lining. By these means, the temperature range of crocodilians is usually maintained between , and mainly stays in the range [...]|$|E

40|$|Background: Scleroderma is {{a chronic}} disorder, {{characterized}} by thickening and fibrosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin and disruption of internal organs that affects global functioning {{and quality of}} life. Facial skin alterations {{have an impact on}} self-esteem and interfere with social interactions, with an association to psychological symptoms, especially depression. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study, in collaboration with a Canadian team and European Associations, intended to characterize the symptoms and the psychological problems in European patients with scleroderma. Methods: 563 participants from 13 European Countries; 484 (89 %) female; 59 (11 %) male; mean age: 49 (SD= 14. 8); 93 % caucasian; 68 % married; 32 % higher education filled out <b>the</b> Patient Survey <b>of</b> Health Concerns and Research Priorities. (Scleroderma Society of Canada (SSC) and Canadian Scleroderma Research Group). The questionnaire has 11 Sections (Demographics, Diagnosis and Disease; Healthcare Services Utilization; Healthcare Services Reimbursement; Healthcare Services Reimbursement Needs; Medical Care; Symptoms; Employment; Sensations; Physical Appearance; Commentaries). Results: the symptoms most commonly reported by patients are: joint pain, fatigue, Raynaud’s symptoms, muscle pain, hardening/tightening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin, difficulty sleeping, difficulty remember things and heartburn. 74 % of participants reported that they show little interest or pleasure in performing tasks several days, more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> nearly every <b>day.</b> 72 % feels down, depressed <b>or</b> hopeless, several <b>days,</b> more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> nearly every <b>day.</b> 72 % Feel’s nervous, anxious, or on edge, more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> nearly every <b>day.</b> 40 % reported <b>the</b> avoidance <b>of</b> activities because they feel that they will fail due to scleroderma related problems. 43 % of participants have been diagnosed with diffuse scleroderma and 21 % with CREST. 77 % reported other medical conditions, the most frequent being Esophageal dysfunction (56 %). 100 % of participants reported concern regarding <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> parts of their bodies, which they consider especially unattractive due to scleroderma. 64 % of participants reported that scleroderma affects their ability to work, very much or extremely. Discussion and Conclusions: The results concerning the frequency and impact of symptoms were approximate to the results obtained in Canada. There was however some marked differences in psychological variables. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European participants reached higher levels on issues of depression and anxiety. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this study indicate that all participants are concerned about the physical appearance due to scleroderma. These results emphasize <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> psychological intervention in patients with scleroderma in Europe. These results should be taken into consideration by the teams who follow these patient...|$|R

500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} was minimal and {{problems}} were generally described as minor, but included complaints about long load times on computers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>or</b> the game slowing down during combat. Bugs were responsible for slowing down the game when {{a high level of}} graphical assets were on-screen at the same time, but it was reported that a fix was released that solved the problem. Allgame's Derek Williams considered the game's combat simplistic (with a comparison to Diablo), which made the game too easy. [...] The most negative major review came from Eurogamer, who gave the game seven out of ten (and later increased it to eight when the game was patched). Their reviewer expressed distaste at the immortality of the player character, saying that it made the lives of characters [...] "cheap and meaningless", although other reviews welcomed this aspect, saying it was [...] "implemented perfectly" [...] and did not make the game easier. Eurogamer also disapproved of the amount of experience that was awarded for certain dialogues later in the game. However, other reviews cited this as one of the main things that elevated Planescape: Torment above the standard RPG format.
