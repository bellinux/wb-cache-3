5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which are also a form <b>of</b> <b>external</b> debt).

5|$|Egypt's wealth, however, made it {{a tempting}} target for invasion, {{particularly}} by the Libyan Berbers to the west, and the Sea Peoples, a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan, much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects <b>of</b> <b>external</b> threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Analytic {{expressions}} for the nonlinear {{absorption coefficient}} (nonlinear absorption coefficient = NAC) {{of a strong}} electromagnetic wave (laser radiation) caused by confined electrons for the case of electron — optical phonon scattering in doping superlattices (doping superlattices = DSLs) are calculated by using the quantum kinetic equation for electrons. The problem is also considered for both the absence and the presence <b>of</b> an <b>external</b> magnetic field. The dependence of the NAC on the intensity E 0 and the energy �Ω <b>of</b> the <b>external</b> strong electromagnetic wave (electromagnetic wave = EMW), the temperature T of the system, the doping concentration nD and the cyclotron frequency ΩB for case <b>of</b> an <b>external</b> magnetic field is obtained. Two cases for the absorption: Close to the absorption threshold |k�Ω − �ω 0 | ≪ ¯ε and {{far away from the}} absorption threshold |k�Ω − �ω 0 | ≫ ¯ε (k = 0, ± 1, ± 2 [...] ., �ω 0 and ¯ε are the frequency of optical phonon and the average energy of electrons, respectively) are considered. The analytic expressions are numerically evaluated, plotted, and discussed for a specific DSLs n-GaAs/p-GaAs. The computations show that the NAC in DSLs in case presence <b>of</b> an <b>external</b> magnetic field is much more greater than to it is absence <b>of</b> an <b>external</b> magnetic field. The appearance <b>of</b> an <b>external</b> magnetic field causes surprising changes in the nonlinear absorption.
