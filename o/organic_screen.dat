40|$|Does {{regional}} <b>organic</b> <b>screening</b> {{and breeding}} make sense? To {{answer this question}} we looked for experimental evidence in an organic outdoor tomato project. Potentially suitable varieties were collected, genotype x environment interactions were investiga-ted and selection was carried out within three crosses at three farms in Central and Northern Germany. The resulting selections were compared at all farms. <b>Screening</b> within <b>organic</b> horticulture {{was the most important}} means of finding suitable varieties. After three years of evaluation, 71 % of the 18 most successful varieties came from colleagues within organic horticulture. The analysis of the regional evaluation did not reveal strong interactions of varieties and locations. The rate of Phytophthora (late blight) fruit infections significantly depended on the year, thus stressing the need for long-term evaluation. Site specific adaptation was partially observed for late blight in-fections and for yield. The main advantage of multilocational selection, however, was {{to make use of the}} selection potential at each farm. At Rhauderfehn, the farm with the highest level of Phytophthora infections, selection led to reduced fruit infection and extended harvest period. Selection at Ellingerode resulted in the highest yield. We recommend multilocational breeding approaches with frequent exchange of breeding material and data...|$|R

Because significant cleanup and source control activities have been conducted in the inlets since the data supporting the 1998 303 (d) listings were collected, two verification studies were performed to address the 303 (d) segments that were listed for metal and organic contaminants in marine sediment. The Metals Verification Study (MVS) was conducted in 2003; the final report, Metals Verification Study for Sinclair and Dyes Inlets, Washington, was published in March 2004 (Kohn et al. 2004). This report describes the Organics Verification Study that was conducted in 2005. The study approach {{was similar to the}} MVS in that many surface sediment samples were screened for the major classes of organic contaminants, and then the screening results and other available data were used to select a subset of samples for quantitative chemical analysis. Because the MVS was designed to obtain representative data on concentrations of contaminants in surface sediment throughout Sinclair Inlet, Dyes Inlet, Port Orchard Passage, and Rich Passage, aliquots of the 160 MVS sediment samples were used in the analysis for the Organics Verification Study. However, unlike metals <b>screening</b> methods, <b>organics</b> <b>screening</b> methods are not specific to individual organic compounds, and are not available for some target organics. Therefore, only the quantitative analytical results were used in the organics verification evaluation. The results of the Organics Verification Study showed that sediment quality outside of Sinclair Inlet is unlikely to be impaired because of organic contaminants. Similar to the results for metals, in Sinclair Inlet, the distribution of residual organic contaminants is generally limited to nearshore areas already within the actively managed Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility Superfund Site, where further source-control actions and monitoring are under way...|$|R
