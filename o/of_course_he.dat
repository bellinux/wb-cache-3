5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{he acted}} {{on the ground}} of his enemy's choosing, not of his own, and {{on the basis of}} meager {{information}} and almost no understanding of the ground, he broke all the military tactical rules of his own devising. He had thrown his infantry into the teeth of gun fire; he compounded this folly by committing his cavalry piecemeal in pointless charges across soft, spongy ground that was divided by streams, requiring them to attack in long, drawn out lines, rather than en masse; <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> could not send his cavalry en masse because several natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—made this impossible on some of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits {{located in the}} Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and {{in the content of}} trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me {{out as soon}} as I walked out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham when I went out there, and he did test me out.

Then he commandeered two carriages and told the grenadiers to take the arrested men to the Neue Wache in Berlin for interrogation.

25|$|With the King's Men, Field {{seems to}} have {{performed}} as Voltore in Volpone and as Face in The Alchemist. It {{is not clear what}} other parts he played; an epigram, produced by John Payne Collier, that associated the actor with the role of Othello is an apparent forgery. Edmond Malone supposed that Field played women's roles with the company; O. J. Campbell, however, suggests that he played young second leads. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> acted in a number of Fletcher's plays, as well as Shakespeare's; presumably he also acted in his own Amends for Ladies (printed 1618, though probably written earlier), and in The Fatal Dowry, which he wrote with Philip Massinger. Field died some time between May 1619 and August 1620.|$|E
25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the Impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> was Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard I chose to fight.|$|E
500|$|Two {{months after}} the airing of the fourth season finale episode, co-showrunner and {{executive}} producer Robert Carlock was asked if Jack McBrayer's character Kenneth Parcell would return in the upcoming season after he was fired as an NBC page in [...] "I Do Do". Carlock said [...] "We haven't cracked [...] he is getting [...] back, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> will get back somehow. We wanted a fun thing to shuffle the deck {{a little bit and}} send him off into the world. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> will miss it and he will be missed. Events will bring him back." [...] In [...] "The Fabian Strategy", Kenneth is now working at CBS as a page for the Late Show with David Letterman. The scene in which Kenneth throws himself in front of a car to prove to Tracy Jordan that he is real and not Tracy's imagination was filmed on August 27, 2010, in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater.|$|E

500|$|In {{the book}} proper, Briscoe and Stannard quote Ball's most notable opponent, Manfred von Richthofen. The Red Baron, who {{believed}} in his younger brother's victory award, considered Ball [...] "by far the best English flying man". Elsewhere in the book, an unidentified Royal Flying Corps pilot who flew with Ball in his last engagement was quoted as saying, [...] "I see they have given him the V.C. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> won it a dozen times over—the whole squadron knows that." [...] The authors themselves described the story of Ball's life as that of [...] "a young knight of gentle manner who learnt to fly and to kill {{at a time when}} all the world was killing... saddened by the great tragedy that had come into the world and made him a terrible instrument of Death".|$|E
500|$|On 18 June, after closing speeches from {{prosecution}} and defence counsels, the judge began his summing-up. While emphasising Thorpe's distinguished public record, he was scathing about the principal prosecution witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug", Scott a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> {{could still be}} telling the truth." [...] Newton was [...] "determined to milk the case {{as hard as he}} can." [...] On 20 June the jury retired; they returned two days later and acquitted the four defendants on all charges. In a brief public statement, Thorpe said that he considered the verdict [...] "a complete vindication." [...] Scott said he was [...] "unsurprised" [...] by the outcome, but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge from the safety of the bench.|$|E
500|$|According to actress Marley Shelton, [...] "Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, {{at least}} Planet Terror. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and {{adjustments}} to our performances and he changed lines {{every once in}} a while. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> always deferred to Robert on Planet Terror and vice versa for Death Proof. So it's really both of their brainchild." [...] Tarantino has stated, [...] "I can't imagine doing Grindhouse with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, and pretty much that was it." ...|$|E
