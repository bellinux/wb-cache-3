40|$|Scavenging {{energy from}} {{environmental}} sources {{is an active}} area of research to enable remote sensing and microsystems applications. Furthermore, as energy demands soar, {{there is a significant}} need to explore new sources and curb waste. Vibration energy scavenging is one environmental source for remote applications and a candidate for recouping energy wasted by mechanical sources that can be harnessed to monitor and optimize operation of critical infrastructure (e. g. Smart Grid). Current vibration scavengers are limited by volume and ancillary requirements for operation such as control circuitry overhead and battery sources. This dissertation, for the first time, reports a mass producible hybrid energy scavenger system that employs both piezoelectric and electrostatic transduction on a common MEMS device. The piezoelectric component provides an inherent feedback signal and pre-charge source that enables electrostatic scavenging operation while the electrostatic device provides the proof mass that enables low frequency operation. The piezoelectric beam forms the spring of the resonant mass-spring transducer for converting vibration excitation into an AC electrical <b>output.</b> A <b>serially</b> poled, composite shim, piezoelectric bimorph produces the highest output rectified voltage of over 3. 3 V and power output of 145 uW using ¼ g vibration acceleration at 120 Hz. Considering solely the volume of the piezoelectric beam and tungsten proof mass, the volume is 0. 054 cm 3, resulting in a power density of 2. 68 mW/cm 3. Incorporation of a simple parallel plate structure that provides the proof mass for low frequency resonant operation in addition to cogeneration via electrostatic energy scavenging provides a 19. 82 to 35. 29 percent increase in voltage beyond the piezoelectric generated DC rails. This corresponds to approximately 2. 1 nW additional power from the electrostatic scavenger component and demonstrates the first instance of hybrid energy scavenging using both piezoelectric and synchronous electrostatic transduction.

40|$|As imaging {{technology}} evolves, {{so does the}} need for accurate, low-power and high-data-rate low-level image processing {{in a variety of}} computationally intensive vision applications. These applications include optical-flow computation, autonomous navigation, object avoidance or intercept, real-time target tracking, and recognition. To reach this goal, a single chip was developed, which functions as a camera able to preprocess the image in real time. It processes images through a convolution filter with a user-chosen kernel. One of the particulars of this project is to combine the processing unit with an active pixel sensors (APS) pixel array. This complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology for building imager chips allows on-focal plane signal processing, as opposed to their charge-coupled device (CCD) counterparts that need to <b>serially</b> <b>output</b> the flow of pixels to an external processing chip. The filtering can therefore be implemented as a fast, low-power analog circuit. Convolution is achieved by matching a kernel to an image using a computation unit. The chip has an integrated imager array and a digital memory large enough to store a generic, up-loadable kernel. When recognizing or tracking a target, the uploaded kernel represents the template. Other convolution filters are implemented by setting the kernel to the set of parameters corresponding to the desired task. Filtering is performed through a column-parallel architecture of computing units, so real time computation can be achieved. Several versions of the convolution circuit are investigated. They have been fabricated, fully tested and characterized. A number of important design changes have occurred, either to address issues that could be improved on or to experiment with alternative approaches. Timed and geometrical amplifier controls have also been investigated. By implementing image arrays of different sizes, we also demonstrate the scalability of the architecture in the spatial domain to an arbitrarily sized imager.

40|$|In this thesis, by categorizing the {{application}} of spintronic devices with the standard of signal type being processed, the spintronic devices based magnetic field sensors which process the D. C. signal are studied with micromagnetic simulation and the spintronic devices based spin-torque oscillators which process the A. C. signal are studied with macrospin simulation. By conducting micromagnetic simulation, the thermally excited mag-noise in spintronic device based magnetic field sensors is systematically studied. In magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) based magnetic field sensor, the spatial distribution of the thermally excited mag-noise indicates that the edges are the main contributor of thermal mag-noise in the free layer (FL). Both hard bias (HB) field and applied field could suppress the thermal mag-noise in edges. A relatively high applied field will decrease the influence of HB field on mag-noise in edges. The edge effect is not applicable for MTJ sensors with circular cross section. In ferromagnetic ring structure based magnetic field sensor, the saturated state, triangle state, half triangle state, onion state, and vortex state are explored and studied, respectively. The mag-noise calculation shows that triangle state {{is the main reason}} for the mag-noise exhibiting 1 /f tendency in both the low-frequency range and high-frequency range in relaxed state, while the onion state explains why a noise peak appears in high-frequency range in the relaxed state. It is proved that the area of the ferromagnetic rings is not the determining factor for the thermal mag-noise distribution in the saturated state. In dual-vortex structure based magnetic field sensor, the combination of the dual-vortex motion and the magnetic noise properties make it possible to measure the external field (along hard bias direction) through measuring the FMR peak positions or the integrated thermal mag-noise, which indicated two novel field sensing mechanisms using elliptical permalloy single layer. Besides the study of the thermally excited mag-noise in spintronic device based magnetic field sensors, the spintronic device based spintorque oscillators (STOs) is fully investigated by macrospin simulation. Conclusions demonstrate numerically and analytically how a STO locks to a microwave field (Hac). A magnetic energy based analysis is used to explain this phenomenon. This result provides a possible way to synchronize serially connected STOs by tuning each single STO’s phase shift with external microwave field, which could finally enhance the locking efficiency, locking range and <b>output</b> power of <b>serially</b> connected STOs. Meanwhile, the capacitance effect on the oscillation characteristics and the switching characteristics of the STOs has also been studied. The micromagnetic simulation of the noise sources in traditional GMR/TMR based magnetic field sensor and novel spintronic device based magnetic field sensors not onlyprovide reliable explanations of noise-related phenomenon in magnetic field sensors but also offer guidance on how to fabricate magnetic field sensors with relative low thermal magnetic noise and high performance.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2015. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Chris Kim. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 137 pages. This thesis {{is devoted to}} the algorithm and VLSI architecture design for a new class of error-correcting codes, namely polar codes. In particular, efficient algorithm and hardware design for polar codes decoding are the focus of this thesis. A reduced-latency 2 -bit SC decoding algorithm is proposed. Compared to the original SC algorithm that <b>output</b> 1 bit <b>serially,</b> this algorithm can determine 2 bits in one cycle. As a result, the entire decoding latency can be reduced from (2 n- 2) cycles to (1. 5 n- 2) cycles without any performance loss for code-length n polar codes. Then, several hardware-level optimizing techniques are applied to further reduce the latency to (3 n/ 4 - 1) cycles. Synthesis results show that the proposed decoder architecture for example (1024, 512) polar codes has significant improvement on throughput and hardware efficiency than the prior works. Then, a multi-bit decision algorithm, namely 2 Kb-SCL algorithm, is proposed for general SC list decoding cases. This new algorithm can determine 2 K bits at the same time without any performance loss for arbitrary K. As a result, the entire decoding latency can be reduced from 3 n- 2 to n/ 2 K- 2 - 2 cycles. Then, hardware architecture of the 2 Kb-SCL decoder is developed. In particular, data path balancing technique is developed to enable the proposed architecture operate in a high clock frequency. Synthesis results show that the proposed (1024, 512) 2 b-rSCL and 4 b-rSCL decoders have significant reduction in latency and throughput than the existing SCL decoders. Furthermore, this thesis presented the LLR-based SCL decoder to reduce the overall silicon area. The proposed new algorithm, namely LLR- 2 Kb-SCL algorithm, can determine 2 K bits together with the use of LLR messages. As a result, it can achieve both low-complexity and short latency at the same time. Then, the corresponding VLSI architecture of the new SCL decoder is developed. Synthesis results show that the proposed example (1024, 512) LLR- 4 b-SCL decoder achieves great reduction in both area and latency as compared to the prior LLR or non-LLR-based SCL decoders. Besides the investigation on SC decoders, this thesis also performs systematic optimization on BP decoders. First, a scaled min-sum (SMS) algorithm is proposed to improve the error-correcting performance. Then, folding and overlapped-scheduling techniques are applied to hardware architecture of BP decoders to reduce area and latency. Moreover, this thesis proposes several novel early-stopping criteria to terminate the iteration of BP decoders earlier. As a result, the overall energy consumption and decoding latency are reduced linearly. Finally, this thesis presents the stochastic SC decoder. First, a stochastic SC decoding algorithm is derived from the deterministic form. Then, several techniques are applied to the stochastic SC algorithm to avoid the performance loss caused by the stochastic computation. With the use of those approaches, an example (1024, 512) stochastic SC decoder can achieve the similar error-correcting performance with its deterministic counterpart...|$|R
40|$|At {{the onset}} of the "Big Data" age, we are faced with {{ubiquitous}} data in various forms and with various characteristics, such as noise, high dimensionality, autocorrelation, and so on. The question of how to obtain accurate and computationally efficient estimates from such data is one that has stoked the interest of many researchers. This dissertation mainly concentrates on two general problem areas: inference for high-dimensional and noisy data, and estimation of the steady-state mean for univariate data generated by computer simulation experiments. We develop and evaluate three separate sequential algorithms for the two topics. One major advantage of sequential algorithms is that they allow for careful experimental adjustments as sampling proceeds. Unlike one-step sampling plans, sequential algorithms adapt to different situations arising from the ongoing sampling; this makes these procedures efficacious as problems become more complicated and more-delicate requirements need to be satisfied. We will elaborate on each research topic in the following discussion. Concerning the first topic, our goal is to develop a robust graphical model for noisy data in a high-dimensional setting. Under a Gaussian distributional assumption, the estimation of undirected Gaussian graphs is equivalent to the estimation of inverse covariance matrices. Particular interest has focused upon estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix to reveal insight on the data as suggested by the principle of parsimony. For estimation with high-dimensional data, the influence of anomalous observations becomes severe as the dimensionality increases. To address this problem, we propose a robust estimation procedure for the Gaussian graphical model based on the Integrated Squared Error (ISE) criterion. The robustness result is obtained by using ISE as a nonparametric criterion for seeking the largest portion of the data that "matches" the model. Moreover, an l₁-type regularization is applied to encourage sparse estimation. To address the non-convexity of the objective function, we develop a sequential algorithm in the spirit of a majorization-minimization scheme. We summarize the results of Monte Carlo experiments supporting the conclusion that our estimator of the inverse covariance matrix converges weakly (i. e., in probability) to the latter matrix as the sample size grows large. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of several existing approaches through numerical simulations. We further demonstrate the strength of our method with applications in genetic network inference and financial portfolio optimization. The second topic consists of two parts, and both concern the computation of point and confidence interval (CI) estimators for the mean µ of a stationary discrete-time univariate stochastic process X ≡{X_i: i= 1, 2, [...] . generated by a simulation experiment. The point estimation is relatively easy when the underlying system starts in steady state; but the traditional way of calculating CIs usually fails since the data encountered in simulation <b>output</b> are typically <b>serially</b> correlated. We propose two distinct sequential procedures that each yield a CI for µ with user-specified reliability and absolute or relative precision. The first sequential procedure is based on variance estimators computed from standardized time series applied to nonoverlapping batches of observations, and it is characterized by its simplicity relative to methods based on batch means and its ability to deliver CIs for the variance parameter of the output process (i. e., the sum of covariances at all lags). The second procedure is the first sequential algorithm that uses overlapping variance estimators to construct asymptotically valid CI estimators for the steady-state mean based on standardized time series. The advantage of this procedure is that compared with other popular procedures for steady-state simulation analysis, the second procedure yields significant reduction both in the variability of its CI estimator and in the sample size needed to satisfy the precision requirement. The effectiveness of both procedures is evaluated via comparisons with state-of-the-art methods based on batch means under a series of experimental settings: the M/M/ 1 waiting-time process with 90...|$|R
