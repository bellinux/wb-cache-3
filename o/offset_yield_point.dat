40|$|Recently, {{the authors}} {{published}} results of plastic buckling analysis of cylindrical shells. Ideal elastic-plastic material behavior {{was used for}} the analysis. Subsequently, the buckling analysis program was continued with the realistic stress-strain relationship of a stainless steel alloy which does not exhibit a clear <b>yield</b> <b>point.</b> The plastic buckling analysis was carried out through the initial stages of strain hardening for various internal pressure values. The computer program BOSOR 5 was used for this purpose. Results were compared with those obtained from the idealized elastic-plastic relationship using the offset stress level at 0. 2 % strain as the yield stress. For moderate hoop stress values, the realistic stress-grain case shows a slight reduction of the buckling strength. But, a substantial gain in the buckling strength is observed as the hoop stress approaches the yield strength. Most importantly, the shell retains a residual strength to carry a small amount of axial compressive load even when the hoop stress has exceeded the <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> strength...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} study it was {{observed}} that the <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> of Mg- 9 %Al- 1 %Zn alloy was strongly influenced by the connectivity of Mg 17 Al 12. It was suggested that an increase in the fraction of Mg 17 Al 12  from 8 % to 11 % could lead to the formation of a Mg 17 Al 12  network which resulted in a higher <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point.</b> In addition, {{it was observed that}} elongation to failure of the Mg- 9 %Al- 1 %Zn alloy strongly depended on the fraction of Mg 17 Al 12. Moreover, the apparent toughness showed a strong inverse relation to the secondary dendrite arm spacing.

40|$|Magnesium and {{magnesium}} alloys {{are used in}} a wide variety of structural applications including automotive, aerospace, hand tools and electronic industries thanks to their light weight, high specific strength, adequate corrosion resistance and good castability. Al and Zn are the primary alloying elements in commercial Mg alloys and commonly used in automotive industries. AZ 91 is one of the most popular Mg alloys containing 9 % Al and 1 % Zn. Hence, lots of research have been done during last decades on AZ 91 D. However, the existing data concerning mechanical properties and microstructural features showed large scatter and is even contradictory. This work focused on the correlation between the microstructure and the mechanical properties of as-cast AZ 91 alloy. An exhaustive characterization of the grain size, secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) distribution, and fraction of Mg 17 Al 12 using optical and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) was performed. These microstructural parameters were correlated to <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> (Rp 0. 2), fracture strength and elongation to fracture. It was understood that the intermetallic phase, Mg 17 Al 12, plays an important role in determining the mechanical and physical properties of the alloy at temperature range from room temperature up to 190 oC. It was realized that by increasing the Mg 17 Al 12 content above 11 % a network of intermetallic may form. During deformation this rigid network should break before any plastic deformation happen. Hence, increase in Mg 17 Al 12 content resulted in an increase in <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point.</b> The presence of this network was supported by study of thermal expansion behaviour of the alloy containing different amount of Mg 17 Al 12. A physically-based model was adapted and validated in order to predict the flow stress behaviour of as-cast AZ 91 D at room temperature up to 190 ºC for various microstructures. The model was based on dislocation glide and climb in a single-phase (matrix) material containing reinforcing particles. The temperature dependant variables of the model were quite well correlated to the underlying physics of the material...|$|E

40|$|The {{rheology}} of {{the sludge}} provides {{information about the}} capacity and the flow, which {{in the case of}} project tasks for the hydraulic conveying installation is an important control parameter. Accurate knowledge of the rheological properties of sludge requires the designation of rheological models. Models single and multiparameter (Ostwald, Bingham, Herschel-Bulkley'a, and others) allow an approximation of flow curves, and the determination of the boundaries of the flow of modified sludge allows you to control the process compaction or are dewatered sludge undergoing flow. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the rheological parameters and rheological models of sludge conditioned by physical methods before and after the process of anaerobic digestion. So far, studies have shown that the application of conditioning in the preparation of sewage sludge increases shear stress, viscosity as well as the limits of flow in relation to the untreated sludge. <b>Offset</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> by the application of a conditioning agent is associated with decreased flowability tested sludge, which has also been observed by analyzing the structure of the prepared samples.

40|$|Realistic {{simulations}} {{are increasingly}} demanded {{to clarify the}} dynamic behaviour of foam materials, because, on one hand, the significant variability (e. g. 20 % scatter band) of foam properties {{and the lack of}} reliable dynamic test methods for foams bring particular difficulty to accurately evaluate the strain-rate sensitivity in experiments; while on the other hand numerical models based on idealised cell structures (e. g. Kelvin and Voronoi) may not be sufficiently representative to capture the actual structural effect. To overcome these limitations, the strain-rate sensitivity of the compressive and tensile properties of closed-cell aluminium Alporas foam is investigated in this study by means of meso-scale realistic finite element (FE) simulations. The FE modelling method based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) image is introduced first, as well as its applications to foam materials. Then the compression and tension of Alporas foam at a wide variety of applied nominal strain-rates are simulated using FE model constructed from the actual cell geometry obtained from the CT image. The stain-rate sensitivity of compressive strength (collapse stress) and tensile strength (0. 2 % <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point)</b> are evaluated when considering different cell-wall material properties. The numerical results show that the rate dependence of cell-wall material is the main cause of the strain-rate hardening of the compressive and tensile strengths at low and intermediate strain-rates. When the strain-rate is sufficiently high, shock compression is initiated, which significantly enhances the stress at the loading end and has complicated effect on the stress at the supporting end. The plastic tensile wave effect is evident at high strain-rates, but shock tension cannot develop in Alporas foam due to the softening associated with single fracture process zone occurring in tensile response. In all cases the micro inertia of individual cell walls subjected to localised deformation is found to have negligible effect on the macro strain-rate sensitivity of Alporas foam...|$|E

IM-NS was implanted into the right tibia (24 -week investigation period; nails/screws diameter: 9 mm/ 3. 5 mm, length: 130 mm/ 15 - 40 mm) of 10 adult sheep (LAE 442, stainless steel, n= 5 each group). Clinical and radiographic examinations, in vivo computed tomography (CT), ex vivo micro-computed tomography (muCT), mechanical and histological examinations and element analyses of alloying elements in inner organs were performed. The mechanical examinations (four-point bending) revealed a significant decrease of LAE 442 implant stiffness, force at 0. 2 % <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and maximum force. Periosteal (new bone formation) and endosteal (bone decline) located bone alterations occurred in both groups (LAE 442 alloy more pronounced). Moderate gas formation was observed within the LAE 442 alloy group. The CT-measured implant volume decreased slightly (not significant). Histologically a predominantly direct bone-to-implant interface existed within the LAE 442 alloy group. Formation of a fibrous tissue capsule around the nail occurred in the steel group. Minor inflammatory infiltration was observed in the LAE 442 alloy group. Significantly increased quantities of rare earth elements were detected in the LAE 442 alloy group. muCT examination showed the beginning of corrosion in dependence of the surrounding tissue. After 24 weeks the local biocompatibility of LAE 442 {{can be considered as}} suitable for a degradable implant material. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: An application oriented interlocked intramedullary nailing system in a comparative study (degradable magnesium-based LAE 442 alloy vs. steel alloy) was examined in a sheep model for the first time. We focused in particular on the examination of implant degradation by means of (?-) CT, mechanical properties (four-point bending), clinical compatibility, local bone reactions (X-ray and histology) and possible systemic toxicity (histology and element analyses of inner organs). A significant decrease of magnesium (LAE 442 alloy) implant stiffness and maximum force occurred. Moderate not clinically relevant gas accumulation was determined. A predominantly direct bone-to-implant contact existed within the magnesium (LAE 442 alloy) group compared to an indirect contact in the steel group. Rare earth element accumulation could be observed in inner organs but H&E staining was inconspicuous...|$|E
40|$|Creep rupture {{strength}} and ductility of Creep Strength Enhanced Ferritic steels of Grades 23, 91, 92 and 122 was investigated with particular emphasis on remarkable drop in the long-term. Large difference in creep {{rupture strength}} and ductility was observed on three heats of Grade 23 steels. Remarkable drop of creep rupture strength in the long-term of T 91 was {{comparable to those of}} Grades 92 and 122. Remarkable drop in creep rupture ductility in a stress regime below 50 % of 0. 2 % <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> stress was observed on Grade T 23 steel, however, that of Grade P 23 steel did not indicate any degradation of creep rupture ductility. Higher creep rupture ductility of Grade P 23 steel was considered to be caused by its lower creep strength than that of T 23 steels. Creep rupture ductility of Grades 92 and 122 steels indicated rapid and drastic decrease with decrease in stress at 50 % of 0. 2 % <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> stress. Stress dependence of creep rupture ductility of Grades 92 and 122 steels was well described by a ratio of stress to 0. 2 % <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> stress, regardless of temperature. On the other hand, large drop in creep rupture ductility of Grade 91 steel was observed only in the very low stress regime at 650 °C. Alloying elements including impurities and changes in precipitates may influence on creep rupture ductility, however, remarkable drop in ductility of the steels cannot be explained by chemical composition and precipitates. High ductility in the high stress regime above 50 % of 0. 2 % <b>offset</b> <b>yield</b> stress should be provided by easy plastic deformation, and it has been concluded that a remarkable drop in ductility in the low stress regime is derived from a concentration of creep deformation into a tiny recovered region formed at the vicinity of grain boundary...|$|R

Polyurea samples were casted and continuously exposed to ultra-violet radiation for 15 weeks to simulate ~ 9200 hours of direct sunlight exposure. Each sample (unexposed and exposed) was tested uniaxially with quasi-static tension per ASTM D 638 - 8.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present a method that {{simplifies}} the standard procedure to determine the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> providing complementary information about changes in the behaviour of the materials under study. It is generally accepted that the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> is determined by the inflection point of the curve of pressure versus apparent volume of the sample, P(V), from Hg porosimetry runs. Although compressible materials present an easily identifiable neat inflection point, in resilient materials, the inflection point is not easy to identify by simple visual inspection of the curve. A physical magnitude (K') is introduced to characterise the evolution of the material's compliance under isotropic pressure. The physical meaning of K' is the variation in the resistance to uniform compression with the pressure applied, helping to identify the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> and the plastic mechanism beyond the <b>yield</b> <b>point</b> in a single run. © 2009 Académie des sciences.
