5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done <b>or</b> <b>said</b> by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done <b>or</b> <b>said</b> by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E

25|$|If φ: F → E is a functor {{between two}} {{categories}} and S is {{an object of}} E, then the subcategory of F consisting of those objects x for which φ(x)=S and those morphisms m satisfying φ(m)=idS, is called the fibre category (or fibre) over S, and is denoted FS. The morphisms of FS are called S-morphisms, and for x,y objects of FS, the set of S-morphisms is denoted by HomS(x,y). The image by φ of an object or a morphism in F is called its projection (by φ). If f is a morphism of E, then those morphisms of F that project to f are called f-morphisms, and the set of f-morphisms between objects x and y in F is denoted by Homf(x,y). A functor φ: F → E is also called an E-category, <b>or</b> <b>said</b> to make F into an E-category or a category over E. An E-functor from an E-category φ: F → E to an E-category ψ: G → E is a functor α: F → G such that ψ ∘ α = φ. E-categories form in a natural manner a 2-category, with 1-morphisms being E-functors, and 2-morphisms being natural transformations between E-functors whose components lie in some fibre.|$|E

500|$|Toft did {{not escape}} the ire of the satirists, who {{concentrated}} mainly on sexual innuendo. [...] Some took advantage of a common 18th-century word for a rabbit track—prick—and others were scatological in nature. [...] However, Much Ado about Nothing; or, A Plain Refutation of All that Has Been Written <b>or</b> <b>Said</b> Concerning the Rabbit-Woman of Godalming (1727) {{is one of the}} more cutting satires on Toft. [...] The document supposes to be the confession of 'Merry Tuft', [...] "... in her own Stile and Spelling". [...] Poking fun at her illiteracy, it makes a number of obscene suggestions hinting at her promiscuity—"I wos a Wuman as had grate nattural parts, and a large Capassiti, and kapible of being kunserned in depe Kuntrivansis." [...] The document also ridicules several of the physicians involved in the affair, and reflects the general view portrayed by the satirists that Toft was a weak woman and the least complicit of [...] "the offenders" [...] (regardless of her guilt). [...] The notion contrasts with that expressed of her before the hoax was revealed and may indicate an overall strategy to disempower Toft completely. [...] This is reflected in one of the most notable satires of the affair, Alexander Pope and William Pulteney's anonymous satirical ballad The Discovery; or, The Squire Turn'd Ferret.

Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness".

500|$|Loss {{of control}} {{is defined in}} {{sections}} 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Section 56 abolishes the common law defence of provocation, which also dealt only with murder. There is no mandatory life sentence for voluntary manslaughter. The defence operates whether the defendant is a principal or an accomplice. Broadly speaking, the defendant must have actually lost self-control; the trigger for {{this must be a}} qualifying trigger; and it must be that a [...] "normal" [...] person might also have lost control in the circumstances. The loss of control need not be sudden, but cannot be in a [...] "considered desired for revenge". The loss of control is a subjective test which asks whether this defendant actually lost control, and if so, whether that loss of control led to their killing. The qualifying trigger may take one of two forms, or be a combination of both: that the killing was attributable to the defendant's fear of serious violence from the victim against the defendant or another identified person; or where the defendant's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or things done <b>or</b> <b>said</b> (or both) which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. The meaning of the terms [...] "extremely grave character" [...] and [...] "justifiable sense of being seriously wronged" [...] used in the second form is currently unclear. Section 51(1)(c) requires that [...] "a person of 's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of , might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to [...]" [...] These issues are complicated and directing a jury on issues of loss of control is likely to be difficult.|$|E
500|$|According {{to modern}} {{historian}} Michael Winship, Hutchinson is famous, {{not so much}} for what she did <b>or</b> <b>said</b> during the Antinomian Controversy, but for what John Winthrop made of her in his journal and in his account of the controversy called the Short Story. [...] According to Winship, Hutchinson became the reason in Winthrop's mind for all of the difficulties that the colony had gone through, though inaccurately portrayed and, with her departure, any other lingering issues were swept under the carpet. [...] Winthrop's account has given Hutchinson near legendary status and, as with all legends, what exactly she stood for has shifted over the centuries. Winthrop described her as [...] "a woman of ready wit and bold spirit". In the words of Winship, to Winthrop, Hutchinson was a [...] "hell-spawned agent of destructive anarchy". The close relationship between church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that a challenge to the ministers was quickly interpreted as challenge to established authority of all kinds. [...] To 19th century America, she was a crusader for religious liberty, as the nation celebrated its new achievement of {{the separation of church and}} state. [...] Finally, in the 20th century, she became a feminist leader, credited with terrifying the patriarchs, not because of her religious views but because she was an assertive, highly visible woman. According to feminist Amy Lang, Hutchinson failed to understand that [...] "the force of the female heretic vastly exceeds her heresy". [...] Lang argues that it was difficult for the court to pin a crime on her; her true crime in their eyes, according to Lang's interpretation, was the violation of her role in Puritan society, and she was condemned for undertaking the roles of teacher, minister, magistrate, and husband. [...] (However, the Puritans themselves clearly stated that the threat which they perceived was entirely theological, and no direct mention was ever made to indicate that they were threatened by her gender.) ...|$|E
