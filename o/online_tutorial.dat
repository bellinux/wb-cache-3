Below is an example equation of the second degree. The C-values are the glass component concentrations like Na2O or CaO in percent or other fractions, the b-values are coefficients, and n is the total number of glass components. The glass main component silica (SiO2) is excluded in the equation below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%. Many terms in the equation below can be neglected based on correlation and significance analysis. Systematic errors such as seen in the picture are quantified by dummy variables.

Frequencies were also compared between Australian and New Zealand tutorials, and also between two types of tutorials. Method: Elements of <b>online</b> <b>tutorials</b> were located in articles from highly ranked journals, and other germane sources. A content analysis of a sample of <b>online</b> <b>tutorials</b> was carried out, using the elements identified as criteria. Findings and conclusion: No statistically {{significant differences were found}} between the frequencies of elements in the literature and elements in the <b>online</b> <b>tutorials,</b> despite descriptive statistics indicating otherwise. A slight positive correlation was found between the frequencies of elements in tutorials produced in the two different countries. However, the small size of the literature sample severely restricts the conclusiveness of these results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective – This article aims {{to assess}} student {{achievement}} of higher-order information literacy learning outcomes from <b>online</b> <b>tutorials</b> {{as compared to}} in-person instruction in science and health science courses. Methods – Information literacy instruction via <b>online</b> <b>tutorials</b> or an in-person one-shot session was implemented in multiple sections of a biology (n= 100) and a kinesiology course (n= 54). After instruction, students in both instructional environments completed an identical library assignment to measure the achievement of higher-order learning outcomes and an anonymous student survey to measure the student experience of instruction. Results – The data collected from library assignments revealed {{no statistically significant differences}} between the two instructional groups in total assignment scores or scores on specific questions related to higher-order learning outcomes. Student survey results indicated the student experience is comparable between instruction groups in terms of clarity of instruction, student confidence in completing the course assignment after library instruction, and comfort in asking a librarian for help after instruction. Conclusions – This study demonstrates that it is possible to replace one-shot information literacy instruction sessions with asynchronous <b>online</b> <b>tutorials</b> with no significant reduction in student learning in undergraduate science and health science courses. Replacing in-person instruction with <b>online</b> <b>tutorials</b> will allow librarians at this university to reach a greater number of students and maintain contact with certain courses that are transitioning to completely online environments. While the creation of <b>online</b> <b>tutorials</b> is initially time-intensive, over time implementing online instruction could free up librarian time to allow for the strategic integration of information literacy instruction into other courses. Additional time savings could be realized by incorporating auto-grading into the <b>online</b> <b>tutorials...</b>|$|R

The findings suggest that both the students and tutors are positive about the use of Interwise for <b>online</b> <b>tutorials</b> in general. Some students, however, indicate dissatisfaction with the one-way communication and teacher-control functionalities of the system. The results also indicate that the tutors are concerned about the workload involved in using Interwise in terms of managing the functionalities of the system and the different learning tasks. Implications are then drawn for supporting synchronous online learning both in the OUHK and a wider academic context...|$|R
