5|$|East of Rochester, NY31 {{continued}} eastward to Jordan, {{utilizing the}} Rochester–Pittsford portion of legislative Route14, the Perinton–Jordan segment of Route20, and its current alignment between Pittsford and Perinton. From Weedsport to Jordan, NY31 used {{a slightly different}} routing. It initially exited the village <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> Road and followed that road to Jordan, where NY31 turned north and followed modern NY317 and NY31 north and east to modern CR84. NY31 turned north here, using what is now Old Route31, current NY31, and Downer Street to reach Baldwinsville. Within the village, NY31 followed Downer Street and what is now NY48 along Syracuse Street between Downer and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY31 remained on its current routing to Cicero, where it followed a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road. It rejoined its modern alignment near the eastern town line, and followed it east {{to what is now}} NY316 in Lenox. From here, NY31 went southeastward to NY5 in Oneida by way of modern NY316 and NY46.|$|E
5|$|The route {{becomes a}} residential/commercial mix {{as it passes}} through the city of Lockport, passing Altro Park before {{entering}} {{the center of the}} city. In the center of the city, NY78 intersects with NY31 (West Genesee Street and Walnut Street) just over the Erie Canal. At this junction, NY78 changes monikers to North Transit Street, becoming a two-lane residential street north of the city center. Crossing over an ex-Erie Railroad line, the route intersects with Grand Street, where NY78 turns east off North Transit Street onto Grand. East on Grand Street, NY78 intersects with Clinton Street, where NY78 turns north. Passing northeast of Upson Park, NY78 continues northeast through Lockport <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> Street. The route becomes a two-lane residential street, passing Dolan Park and turning north on Lake Avenue.|$|E

25|$|At {{the next}} {{intersection}} west along Clinton, Henry Johnson Boulevard, US 9 leaves Clinton Avenue for the latter. The district continues {{to follow the}} Clinton property lines to Lexington Avenue, where it includes the houses along the west side to midway between First and Second streets, and short rows along either side of First Street west of the Lexington intersection. From there the district returns to Clinton {{all the rest of}} the way to Quail, including 2 Judson Street only because it fronts <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> and is part of a row in that area.|$|E

25|$|In the 1850s {{the street}} was {{gradually}} built out between North Pearl and Swan streets. Houses built during this time reflected the early adoption of the Italianate mode and its preference for the bracketed cornice. These elements were usually made of sandstone before the Civil War but of wood afterwards. The Italianate style dominated in rowhouses <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> Avenue until 1880; today it still accounts {{for the majority of}} rowhouses in the district. The houses at 133–143 Clinton, dating to 1851, exemplify the prewar Italianate rowhouses. The unbroken row from 250–272 Clinton, dating to the 1870s, demonstrates the postwar application of the style.|$|E
25|$|South of the Clinton-North Pearl intersection, the {{boundary}} {{takes in the}} two remaining rowhouses <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> Place, the oldest extant buildings in the district. After excluding the properties {{on either side of}} the Ten Broeck Street intersection, it continues westward along Clinton's rear property lines until the southern Lark Street intersection, where US 9W branches off to the south from Route 9, the beginning of a highway to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Here it extends down the street for several blocks, all the way to Elk Street, taking in the nine-house row along the north side to the east of the intersection.|$|E
25|$|NY354 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY5 (Ellicott Street) and Broadway Street {{in the city}} of Buffalo. Proceeding southeast along William Street, NY354 runs as a two-lane commercial street through Jesse Clipper Square, passing numerous residences in the square. At the junction with Pine Street, the route turns southward for one block to Clinton Street, where it turns southeast <b>on</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Along Clinton Street, NY354 becomes a two-lane residential street through the Ellicott section of Buffalo, crossing multiple residential complexes and buildings {{on both sides of the}} roadway. Just before Lord Street, the route crosses under railroad tracks and changes to a two-lane commercial and residential mix. Just after Filmore Avenue, the route crosses into the Babcock section of the city.|$|E

25|$|In September 1993, General Powell asked Aspin {{to approve}} {{the request of the}} U.S. {{commander}} in Somalia for tanks, armored vehicles and AC-130 Spectre gunships for his forces. Aspin turned down the request. Shortly thereafter Aidid's forces in Mogadishu killed 18 U.S. soldiers and wounded more than 75 in attacks that also resulted in the shooting down of two U.S. helicopters and the capture of one pilot (see the Battle of Mogadishu). In the face of severe congressional criticism, Aspin admitted that in view of what had happened he had made a mistake, but stated that the request for armored equipment had been made within the context of delivering humanitarian aid to Somalia rather than protecting troops. In an appearance before a congressional committee to answer questions about the Somalia disaster, Aspin made an unfavorable impression and appeared weak in response to the detailed probing and criticism of his performance. The president publicly defended Aspin but made clear that the White House was not involved in the decision not to send armor reinforcements to Somalia. Several members of Congress called <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> to ask for Aspin's resignation.|$|E
25|$|A {{public meeting}} {{was held in}} December 2011 to discuss the future goals and designs of Union Station, with ideas being {{exchanged}} on how the station can accommodate the expected 40 percent growth in passengers by 2040. The results of this dialogue were incorporated into the May 2012 Chicago Union Station Master Plan Study. The study, led by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), in collaboration of Amtrak (station owner), Metra (station’s primary tenant), and other local and federal organizations, calls for increasing the station’s capacity and quality of service. According to the City of Chicago’s website on the study, short-term improvements call for improving station entrances and expanding waiting rooms, as well as enhancing bus lanes <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Canal Streets and creating a bus terminal on Jackson Boulevard between Canal and Clinton. For the medium-term (5- to 10-year horizon), ideas include widening commuter platforms, using unutilized mail platforms (including an extra-long through platform) for intercity passenger trains, adding more through tracks and platforms, reorganizing facilities for better capacity and flow, increasing height clearances of the tracks, and improving street access {{to and from the}} station. Long-term, proposals include increasing capacity and improving the ambiance of the station by significantly expanding or replacing station facilities in the 200 or 300 blocks of South Canal Street. Adding track and platform capacity along Clinton Street or Canal Street are also analyzed.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact <b>on</b> <b>Clinton.</b> British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and {{talking to me about}} the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E

500|$|The {{congregation}} initially {{moved to}} {{the top floor of}} a building at the corner of Grand and Forsyth Streets, and in 1865 moved again, to a former courthouse <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> Street. In 1872, the congregation built a synagogue at Ludlow and Hester Streets. There the congregation's younger members gained greater control and introduced some minor innovations; for example, changing the title of parnas to president, and in 1877 hiring a professional cantor—Judah Oberman—for $500 (today $) per year, to bring greater formality and decorum to the services as well as to attract new members. While somewhat [...] "Americanized", in general the congregation remained quite traditional. Men and women sat separately, the full service in the traditional prayer book was followed, and the congregation still trained men for rabbinic ordination. Additionally, Talmud and Mishna study groups, founded in the 1870s, were held both mornings and evenings.|$|E

Note that the PHMC sheet <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> County {{incorrectly}} {{says it was}} formed as part of Northumberland County, but neither the Lycoming nor Northumberland County histories support this. When Clinton County was formed in 1839, there were 12 original townships. It [...] "embraced the following townships then in Centre County, viz., Bald Eagle, Lamar, and Logan; and from Lycoming, Allison, Chapman, Colebrook, Dunstable, Grove, Lumber, Limestone, Pine Creek, and Wayne." [...] Since Lamar was formed from Bald Eagle, 11 of the 12 original townships came at least indirectly from Lycoming County. Limestone was split from the Lycoming County township of the same name, then attached to Wayne Township, and renamed Crawford Township when it was reformed. Grove and Lumber townships became part of Cameron County, but the remaining ten townships are still in Clinton County.|$|E
500|$|In 1905, {{an orphanage}} located nearby Kenmore Asylum was {{proposed}} at a general meeting of parishioners to replace an older orphanage {{that had been}} operating for more than 25 years <b>on</b> <b>Clinton</b> Street.

Thus, [...] of land was purchased in nearby Kenmore for the proposed orphanage. Shortly after, the foundation stone was laid and blessed on the site. EC Manfred was the building's architect, and the contractors were Messrs. King and Armstrong. It was described as [...] "severely simple Gothic" [...] and cost £6,000 to build. [...] All of the girls from the old orphanage were removed, and boys aged eight and older were moved there and waited for a permanent home. An effort was made for people from Albury, Cootamundra, Wagga Wagga, Young and other places {{to take charge of}} the orphanage, but this was unsuccessful. Instead, the orphanage was established in Goulburn.|$|E
