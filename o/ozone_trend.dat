The revised TOMS <b>ozone</b> <b>trend</b> data are in agreement, within error limits, with the average of 39 ground-based Dobson stations and with the world standard Dobson spectrometer 83 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii.

40|$|Explaining the {{observed}} <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> discussed {{in an earlier}} update and predicting future trends requires {{an understanding of the}} stratospheric processes that affect ozone. Stratospheric processes occur on both large and small spatial scales and over both long and short periods of time. Because these diverse processes interact with each other, only in rare cases can individual processes be studied by direct observation. Generally the cause and effect relationships for ozone changes were established by comparisons between observations and model simulations. Increasingly, these comparisons rely on the developing, observed relationships among trace gases and dynamical quantities to initialize and constrain the simulations. The goal of this discussion of stratospheric processes is to describe the causes for {{the observed}} <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> as they are currently understood. At present, we understand with considerable confidence the stratospheric processes responsible for the Antarctic ozone hole but are only beginning to understand the causes of the <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> at middle latitudes. Even though the causes of the <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> at middle latitudes were not clearly determined, it is likely that they, just as those over Antarctica, involved chlorine and bromine chemistry that was enhanced by heterogeneous processes. This discussion generally presents only an update of the observations that have occurred for stratospheric processes since the last assessment (World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 1990), and is not a complete review of all the new information about stratospheric processes.

We find that for these years with massive Arctic ozone depletion the zonal mean total ozone column at midlatitudes is reduced with between 7 and 12 DU in the April-May period. The polar vortex and remnants have preferred locations which leads to longitudinal differences in the midlatitude <b>ozone</b> <b>trends.</b> Together with decadal variations in circulation the dilution of ozone depleted air may explain the major fraction of longitudinal differences in midlatitude <b>ozone</b> <b>trends.</b> For the period 1979 ? 1997 the dilution may explain 50 % of the longitudinal differences in <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> and for the period 1979 ? 2002 it may explain 45 %.

Overall, all the observational data sets and model simulations indicate significant increasing {{trend in the}} upper troposphere (0 – 2. 5 %/year). In the lower stratosphere, estimated trends are slightly positive up to 30 mb and are negative between 30 and 10 mb. Increasing trends in the upper troposphere is probably due to increasing trends in the tropospheric ozone precursor gases (e. g. CO, NO x, NMHCs). Here, we argue that these contrasting ozone-trend profiles might be partially responsible for insignificant long-term trends in the tropical total column ozone.

Models and {{statistical}} analyses of observations such as SAGE ozone profiles and TOMS column measurements show that seasonal cycle, solar cycle, and interannual dynamical variability and dynamical phenomena such as the quasi- biennial oscillation all contribute to ozone variability. These must be accounted for when deriving ozone trends. Systematic or random changes in the atmospheric circulation may also contribute to ozone trends.

Recent studies of <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> over Canada have shown negative <b>trends</b> in total <b>ozone</b> (WMO, 1994). In this thesis <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> in the troposphere and the lower to midstratosphere are examined using the three types of data sets. The purpose has been to investigate the ozone variation pattern in the northern hemisphere and to determine the possible effects of some meteorological factors on this variation during the period from January 1979 to December 1992. A statistical model for a trend analysis of the ozone time series has been used. The model included terms for seasonal variations in mean ozone and seasonal variations in <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> as well as the effect of some meteorological factors. An attempt to assess stratospheric temperature and ozone-temperature trends in the troposphere and lower and mid-stratosphere has also been made. It is concluded that while there is clear evidence for a negative trend in the total ozone column, the full coupling is masked by the seasonal variation...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the issue of}} the turnaround in <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> of the recently homogenized Umkehr ozone record of Arosa, Switzerland, which is the longest Umkehr data set, extending from 1956 to date, using different statistical methods. All methods show statistically significant negative <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> from 1970 to 1995 in the upper stratosphere (above 32. 6 km) throughout {{the course of the year}} as well as in the lower stratosphere (below 23. 5 km) mainly during winter to spring, which can be partially attributed to dynamical changes. Over the recent period (19962004) the year-round trends in the lower stratosphere become positive and are more positive during the winter to spring period. The results also show changes in upper stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>trends</b> after 1996, which are, however, not statistically significant at 95 % if aerosol correction is applied on the retrieved data. This lack of significant trend changes during the recent period in the upper stratosphere is regionally coherent with recent results derived from upper stratospheric ozone data recorded by lidars, microwave radiometers, and satellite instruments at an adjacent location. Although the positive change in trends after 1996 both for upper and lower stratospheric ozone is in line with the reduction of the emissions of ozone-depleting substances from the successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, we recommend, because of lack of significance for the upper stratospheric trends, repeating this analysis in a few years in order to overcome ambiguous results for documentation of the turnaround of upper stratospheric ozone...|$|R
