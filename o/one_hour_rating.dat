40|$|Soil {{and water}} losses due to {{agricultural}} mismanagement {{are high and}} non-sustainable in many orchards. An experiment was setup using rainfall simulation experiments at 78 mm h- 1 over <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> on 20 paired plots of 2 m 2 (bare and straw covered) in new persimmon plantations in Eastern Spain. The effects of a straw cover on the control of soil and water losses was assessed. An addition of 60 % straw cover (75 g m- 2) resulted in delayed ponding and runoff generation {{and as a consequence}} reduced water losses from 60 to 13 % of the total rainfall. The straw cover reduced raindrop impact and as a consequence sediment detachment from 1, 014 to 47 g per plot in <b>one</b> <b>hour.</b> The erosion <b>rate</b> was reduced from 5. 1 to 0. 2 Mg ha- 1 h- 1.

40|$|Hypoglycemia is {{associated}} with increased cardiovascular mortality in trials of intensive therapy in type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM). We previously observed an increase in arrhythmias during spontaneous prolonged hypoglycemia in T 2 DM patients. Our aim was to examine changes in cardiac autonomic function and repolarization during sustained experimental hypoglycemia. Twelve adults with T 2 DM and eleven age, BMI-matched nondiabetic controls underwent paired hyperinsulinemic clamps separated by 4 weeks. Glucose was maintained at euglycemia (6. 0 mmol/L) or hypoglycemia (2. 5 mmol/L) for <b>one</b> <b>hour.</b> Heart <b>rate,</b> blood pressure, heart rate variability were assessed every thirty minutes and corrected QT (QTc) and T wave morphology every 60 minutes. Heart rate initially increased in T 2 DM participants but then fell towards baseline despite maintained hypoglycemia at 1 hour, accompanied by reactivation of vagal tone. In nondiabetic participants, vagal tone remained depressed during sustained hypoglycemia. Diabetic participants exhibited greater heterogeneity of repolarization during hypoglycemia as demonstrated by T wave symmetry and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ratio compared with the nondiabetic group. Epinephrine levels during hypoglycemia were similar between groups. Cardiac autonomic regulation during hypoglycemia appears time-dependent. T 2 DM individuals demonstrate greater repolarization abnormalities for a given hypoglycemic stimulus despite comparable sympathoadrenal responses. These mechanisms could contribute to arrhythmias during clinical hypoglycemic episodes...|$|R

50|$|Because UltraBattery {{operates}} {{effectively in}} the partial SoC range, it can accept charge more efficiently than conventional VRLA batteries, which typically operate at high states of charge. Sandia National Laboratory tests show VRLA batteries typically achieve less than 50% efficiency at greater than 90% charged, about 55% efficiency between 79% and 84% charged, and over 90% efficiency if charged at between zero and 84% of the full capacity.In comparison with conventional VRLA batteries, UltraBattery can be charged efficiently and at high charging/discharging rates. Hund et al.’s test {{results showed that the}} Ultrabattery was able to cycle at the 4C1 rate for around 15,000 cycles. The VRLA battery using this test procedure could only cycle at the 1C1 rate. A 1C rate indicates that the battery’s entire capacity would be used (or replaced if charging) in <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> at this <b>rate.</b> A 4C rate is four times faster - i.e. the battery would be fully discharged (or charged) in 15 minutes at the 4C rate.|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} {{procedure}} to grow thermo-responsive polymer shells {{at the surface}} of magnetic nanocarriers made of multiple iron oxide superparamagnetic nanoparticles embedded in poly (maleic anhydride-alt- 1 -ocatadecene) polymer nanobeads. Depending on the comonomers and on their relative composition, tunable phase transition temperatures in the range between 26 - 47 ºC under physiological conditions could be achieved. Using a suitable microfluidic platform combining magnetic nanostructures and channels mimicking capillaries of the circulatory system, we demonstrate that the thermo-responsive nanobeads are suitable for localized drug delivery with combined thermal and magnetic activation. Below the critical temperature nanobeads are stable in suspension, retain their cargo and cannot be easily trapped by magnetic fields. Increasing temperature above the critical temperature causes the aggregation of nanobeads forming clusters with magnetic moment high enough to permit their capture by suitable magnetic gradients {{in close proximity to}} the targeted zone.

40|$|Patient {{management}} following elective cranial surgery often includes routine postoperative {{computed tomography}} (CT). We analyzed whether a regime of early extubation and close neurological monitoring without routine CT is safe, and compared {{the rate of}} postoperative emergency neurosurgical intervention with published data. Four hundred ninety-two patients were prospectively analyzed; 360 had supra- and 132 had infratentorial lesions. Extubation within <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after skin closure was aimed for in all cases. CT was performed within 48 hours only in cases of unexpected neurological findings. Four-hundred sixty-nine of the 492 patients (95. 3 %) were extubated within <b>one</b> <b>hour,</b> 20 (4. 1 %) within 3 hours, and three (0. 6 %) within 3 to 10 hours. Emergency CT within 48 hours was performed for 43 / 492 (8. 7 %) cases. Rate of recraniotomy within 48 hours for patients with postoperative hemorrhage was 0. 8 % (n = 4), and 0. 8 % (n = 4) required placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD). Of 469 patients extubated within <b>one</b> <b>hour,</b> 3 required recraniotomy and 2 required EVD placements. Of 23 patients with delayed extubation, 1 recraniotomy and 2 EVDs were required. Failure to extubate within <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> {{was associated with a}} significantly higher risk of surgical intervention within 48 <b>hours</b> (<b>rate</b> 13. 0 %, p = 0. 004, odds ratio 13. 9, 95 % confidence interval [3. 11 - 62. 37]). Early extubation combined with close neurological monitoring is safe and omits the need for routine postoperative CT. Patients not extubated within <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> do need early CT, since they had a significantly increased risk of requiring emergency neurosurgical intervention.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the sedative effect of, and hemodynamic response to dexmedetomidine administration in propofol-sedated swine. Sixteen swine were subjects. After anesthetic induction and preparation, the propofol infusion rate was adjusted to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) value between 55 and 65 (i. e., baseline). With the propofol infusion rate fixed at the baseline rate, dexmedetomidine was infused continuously {{at a rate of}} 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 7 μg・kg - 1 ・h- 1 for <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> at each <b>rate.</b> The BIS value and hemodynamic parameters were recorded at each step. Dexmedetomidine decreased the BIS value, mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and mixed venous oxygen saturation in a dose-dependent manner. The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) did not change, but the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased. Oxygen delivery (DO 2) and oxygen consumption (VO 2) decreased. A small dose of dexmedetomidine (0. 2 μg・kg- 1 ・h- 1) greatly enhanced the sedative effects of propofol with only small changes in hemodynamics and systemic oxygen balance, suggesting it may be useful in reducing the propofol dose requirement. However, dexmedetomidine 0. 4 μg・kg- 1 ・h- 1 suppressed cardiac contractility, and 0. 7 μg・kg- 1 ・h- 1 induced hemodynamic instability and further systemic oxygen imbalance while the additional sedative effect was limited. A lower dose of dexmedetomidine may be recommended when using it in combination with propofol...|$|R

40|$|Question: Can Respiratory therapy {{alter the}} lung {{mechanics}} {{in patients with}} invasive mechanical ventilation? The data available in the literature remain controversial. This study aims to assess the changes of pulmonary mechanics in patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, comparing hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> prior to application of the service, immediately after and <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after the service. Design: Participants: Patients on mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours with oro-tracheal tube. Intervention: Patients underwent a protocol of respiratory therapy and hemodynamic variables were recorded at different times. Outcome measures: The following variables were measured <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before, immediately after and <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after application of the protocol of respiratory therapy. Dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), respiratory system resistance (Rsr), Tidal Volume (Vt), Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP), Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory frequency (RF), and Saturation peripheral oxygen (SpO 2). Results: The variables obtained the following mean and standard deviation: HR 88. 9 ± 18. 7 {{an hour before the}} service, presented an increase to 93. 7 ± 19. 2 immediately after the service, which fell <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after the service, 88. 5 ± 17. 1. So we can conclude that heart rate showed an increase after treatment of respiratory therapy and <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after this variable had a value less than the obtained in the beginning. SpO 2 96. 5 ± 2. 29 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service, with an increase to 98. 2 ± 1. 62 immediately after the service, and a slight decrease to 97. 8 ± 1. 79 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after the service. We can conclude that the oxygen saturation showed a significant improvement <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after the service, not returning to the value obtained <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service. RF 20. 8 ± 5. 40 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service, increasing to 21. 9 ± 5. 89 immediately after the service and presenting a decrease of 19. 4 ± 1. 79 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after the service, when compared to <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service. Rsr 14. 2 ± 4. 63 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service, down immediately after the service 11. 0 ± 3. 43 and a small increase <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after the service, but did not return to baseline. Vt 550 ± 134 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service, increasing significantly to 698 ± 155 and presenting a decrease 672 ± 146, although it remained higher than the value obtained <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service. PIP 22. 2 ± 5. 54 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service, with a slowdown that does not differ from the Bonferroni test with the value immediately after the service, and decreased to 21. 5 ± 5. 24, when compared with the previous two times. Cdyn 52. 3 ± 16. 1 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> before the service, increased significantly immediately after the service 65. 1 ± 19. 1 and decreased to 64. 7 ± 20. 2 <b>one</b> <b>hour</b> after the service, with no significant difference if compared to the second time, and significant difference if compared with the first time.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS—To {{test the}} {{contribution}} of portal pressure gradient (PPG) and neurohumoral factors to sodium handling in cirrhotic patients without ascites, by comparing preascitic cirrhotic patients with patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) and previous ascites.  PATIENTS—Ten patients with TIPSS and 10  preascitic cirrhotic patients.  METHODS—Changes in glomerular filtration, renal plasma flow, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV), and neurohumoral factors were measured before and for two hours after infusion of one litre of 0. 9 % saline over <b>one</b> <b>hour.</b>  RESULTS—Glomerular filtration <b>rate</b> and renal plasma flow were significantly higher in patients with TIPSS compared with preascitic cirrhotic patients. Following saline infusion both parameters increased significantly; this increase was significantly greater in patients with TIPSS. UNaV increased significantly in both groups following saline infusion. The increase in UNaV was significantly greater in the TIPSS group. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II decreased significantly in both groups. Basal UNaV was independently correlated with angiotensin II concentration and PPG and the change in UNaV correlated with the PPG.  CONCLUSIONS—Results suggest that patients with advanced liver disease and low portal pressure handle sodium as well as patients with compensated liver disease and high portal pressure. These {{results are consistent with}} the notion that in addition to peripheral vasodilatation and severity of liver disease, the severity of portal hypertension contributes to the abnormalities of sodium retention in cirrhosis.    Keywords: cirrhosis; transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt; TIPSS; angiotensin; sodium handling; peripheral vasodilatatio...|$|R
