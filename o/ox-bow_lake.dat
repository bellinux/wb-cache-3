500|$|Under ideal {{conditions}} (uniform gentle slope on a homogeneously erodible substrate), the sinuosity of a meandering river approaches [...] The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, {{and increasing the}} overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and [...] "short-circuit", creating an <b>ox-bow</b> <b>lake</b> in the process.

The Beni River, whose upper sub-catchments drain the Andean and sub-Andean ranges, is a major tributary of the Madeira River. This study examines the river in the south-western Amazonian lowlands of Bolivia, where it develops mobile meanders. Channel migration, meander-bend morphology and <b>ox-bow</b> <b>lakes</b> are analysed at different temporal and spatial scales. The first part of this study was undertaken with the aim to link the erosion-deposition processes in the active channel with hydrological events. The quantification of annual erosion and deposition areas shows high inter-annual and spatial variability. In this study, we investigate the conditions of sediment exportation in the river in relation to three hydrological parameters (flood intensity, date of discharge peak and duration of the bank-full stage level). The second part of this study, focusing on the abandoned meanders, analyses the cutoff processes and the post-abandonment evolution during 1967 - 2001. This approach shows the influence of the active channel behaviour on the sediment diffusion and sequestration of the abandoned meanders and allows us to build a first model of the contemporary floodplain evolution.

40|$|Nepal houses only inland {{freshwater}} wetlands, {{ranging from}} floodplains of snow-melt-fed cold Himalayan rivers, warm rivers {{originating in the}} mid hills, high altitudinal glacial lakes to hot springs, ponds, <b>ox-bow</b> <b>lakes,</b> marshes and swamps. These wetlands support several endemic and globally threatened species of flora and fauna. Besides, wetland sites have significant recreational, religio-cultural and spiritual values. There are over 240 wetland sites in Nepal, of which 163 are in the Terai (plain lowland). Wetlands found in Tarai are comparatively more inventoried than the wetlands of mountains and the Himalayan regions of the country. The Terai region (below 300 m) covers about 14 % of the country’s total area, where half of Nepal’s total populations exist. About 11 % population {{of the country is}} wetland dependent; majority of them are living in the Terai region. The country has nine Ramsar sites, of which, four are in the Tarai region.

As the lakes gradually dry up and recede, the region attracts many large animals in search of water, making it one of Africa's most renowned game-viewing regions. In Shona language, ‘Mana’ means “four” referring to the four large permanent pools formed by the meandering <b>ox-bow</b> <b>lakes</b> of the middle Zambezi River. Dande Safari Area (532 km2) established in 1968, and the Urungwe Safari Area (2870 km2) established in 1976 are contiguous to this park. The park’s habitat consists of islands, sandbanks and pools, flanked by forests of mahogany, wild figs, ebonies and baobabs. Alluvial deposits along the Zambezi have winterthorn with more diverse woodlands with species of Kigelia africana and Trichelia emetica on the top alluvial layers. The park has the country’s biggest concentration of hippopotamuses and crocodiles (Nile crocodiles in particular) and large dry season mammal populations of elephant and buffalo. Spotted hyena, honey badger, warthog, bushpig, plains zebra and many species of antelope are found here. Bird life consists of 380 species which includes Nyasa lovebird, yellow-spotted nicator, rock pratincole, banded snake-eagle and Livingstone's flycatcher.|$|R

50|$|The river rises near Lower Beeding {{and runs}} eastwards into East Sussex, {{meandering}} narrowly and turning slowly southward. A number of tributaries join it {{near the village}} of Isfield, and more at Barcombe Mills, where it is used by South East Water along with neighbouring Barcombe Reservoir, and there are many weirs and bridges. Just north of this, the Anchor Inn is {{on the banks of the}} river, and canoes can be hired from here. Continuing on from Barcombe, the Ouse really starts to meander (leaving several <b>ox-bow</b> <b>lakes)</b> as it reaches Hamsey, where the meander has been cut short by a canal creating Hamsey Island, home to St. Peter's Church, which is situated on a mount. Then the river flows through the town of Lewes, where it has been converted considerably over history. Three bridges cross it at Lewes: Willey's Bridge (a small footbridge opened in 1965), the Phoenix Causeway (a larger road bridge named after the extinct Phoenix Ironworks), and Cliffe Bridge (which is much older). After Cliffe the Winterbourne stream flows into the Ouse and the main river is banked on the west by the Heart of Reeds. The Ouse courses southeast past Glynde, where the tributary of Glynde Reach gushes into it; and then passes Rodmell, Southease (where there is a locally famous bridge) and Piddinghoe, finally reaching Newhaven, where it splits industrial Denton Island from the mainland and provides an important harbour in the Port of Newhaven. It then flows into the English Channel, surrounded on either side by two long breakwater piers.|$|R
40|$|The Densu River Basin {{has come}} under serious threat {{from a number of}} human {{activities}} such as farming, lumbering, sand winning, animal grazing, dam construction among others. These activities have significant implications on the fluvial processes of the river such as erosion, braiding and flooding. The study examined the current fluvial processes and landforms and the dynamics in the river morphology since the 1960 s. This was done by analysing existing survey maps and air photographs. This involved air photo interpretation and digitizing of old topographic maps which were overlaid on each other to identify changes in the river’s course. These analyses were backed by field studies to verify findings from these secondary data sources. Fluvial processes in the river channel include erosion and braiding which is hastening the siltation of the Weija Lake, a dam built at the river’s mouth. The study revealed that the lower section of the river channel was characterised by <b>ox-bow</b> <b>lakes,</b> meanders and sand dunes. Channel morphology in the middle and upper courses was that of incised river valleys with rapids, water falls and pot-holes. It was also noticed that, the construction of the Weija Dam has led to the drying up of the Sakumo Lagoon below the dam as water flow into the lagoon is regulated. The reduction of fresh water flow into the lagoon has promoted salt mining in the delta declared as a RAMSAR Site. Another major change {{at the mouth of the}} river has been the sealing – off of one distributary of the river due to the accretion of a sand bar westwards from Grefi to Bortianor. This change in the river’s course is due to the low flows at the mouth as a result of the dam hence the river lacks the requisite energy to carry away sand dunes deposited at its mouth. 1...|$|R
500|$|The route {{continues}} through a wooded valley, past {{the site of}} the Sprotborough Flash Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with the towpath forming part of the Trans Pennine Trail. Sprotborough lock and weir are situated just before Sprotborough. Just below the lock on the north bank [...] are the remains of an engine house, built in the 1690s for Sir Godfrey Copley of Sprotborough Hall. A water wheel pumped river water some [...] upwards to supply a fountain in the grounds of the hall, a swimming pool, and also provided a water supply for the village. The pump was powered by a water wheel which was removed in the 1970s. Soon the edge of Doncaster is reached, where amongst the railway marshalling yards, the River Don leaves the navigation for the final time, as does the towpath. The two weir streams flow either side of Doncaster prison, effectively forming an island on which the building sits. Doncaster Town Lock is situated close to Doncaster railway station, and between here and Long Sandall Lock, some of the changes which have occurred over the years can be visualised, with the river on the left and <b>ox-bow</b> <b>lakes</b> on the right, severed by the course of the Wheatley Cut. The final section to Bramwith is usually called the River Dun Navigation. At Bramwith, the waterway splits, with the New Junction Canal heading north-east for the Aire and Calder Navigation and Goole, and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal heading east to the River Trent at Keadby. The River Don heads northwards too, turning to the east where the Dutch River starts at Newbridge. The original course to the River Aire can be traced across the fields, now little more than a drainage ditch crossed by an oversized Grade II listed bridge on the A1041 at East Cowick, and Vermuyden's embankments are closely followed by the A614 road after it has crossed the M18 motorway.|$|R
