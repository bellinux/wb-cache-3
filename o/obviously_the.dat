5|$|George Gilbert Scott, the {{architect}} of ChristChurch Cathedral, and an empathiser of Mountfort's teacher and mentor Carpenter, wished his former pupil Mountfort to be the clerk of works and supervising architect of the new cathedral project. This proposal was originally vetoed by the Cathedral Commission. Nevertheless, following delays in the building work attributed to financial problems, the position of supervising architect was finally given to Mountfort in 1873. Mountfort was responsible for several alterations to the absentee main architect's design, most <b>obviously</b> <b>the</b> tower and the west porch. He also designed the font, the Harper Memorial, and the north porch. The cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904, six years after Mountfort's death. The cathedral {{is very much in}} the European decorated Gothic style with an attached campanile tower beside the body of the cathedral, rather than towering directly above it in the more English tradition.|$|E

25|$|In {{some cases}} also an above ground {{pipeline}} was tested as a storage system, giving some good results. <b>Obviously</b> <b>the</b> {{cost of the}} system is higher, but it can be placed wherever the designer chooses, while an underground system needs some particular geologic formations (salt domes, aquifers, depleted gas mines..etc.).|$|E
25|$|The shakehole on {{the plateau}} is centred on the Wembley Fault line. <b>Obviously</b> <b>the</b> fault played a {{significant}} role in the major collapse that created the shakehole. The underground debris from the collapse forms the Big Rapids and is responsible for the boulder chokes seen near Blank Passage.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many stories to {{interpret}} the intercalation, a period of 22 or 23 days is always ¾ synodic month. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>the</b> month beginning shifts forward (from the new moon, to the third quarter, to the full moon, to the first quarter, back the new moon) after intercalation.|$|E

25|$|Another {{source of}} Jacobite support came from those {{dissatisfied}} with political developments. Some Whigs, most <b>obviously</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Mar, reacted to political disappointments by joining the Jacobites, but {{while others were}} courted from 1692 onwards and indicated support, mostly this was just reinsurance in case the Jacobites came out on top.|$|E
25|$|Let us {{assume that}} m = 10, n = 100, p = 10 and s = 1000. So, the first way to {{multiply}} the chain will require 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 calculations. The second way will require only 10,000+100,000 calculations. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>the</b> second way is faster, {{and we should}} multiply the matrices using that arrangement of parenthesis.|$|E
25|$|Van der Horst, Van der Veer, and Van IJzendoorn write:Bowlby spurred Hinde {{to start}} his ground {{breaking}} work on attachment and separation in primates (monkeys and humans), and in general {{emphasized the importance of}} evolutionary thinking about human development that foreshadowed the new interdisciplinary approach of evolutionary psychology. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>the</b> encounter of ethology and attachment theory led to a genuine cross-fertilization.|$|E

25|$|The fruity aromas include {{citrus fruit}} such as lemon and grapefruit, white fruit such as apple, quince, peach and apricot, and nuts such as walnut and hazelnut. Exotic fruits are also present: pineapple, mango, and lychee. <b>Obviously</b> <b>the</b> {{aromatic}} palette includes these cooked flavours: apple, jam, candied fruit, etc. White wines may also convey floral aromas of acacia, honeysuckle, verbena, violet, etc.. (Scents of honey {{can also be}} assimilated).|$|E
25|$|Later {{examples}} of the Italianate style in England tend to {{take the form of}} Palladian-style building often enhanced by a belvedere tower complete with Renaissance-type balustrading at the roof level. This is generally a more stylistic interpretation of what architects and patrons imagined to be the case in Italy, and utilises more <b>obviously</b> <b>the</b> Italian Renaissance motifs than those earlier {{examples of}} the Italianate style by Nash.|$|E
25|$|Several {{opposition}} figures {{outside the}} PCP also had anticolonial opinions, {{such as the}} candidates to the fraudulent presidential elections, like Norton de Matos (in 1949), Quintão Meireles (in 1951) and Humberto Delgado (in 1958). The communist candidates had, <b>obviously,</b> <b>the</b> same positions. Among them were Rui Luís Gomes and Arlindo Vicente, the first {{would not be allowed}} to participate in the election and the second would support Delgado in 1958.|$|E

25|$|His {{works are}} {{sometimes}} even {{said to have}} contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words politics and politician, and it is sometimes thought that it is because of him that Old Nick became an English term for the Devil. More <b>obviously,</b> <b>the</b> adjective Machiavellian became a pejorative term describing someone who aims to deceive and manipulate others for personal advantage. Machiavellianism also remains a popular term used in speeches and journalism; while in psychology, it denotes a personality type.|$|E
25|$|Departures {{from the}} {{expected}} pattern may occur because of unidentified social or political situations {{or because of}} geographic barriers. In the Southwest, mountain ranges, rivers, and most <b>obviously,</b> <b>the</b> Grand Canyon, can be significant barriers for human communities, likely reducing the frequency of contact with other groups. Current opinion holds that the closer cultural similarity between the Mogollon and Ancestral Puebloans, and their greater differences from the Hohokam and Patayan, is due to both the geography and the variety of climate zones in the Southwest.|$|E
25|$|Earthquake swarms are {{sequences}} of earthquakes striking {{in a specific}} area within {{a short period of}} time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is <b>obviously</b> <b>the</b> main shock, therefore none have notable higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park. In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Stone was {{the basis}} for a major {{character}} in John Hay's 1883 anti-union novel The Breadwinners. In response to Hay's novel, journalist Henry Francis Keenan (a former colleague of Hay's at the New-York Tribune) published The Money-Makers in 1885. The novel was an attack on robber barons and industrialists, and its main character was an idealistic journalist who marries into a wealthy family and abandons his progressive values for greed, power, and materialism. John Hay clearly inspired the main character, and Amasa Stone was <b>obviously</b> <b>the</b> basis for the grasping, cruel industrialist Aaron Grimestone.|$|E
25|$|Many sources {{contend that}} Sykes-Picot {{conflicted}} with the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence of 1915–1916 {{and that the}} publication of the agreement in November 1917 caused the resignation of Sir Henry McMahon. There were several points of difference, the most obvious being Iraq placed in the British red area and less <b>obviously,</b> <b>the</b> idea that British and French advisors would be in control of the area designated as being for an Arab State. Lastly, while the correspondence made no mention of Palestine, Haifa and Acre were to be British and the brown area (a reduced Palestine) internationalised.|$|E
25|$|Female calves {{born on a}} {{dairy farm}} will {{typically}} be raised as replacement stock {{to take the place}} of older cows that are no longer sufficiently productive. The life of a dairy cow is a cycle of pregnancy and lactation starting at puberty. <b>Obviously</b> <b>the</b> timing of these events is very important to the production capacity of the dairy. A cow will not produce milk until she has given birth to a calf. Consequently timing of the first breeding as well as all the subsequent breeding is important for maintaining milk production levels.|$|E
