As Iraq dominated discourse in America and across the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.|$|E

500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. <b>Once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E

[...] He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying [...] "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals." [...] Gregg Barrios from Daily Star was critical of the book, saying [...] " [...] The fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs {{is that they have}} no real ending or any way of predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [...] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Guardian criticized Morton's writing by saying, [...] "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... <b>Once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> used to Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional snooze), it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around, trying to find some place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes Sean Penn and Warren Beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight." ...|$|E

[...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, but <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E

Writing for the Transylvanian readership of Luceafărul, in May 1909, George Murnu contended: [...] "Teodorescu Sion is a new talent that ought to work hard before reaching the profundity of observation which makes one an artist. He is altogether too preoccupied with technical matters and too superficial in his drawing." [...] Five years later, Tăslăuanu was to assess: [...] "Mr. Theodorescu-Sion's art [...] doesn't agree with all people on first impression.
