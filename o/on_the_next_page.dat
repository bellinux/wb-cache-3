500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If {{there is}} no place for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly speaks to a child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>page</b> before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E

The factions of The Wood {{use a variety of}} anachronistic technologies, including cutlasses, blunderbusses, and flintlocks, concurrent with howitzers and semi-automatic pistols, and vehicles like animal-drawn wagons and carts alongside bicycles, trucks and trains. No attempt was made to maintain a consistent level of technological advancement or to rationalize why a particular piece of equipment was used; rather, Meloy said, they could [...] "pick coolest version of whatever piece of technology" [...] they wanted, and Ellis said they [...] "just picked whatever we liked."
