5|$|From 1970 the Provisional Irish Republican Army was {{carrying}} out an armed campaign aimed ultimately at bringing about a united Ireland. As well as attacking {{military and political}} targets, it also bombed infrastructure and commercial targets in Northern Ireland and England. It believed that by damaging the economy and causing severe disruption, it could pressure the British government to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Manchester had {{been the target of}} earlier IRA bombs. Firebombs damaged city centre businesses in 1973 and 1974, for which a man was later imprisoned. In April 1974, a bomb exploded at Manchester Magistrates' Court, injuring twelve. In 1975, IRA bomb factories were found in Greater Manchester and five men were imprisoned for planning attacks in North West England. On 4 December 1992, the IRA detonated two small bombs in Manchester city centre, forcing police to evacuate thousands <b>of</b> <b>shoppers.</b> More than 60 were hurt by shattered glass and the blasts cost an estimated £10 million in damage and business losses.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 2010s, Kreuzlingen's {{downtown}} began {{to experience a}} dearth <b>of</b> <b>shoppers</b> as many of them, including buses from elsewhere in Switzerland that pass through the city, started crossing the border to shop in Konstanz instead, due to lower prices for basic items in Germany, a favorable exchange rate between the euro and the franc and a German VAT refund that allows shoppers from non-European Union countries such as Switzerland to get back {{as much as a}} fifth of the price of the goods they buy. Elected officials from the city have asked the national government to negotiate a change in this policy with their German counterparts as they feel it is anti-competitive; at the same time some Konstanz residents, feeling displaced in their own hometown by the onslaught of Swiss on weekends, have opened businesses in Kreuzlingen that primarily cater to other Germans.|$|E

Governor Linda Lingle made a speech to the state of Hawaii the same day. She emphasized that the storm was not an imminent threat but that residents should be ready and should know where the nearest emergency shelter is. Since forecasters expected the storm to weaken before it reached the islands, only minor effects—mainly rainfall—were expected. Hawaii County mayor Billy Kenoi was also briefed on the approaching storm and he advised the county to be prepared. Stores reported an influx <b>of</b> <b>shoppers</b> and posted anniversary sales.

The concept of a vertical mall was originally conceived in the late 1960s by the Mafco Company, former shopping center development division of Marshall Field & Co.

40|$|Background: There {{are several}} trends in {{logistics}} Internet retailers {{have to face}} nowadays, e. g. addressing and reaching customers through different sales channels (multi- or cross-channel management), integration of new payment alternatives (combined online and/or mobile payment methods), ordering and delivery of products from an Internet retailer at the same day (same-day delivery), and allowing product returns (management of product returns). Here the question is, whether relevant factors influencing the buying behaviour <b>of</b> online <b>shoppers</b> as well as groups of these can be found. 	 Methods:  Our contribution is analysing this area in two ways. On the hand, an overview about these major trends and the German e-commerce market will be given.

Results: Four relevant factors influencing the behavior <b>of</b> online <b>shoppers</b> could be identified.
