They associate and work directly with adults as partners, but the crew is led by elected youth officers who are given <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and apply leadership skills.

An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and personal growth.

40|$|This study {{argues that}} to improve school effectiveness, schools and {{educators}} {{should focus on}} even more basic elements than those posited by other research. The focus should be on providing a basic <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> by having the school open every day; the teacher present; students present and ready to learn; and instructional time on task. The educational value of that basic opportunity then depends on how teachers and students use the time available during the day, whether materials are present and used by them, and whether class sizes are reasonable. The study further established an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> (OTL) index based on 12 factors and measures the extent <b>to</b> which <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> is optimized {{in a sample of}} schools in Guatemala. The study answers the following questions: How well do schools provide <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn?,</b> How does actual <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> compare <b>to</b> potential <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn?,</b> How does <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> vary across schools...|$|R

500|$|Snyder's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] {{describes}} the Joker as {{in love with}} Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, and he loves the villain for that. Batman comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker's main {{goal is to make}} Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's [...] "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in [...] "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply [...] "the Joker", he believes that Batman is [...] "Batman" [...] (with or without the costume) and has no interest in what is behind Batman's mask, ignoring <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Batman's secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{debate has}} {{occurred}} {{over whether or}} not the goddess was an invention of Bede's, particularly in the 19th century before more widespread reconstructions of the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess. Writing in the late 19th century, Charles J. Billson notes that scholars before his writing were divided about the existence of Bede's account of Ēostre, stating that [...] "among authorities who have no doubt as to her existence are W. Grimm, Wackernagel, Sinrock , and Wolf. On the other hand, Weinhold rejects the idea on philological grounds, and so do Heinrich Leo and Hermann Oesre. Kuhn says, 'The Anglo-Saxon Eostre looks like an invention of Bede;' and Mannhardt also dismisses her as an etymological dea ex machina." [...] Billson says that [...] "the whole question turns , upon Bede's credibility", and that [...] "one is inclined to agree with Grimm, that it would be uncritical to saddle this eminent Father of the Church, who keeps Heathendom at arms' length and tells us less of than he knows, with the invention of this goddess." [...] Billson points out that the Christianization of England started {{at the end of the}} 6th century, and, by the 7th, was completed. Billson argues that, as Bede was born in 672, Bede must have had <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the names of the native goddesses of the Anglo-Saxons, [...] "who were hardly extinct in his lifetime." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a {{societal}} level, {{the arrival of}} Christian missionaries supported by the European and American governments {{led to the creation}} of a formal system of education for girls, who had until this period received little or no education. Initially, this took the form of private institutions attracting wealthy and mostly Christian families. However, as these schools became more socially acceptable and affordable, the idea trickled down to the middle classes before finally reaching out to the poor. Thus, a new norm was becoming increasingly prevalent; the idea that girls should receive an education so as to afford them better marriage prospects, and more importantly, to provide them with adequate means in which to educate their children. At this point in time, the range of subjects offered to women was limited. However women seized these <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> and showed admirable drive and determination. By the middle of the century, a sense of [...] "...awareness and obligation for intellectual and social consciousness, especially the appreciation of women's plight, and the struggle for a voice in society became visible and public." [...] A notable example of the contribution of Western missionaries to increasing educational opportunities for women was the work of Daniel and Abby Maria Bliss, an American couple who moved to Beirut in 1866 and subsequently set up the Syrian Protestant College (which later became the American University of Beirut). In 1905, a nursing programme that accepted applications from women was established, and in 1924, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences opened its doors to female students.|$|E
