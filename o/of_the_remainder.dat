5|$|After John succeeded Richard in 1199, {{he decided}} to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but {{continued}} to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome.

But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200.

5|$|After the Fourth Test, the Australians {{had five}} tour matches {{before the final}} Test. They {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an innings, before having a washout against Glamorgan. The Australians then defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets, before drawing with Lancashire, who hung on with three wickets in hand on the final day. This {{was followed by a}} two-day non-first-class match against Durham, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day. During this period, Barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury. Toshack also recovered to play against Lancashire, but injured himself again and was ruled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> of the tour.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} passing of noble titles or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property.

A different distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder</b> could be specified in a will, but it is unclear how common this was.|$|E

Some 26 of the fighters lost were Hurricanes, and five were Spitfires. Personnel losses for the RAF amounted to 10 British fighter pilots killed on the day, and another who died of wounds.

5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief.

Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remainder,</b> known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other.
