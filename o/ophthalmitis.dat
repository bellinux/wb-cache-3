40|$|Purpose. To {{report the}} visual outcome of {{penetrating}} keratoplasty {{performed on the}} sympathizing eye in three cases of sympathetic <b>ophthalmitis.</b> Methods. Interventional case series of three patients, diagnosed with sympathetic <b>ophthalmitis,</b> with corneal changes {{in the form of}} band keratopathy and decompensation underwent penetrating keratoplasty to the sympathizing eye. They had each sustained penetrating trauma as a child and had undergone previous cataract surgery and superficial keratectomy. Two patients had undergone lamellar keratoplasty prior to this procedure. One patient had undergone trabeculectomy for glaucoma, and she was on antiglaucoma medication. The preoperative visual acuity was 1 / 60 in the affected eye of each patient. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed in the sympathizing eye and the donor graft size was 7. 50 [*]mm, and the host graft size was 7. 25 [*]mm. Our patients were immunosuppressed prior to the procedure to help prevent graft rejection. Result. At one year follow-up, a BCVA of 6 / 36 or better was achieved in all three patients.

40|$|Background: The most {{frequently}} isolated fungi in patients using TPN {{belongs to the}} Candida genus. Various infections including venous catheter infections, fungemia, endocarditis and <b>ophthalmitis</b> may be encountered. Objective: Upon growth of Candida in the blood cultures from the pediatric (neonatal) unit of our hospital, a surveillance was performed in this unit and involving the health care workers. Clonal relationships of the isolates were investigated with molecular tests. Methods: Blood samples obtained from the patients in pediatric neonatal unit were studied with automatized blood culture [BacT/Alert (Bio Mιrioux, France) ]. Yeast isolates from environmental surveillance cultures (TPN solutions, hands of healthcare personnel, ιtagθre, etc) and patients were identified as C. albicans with conventional methods and ID 32 C and ATB TM Fungus 3 (Biomerieux, France) kits. Clonal similarity was determined by using AP-PCR as initial method and we have also typified all strains by the method of REP-PCR (diversilab system,bioMιrieux). Finally; Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) was used for confirmation. Results: C. albicans was isolated in blood cultures of seven patients. Similar antifungal susceptibility patterns were observed in all isolates. AP-PCR and REP-PCR showed that the C. albicans isolates grown in the TPN solution and from the patients′ blood cultures were clonally same strains. PFGE analysis further confirmed this clonality.

40|$|Cytomegalovirus {{can produce}} a severe necrotizing {{chorioretinitis}} in patients on immunosuppressive therapy and infants born with congenital cytomegaloviral inclusion disease. To study the effect of cytomegalovirus on the eye, murine cytomegalovirus was injected {{into the eyes of}} nonimmunosuppressed Swiss CD- 1 weanling mice. The eyes were then prepared for virus titer, as well as light and electron microscopy at variable periods after inoculation (1 to 28 days). From days 2 to 6, the hallmarks of cytomegalovirus infection, intranuclear and intracytoplasmic viral inclusions, were evident within cytomegalic cells. The major site of reaction was in the uveal tract, where necrosis and inflammation were prominent. Viral particles budding through the nuclear membranes into the perinuclear cisternae and vacuoles with viral particles could be seen in the cytoplasm of infected cells. In lesions older than 2 weeks, only a mild mixed inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis were observed. Morphologic alterations unaccompanied by inflammation occurred in the outer sensory retina overlying infected retinal pigment epithelial cells. Multiple necrotic foci with inclusion-bearing cells in the liver indicated the systemic spread of virus from the eye. The titer of virus recovered from the eye peaked at day 4 and then declined to low levels, but infectious virus could still be isolated at day 28, even though viral particles were not seen morphologically at or after day 14. Many of the alterations seen in the model resemble those found in the human cytomegaloviral <b>ophthalmitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A case of incontinentia pigmenti is {{reported}} with fundus changes in 1 eye. She had microaneurysms temporal to the macula, with an abnormal branch of inferior temporal vein. There was extensive retinitis proliferans {{in the upper}} temporal equatorial region, which showed leakage on fluorescein angiography. The ocular and systemic changes in incontinentia pigmenti are reviewed here and a case {{is reported}} with fundus changes which have not been described previously. Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is characterised by ectodermal defects, with occasional associated mesodermal abnormalities. The typical skin lesions are blue-grey to chocolate-brown arranged along the naevus lines of Blaschko. These occur on the torso and the extremities. The disease can be dif-ferentiated into 2 clinical types: Bloch-Sulzberger and Naegeli. The Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome occurs predominantly in females and is usually present at birth. There is patchy, splash-like cutaneous pig-mentation with whorls and splotches of pigment. It is associated with frequent ocular changes, absence or malformations of the teeth, and alopecia. The Naegeli type occurs in {{both males and females}} and appears after 2 years of age. There is a reticular type of pigmentation, sometimes associated with hypohidrosis, unhealthy and spotted teeth, and keratosis of palms and soles. The ocular anomalies occur in about a quarter of cases of Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome. They include cataract, uveitis, blue sclerae, conjunctival pigmenta-tion, strabismus, nystagmus, papillitis, optic atrophy, metastatic <b>ophthalmitis,</b> pseudoglioma, retrolental fibroplasia, phthisis bulbi, and microphthalmos.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{compelling}} topics {{to emerge from the}} last decade of veterinary protozoology is disease caused by a zoonotic pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, in otherwise healthy people. These findings may catch the health professions by surprise, because veterinary and medical courses and textbooks typically emphasize that T. gondii infections are subclinical, unless acquired in utero or the patient has a serious immunosuppressive condition. Nevertheless, numerous reports in the last decade associate toxoplasmosis with lymphadenopathy, fever, weakness and debilitation, <b>ophthalmitis,</b> and severe multisystemic infections in people who do not have immunosuppressive conditions. Toxoplasmosis in rodents causes altered behavior, and similar mental aberrations are coming to light in humans; recent studies associate T. gondii infection with personality shifts and increased likelihood of reduced intelligence or schizophrenia. These conditions reduce {{the quality of life of}} individuals, and may exact a significant economic burden upon society. Of course, toxoplasmosis continues to cause serious conditions in AIDS patients and congenitally infected people, as well as abortions and encephalitis in domestic and wild animals. Environmental contamination is heavy enough to extend into marine wildlife. It is time for the health professions to amend teaching curricula regarding T. gondii. Veterinary parasitologists should lead the way in developing methods to reduce the prevalence of T. gondii in food animals. Public health policies should prohibit the practice of allowing pet cats to roam. Organizations and individuals that feed feral cats are unwittingly contributing to the dissemination of T. gondii, by sustaining artificially dense populations of a definitive host of this protozoal parasite.

40|$|Background: Sympathetic <b>ophthalmitis</b> (SO) {{has been}} {{reported}} following vitrectomy; however, {{there is a lack}} of data on the role of antecedent penetrating ocular trauma impacting the disease manifestation in eyes developing SO following vitrectomy. Aim: To report differences in the presentation and outcomes of SO in eyes with or without a history of antecedent penetrating trauma; SO being diagnosed after vitreoretinal (VR) surgery. Design: Comparative case series. Methods: Seventeen consecutive patients presenting with SO following VR surgery, diagnosed between 1995 and 2011 were included. Eyes with and without prior penetrating injury were included in Group I (n = 7) and Group II (n = 10), respectively. All Group I patients had received systemic steroids prior to presentation. Demographic and clinical parameters were evaluated. Results: Differences were observed between Group I and Group II mainly with regards to time interval between VR surgery and diagnosis of SO (1. 5 months vs. 8 months, P = 0. 10), presence of neurosensory detachments (100 % vs. 30 %, P = 0. 01), and the inciting eye vision at presentation (nil light perception in 28. 5 % vs. 80 %, P = 0. 049). Other differences observed though not statistically significant were optic disc and retinal vessel involvement (42 % vs. 70 %, P = 0. 28), Dalen-Fuchs nodules (localized vs. diffuse) and leaks on fundus fluorescein angiography (pin-head vs. pin-point leak). Conclusion: SO in patients with antecedent penetrating ocular trauma present early with the central serous chorioretinopathy-like picture. Prior use of systemic steroids might have a bearing on the differences in presentation and the visual acuities between the two groups...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 40 -year-old female patient who was {{admitted}} to the hospital because of a left ovarian mass torsion. A nonhemolytic, nonmotile Bacillus, suspicious of Bacillus anthracis, was isolated from a blood culture. We discuss the evaluation that led to the final identification of the bacterium as B. megaterium. Bacillus represents a genus of ubiquitous gram-positive bacteria. The species are used in many medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and industrial processes, including those for making antibiotics and insecticides (1 – 4). Even the anthrax toxin is being evaluated as a choice for tumor cell surface targeting in chemoresistant neoplasms (5). Although most species are harmless, two are medically significant: Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus. B. anthracis causes anthrax in its cutaneous, pulmonary (inhalational), and intestinal forms. B. cereus causes two distinct food poisoning syndromes, a rapid-onset emetic syndrome characterized by nausea and vomiting and a slower onset diarrheal syndrome. Bacillus are often isolated on blood culture and usually represent blood culture contamination. For example, Bacillus species pseudobacteremia has been traced to contaminated gloves used in collection of blood from patients (6). In immunocompromised hosts, a blood culture growing Bacillus species should be evaluated carefully. Rarely, these species cause important clinical diseases such as bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, empyema, <b>ophthalmitis,</b> osteomyelitis, endocarditis, soft tissue infection, and intravascular catheter-acquired sepsis. Pseudotumour of the lung has been reported as the cause of infection with B. sphaericus (7). Endocarditis has been reported to be caused by B. subtilis (8). An outbreak of Bacillus species in a cancer hospital in Brazil was reported (9) and was strongly associated with use of calcium gluconate solution and central venous lines. The outbreak was controlled by stopping use of the implicated calcium gluconate vials...|$|E

Participants completed questionnaires on past symptoms and exposures, physical exam, vision testing, and blood collection. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed on a subset of individuals who reported past clinical symptoms consistent with RVF and unrelated subjects. Four symptom clusters were defined: meningoencephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, eye disease, and RVF-not otherwise specified. SNPs in 46 viral sensing and response genes were investigated. Association was analyzed between SNP genotype, serology and RVF symptom clusters. The meningoencephalitis symptom phenotype cluster among seropositive patients was associated with polymorphisms in DDX 58 /RIG-I and TLR 8. Having three or more RVF-related symptoms was significantly associated with polymorphisms in TICAM 1 /TRIF, MAVS, IFNAR 1 and DDX 58 /RIG-I. SNPs significantly associated with eye disease included three different polymorphisms TLR 8 and hemorrhagic fever symptoms associated with TLR 3, TLR 7, TLR 8 and MyD 88. Of the 46 SNPs tested, TLR 3, TLR 7, TLR 8, MyD 88, TRIF, MAVS, and RIG-I were repeatedly associated with severe symptomatology, suggesting that these genes may have a robust association with RVFV-associated clinical outcomes. Studies of these and related genetic polymorphisms are warranted to advance understanding of RVF pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Cyclosporine (CsA) is {{currently}} widely {{used as a}} primary immunosuppressive agent in ocular disease, particularly in severe uveitis. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a significant complication of CsA therapy. However, there are no reports of the occurrence of PRES {{in response to the}} treatment of uveitis in the ophthalmological area. Case Presentation: We report a case with CsA-associated PRES. A 70 -year-old woman with sympathetic <b>ophthalmitis</b> was treated with 50 mg/day of CsA for 1 week. However, the trough level in her blood was too low; thus, we increased the dose to 100 mg/day of CsA with prednisolone. She had headaches, hypertension (systolic blood pressure 180 - 200 mm Hg), loss of consciousness for several hours, and reduced limb movement, and her MRI showed a high signal intensity in both posterior lobes, consistent with PRES. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid indicated that it was within normal limits. Her CsA trough level in the blood was within normal ranges {{on the day of the}} attack. Her symptoms gradually improved over the next several days; however, she presented with cortical blindness, which lasted for several weeks. Finally, she returned to her baseline values from before the attack. Her MRI findings showed that PRES had essentially disappeared. Conclusion: PRES is not directly associated with the dosage of CsA administered; however, in general, it is well known that PRES can affect strongly immunosuppressed cases undergoing organ and bone marrow transplantation. Nevertheless, our CsA dose was only 100 mg (1. 8 mg/kg). In this study, we report on the occurrence of PRES after the administration of CsA to treat sympathetic ophthalmia. To our knowledge, PRES can also occur after the administration of a small dose of CsA; thus, ophthalmologists using CsA should carefully observe the systemic conditions of CsA-treated patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) is {{a common}} sexually {{transmitted}} infection in women, with a heavy burden on female and neonatal health, because sequelae occur, such as female infertility, ectopic pregnancy, neonatal <b>ophthalmitis</b> and infection, and chronic pelvic pain. Prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment can cure infection and avoid complications. However, adequate treatment is not easy, because early and rapid identification of gonorrhea is interfered with by many factors, including the complicated mixed microflora of the vagina and cervix, non-user-friendly culture systems, and lack of immediate availability of results, even {{with a combination of}} subjective complaint and high clinical suspicion. A PubMed search was conducted using the major headings of “gonorrhoea and diagnostic tool” and “Neisseria gonorrhoeae and diagnostic tool”, before the end of 2010. Recently available methods for the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection in women were included, including traditional tools and advanced technology. Traditional tools such as microscopic examination and microbial culture have been used broadly; unfortunately, they have relatively lower specificity or sensitivity, and most importantly, “see-and-treat” is impossible for these infected women. Advances in technology, such as antigen detection by immunoassay and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), have achieved major progress in the diagnosis of gonorrhea, because of their accuracy, convenience and time-saving aspects. However, NAATs are expensive, making their acceptance impossible in developing countries. Detection of pathogens including N. gonorrheae using microarray chips is viewed as a possible solution, because it is a relatively rapid, easy, inexpensive and sensitive tool, which makes an “identify-and-treat” or point-of-care policy possible. A rapid and affordable tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of gonorrhea in developing countries is still not available at the time of writing. To make a point-of-care policy possible, advanced technology for aiding diagnosis of gonorrhea is encouraged and appreciated...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the haematological parameters {{and assess the}} comparatively mild, moderate and severe effects of trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis on local dog breeds. Methods: Diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was based on clinical signs and presence of Trypanosoma congolense in wet mount of infected animals. Diagnosis of ancylostomiasis was based on clinical signs and presence of Ancylostoma caninum eggs in fecal samples. Fecal samples were examined using modified McMaster technique. Haematological parameters assessed were packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration (HbC), total leucocyte counts and differential leucocyte counts. Results: The severity of anaemia produced was graded into mild, moderate and severe. The infected dogs with mild trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis had slightly elevated temperatures. Other symptoms observed included dullness, depression, muscular weakness and pale mucous membranes. The infected dogs with mild ancylostomiasis also showed anorexia. The mean PCV and HbC values for mild infections with T. congolense and A. caninum were significantly (P < 0. 05) {{lower than those of}} normal dogs. The mean total WBC counts for both mild trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis were within the normal range when compared with the values for normal dogs. In all the cases of trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis, the total differential counts of monocytes were significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than the normal values. There were obvious clinical signs such as pyrexia, anaemia, enlarged lymph nodes, subcutaneous oedema and occasional <b>ophthalmitis</b> for most of the dogs with severe trypanosomiasis. The mean PCV and HbC values of severe trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis were significantly lower than the normal values and also lower than all other cases of the disease condition. Anaemia was associated with both disease conditions but more severe in acute cases of trypanosomiasis. Conclusions: This study shows that dogs in this area are at risk of trypanosome infection all the year round, although the incidence of infection is the highest during the rainy season. Understanding on the causes of the changes in the composition of the blood in mixed infections of trypanosomiasis and ancylostomiasis is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Objects: Chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis) is {{a common}} sexually {{transmitted}} infection that places a heavy burden on women and neonatal health. To avoid severe sequelae such as female infertility, ectopic pregnancy, neonatal infection, such as <b>ophthalmitis,</b> and chronic pelvic pain prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment seems the best policy in treating this group of patients. However, adequate treatment is not easy because many factors can interfere with an early and rapid identification of Chlamydia infection, including complicated mixed microflora of the vagina and cervix, a nonuser-friendly detection system, and the time required for identification, even with the combination of specific complaints and {{a high level of}} clinical alertness. When dealing with a female patient in a point-of-care (POC) clinic, we need to find the best strategy to provide {{the most efficient way to}} detect this infection. Materials and Methods: Totally five traditional methods and advanced technologies used for the diagnosis of Chlamydia infection in women were reviewed. A criterion proposed by World Health Organization with an acronym of ASSURED, representing affordable price, high sensitivity, high specificity, user-friendly design, rapid process, minimal equipment, and delivered-or-not, was used to reexamine these tools if they are the best tools. A multiplexed microchip-based immunoassay was evaluated as a potential tool. The ASSURED score was compared and a Chi-square test with a p value less than 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Traditional methods, such as symptoms approach, microscopic examination, and microorganism culture that have been broadly used once, are affordable, simple, and equipment-free but their relatively low sensitivity and specificity limit their use as a test of POC setting for these infected women. On the other hand, advanced technologies, such as antigen detection by immunoassay and nucleic acid amplification tests, have contributed to major progress in the diagnosis of Chlamydia because of its accuracy, convenience, and time saving. However, nucleic acid amplification tests are too expensive, so they cannot be accepted as a screening tool in a developing country. The only significant finding with p value less than 0. 01 was achieved when a more sensitive immunoassay system developed successfully as a test of POC setting. Conclusions: Eventually, advances in laboratory techniques will satisfy our needs to detect Chlamydia infection economically and instantly. Microarray chips might be a relatively rapid, easy, inexpensive, and sensitive tool to detect many pathogens, including Chlamydia, using a one-time vaginal sampling process, which might make a POC policy possible...|$|E
