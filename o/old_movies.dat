5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch <b>old</b> <b>movies,</b> such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
25|$|While not recording, {{the band}} members at times ventured onto The Strip, but they also {{made an effort to}} {{experience}} Las Vegas as locals rather than merely a tourist destination. Howling Bells believed that their Las Vegas surroundings infused the spirit and the ambience of the desert and very much affected the outcome of the music. They spent time jamming on Doors and John Lennon songs, whereupon Stoermer joined them, sometimes filling in on drums. Stoermer also brought his collection of Hitchcock and cult films into the studio late at night and entertained the band with the <b>old</b> <b>movies.</b>|$|E
25|$|CNBC had its {{beginnings}} around 1980 as the Satellite Program Network (SPN), showing a low-budget mix of <b>old</b> <b>movies,</b> instructional and entertainment programs. The channel later {{changed its name}} to Tempo Television. After initially signing a letter of intent to acquire Tempo, NBC eventually opted for a deal to lease the channel's transponder in June 1988. On this platform, and under the guidance of Tom Rogers, the channel was relaunched on April 17, 1989 as the Consumer News and Business Channel. NBC and Cablevision initially operated CNBC as a 50-50 joint venture, choosing to headquarter the channel in Fort Lee, New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|In April 1969, Garroway {{launched}} a daytime talk show on WNAC-TV, Tempo Boston, which {{he hoped would}} be picked up for national syndication. Stations in New York and Philadelphia agreed {{to pick up the}} show, but by early 1970, the small-scale syndication ended and Tempo was cancelled. The show had promise, but management instead decided to fill its time slot with <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> instead of more expensive local programming. After leaving the Boston airwaves, Garroway traveled to southern California, hosting a music-and-talk show on KFI radio in Los Angeles. He planned to reenter the television world with a CBS summer replacement show, Newcomers, but the show never made it past the summer of 1971. While in Los Angeles, Garroway began to take acting workshops; he had a role in an episode of the western series Alias Smith and Jones as a judge in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Rosa {{was exposed}} to comics {{at a very young}} age, as his 11-years-older sister was a comics hoarder, and had {{thousands}} of comics for Don to look at and later read. Rosa began drawing comics before being able to write. Until he attended Saint Xavier High School in Louisville, Kentucky, his featured characters were a large cast of stick figures featured in comedy-adventures like the Barks comics and <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> Rosa enjoyed most. He never tried to draw more than stick figures, because the drawings, for him, were illustrations to get the story told. Only the story was important to him, not the actual drawings. His favorite comic books growing up were Uncle Scrooge by Western Publishing and Little Lulu comics from Dell Comics (Western Publishing), and his sister's collection of MAD comics and magazines. When he was 12 years old he also discovered and enjoyed the Superman titles by DC Comics of the editor Mort Weisinger period, drawn mostly by his favorite Superman artists Curt Swan and Kurt Schaffenberger. Shortly after starting to collect Superman comics he started to trade the collection of his older sister for Superman Comics. Since a comic book shop in his area traded two old comics for one new, he only had two Duck comics left from his sister's collection by the 1970s, one of them being The Golden Helmet. When he became a serious collector of older comics, he particularly enjoyed the classic E.C. horror and science fiction comics of the 1950s, Will Eisner's The Spirit, Walt Kelly's Pogo, and most comics of the 1940s onward.|$|E
500|$|... "Abie Baby" [...] {{is part of}} the Act 2 [...] "trip" [...] sequence: four African witch doctors, {{who have}} just killed various American historical, {{cultural}} and fictional characters, sing the praises of Abraham Lincoln, portrayed by a black female tribe member, whom they decide not to kill. The first part of the song contains stereotypical language that black characters used in <b>old</b> <b>movies,</b> like [...] "I's finished ... pluckin' y'all's chickens" [...] and [...] "I's free now thanks to y'all, Master Lincoln". [...] The Lincoln character then recites a modernized version of the Gettysburg Address, while a white female tribe member polishes Lincoln's shoes with her blond hair.|$|E

Wireds Chris Kohler wrote that [...] "Oxenfree shows some smart {{thinking about the}} relationship between games and players," [...] and that as Night School's first game, it was an [...] "auspicious debut." [...] Destructoids Nic Rowen praised the game for taking inspiration from <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> but still being [...] "anything but generic"; [...] "It dials into its own style and mood, tapping into something very heartfelt and special. It might just be the best 'horror' game I've played in years," [...] he wrote. A less enthusiastic review was offered by Allegra Frank for Polygon, who wrote that despite offering many promising attributes, [...] "I finished Oxenfree with my mouth agape, feeling wholly unsatisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|Ocean {{recorded}} his vocals alone for several months, striving intensively for high performance standards, before rejoining Malay for the album's production. Ocean produced most of Channel Orange and was assisted by Malay, who also played guitar, bass, keyboards, and brass instruments. He described his own contributions as [...] "behind the scenes" [...] to Ocean's [...] "diligent" [...] work ethic. Ocean wanted to experiment sonically and approach song structure differently {{than he had}} before. For inspiration, he and Malay listened to older records to either use as musical references or set a mood at the studio, listening to music by Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Sly and the Family Stone, Pink Floyd, and Jimi Hendrix. They also put up posters of Pink Floyd and Bruce Lee, and projected inaudible <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> in the studio's background.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several special effects. The stab {{wounds that}} were on Fellig's back were constructed in [...] "precisely graduated sizes" [...] to show Fellig's healing powers. The faux-wounds were then applied to Lewis' back by make-up department head Cheri Montesanto-Mecalf. The hardest digital effect to create was the transformation of select figures from color into black-and-white. Visual effects producer Bill Millar noted that the process, was [...] "very {{similar to the one}} used to wreck all those <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> by colorizing them. In fact, it's basically the same, only in reverse". The [...] "painstaking" [...] process involved outlining the portion of the frame to be de-colorized. A computer program was then used to complete the job. Millar, who had previously used the technique on the NBC series Nightmare Cafe in 1992, had used it in the 1998 movie Pleasantville.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} grown in popularity. Murray Burnett called it [...] "true yesterday, true today, true tomorrow". By 1955, the film had brought in $6.8 million, making it the third most {{successful}} of Warners' wartime movies (behind Shine On, Harvest Moon and This Is the Army). On April 21, 1957, the Brattle Theater of Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed the film {{as part of a}} season of <b>old</b> <b>movies.</b> It was so popular that it began a tradition of screening Casablanca during the week of final exams at Harvard University, which continues to the present day. Other colleges have adopted the tradition. Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology who had attended one of these screenings, has said that the experience was [...] "the acting out of my own personal rite of passage". The tradition helped the movie remain popular while other films famous in the 1940s have faded from popular memory. By 1977, Casablanca was the most frequently broadcast film on American television.|$|E
500|$|The {{critics who}} {{did not like the}} film were not amused by the film's graphic and comical violence, with Larry Ratliff of San Antonio Express-News noting that [...] "this ambitious, {{scratched}} and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on the senses." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle awarded the film a high rating, but noted that [...] "the Rodriguez segment is terrific; the Tarantino one long-winded and juvenile." [...] Others considered Death Proof to be a deeper and more noteworthy segment. Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "t a certain point in Death Proof the scratches and bad splices disappear, and you find yourself watching not an arch, clever pastiche of <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> and movie theaters but an actual movie." [...] Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert was divided. He gave Grindhouse as a whole {{two and a half stars}} out of four, awarding Planet Terror two stars and Death Proof three stars. Ebert also noted the irony of grindhouse films largely being superseded by many big-budget R-rated mainstream films that included a great deal of nudity and graphic violence.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{television}} commercials are compressed heavily (typically to a dynamic range {{of no more}} than 3dB) to achieve near-maximum perceived loudness while staying within permissible limits. This is the explanation for a problem that TV viewers and listeners have noticed for years: [...] While commercials receive heavy compression {{for the same reason that}} radio broadcasters have traditionally used it (to achieve a [...] "loud" [...] audio image), TV program material, particularly <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> with soft dialogue, is comparatively uncompressed by TV stations. This results in commercials seeming to be much louder than the television programs.|$|E

2500|$|Both <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> {{and music}} {{inspired}} {{several of the}} show's character names as developed by Hodgson. The show's name came from the promotional phrase [...] "Mystery Scientist" [...] used by magician Harlan Tarbell and a play on the name of Sun Ra's band, the Myth Science Arkestra. The [...] "3000" [...] was added to spoof the common practice of adding [...] "2000" [...] to show and product names {{in light of the}} upcoming 21st century, and Hodgson thought it would set his show apart to make it [...] "3000". Dr. Forrester was named after the main character of The War of the Worlds. The Satellite of Love was named after the song of the same name by Lou Reed. Crow T. Robot was inspired by the song [...] "Crow" [...] from Jim Carroll's Catholic Boy, while Rocket Number 9's name was inspired by the original name of Sun Ra's album Interstellar Low Ways.|$|E

These are interspersed with shots of Del Rey singing, which she filmed herself using a webcam. When asked if she would change anything about the video's production, Del Rey stated, [...] "Had I known {{so many people were}} going to watch the video, I'd have put some more effort into it. I would have got my hair and make-up done and tried not to be so pouty, seeing as everyone talks about my face all the time. And I'd have put more of a storyline into it." [...] The singer also revealed that she was [...] "trying to look smart and well turned-out, rather than 'sexy' [...] Of course I wanted to look good, but 'smart' was the primary focus." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before Frankie Manning visited Sweden, The Rhythm Hot Shots {{had learned}} how to Lindy Hop by {{watching}} <b>old</b> <b>movies</b> in slow motion, such as Hellzapoppin' and A Day at the Races. [...] They would spend four hours watching a film clip on TV just to learn one or two dance steps. [...] They trained together intensively six days a week for several hours. [...] When Frankie Manning visited Sweden in 1987, he stayed for two weeks. [...] At that time, Lena had left the dance company and Ewa Staremo partnered Anders. [...] Since two members of TRHS now had first names that were pronounced the same way – Eva Lagerqvist and Ewa Staremo – Frankie nicknamed Ewa Staremo [...] "W" [...] to quickly differentiate the two. [...] The members of TRHS had regular day jobs so {{during the first week of}} Frankie's visit, they met after work at around 16:00 or 17:00 and worked together for four to five hours every night. [...] During the second week, they moved to Herräng, where the Swedish Swing Society had been holding a small dance camp, the Herräng Dance Camp, since 1982. [...] They stayed and practiced in Folkets Hus, the community center in Herräng. [...] During those two weeks, TRHS learned for the first time how to social dance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{station was}} then sold to FM radio pioneer James Gabbert (who {{previously}} owned popular music station KIOI (101.3 FM), who {{returned it to}} the air on October 6, 1980, as KTZO (which stood for Television 20, the Z being construed as a numeral 2), with a dramatically upgraded general entertainment format, featuring off-network drama shows, sitcoms, <b>old</b> <b>movies,</b> rejected CBS and NBC shows preempted by KPIX-TV (channel 5) and KRON-TV (channel 4), music videos, and religious shows. But unlike its independent competitors in that time, KTVU (channel 2, now a Fox owned-and-operated station), KICU-TV (channel 36) and KBHK (channel 44, now CW station KBCW), a majority of KTZO's programming lineup at most consisted of low-budget programs, which continued into its early years as KOFY. Most memorable were the station identification breaks featuring pets, usually dogs, of Bay Area viewers that would look on cue at a television screen showing the station's logo. In fact, these proved to be immensely popular—so much so that KTZO/KOFY would often work together with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals by displaying pets that could be adopted, along with a phone number to call with the pet's name on screen. These IDs were retired in 1998, having aired alongside [...] "official" [...] WB-issued KOFY IDs {{for the first three}} years of the network's existence.|$|E
