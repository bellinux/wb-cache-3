5|$|For the {{supporting}} roles, Zarina Wahab was cast as Suhasini Chauhan, Vijay's mother; a role originally played by Rohini Hattangadi. Wahab {{agreed to do}} the film, due to her close association with producer, Johar. For the role of Shiksha Chauhan, newcomer Kanika Tiwri was auditioned and cast among 6500 girls. In order to feature an item number in the film, producer Johar wanted to sign Kareena Kapoor, who refused the offer and Katrina Kaif was eventually contracted. Filming for the song was demanding on Kaif, as she ended up with cuts and blisters <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> due to the long, stretched-out schedules.|$|E
5|$|The female {{relies on}} her hind feet for digging. She may {{accumulate}} so much sand and mud <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> that her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. To lighten her labors, she lubricates {{the area with}} her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take fourhours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> or other debris, {{such as the}} sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The blood on her nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E

The crowd at the concert is seen singing along with the band. The video continually cuts the singer walking through Brooklyn in a dark dress and makeup. She walks through a train station, streets and the Brooklyn Bridge. During the bridge of the song, Lee runs through the Brooklyn Bridge and jumps on the other side, landing <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> At the end of the video, the band meet up and walk to the beach where they walk into the sea.

5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of several {{residents}} on the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) has encouraged a stripper Robin Gallagher (Julie Benz) to quit her job and turn her life around. Susan invited Robin to move into her house until she gets back <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital after suffering a mental breakdown stemming from the breakup of her relationship with Mike Delfino (James Denton), who has since married Susan. Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan) has recently learned that his wife, Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross), {{was having an affair with}} Susan's ex-husband Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi). Orson has been using a wheelchair since Christmas, as a result of a small passenger plane crash landing into a building he and Karl were inside; Karl died as a result of the accident. Angie (Drea de Matteo) and Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling) recently moved onto Wisteria Lane to escape circumstances that are yet to be fully explained; however, Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) overheard the Bolens arguing about their circumstances, and have grown concerned about their niece Ana (Maiara Walsh) dating the Bolens' son, Danny (Beau Mirchoff).|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, the activist announces that the kulaks will be exterminated as a class, {{and then their}} bodies will be sent down the river on a {{makeshift}} raft. Many peasants were expecting this to happen and stopped taking care of themselves long ago. One woman, for instance, is alive only to the pain she feels when stray dogs chew <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> Others rip their plants {{out of the ground}} by the roots, refusing to let their property be taken into collectivization. The rest of the peasants spend the night involuntarily vomiting.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, it was {{reported}} that one of the former female gladiators from the series named Storm (Debbie Clark) and her 10-year-old son Crayton have both been homeless in San Diego {{for more than two years}} after fleeing from a domestic violence situation in South Carolina. In addition, Clark was also in serious pain from knee injuries and has to deal with her son's food allergies and ADHD. However, it was later reported that Sherri Shepherd, host of The View, has helped get back <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> by promising to pay six months of her rent, gas and electric cost.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} said that the small figurine was the only {{preserved}} statue of Khufu. This is not quite correct. Excavations at Saqqara in 2001 and 2003 revealed a pair of terracotta statues depicting a lion goddess (possibly Bastet or Sakhmet). <b>On</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> two figures of childlike kings are preserved. While the right figurine can be identified as king Khufu by his Horus name, the left one depicts king Pepy I of 6th dynasty, called by his birth name. It {{is obvious that the}} figurines of Pepy were added to the statue groups in later times, because they were placed separately and at a distance from the deity. This is inconsistent with a typical statue group of the Old Kingdom—normally all statue groups were built as an artistic unit. Both statue groups are worked out similarly to each other (both have the same size and scale), {{the only difference is that}} one lion goddess holds a scepter. The excavators point out that the statues were restored during the Middle Kingdom, after they were broken apart. However, it seems that the reason for a restoration lay more in an interest for the goddess, than for a royal cult around the king figures: their names were covered with gypsum.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{also argued}} {{that people who have}} carried out {{so-called}} [...] "altruistic" [...] killings have been known to engage in ritualistic behaviour before killing themselves, and that Sheila might have placed the silencer in the cupboard, changed her clothes and washed herself, which would explain why there was little lead on her hands, or sugar from the floor <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> There was also a possibility that the blood in the silencer was not hers, but was a mixture of Nevill's and June's.|$|E
500|$|According to French film {{historian}} Yves Thoraval, the film's {{theme is}} [...] "the Oedipal possessiveness of a married brother for his younger sister". Ramachandran notes that like {{the characters in}} Bairavi (1978), Kali and his sister have abusive parents in childhood and {{he is responsible for}} his sister's welfare. Unlike Bairavi, the siblings in Mullum Malarum are not separated; this leads Kali's protectiveness of Valli to the brink of obsession. In one scene, after he violently berates her during the day, he puts henna <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> at night while she is asleep.|$|E

As they set off to take Angela's things to Oscar's place, Angela breaks down into tears, saying [...] "I love him."

500|$|Decorating of the Bride [...] ( [...] ; [...] ) {{measures}} [...] The {{painting is}} set in an impoverished 19th-century ethnic Albanian household. It shows {{the women of the}} family adorning a young bride. The jewelry that the bride is supposed to wear at her wedding is taken from an old wooden chest that {{can be seen in the}} left-hand corner and is temporarily set against a copper tray beside her. Immediately next to the chest, a little girl holds another copper tray, which also contains several items of jewelry. Two elderly women attend to the bride. To the far right, young maidens fashion a garland of fresh flowers and joyfully whisper to one another. The room in which the women have gathered is sparsely furnished, with a low ceiling, well worn carpet and plain plastered walls. The bride wears traditional garb, with a gold necklace around her neck and delicately embroidered slippers <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> The artist's signature, Germanicized as P. Joanowitch, can be seen at the bottom right.|$|E
500|$|In early 1922, Lloyd {{moved in}} with her sister Daisy to save money. On 4 October, against her doctor's advice, she {{appeared}} at the Empire Music Hall in Edmonton, North London, where she sang [...] "I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit". [...] Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> eventually falling over on stage. [...] Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that it was all part of the act. [...] A week later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps. [...] She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure three days later, aged 52. [...] More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at Hampstead Cemetery on 12October 1922. [...] Lloyd was penniless {{at the time of her}} death and her estate, which was worth £7,334, helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.|$|E
500|$|Toyah {{was aware}} that her {{attacker}} knew her as she remembered him calling her name, but could not put a name to the voice. She also struggled {{to deal with her}} [...] "physical and emotional scars" [...] and soon developed agoraphobia. Toyah found support from her mother and neighbour Charlie Ramsden (Clare McGlinn), who revealed that she had once been raped. Taylor told Inside Soap's Allison Maund that Charlie's advice really helped Toyah to start getting back <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> However, the process was hampered when Toyah received an anonymous phone call, which left her feeling [...] "extremely frightened". The phone call sparked [...] "a terrifying event" [...] in which Toyah's rapist was finally revealed to be her friend Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam). When Phil came round to comfort Toyah, she recognised his voice as he called out her name and realised that he was her rapist. While Toyah tried to escape, Phil grabbed her and held her hostage. Toyah's screams were heard by Peter, who broke the door down and knocked Phil unconscious. A show spokesperson commented that Toyah would be left to worry about whether Phil would deny the rape and be convicted.|$|E

500|$|In the lyrics, Lo compares {{falling in}} love to being under the {{influence}} of drugs. Regarding the track's composition, she stated that [...] "all of the verses are drug references. It is comparing a high to being in love, which I think can be kind of the same thing". According to Scandipop, the artist is saying in the lyrics that [...] "no – she's not on drugs, it's all that amazing love she's in which is making her so high". Carrie Battan of Pitchfork wrote that Lo insists [...] "she's back <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and reaching for the stars—she's not on drugs, she's just in love" [...] in the verse, [...] "I'm up with the kites in a dream so blue / I live in the sky / You come live here, too". The line, [...] "I'm queen of the clouds, make my wish come true" [...] served as the inspiration for the title of the singer's debut album. Both Tim Jonze of The Guardian and Jamieson Cox of Time noted that the track's message contrasted that of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", in which the artist sings about using drugs in order to forget her former boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|The Queen {{was also}} the first {{character}} to meet death in a Disney film. As part of elimination of the original story's more gruesome aspects, and to make Snow White seem more a [...] "nice girl", the Wicked Queen is no longer cannibalistic and her destruction was made [...] "just as certain but more merciful" [...] than in the original story, where she is forced to dance to her death in red-hot iron shoes <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> as an invited guest at Snow White's wedding. Snow White's role in the Queen's demise is removed, and the Queen [...] "dies more neatly and quickly," [...] as justice is served without resorting to killing or torture. She also invites her own downfall while pushing the boulder, and her fate is only suggested rather than shown. One of the Witch's animators was Ward Kimball, whom Walt Disney also let to draw the two vultures watching her fall [...] "to make it a little easier" [...] for him, as Kimball has been reassigned after his own sequence was cut from the film, since Disney thought these additional dwarfs gag scenes would distract from [...] "the real drama" [...] of the tension between Snow White and her wicked stepmother that was supposed to drive the film.|$|E

Naomi's first scenes saw her meeting and flirting with Paul Robinson (Dennis), who was later {{surprised to learn that}} she was Sheila's daughter. She then reunited with her mother and her nephew Kyle (Chris Milligan). While Sheila was pleased to see her daughter, she was suspicious of her motives and sudden urge to see her. Mann commented, [...] "Sheila has learned the hard way that there is always an agenda with Naomi. Nothing is ever as it seems." [...] When Sheila found a discarded SIM card, she hoped to find some clues as to why her daughter has reappeared in her life. After seeing a lot of number and messages stored on the card, Sheila believed Naomi was having another affair. She then accused Naomi of repeating her past mistakes and [...] "a fierce war of words" [...] erupted between the two, which resulted in Naomi deciding to leave. Sheila then promised not to interfere in her life and [...] "reluctantly" [...] offered Naomi a place to stay, until she got back <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
