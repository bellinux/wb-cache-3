5|$|Before his death, Dr. Butterfly drains {{the energy}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>at</b> Kazuki's school to heal and revive Victor, a being {{superior}} to humans and homunculi. Victor is confronted by Kazuki, but Victor {{is not interested}} in fighting and leaves. During the battle, however, Kazuki's kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor's—a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the philosopher's stone. The black kakugane absorbs human life forces; to prevent this from happening, Kazuki's death is ordered by the Alchemist Army. Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki, but Tokiko finds him alive. A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki's death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former protégé of Tokiko's) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki's death is postponed because, as the Alchemists' leader explains, their top priority is to defeat Victor.|$|E

25|$|Education in primary-schools serving Xhosa-speaking {{communities}} is conducted in isiXhosa, {{but this is}} replaced by English after the early primary grades.

Rhodes University in Grahamstown, additionally, offers courses in isiXhosa for both mother-tongue and non-mother-tongue speakers. These courses both include a cultural studies component.

25|$|The {{appointment}} at the Mint while not a sinecure as such afforded Atkinson {{a considerable amount}} of free time to pursue more academic pursuits. He published a ‘free’ translation of the poem Soohrab an extract from the Sha Nameh by the Persian poet Firdausi in 1814; Hatim Ta’ee, an old romance in the Persian language in 1818 for the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>at</b> Fort William College where he held the Deputy Chair of Persian for that year; in 1819 The Aubid an eastern tale and in 1824 The City of Palaces, a collection of poems, the title of which became the epithet for Calcutta during the period of British rule.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>at</b> colleges such {{as those}} in Sárospatak and Székelyudvarhely were minor nobles from rural areas who brought with them their {{regional}} styles of music. Whilst the choirs in these colleges adopted a more polyphonic style, the students' songbooks indicate a growth in the popularity of homophonic songs. Their notation, however, was relatively crude and no extensive collection appeared until the publication of Ádám Pálóczi Horváth’s Ötödfélszáz Énekek in 1853. These songs indicate that during the mid to late 18th century the previous Hungarian song styles died out and musicians looked more to other (Western) European styles for influence.|$|E

500|$|At {{his young}} age, Middleton was {{required}} to complete a year of preparatory school before being enrolled in the four-year program at Mississippi A In essence he did a final {{year of high school}} while living in the dormitory and following the regimen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>at</b> the college. [...] The students were treated like cadets at a military academy, marching to and from all meals, and beginning their day with the first bugle call at 5:30a.m. Every week day was the same: cleanup and study time in the morning, march to breakfast, a usually short chapel call, classes from 8:30 to 4:00, broken only by lunch, athletics from 4:00 to 6:30p.m., dinner, and then study from 7:30 to 10:00p.m., followed by the playing of taps at 10:30, and lights out at 10:40. While Middleton did not particularly savor the military atmosphere, he settled into the routine, and the year passed quickly. [...] The highlight of his preparatory year came on 10 February 1905 when John Philip Sousa brought his band to A, attracting people from around the state, and packing the 2000-seat mess hall. The train that would take the band to its next stop was held up for over an hour as the concert was extended by repeated calls for encores.|$|E
