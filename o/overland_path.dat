They continued downstream and encountered a large Indian village where they stopped to build a fort he named Fort Crèvecoeur.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Software tools {{have been}} {{developed}} at the U. S. Geological Survey’s EROS Data Center to extract topographic structure and to delineate watersheds and <b>overland</b> flow <b>paths</b> from digital elevation models. The tools are special purpose FORTRAN programs interfaced with general-purpose raster and vector spatial analysis and relational data base management packages. The first phase of analysis is a conditioning phase that generates three data sets: the original DEM with depressions filled, a data set indicating the flow direction for each cell, and a flow accumulation data set in which each cell receives a value equal {{to the number of}} cells that drain to it. The original DEM and these three derivative data sets can then be processed {{in a variety of ways}} to optionally delineate drainage networks, <b>overland</b> <b>paths,</b> watersheds for user-specified locations, sub-watersheds for the major tributaries of a drainage network, or pour point linkages between watersheds. The computer-generated drainage lines and watershed polygons and the pour point linkage information can be transferred to vector-based geographic information systems for further analysis. Comparisons between these computer generated features and their manually delineated counterparts generally show close agreement, indicating that these software tools will save analyst time spent in manual interpretation and digitizing...|$|R

40|$|The isotope {{signatures}} {{registered in}} speleothems during tropical cyclones (TC) provides {{information about the}} frequency and intensity of past TCs but the precise relationship between isotopic composition and the meteorology of TCs remain uncertain. Here we present continuous δ 18 O and δ 2 H data in rainfall and water vapour, {{as well as in}} discrete rainfall samples, during the passage of TC Ita and relate the evolution in isotopic compositions to local and synoptic scale meteorological observations. High-resolution data revealed a close relationship between isotopic compositions and cyclonic features such as spiral rainbands, periods of stratiform rainfall and the arrival of subtropical and tropical air masses with changing oceanic and continental moisture sources. The isotopic compositions in discrete rainfall samples were remarkably constant along the ~ 450 km <b>overland</b> <b>path</b> of the cyclone when taking into account the direction and distance to the eye of the cyclone at each sampling time. Near simultaneous variations in δ 18 O and δ 2 H values in rainfall and vapour and a near-equilibrium rainfall-vapour isotope fractionation indicates strong isotopic exchange between rainfall and surface inflow of vapour during the approach of the cyclone. In contrast, after the passage of spiral rainbands close to the eye of the cyclone, different moisture sources for rainfall and vapour are reflected in diverging d-excess values. High-resolution isotope studies of modern TCs refine the interpretation of stable isotope signatures found in speleothems and other paleo archives and should aim to further investigate the influence of cyclone intensity and longevity on the isotopic composition of associated rainfall...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} study, {{based on}} an {{in-depth}} study of coeval references, is {{the analysis of the}} crossing of the Crusade legions, in 1096, through the Hungarian Reign to the borders of the Byzantine Empire. The Hungarian Reign, when the crossing studied occurred, was governed by Coloman I, who had recently gained power a few months before. Taking into account the following events of the Crusade, we focus on the Lorraine Legion, headed by the duke of Lower Lorraine, Godefroy de Bouillon and the diplomatic relations that developed between the French-Flemish noble élite and the Hungarian Court. The “Call” for the Crusade by Pope Urban II at Clermont in 1095, created great enthusiasm all over Christian Europe. This caused not only unorganized masses to react positively, but also many feudal armies to move towards Palestine. The scope of the Crusade movement, besides supporting Byzantium against the Turks, was mainly the setting-free of the Holy Sepulchre of Christ and of the Holy City of Jerusalem, under Islamic domination from the 7 th century. Among the many possible paths to travel, many Crusaders made use of the <b>overland</b> <b>path,</b> across the Balkans. This path, which used the Route of the Roman Danubian Limes, had been abandoned centuries before due to the many invasions which had occurred on the peninsula between the end of the 4 th century and the 10 th century.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to improve existing and develop new DEM enhancement methods and DEM-based overland flow delineation methods in order to generate reliable overland flow networks. These networks {{can be used in}} conjunction with existing urban drainage modelling methodologies in order to improve surface flooding simulation results. The objective has been achieved by: developing new methods to merge DEMs; evaluating nad improving available DEM enhancement methods; improving methods to solve DEM flat area problems, and developing novel methods to improve <b>overland</b> flow <b>path</b> delineation. All improvements and new developments have been adapted to the specific characteristics of high-resolution DEMs and urban catchments. The experimental work undertaken in Lisbon, together with two case-studies in the UK, was used to validate the concepts proposed in this thesis. It is concluded that DEM enhancement methods can be used to improve DEMs for overland flow delineation, thereby enhancing the reliability of urban flood modelling. The advanced flow path delineation methods developed here produce more reliable results than conventional <b>overland</b> flow <b>path</b> delineation methods. The hydraulic simulation results obtained confirm the advantages of applying 1 D/ 1 D modelling to simulate urban flood events. However, the findings show that the use of these methods needs to be preceded by a thorough analysis and quantification of Dem surface characteristics, and by a detailed calibration and validation procedure. Independent testing carried out by UKWIR has proved the adequacy and reliability of the developed methodology in full scale flood risk mapping applications.

The algorithms incorporated into TERRAIN have been used at two different geographic scales: first for small research watersheds where surface wetness measurements are made, and second for regional water modeling for entire counties. For small areas methods based on flow distribution may be more desirable, especially if time-dependent flow models are to be used. The main improvement in TERRAIN compared with earlier programs on which it is based is that it combines the conditioning routines, which remove depressions to avoid water storage, into a single process. Efficiency has also been improved, reducing run {{times as much as}} 10 : 1 and enabling the processing of very large grids in strips for regional modeling. Additionally, the ability to calculate the nutrient load delivered any cell in a watershed has been added. These improvements make TERRAIN a powerful tool for modeling surface flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{stochastic}} runoff-runon process models {{the volume}} of infiltration excess runoff from a hillslope via the <b>overland</b> flow <b>path.</b> Spatial variability is represented in the model by the spatial distribution of rainfall and infiltration, and their “correlation scale”, that is, the scale at which the spatial correlation of rainfall and infiltration become negligible. Notably, the process can produce runoff even when the mean rainfall rate {{is less than the}} mean infiltration rate, and it displays a gradual increase in net runoff as the rainfall rate increases. In this paper we present a number of contributions to the analysis of the stochastic runoff-runon process. Firstly we illustrate the suitability of the process by fitting it to experimental data. Next we extend previous asymptotic analyses to include the cases where the mean rainfall rate equals or exceeds the mean infiltration rate, and then use Monte Carlo simulation to explore the range of parameters for which the asymptotic limit gives a good approximation on finite hillslopes. Finally we use this to obtain an equation for the mean net runoff, consistent with our asymptotic results but providing an excellent approximation for finite hillslopes. Our function uses a single parameter to capture spatial variability, and varying this parameter gives us a family of curves which interpolate between known upper and lower bounds for the mean net runoff...|$|R
40|$|Grid-based digital {{elevation}} models (DEMs) {{are used to}} simulate <b>overland</b> flow <b>paths</b> in hydrological models. The accuracy of these drainage patterns are dependent upon how well the DEM represents the terrain features that control runoff patterns. Often regional DEMs are not produced at scales small enough to represent rural infrastructure. The scale of runoff patterns that can be accurately modeled is, therefore, restricted, particularly when the terrain is relatively flat. The RIDEM (Rural Infrastructure Digital Elevation Model) model is presented that utilizes commonly available ancillary data to downscale grid-based runoff patterns. The resulting drainage patterns reflect drainage modifications imposed by rural infrastructure including: roads, ditches, culverts, and irrigation canals. Downscaling runoff patterns enables the completion of runoff studies at smaller scales. The model was implemented within the Oldman River watershed, Alberta, Canada to determine the spatial patterns of potential runoff contributing areas in three agricultural watersheds regularly contaminated by pathogens. ii Acknowledgements I would like to extend my appreciation to Dr. Stefan Kienzle for giving {{me the opportunity to}} expand my horizons and for his support, expertise, and encouragement during this process.

Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) typically {{form the basis of}} such a discretization. HRUs are generally obtained by intersecting raster or vector layers of land uses, soil types, geology and sub-catchments. Polylines maps representing ditches and river drainage networks can also be used.

Thus, a pre-processing is needed to improve the mesh in order to avoid negative effects on the performance of the hydrological model. This paper proposes computer-assisted mesh generation tools to obtain a more regular and physically meaningful mesh of HRUs suitable for hydrologic modelling.

40|$|Pluvial {{flooding}} is {{a problem}} in many cities and for city planning purpose the mechanisms behind pluvial flooding are of interest. Previous studies seldom use insurance claim data to analyse city scale characteristics that lead to flooding. In the present study, two long time series (∼ 20 years) of flood claims from property owners have been collected and analysed in detail to investigate the mechanisms and characteristics leading to urban flooding. The flood claim data come from the municipal water utility company and property owners with insurance that covers property loss from overland flooding, groundwater intrusion through basement walls and flooding from the drainage system. These data are used as a proxy for flood severity for several events in the Swedish city of Malmö. It is discussed which rainfall characteristics give most flooding and why some rainfall events do not lead to severe flooding, how city scale topography and sewerage system type influence spatial distribution of flood claims, and which impact high sea level has on flooding in Malmö. Three severe flood events are described in detail and compared with a number of smaller flood events. It was found that the main mechanisms and characteristics of flood extent and its spatial distribution in Malmö are intensity and spatial distribution of rainfall, distance to the main sewer system as well as <b>overland</b> flow <b>paths,</b> and type of drainage system, while high sea level has little impact on the flood extent.

Two field experiments were conducted to investigate this, one looking at whether sediment is entrained from different points {{along the length of the}} tramline and one looking at the area over which sediment is entrained from either side of a tramline. Results from leaching tests and rainfall simulations clearly demonstrated the potential of this method for tracing sediment, there was very little movement of REOs through the soil profile and they were transported with sediment in overland flow. In the field experiment a large proportion of the sediment transported in the tramline originated within the first metre either side of it. However, the total area over which eroded sediment collects and flows into the tramline is potentially large with small amounts of sediment eroded from the between 4 and 6 m being transported in the tramline. REOs have an excellent potential for use as a tracer of soil erosion. They provide a quick and cheap method of identifying sources of eroded sediments and have good potential for use in determining erosion rates...|$|R

40|$|To relate general {{circulation}} model (GCM) hydrologic output to readily available river hydrographic data, a runoff routing scheme that routes gridded runoffs through regional- or continental-scale river drainage basins is developed. By following the basin <b>overland</b> flow <b>paths,</b> the routing model generates river discharge hydrographs {{that can be}} compared to observed river discharges, thus allowing an analysis of the GCM representation of monthly, seasonal, and annual water balances over large regions. The runoff routing model consists of two linear reservoirs, a surface reservoir and a groundwater reservoir, which store and transport water. The water transport mechanisms operating within these two reservoirs are differentiated by their time scales; the groundwater reservoir transports water much more slowly than the surface reservior. The groundwater reservior feeds the corresponding surface store, and the surface stores are connected via the river network. The routing model is implemented over the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project Mississippi River basin on a rectangular grid of 2 deg X 2. 5 deg. Two land surface hydrology parameterizations provide the gridded runoff data required to run the runoff routing scheme: the variable infiltration capacity model, and the soil moisture component of the simple biosphere model. These parameterizations are driven with 4 deg X 5 deg gridded climatological potential evapotranspiration and 1979 First Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) Global Experiment precipitation. These investigations have quantified the importance of physically realistic soil moisture holding capacities, evaporation parameters, and runoff mechanisms in land surface hydrology formulations...|$|R

These two projects strongly suggest the power that Ebenezer Howard’s (Howard, 1902) original concept of Garden City still has. Yet even a cursory inspection of the two projects and the current debate in the UK show little new, unlike the radical combination of working and living within a hybrid of garden and countryside that Howard originally advanced. This paper suggests {{a way in which}} landscape architects can frame the renewed interest in the Garden City by building on the tradition of Howard’s radical inquiry. Taking a combination of techniques from environmental planning and traditional garden making the author develops a planning methodology to demonstrate how a new new garden city might be built. The paper is illustrated by two case studies designed by the author; the design of a resort in Guangdong Province, PR China [Beixing Resort Development] and a subdivision in Auckland New Zealand.

40|$|Vegetative filters (VF) are a best {{management}} practice installed {{in many areas}} to control sediment movement to water bodies. It is commonly assumed that runoff proceeds perpendicularly across a VF as sheet flow. However, there is little research information on natural pathways of water movement and performance of field-scale VF. The objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify {{the performance of a}} VF where the flow path is not controlled by artificial borders and flow path lengths are field-scale, and (2) to develop methods to detect and quantify overland flow convergence and divergence in a VF. Our hypothesis is that flow converges and diverges in field-scale VF and that flow pathways that define flow convergence and divergence areas can be predicted using high-resolution topography (i. e., maps). Overland flow and sediment mass flow were monitored in two 13 × 15 m subareas of a 13 × 225 m grass buffer located in Polk County in east-central Nebraska. Monitoring included a high-resolution survey to 3 cm resolution, dye tracer studies to identify flow pathways, and measurement of maximum flow depths at 51 points in each subarea. Despite relatively planar topography (a result of grading for surface irrigation), there were converging and diverging areas of overland flow in the buffer subareas.

40|$|River {{catchments}} are {{an obvious}} scale for {{soil and water}} resources management, since their shape and characteristics control the pathways and fluxes of water and sediment. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are widely used to simulate <b>overland</b> water <b>paths</b> in hydrological models. However, all DEMs are approximations to some degree and it is widely recognised that their characteristics can vary according to attributes such as spatial resolution and data sources (e. g. contours, optical or radar imagery). As a consequence, {{it is important to}} assess the ‘fitness for purpose’ of different DEMs and evaluate how uncertainty in the terrain representation may propagate into hydrological derivatives. The overall aim of this research was to assess accuracies and uncertainties associated with seven different DEMs (ASTER GDEM 1, SRTM, Landform Panorama (OS 50), Landform Profile (OS 10), LandMap, NEXTMap and Bluesky DTMs) and to explore the implications of their use in hydrological analysis and catchment management applications. The research focused on the Wensum catchment in Norfolk, UK. The research initially examined the accuracy of the seven DEMs and, subsequently, a subset of these (SRTM, OS 50, OS 10, NEXTMap and Bluesky) were used to evaluate different techniques for determining an appropriate flow accumulation threshold to delineate channel networks in the study catchment. These results were then used to quantitatively compare the positional accuracy of drainage networks derived from different DEMs. The final part of the thesis conducted an assessment of soil erosion and diffuse pollution risk in the study catchment using NEXTMap and OS 50 data with SCIMAP and RUSLE modelling techniques. Findings from the research demonstrate that a number of nationally available DEMs in the UK are simply not ‘fit for purpose’ as far as local catchment management is concerned. Results indicate that DEM source and resolution have considerable influence on modelling of hydrological processes, suggesting that for a lowland catchment the availability of a high resolution DEM (5 m or better) is a prerequisite for any reliable assessment of the consequences of implementing particular land management measures. Several conclusions can be made from the research. (1) From the collection of DEMs used in this study the NEXTMap 5 m DTM was found to be the best for representing catchment topography and is likely to prove a superior product for similar applications in other lowland catchments across the UK. (2) It is important that error modelling techniques are more routinely employed by GIS users, particularly where the fitness for purpose of a data source is not well-established. (3) GIS modelling tools {{that can be used to}} test and trial alternative management options (e. g. for reducing soil erosion) are particularly helpful in simulating the effect of possible environmental improvement measures...|$|R
