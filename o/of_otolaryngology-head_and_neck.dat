40|$|Desmoid tumors (fibromatosis) {{are rare}} benign tumors, they arise from musculoaponeurotic {{structures}} throughout the body.

40|$|Microlaryngeal surgery evolved {{with the}} {{development}} of suspension laryngoscopy and binocular microscopes for enhanced visualization. Development of microla-ryngeal instrumentation followed rapidly to meet the demands <b>of</b> the <b>otolaryngology–head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> surgeon. Advancement <b>of</b> laser technology further enhanced the surgeon’s ability to sharply dissect tissue using a hands-off approach and added hemostatic capability to the cut-ting edge. Similarly, endoscopic sinus surgery has evolved with application of minimally invasive instru-mentation. The recent introduction of powered surgical instruments, combining cutting capability and suction, facilitates removal of diseased or anatomically variant tissue from sinus cavities. Powered surgical instrumentation applied to micro-laryngeal surgery and surgery of the airway, as demon-strated in this report, provides the head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> sur-geon with a novel approach for surgery of the airway. Combining telescopic video control and powered instrumentation with suspension laryngoscopy provides superior visualization and access for rapid removal of obstructing lesions and controlled excision of vocal fold pathoses...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} scar outcome of video-assisted parathyroidectomy (VAP) with {{traditional}} bilateral cervical exploration (BCE) using previously validated scar assessment scales, {{and to examine}} the feasibility of introducing VAP into a general <b>otolaryngology-head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> practice. DESIGN: A retrospective review of medical records from a prospectively obtained database of patients and long-term follow-up of scar analysis. PATIENTS: The records of 60 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy were reviewed: 29 patients underwent VAP and 31 patients underwent an open procedure with BCE. The groups were matched for age and sex. A total of 46 patients were followed up to assess scar outcome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a comparison of patient and observer scar satisfaction between VAP and traditional BCE using validated scar assessment tools: the Patient Scar Assessment Scale and the Manchester Scar Scale. The secondary outcomes were to retrospectively evaluate our results with VAP and to assess the suitability of introducing this technique into a general <b>otolaryngology-head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> practice. RESULTS: The average scar length in the VAP group was 1. 7 cm, and the average scar length in the BCE group was 4. 3 cm. The patients in the BCE group scored higher than the patients in the VAP group on the Manchester Scar Scale (P <. 01) and on the Patient and Observer Scar Scales (P =. 02), indicating a worse scar outcome. The mean operative time in the VAP group was 41 minutes compared with 115 minutes in the open procedure BCE group. There {{was no difference between}} the 2 groups in terms of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted parathyroidectomy is a safe and feasible procedure in the setting <b>of</b> a general <b>otolaryngology-head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> practice, with outcomes and complication rates that are comparable to those of traditional bilateral neck exploration. Both patient and observer analysis demonstrated that VAP was associated with a more favorable scar outcome when compared with BCE...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{clinically}} {{evaluate a}} new photosensitizer, m-tetra(hydroxyphenyl) chlorin (m-THPC), for the photodynamic therapy of early squamous cell carcinomas {{of the upper}} aerodigestive tract. DESIGN: Phase 1 included evaluation of the innocuousness of the compound after intravenous injection (control of vital parameters and blood analysis before and after injection) and evaluation of the duration of skin photosensitization. Phase 2 included assessment of optimal conditions for treatment (injected dose, drug-light interval, light dose, wavelength, etc), on 33 early squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth, esophagus, and bronchi, with a mean follow-up of 14 months; irradiation tests on healthy and neoplastic mucosae to determine the irradiation conditions that lead to tumor eradication with minimal damage to the surrounding normal mucosa and muscle layers; and localization of the dye in various tissue compartments and cells at different time intervals after the injection of the photosensitizer, by using a fluorescence microscope to analyze 46 biopsy specimens taken during the treatment sessions and 8 resected specimens of early cancers, excised with the carbon dioxide laser. SETTING: Endoscopic medical center <b>of</b> an <b>otolaryngology-head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> surgery department. PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients treated previously for a head <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> cancer with a synchronous or metachronous early second primary cancer. Patients with porphyria {{were excluded from the}} trial. RESULTS: The best results in the bronchi and mouth were obtained with an injected dose of 0. 15 mg of m-THPC per kilogram of body weight 4 days before irradiation. The fluence was 7 to 16 J/cm 2, and the fluence rate was between 100 and 150 mW/cm 2 using red light at 652 nm. In the esophagus, green light at 514 nm is preferred to the red light to avoid fistulas. Optimal irradiation conditions at this wavelength, which was also used in the trachea, were found at a fluence of 75 to 100 J/cm 2 and a fluence rate between 70 and 100 mW/cm 2. Of 33 lesions treated thus far by photodynamic therapy with m-THPC, 28 show no recurrence with a mean follow-up of 14 months. Photosensitivity to sunlight does not exceed 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: m-Tetra(hydroxyphenyl) chlorin is a second-generation photosensitizer that has several significant advantages as compared with the first-generation porphyrin mixtures hematoporphyrin derivative and porfimer sodium (Photofrin II). It is a pure compound that is 100 times more phototoxic at 652 nm and 10 times more photoxic at 514 nm, has better selectivity for early carcinomas, and a shorter duration of skin photosensitivity. The therapeutic results indicate a recurrence rate that is similar to that obtained with Photofrin II, ie, about 15...|$|R
