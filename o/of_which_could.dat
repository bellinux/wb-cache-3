5|$|As {{a result}} of the losses it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had ceased to be an {{effective}} fighting force. Following a series of raids on the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> be fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was limited by the lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Born in Spirit Lake, Iowa, Bedell {{was educated}} in Spirit Lake public schools. He {{graduated}} from Spirit Lake High School in 1939, where he earned spending money {{with a business}} {{in the midst of}} the Great Depression. His business involved braiding dog hairs around fishhooks, the result <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> be sold as fish flies. He began tying the fly-fishing lures in his bedroom, then he moved the business into his parents' basement. In time, he got space above a grocery store to continue the business full-time.|$|E

5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E
5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E
5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.|$|E

5|$|Ibrox Park, as it {{was known}} between 1899 and 1997, is almost {{completely}} different from the Ibrox Stadium of today. It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand along one side. The ground had a capacity of 40,000. Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed {{with each other to}} host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland matches, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club. To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large terracing, holding 36,000 people, behind the western goalmouth. The terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch, was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron. A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 May, the two squadrons {{encountered}} each other off the island of Heligoland, then controlled by neutral Great Britain. Tegetthoff attacked with his two frigates while the slower Prussian vessels lagged behind, unable to effectively engage the Danish warships. Tegetthoff's flagship, Schwarzenberg, bore {{the brunt of the}} Danish gunfire and caught fire three times, the last <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> not be put out quickly and forced Tegetthoff to seek shelter in the neutral waters around Heligoland. Though Denmark claimed a tactical victory in the battle, the Danes were forced to end the blockade of the German coast. An armistice came into effect three days after the Battle of Heligoland. By the time fighting broke out again in June, further Austrian warships had arrived to strengthen the Austro-Prussian naval forces, and the Danes did not seek to challenge them.|$|E
5|$|Since 1958, the Cup has {{undergone}} several minor alterations. The original collar and bowl were too brittle, and were replaced in 1963 and 1969, respectively. The modern one-piece Cup design {{was introduced in}} 1958, when the old barrel was replaced with a five-band barrel, each <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> contain 13 winning teams. Although the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial year, {{the names of the}} 1965 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13. When the bands were all filled in 1991, the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the Stanley Cup would not grow further.|$|E

5|$|Terminal 2 {{opened in}} December 1991 as the Charter/International Terminal, serving all {{international}} flights and some domestic flights to the airport. It was {{located at the}} site of two previous terminals, one for PSA Airlines and the other for American Airlines. The PSA terminal was converted to an international terminal before both terminals were demolished to make room for a single Terminal 2. It had two stories and eight gates (T2-1 through T2-8), four <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> receive international flights. Terminal 2 closed upon the opening of Terminal 3, and it was demolished in early 2016.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Giro {{featured}} {{an assortment}} of contenders for the overall victory. Defending champion Danilo Di Luca had faced potential bans which would have {{kept him out of}} the race, after investigations into his involvement with the Oil for Drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia, either <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> have resulted in a two-year suspension. Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee of any wrongdoing in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} has {{an extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million square miles), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern. In the western Palaearctic, populations are generally stable or increasing, {{but there have been}} local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of pesticides, both <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.|$|E

5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> be saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E
5|$|The draft {{order was}} {{determined}} by a coin toss, the winner <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> choose either: (a) the first overall pick in the expansion draft and the 28th, and last, pick {{in the first round}} of the 1993 MLB amateur draft; or (b) allow the other team to pick first and receive both the second and third overall expansion draft picks, the right to pick first in the subsequent rounds of the expansion draft, and the 27th, and next-to-last, overall pick in the 1993 MLB amateur draft. Colorado won the toss and chose to pick first overall.|$|E
5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} {{that global warming is}} unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to global warming.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, a {{new report}} was released stating that the Route 30 Connector project was feasible. The proposed Connector was to be one mile (1.3km) long, and would be constructed as an elevated highway above the wetlands. Construction cost was estimated at $80 million, half <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> {{be paid for by}} making the Connector a toll road. The new report also identified US 30 as an important roadway for reducing city traffic, as it carried the least amount of traffic and had the greatest capacity out of the city's three major entering highways, the other two being the Expressway and the Black Horse Pike (US 40/US 322).|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>could</b> be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E
