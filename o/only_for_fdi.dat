40|$|This paper adds a new {{dimension}} to the recent literature on relationship beween firm's heterogeneity in tfirms of total factor productivity and its dynamic exports vs. FDI decision, namely the heterogeneity of export markets. We show that higher productivity of investing firms relative to just exporters is not inevitably unifirm. Exploiting a complete set of Slovenian exporting firms in the period 1994 - 2002, we confirm the tendency of higher productivity firms to engage in FDI <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>FDI</b> conducted in high wage countries. In addition, we find no evidence in favor of either market-seeking (horizontal) or factor-seeking (vertical) motive for FDI. While survey results suggest trade-promotion motive to be just as important, we find little evidence in favor of efficiency of this strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the present paper to the literature investigating the effects of outward FDI on the home country employment and skill composition is twofold. First, by considering the “industrial region” as unit of the analysis, it allows to capture both direct and indirect effects of foreign production on the parent company’s environment. Second, by modelling separately the demand for high and low skilled workers, it allows to assess whether outward FDI can {{be held responsible for}} any skill upgrading in the home country. Empirical evidence refers to the Italian case throughout the period 1996 - 2002, and shows that outward FDI has a significant negative impact upon the demand for low skilled workers in the parent company’s “industrial region”, but this is true <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>FDI</b> in lower wage (namely, CEE) countries.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} and study a variety of dimensions {{of the relationship between}} foreign direct investment (FDI), domestic investment (DI) and economic growth in the host countries. The main purpose of this thesis is to empirically examine the implications of the relationship and complementarity between FDI and DI, and the contribution of the host country’s factors in achieving the benefits of FDI inflows. To achieve the aim and to examine the argument of this thesis, the thesis was structured to include six chapters, containing three empirical chapters. These empirical chapters studied different hypotheses of the relationship between FDI and economic growth. The first empirical chapter attempted to find the answer to these two questions: (a) does FDI contribute positively to GDP; and (b) does FDI really crowd out DI in the host countries. The second empirical chapter also tried to offer the answer to this question: does FDI contribute to economic growth in developing countries alone, or does it depend on its initial conditions? Furthermore, the third empirical chapter studies the direct impact of not only FDI but also other foreign capital inflows on economic growth, and their indirect impact on economic growth, which works via domestic investment channel. This chapter searched for the answer to this question: how do FDI and other types of foreign capital inflows affect economic growth? Chapter one presents the motivation of the thesis and sets its aim and structure. Chapter two presents a background of economic literature on the relationship between FDI, DI and economic growth. This chapter also provides a brief review of theoretical and empirical background on the interrelationship between those variables, in order to reach {{a better understanding of the}} contributions of FDI and DI to economic growth in the host countries. Based on this chapter, Chapter three studies empirically the relationship between FDI, DI and economic growth by applying a multivariate VAR system with the error correction model (ECM) and time-series and panel-data techniques of cointegration {{to investigate}} the links between FDI, DI and GDP. The empirical evidence reported in this chapter shows that, on the one hand, FDI crowds out DI in the host countries, either in the short-run or in the long-run based on the results of time-series analysis. On the other hand, Panel-data techniques provide strong evidence that FDI has crowding-in effect on DI. Both time-series and panel-data analysis also provide evidence that FDI can positively affect economic growth in host countries. The results of this chapter also show that GDP have a positive impact on FDI and DI, either in the short-run or in the long-run. The results also show that DI is positively related to GDP and FDI in receiving economies. Based on the results of Chapter three, Chapter four investigated empirically whether FDI contributes to economic growth alone, or does it depend on the host country’s conditions. The empirical evidence stated in this chapter shows that FDI inflows have, in general, a significantly positive impact on growth; however, the magnitude of this effect depends on the host country’s absorptive capacity as measured by human capital, technology gap, infrastructure, institution quality, financial market, and trade openness. The results of this chapter show that the host country must reach a threshold of absorptive capacity in order to gain the positive externalities offered by FDI inflows. The results of this chapter also show that domestic investment, human capital, infrastructure development, financial market development, institution quality, and trade openness are positively related to economic growth, while the technology gap is negatively related to economic growth. Based on the results of chapter three and four, chapter five explored whether the positive impact of FDI and other foreign capital inflows (portfolio investment and loans inflows) in DI on the host economies can be considered as a growth-enhancing role not <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>FDI</b> but also for other foreign capital inflows. The results reported in this chapter show that all types of foreign capital inflows have a significant positive influence on economic growth in the host economies. The empirical evidence reported in this chapter also shows that FDI inflows have a more significant effect on economic growth than other type of capital inflows, such as portfolio investment and loans inflows. The results of this chapter also show that all types of foreign capital inflows have a strong crowding-in effect on DI in the host countries; however, FDI inflows have a greater crowding-in effect on DI than portfolio investment, and loans inflows are in between them. The main result presented in chapter five is that the impact of FDI, portfolio investment and loans inflows on economic growth, which works via domestic investment channel, is not a significant one, but also is generally greater and more robust than the direct impact in the host economies. Generally, the most important contribution of this thesis is that a better understanding of the relationship between FDI, DI and economic growth in developing countries, taking into account the influence of the host country’s absorptive capacity, and different types of foreign capital inflows...|$|E
40|$|Determinants {{of foreign}} direct {{investment}} in Sub-Saharan Africa Abstract This paper deals with determinants of {{foreign direct investment}}s in Sub-Saharan Africa. This region has been considered very risky for foreign investors and the <b>only</b> incentive <b>for</b> <b>FDI</b> was seen in natural resources, especially oil. The objective {{of this paper is}} to find out whether this trend has prevailed in the past decade or if countries that managed to improve their institutional environment attracted significant amount of FDI into other sectors of economy. Standard econometric models are employed to explain FDI flows to individual countries. Not only FDI flows but also the share of FDI to GDP and accumulated FDI are used as dependent variable. The results confirm the fact, that natural resources still play the most important role <b>for</b> inward <b>FDI.</b> Key words: foreign direct investment, natural resources, Sub-Saharan Afric...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{an important}} neglected question: To {{what extent do}} geographic clusters promote {{outward foreign direct investment}} (ODI) ? We find evidence that clusters do promote ODI and so support Porter’s argument that advantages gained in clusters can be the foundations of successful internationalisation. Digging deeper, we find that certain cluster incumbents promote more ODI than others, with more experienced firms and firms with stronger resource bases accounting for more ODI. We also find that firms located in clusters within major global nodes/cities engage in more ODI. Finally, we find that both localisation and urbanisation economies promote ODI. However, the former, within-industry effects, are more important. Overall, this study echoes Dunning’s call for more focus on the ‘L’ component of the OLI paradigm and particularly on the advantages that reside in clusters that make them not <b>only</b> attractive destinations <b>for</b> <b>FDI</b> but also fertile environments from which FDI can spring...|$|R
40|$|Neuroimaging {{studies on}} action {{observation}} suggest that context {{plays a key}} role in coding high-level components of motor behavior, including the short-term and the end-goal of an action. However, little is known about the possible role of context in shaping lower-levels of action processing such as reading action kinematics and simulating muscular activity. Here, we combined single-pulse TMS and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) recording to explore whether top-down contextual information is capable of modulating low-level motor representations. We recorded MEPs from FDI and FCR muscles while participants watched videos about everyday actions embedded in congruent, incongruent or ambiguous contexts. Videos were interrupted before action ending, and participants were requested to predict the course of the observed action. A contextual modulation of corticospinal excitability was observed <b>only</b> <b>for</b> the <b>FDI</b> muscle, which is specifically involved in the execution of reaching-to-grasping movements, and whose corticospinal pathway is influenced by the observation of the very same movements. This modulation was reflected in a selective decrease of corticospinal excitability during the observation of actions embedded in incongruent as compared to congruent and ambiguous contexts. These findings indicate that motor resonance is not an entirely automatic process, but it can be modulated by high-level contextual representations...|$|R
40|$|At {{the center}} of the {{pollution}} haven debate is the claim that foreign investors from industrial countries are attracted to weak environment regulations in developing countries. Some recent location choice studies have found evidence of this attraction, but <b>only</b> <b>for</b> inward <b>FDI</b> in industrial countries. The few studies of inward FDI in developing countries have been hampered by weak measures of environmental stringency and by insufficient data to estimate variation in firm response by pollution intensity. This paper tests for pollution haven behavior by estimating the determinants of location choice for equity joint ventures (EJVs) in China. Beginning with a theoretical framework of firm production and abatement decisions, we derive and estimate a location choice model using data on a sample of EJV projects, Chinese effective levies on water pollution, and Chinese industrial pollution intensity. Results show EJVs in highly-polluting industries funded through Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are attracted by weak environmental standards. In contrast, EJVs funded from non-ethnically Chinese sources are not significantly attracted by weak standards, regardless of the pollution intensity of the industry. These findings are consistent with pollution haven behavior, but not by investors from high income countries and only in industries that are highly polluting. Further investigation into differences in technology between industrial and developing country investors might shed new light on this debate.
