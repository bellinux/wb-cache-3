5|$|Although mainly terrestrial, these snakes {{are good}} {{swimmers}} {{and can also}} climb with ease; <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> found basking in low bushes. One specimen was found 4.6 m above {{the ground in a}} densely branched tree.|$|E
5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} a hot to very acrid taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. <b>Often,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.|$|E

50|$|A stupa is a {{monument}} specifically to house such relics. <b>Often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> enclosed in caskets (such as the Kanishka casket or the Bimaran casket).|$|R
50|$|<b>Often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not {{credited}}, or else were credited {{under other}} names. For example, when singing the TV theme of Love, American Style, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> credited as The Charles Fox Singers.|$|R
5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More <b>often,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Adam Cleveland at IGN called Revelations: The Demon Slayer a fun but not {{innovative}} game. The American game magazine Nintendo Power did however find it innovative; for instance, they {{cited the}} automatic battle option. Cleveland disliked the monster conversation system, which he found irritating; {{he said that}} players never know what answer they should give a monster, and that the questions the monsters ask feel monotone due to how <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> repeated. Writers for the Japanese game magazine Famitsu thought the monster fusion system was fun. In their review of Last Bible III, they commented on how different the game is from the Megami Tensei series, and instead compared it to Final Fantasy. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove wrote for Hardcore Gaming 101 that while The Demon Slayer was {{not by any means}} an outstanding game, it was one of few competent role-playing games on Game Boy. They found Last Bible III to be the best game in the series.|$|E
5|$|Wilde's life {{continues}} to fascinate, {{and he has}} been the subject of numerous biographies since his death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, his friend and editor, wrote a biography, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. Oscar Wilde and Myself (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that De Profundis was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later, in Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up (1939) and his Autobiography he was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit (1946). In 1954 Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir Son of Oscar Wilde, which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Lyrics in doom metal {{play a key}} role. <b>Often,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> gloomy and pessimistic, include themes such as: suffering, depression, fear, grief, dread, {{death and}} anger. While some bands write lyrics in introspective and {{personal}} ways, others convey their themes using symbolism – which may be inspired by literature.|$|E
25|$|The {{enclitic}} particles can {{be attached}} to any word in a sentence, but most <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> attached to the first phrase of the sentence or to the verb. They are much more diverse and frequent in the Mitanni letter than in Old Hurrian. Common ones include =ān (and), =mān (but), =mmaman (to be sure) and =nīn (truly!).|$|E
25|$|In supermax, {{prisoners are}} {{generally}} allowed {{out of their}} cells for only one hour a day (one-and-a-half hours in California state prisons); <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> kept in solitary confinement. They receive their meals through ports in the doors of their cells. When supermax inmates are allowed to exercise, this may {{take place in a}} small, enclosed area where the prisoner will exercise alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>Often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wet by rains, nor <b>were</b> <b>they</b> ever in {{the warm}} {{sunlight}} for a sufficient length of time to become thoroughly dry and comfortable. Of food they had little, and of the poorest quality.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, the {{authorization}} {{and construction of}} the first Federally-funded building {{in a small town}} often has been a major event. Sometimes these were simply a post office or a courthouse; <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> combination buildings.|$|R
50|$|The landshövdingehus {{built around}} 1880-1890 {{attempted}} {{to imitate the}} more high-status stone houses.

25|$|Most {{testicular}} {{germ cell}} tumors {{have too many}} chromosomes, and most <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> triploid to tetraploid. An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 {{on both sides of}} the same centromere) is present in about 80% of the testicular cancers, and also the other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.|$|E
25|$|There are an {{overwhelming}} number of mathematical models which {{are referred to as}} Boussinesq equations. This may easily lead to confusion, since <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> loosely referenced to as the Boussinesq equations, while in fact a variant thereof is considered. So it is more appropriate to call them Boussinesq-type equations. Strictly speaking, the Boussinesq equations is the above-mentioned set B, since it is used in the analysis in the remainder of his 1872 paper.|$|E
25|$|These fixed mercados can {{be found}} in any town of any size in Mexico. <b>Often,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{accompanied}} one or more days per week by tianguis, which set up around the main building. However, the largest, best developed and most numerous fixed markets are in Mexico City, which has over 300, 80 of which are specialty markets dedicated to one or more classes of merchandise, such as gourmet food, plants, cut flowers, candy etc.|$|E
5000|$|Television series Parempi myöhään... (1979-1980) made Valkama a {{household}} name in Finland. She starred the show with actor Pentti Siimes, and <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> mistaken for a married couple. She has also been seen in films since 1954.|$|R
50|$|Categories {{are poorly}} defined (<b>often</b> because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> subjective).|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 12th century, much of Hesse belonged to Thuringia. The Thuringian lands, however, were so widely scattered that quite <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> interspersed with estates belonging to the Archbishopric of Mainz and its vassals. The parish of Amöneburg belonged to the archbishopric until 1803.|$|R
25|$|Heinze's {{essays and}} opinion pieces {{have been widely}} {{published}} in newspapers, journals, periodicals and online publications. His opinion pieces are occasionally political, sometimes historical, but most focus on timely issues involving race, immigration or religion. His essays, in contrast, are often cultural critiques of popular books, television shows or movies. Sometimes his essays explore his own family or his personal life; sometimes they are serious, but <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> light-hearted or comic.|$|E
25|$|A {{lavalier}} microphone {{is made for}} hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).|$|E
25|$|To {{say that}} they have a key role to play is an understatement. Finance is {{connected}} to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the litmus test by which public confidence in the institution is either won or lost.|$|E
5000|$|Political {{and ideological}} slogans Soviet people saw {{everyday}} everywhere. <b>Often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> exploited in Russian political jokes. For example, the formula [...] "The Party is Intellect, Honor, and Conscience of our Epoch" [...] was mathematically transformed into [...] "Intellect is party minus honor minus conscience of our epoch." ...|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the rules}} for smoking areas were rather {{permissive}} and were laxly enforced. Restaurants, cafés etc. just had to provide smoking and non-smoking sections, which were often not well separated. In larger establishments, smoking and non-smoking sections could be separate rooms but <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> just areas within the same room.|$|R
5000|$|Students {{with yet}} bigger and {{cumulative}} problems started {{to appear at}} the school in the 1950s. <b>Often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unemployed alcoholics, people with psycho-pathological problems and drug addicts. The number of students grew intensively in the 1960s leading to the broadening of the offer of the school by many other activities.|$|R
25|$|A Bitch takes shit from no one. You may {{not like}} her, but you cannot ignore her.... have loud voices and often use them. Bitches are not pretty....Bitches seek their {{identity}} strictly thru themselves and what they do. They are subjects, not objects...Often they do dominate other people when roles are not available to them which more creatively sublimate their energies and utilize their capabilities. More <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> accused of domineering when doing what would be considered natural by a man.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} usually {{alternate}} and compound. Most <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> even- or odd-pinnately compound (e.g. Caragana and Robinia respectively), often trifoliate (e.g. Trifolium, Medicago) and rarely palmately compound (e.g. Lupinus), in the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae commonly bipinnate (e.g. Acacia, Mimosa). They always have stipules, {{which can be}} leaf-like (e.g. Pisum), thorn-like (e.g. Robinia) or be rather inconspicuous. Leaf margins are entire or, occasionally, serrate. Both the leaves and the leaflets often have wrinkled pulvini to permit nastic movements. In some species, leaflets have evolved into tendrils (e.g. Vicia).|$|E
25|$|Red dwarfs are {{far more}} {{variable}} and violent than their more stable, larger cousins. <b>Often</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> covered in starspots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% {{for months at a}} time, while at other times they emit gigantic flares that can double their brightness in a matter of minutes. Such variation would be very damaging for life, as it would not only destroy any complex organic molecules that could possibly form biological precursors, but also because it would blow off sizeable portions of the planet's atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|There {{were many}} artistic groups and {{movements}} that {{were active in}} the Soviet Union after {{the period of the}} thaw. <b>They</b> can <b>be</b> difficult to classify because <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not related due to stylistic objectives, but geographical proximity. Furthermore, participation in these groups was fluid as the community of nonconformist artists in Moscow was relatively small and close-knit.|$|R
50|$|The farms {{have large}} and elaborately {{decorated}} dwelling houses, often two or three, sometimes housing several generations, whereas some houses were {{used only for}} festivities and others for sleeping, so called ”bed-cottages”. Most <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> two stories, {{but there are also}} examples of one story cottages with room for two families.|$|R
50|$|The troupe was well-organized and {{strictly}} disciplined by rules. Because entertainers like singers or {{actors were}} often despised in that age, the troupe recruited its members among the orphans, poor farmers` children {{and sometimes even}} through kidnapping. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> not well-paid. Very <b>often</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> offered only meals and beds and {{a small amount of}} money. They had tough lives.|$|R
