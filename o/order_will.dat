5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing <b>order</b> <b>will</b> set aside the unlawful decision, and the mandatory <b>order</b> <b>will</b> require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a {{mandatory order}} cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} insight here is that, whilst parallel {{arrangements of}} anisotropic objects {{lead to a}} decrease in orientational entropy, there {{is an increase in}} positional entropy. Thus in some case greater positional <b>order</b> <b>will</b> be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.|$|E

25|$|Stable sort {{algorithms}} sort identical {{elements in}} the same order that they appear in the input. When sorting some kinds of data, only part of the data is examined when determining the sort order. For example, in the card sorting example to the right, the cards are being sorted by their rank, and their suit is being ignored. This allows the possibility of multiple different correctly sorted versions of the original list. Stable sorting algorithms choose one of these, according to the following rule: if two items compare as equal, like the two 5 cards, then their relative <b>order</b> <b>will</b> be preserved, so that if one came before the other in the input, it will also come before the other in the output.|$|E
