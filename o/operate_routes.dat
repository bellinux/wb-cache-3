5|$|In April1995, when Parliament {{decided to}} nationalize twenty-six {{regional}} airports owned by their respective municipalities, they also debated {{a proposal to}} build a new airport in Båtsfjord. At the time Widerøe was obliged to <b>operate</b> <b>routes</b> to the airport until 31March1997. In December1995, Widerøe took delivery of their fifteenth Dash8 and thus their only need for a Twin Otter was to serve Båtsfjord. From 1994 to 1997, the cost estimates for the new airport increased from NOK95 to 125million. By June1998, Parliament approved additional funding which brought the cost to NOK178 million, including a new county road for NOK8million. The airport opened on 9 September 1999. From the opening Widerøe used the Twin Otter until 1April2000, when the route was taken over by larger Dash8 aircraft. Airport security was introduced on 1January2005.|$|E

Norske Luftruter applied for NOK250,000 per year for a route from Bergen to Copenhagen via Kristiansand and Oslo. The following year, parliament passed a long-term plan for construction of airports, which would be located in Oslo, Telemark, Kristiansand, Stavanger, Bergen, Ålesund and Trondheim.
