40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from May 22, 2014 - Nov. 22, 2014 State departments of transportation, transportation consultants, and other transportation agencies are always in need of data {{that can be used}} to better understand how different modes of transportation use the road and highway systems. A variety of automatic data collection technologies have been used to gather these data including video cameras, inductive loop detectors, license plate recognition, as well as wireless-based technologies such as infrared. These technologies have different capabilities with respect to the amount of information that can be derived from the collected data. Regardless of the richness of the collected data, the majority of the available technologies focus on collecting vehicle-based data because they either do not have the capability to collect data from <b>other</b> travel modes (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>bicycles</b> and pedestrians), or may need to be deployed differently to support this capability (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> video technology). One type of wireless-based data collection system that has been deployed recently is based on Bluetooth technology. A key feature of Bluetooth-based data collection systems that makes travel mode identification feasible is that the Bluetooth-enabled devices within vehicles are also present on bicyclists and pedestrians. The main objective of this research was to explore the feasibility of utilizing the information contained in data collected by Bluetooth-based data collection units (DCU) to automatically identify three different modes of transportation (i. e., motor vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians) travelling through an intersection. To accomplish this objective, a methodology was developed that included three controlled data collection experiments and one uncontrolled data collection experiment where data were gathered from Bluetooth-enabled devices using several Bluetooth DCUs. The main performance metric utilized was the duration of travel which was calculated from the time-stamped MAC address data collected by the Bluetooth DCUs. The clustering methods k-Means, Fuzzy c-Means, and Partitioning Around Medoids were applied to the overall duration of travel data to distinguish vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians. The results obtained in this research prove that the Bluetooth-based data collection system can be a viable approach for distinguishing different modes of transportation travelling through intersections controlled by either a stop sign or traffic light...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} 25 university students' use of addition to solve large single-digit subtractions by contrasting {{performance in the}} standard subtraction format (12 - 9 =.) and in the addition format (9 +. = 12). In particular, we investigated {{the effect of the}} relative size of the subtrahend on performance in both formats. We found a significant interaction between format, the magnitude of the subtrahend (S) compared to the difference (D) (S > D vs. S < D), and the numerical distance between subtrahend and difference. When the subtrahend was larger than the difference and S and D were far from each <b>other</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> 12 - 9 =.), problems were solved faster in the addition than in the subtraction format; when the subtrahend was smaller than the difference and S and D were far from each <b>other</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> 12 - 3 =.), problems were solved faster in the subtraction than in the addition format. However, when the subtrahend and the difference were close to each <b>other</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> 13 - 7 =.), there were no significant reaction time differences between both formats. These results suggest that adults do not rely exclusively and routinely on addition to solve large single-digit subtractions, but select either addition-based or subtraction-based strategies depending on the relative size of the subtrahend.

40|$|Urban {{authorities}} are continuously drawing up policies to promote cycling among commuters. However, these initiatives are counterproductive for the targeted objectives because they increase opportunities for bicycle theft. This paper explores Inner London {{as a case}} study to address place-specific risk factors for bicycle theft at the street-segment level while controlling for seasonal variation. The presence of certain public amenities (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>bicycle</b> stands, railway stations, pawnshops) was evaluated against locations of bicycle theft between 2013 and 2016 and risk effects were estimated using negative binomial regression models. Results showed that a greater level of risk stemmed from land-use facilities than from area-based socioeconomic status. The presence of facilities such as train stations, vacant houses, pawnbrokers and payday lenders increased bicycle theft, but no evidence was found that linked police stations with crime levels. The findings have significant implications for urban crime prevention with respect to non-residential land use...|$|R

40|$|This study {{tested the}} idea of habits {{as a form of}} {{goal-directed}} automatic behavior. Expanding on the idea that habits are mentally represented as associations between goals and actions, it was proposed that goals are capable of activating the habitual action. More specific, when habits are established (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> frequent cycling to the university), the very activation of the goal to act (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> having to attend lectures at the university) automatically evokes the habitual response (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>bicycle).</b> Indeed, it was tested and confirmed that, when behavior is habitual, behavioral responses are activated automatically. In addition, the results of 3 experiments indicated that (a) the automaticity in habits is conditional on the presence of an active goal (cf. goal-dependent automaticity; J. A. Bargh, 1989), supporting the idea that habits are mentally represented as goal-action links, and (b) the formation of implementation intentions (i. e., the creation of a strong mental link between a goal and action) may simulate goal-directed automaticity in habits. The majority of people's actions are executed on a routine basis. The better part of the behavioral repertoire is frequently exhibited in the same physical and social environment and has taken on a habitual character (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> James, 1890; Ouellette & Wood, 1998; Triandis, 1980).

The relative infestation level (i. e., {{the probability that a}} plant is attacked by herbivores) of E. vitis on different grapevine cultivars and their sensitivity (i. e., the incidence of symptoms expression in response to herbivore feeding or other stimuli) to this pest were studied over four years in two vineyards located in northeastern Italy. Some cultivars (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Carménère and Sauvignon Blanc) were usually more infested than <b>others</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Gris), although some differences were observed among years and sites.

Information obtained can be used within the framework of integrated pest management in vineyards. Action thresholds should differ on the basis of sensitivity.

40|$|Key messages: • Schemes {{in which}} general traffic lanes are re-allocated to {{alternative}} uses {{can be expected}} to reduce traffic volumes, improve journey times for the modes given additional priority (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>bicycles</b> or buses), increase the use of non-car modes and reduce casualty numbers. • However, little credible evidence was identified on the monetized costs and benefits of road space re-allocation schemes. This may be a result of such schemes often forming part of a wider package of measures which are then appraised as a whole. • Journey times for general traffic (cars, vans etc.) may increase, although in some cases road space reallocation has not led to the anticipated increases in congestion. Therefore, it is possible to remove road space and improve conditions for users of other modes and the public realm without worsening conditions for general traffic. • Accordingly, modelling exercises of road space reallocation under different scenarios indicate that benefit-cost ratios for road space re-allocation schemes are likely to be positive in cases where the benefits of increased perso...|$|R
