Geoffrey Smith observed in 1909 that {{the collection of}} the flowers for this purpose had caused the decline of some populations on Mount Wellington. The timber of larger specimens has been used for inlays; it has an attractive grain and a pale red color.|$|E

5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was <b>once</b> <b>used</b> to churn butter. The foundations of {{what could have been}} a mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1760s, Westgate {{consisted}} {{of only a}} farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old Boundary Road) and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited {{its name from the}} Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream <b>once</b> <b>used</b> to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide.|$|E

5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century until {{the early part of the}} 1970s, coal was mined in the eastern portion of the Catawissa Creek watershed. The coal was {{primarily}} mined in the Jeansville Coal Basin and the Green Mountain Coal Basin. The Catawissa Water Company <b>once</b> <b>used</b> water from Catawissa Creek. Five drainage tunnels were built in the watershed in the 1930s, and they still discharge acid mine drainage in the 21st century. Strip mining has occurred in parts of the watershed, mainly the Catawissa Creek headwaters and the Little Tomhicken Creek sub-watershed.|$|E

In 1844 John Herschel attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus the Mast, a suggestion followed by Francis Baily, but Benjamin Gould restored Lacaille's nomenclature.|$|E
40|$|Mammographic risk {{assessment}} {{is concerned with}} the probability of a woman developing breast cancer. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} the density of linear structures is related to risk. Two independent sets of mammographic images were annotated according to BIRADS risk classes by expert radiologists. Linear structure information was extracted from each image using the line operator method, and density segmentation was performed using a method based on minimum error thresholding. Linear discriminant analysis and a Support Vector Machine classifer were used to classify the images in to BIRADS classes. The classi?cation was performed three times for each dataset ? <b>once</b> <b>using</b> density information only, <b>once</b> <b>using</b> linear structure information only, and <b>once</b> <b>using</b> both density and linear structure information. The results of classi?cation showed a marked improvement when both density and linear structure information were used, suggesting that linear structure information is valuable in mammographic risk classi?catio...|$|R

5|$|In the Avon Valley to {{the east}} of Bath the classic {{geographical}} example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found: road, rail, river, canal. The canal passes the remains of a loading dock, <b>once</b> <b>used</b> for Bath Stone from the quarries on Bathampton Down, which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the Dry Arch rock bridge (demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the A36). Next, the canal passes the waterwheel-powered Claverton Pumping Station, which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal. The building was completed in 1810 and the pump was working by 1813.|$|E

5|$|Terpenes and terpenoids of {{many kinds}} {{are found in}} a variety of {{medicinal}} plants, and in resinous plants such as the conifers. They are strongly aromatic and serve to repel herbivores. Their scent makes them useful in essential oils, whether for perfumes such as rose and lavender, or for aromatherapy.

5|$|The Puerta de Palmas {{was built}} in 1551. It has two {{cylindrical}} towers flanking the entrance door. Prince Philip II and Emperor Charles V and date of construction are mentioned on the outer side of the tower.

Its entrance is east-facing, and is double-arched and is decorated with medallions of the shield of the Emperor Charles V. It was <b>once</b> <b>used</b> as a prison, but has since undergone many renovations and has been an entrance point to the city.|$|E
