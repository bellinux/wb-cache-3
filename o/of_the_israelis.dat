5|$|The {{battle was}} still not lost for the Israelis {{although}} the wake was coming, and Laskov considered that his men could not hold {{in front of a}} Legion's counter-attack and he preferred to order the retreat. It was also time for the Jordanians to regroup, their 4th Regiment was completely out of ammunition. 73rd Battalion suffered 50% losses and the whole of the engaged forces had counted 44 deaths and twice that number injured. According to the sources, the Legion suffered between 12 and 20 deaths, including the lieutenant commanding the fort. In contrast, the Jordanians reported 2 just deaths on their side, and 161 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b>|$|E
5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, Syrian {{aircraft}} bombed the Israeli village Kinneret {{and the regional}} school Beit Yerah, on the southwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee. By evening, Samakh (Tzemah) had fallen and a new Israeli defensive line {{was set up in}} the Deganias, facing the Syrian counterparts. At night, a Palmach company from Yiftach's 3rd Battalion attempted to recapture Samakh's police station. They stealthily reached the school next to the station, but the assault on the actual fort was warded off. On the morning of May 19, a message was sent from Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada that they were preparing for an evacuation, although when the order was given to stay put, the villages had already been abandoned, mostly to Afikim. In the morning, when the villagers carried out an order to return to their positions, local Arabs were already present at the location. The Syrian troops then captured the villages without a fight, and proceeded to loot and destroy them. Aharon Israeli wrote that an order was given not to disclose the flight of Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan's residents, but this became clear as fire and smoke rose from the villages, and hurt the morale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> making defensive preparations in the Deganias.|$|E

25|$|On 30 January 2013, {{about ten}} jets bombed a convoy {{believed}} to be carrying Russian-made SA-17 anti-aircraft missiles to Lebanon. The attack, attributed by some media reports to Israeli airforce, {{did not result in}} any counterattacks from Syria, although Syria has said it reserves the right to retaliate. Western intelligence sources reported that Iranian general Hassan Shateri had been killed in the airstrike. Iran acknowledged his death at the hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> without further details. Israel refused to comment on its involvement in the incident.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union, {{after long}} {{peering through the}} keyhole of a closed door on what it {{considered}} a Western sphere of influence, now found itself invited over the threshold {{as a friend of}} the Arabs. Shortly after it reopened, the canal was traversed by the first Soviet warships since World War I. The Soviets' burgeoning influence in the Middle East, although it was not to last, included acquiring Mediterranean bases, introducing multipurpose projects, supporting the budding Palestinian liberation movement and penetrating the Arab countries. Nasser claimed to be the defender of the Palestinian cause, but his anti-Israel warlike rhetoric damaged the Palestinians since it convinced a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> to oppose reconciliation with the Palestinians.|$|E

25|$|The {{exact number}} of Arab {{casualties}} is unknown. One estimate places the Arab death toll at 7,000, including 3,000 Palestinians, 2,000 Egyptians, 1,000 Jordanians, and 1,000 Syrians. In 1958, Palestinian historian Aref al-Aref {{calculated that the}} Arab armies' combined losses amounted to 3,700, with Egypt losing 961 regular and 200 irregular soldiers and Jordan losing 362 regulars and 200 irregulars. According to Henry Laurens, the Palestinians suffered double the Jewish losses, with 13,000 dead, 1,953 of whom {{are known to have}} died in combat situations. Of the remainder, 4,004 remain nameless but the place, tally and date of their death is known, and a further 7,043, for whom only the place of death is known, not their identities nor the date of their death. According to Laurens, the largest part of Palestinian casualties consisted of non-combatants and corresponds to the successful operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Begin’s most {{significant}} achievement as Prime Minister was {{the signing of}} a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, for which he and Anwar Sadat shared the Nobel Prize for Peace. In {{the wake of the}} Camp David Accords, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which was captured from Egypt in the Six-Day War. Later, Begin’s government promoted the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Begin authorized the bombing of the Osirak nuclear plant in Iraq and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight PLO strongholds there, igniting the 1982 Lebanon War. As Israeli military involvement in Lebanon deepened, and the Sabra and Shatila massacre, carried out by Christian Phalangist militia allies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> shocked world public opinion, Begin grew increasingly isolated. As IDF forces remained mired in Lebanon and the economy suffered from hyperinflation, the public pressure on Begin mounted. Depressed by the death of his wife Aliza in November 1982, he gradually withdrew from public life, until his resignation in October 1983.|$|E
25|$|The Organization then uses {{both their}} {{southern}} Californian {{base of operations}} and their nuclear weapons to open a wider war in which they launch nuclear strikes against New York City and Israel, initiate a nuclear exchange between the US and the Soviet Union, and plant nuclear weapons and new terrorist cells throughout North America. Many major U.S. cities are destroyed, including Baltimore and Detroit. As the United States undergoes a nuclear civil war, governments {{all over the world}} begin to fall one after the other, and violent anti-Jewish riots break out in the streets. After the nuclear launches against Israel, the Arabs take the advantage of the opportunity and proceed to swarm into Israel, mostly armed with clubs and knives, and kill all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> The governments of France and the Netherlands collapse, and the Soviet Union falls apart while seeing a surge in anti-Semitic violence. Meanwhile, the United States is put in a state of absolute martial law and transformed into a military dictatorship. When the United States government decides to launch an invasion against the Organization's stronghold in Southern California, Earl Turner is ordered on a suicide mission; he flies a crop duster equipped with a nuclear warhead and destroys the Pentagon before the invasion can be ordered.|$|E

According to future IOC vice president Dick Pound, the insertion of the Rhodesian issue into the speech [...] "was universally condemned, and Brundage left office under a cloud of criticism that effectively undermined a lifetime of well-intentioned work in the Olympic movement". Brundage subsequently issued a statement {{that he did not}} mean to imply the decision to exclude the Rhodesians, which he stated was [...] "purely a matter of sport", was comparable to the murder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> According to Alfred Senn in his history of the Olympics, the decision to continue the games [...] "sat poorly with many observers"; sportswriter Red Smith of The New York Times was among the critics: ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of the}} Israeli–Palestinian conflict, {{over the}} years, various Palestinian militants have carried out attacks against Israeli Jews. [...] Statistics from Btselem state that 3,500 Israelis [...] {{have been killed and}} 25,000 have been wounded as a result of Palestinian {{violence}} since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. These figures include soldiers as well as civilians, including those killed in exchanges of gunfire.

MacKay's statements in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict created a national debate in Canada, especially among Arabs and Muslim Canadians who opposed MacKay's position.

The IDF decided against a rescue operation. Soon after, Palestinian rioters stormed the building, overcame the Palestinian police and murdered and mutilated both soldiers.
