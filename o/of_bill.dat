40|$|The concept <b>of</b> a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{exchange}} and promissory note The {{topic of the}} master thesis is "The concept <b>of</b> a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{exchange and}} promissory note". This topic has been chosen for its attractiveness, topicality and difficulty. The author's work experience was the motivation for the selection of this topic. The objective of the diploma thesis is to give a characterization <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note, to explain what kinds of them exist and to analyse their essential elements.

5|$|Duquesne {{suffered}} {{its final}} disappointment {{of the season}} on March 17 as it fell to the Princeton Tigers. Bill Clark remained suspended and Damian Saunders led the team with only 14 points. Duquesne dominated the game early on, taking a 20–11 lead before Princeton came back, eventually leading 28–23 at the half. The Dukes were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind, eventually losing 51–65. The absence <b>of</b> <b>Bill</b> Clark showed on defense, as the Dukes were out-rebounded heavily. The Dukes also failed to improve on their issues from the regular season, going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3-point range. This loss ended the 2009 season, and all Duquesne could do was look ahead to the next year.|$|E
