5|$|By 3 May 1975, North Vietnamese forces {{controlled}} all of South Vietnam, just 55 {{days after}} <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> attack on Buôn Ma Thuột. During that time period, {{an army of}} approximately three-quarters of a million men was defeated by a force one-fourth its size. Since {{the end of the}} war, there has been much historical recrimination and discussion as to how and why such a lopsided victory had occurred. Four main lines of thought have remained particularly viable, all of which possess some validity, but all are also open to argument.|$|E
5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
50|$|These {{are small}} snails, only about 10 mm to 15 mm in {{diameter}} (or approximately one-half inch), notable for their elaborately convoluted apertures, with only very narrow <b>openings.</b> <b>Their</b> range {{is limited to}} the southern United States and northern Mexico.|$|R

5|$|From 1915 onwards the MTT had {{to compete}} against {{unregulated}} private buses, often preceding the trams on the same route to steal fares, which the MTT countered by <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> own motor bus routes from 1925. The South Australian government began regulating buses within the state in 1927, although some private operators used {{a provision in the}} Australian constitution to their advantage. By notionally marking each ticket as a fare from the pickup point to Murrayville, Victoria (but allowing passengers to board or alight sooner) companies avoided having to abide by the regulation for some time. Up until the end of World War I, most Adelaideans were dependent on public transport for daily journeys. The introduction of private automobiles decreased passenger numbers until petrol rationing during World War II led to a resurgence in patronage; patronage remained higher than before the war, until rationing was discontinued in 1951.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{the victory}} at Toronto, United faced the Houston Dynamo in a rematch from April 28, when United won 3–2. The match {{was a special}} {{occasion}} for the Dynamo, as the club was <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> brand-new soccer-specific stadium, BBVA Compass Stadium. The hosts would earn a 1–0 victory thanks to a 67th-minute strike from Houston's Brad Davis, who volley a 35-yard shot.|$|E
25|$|Despite not forcing {{anything}} {{into the}} mouth, mouth corsets are usually {{very effective in}} gagging the victim. This {{is due to the}} fact that the chin piece prevents the wearer from <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> mouth and dislodging the gag, and the lacing at the back of the corset holds the gag tightly against the mouth, making a very effective seal. In addition, it compresses the wearer's cheeks.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the muscle}} in an alligator's jaw evolved to bite and grip prey. The muscles that close the jaws are {{exceptionally}} powerful, but the muscles for <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> jaws are comparatively weak. As a result, an adult human can hold an alligator's jaws shut bare-handed. It is common today to use several wraps of duct tape to prevent an adult alligator from opening its jaws when being handled or transported.|$|E

25|$|The first railway {{to arrive}} in Exeter was the Bristol and Exeter Railway that opened a station at St Davids on the western edge in 1844. The South Devon Railway Company {{extended}} the line westwards to Plymouth, <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> own smaller station at St Thomas, above Cowick Street. A more central railway station, that at Queen Street, was opened by the London and South Western Railway in 1860 when it opened its alternative route to London. Butchers Lloyd Maunder moved to their present base in 1915, to gain better access to the Great Western Railway for transportation of meat products to London.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} criticism {{began in}} Australia; the Sydney Morning Herald immediately {{took issue with}} the fact that not only was captain Ricky Ponting outstrategised by his opposite number Vaughan, but the side in itself was too old and simply did not score the runs when they were needed. The Age of Melbourne criticised the team for <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> big mouths once too often, hitting at Australia's earlier whitewash boast. Psychological warfare, The Age went on to state, is great when it works, but when it backfires those who are responsible ought to be brought to account.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the various Sections of the SLP were about evenly split between the pro-electoral Rosenberg NEC and the trade union-oriented Volkszeitung NEC. In a last-ditch attempt to prevent a split the SLP's Control Committee, based in Philadelphia, intervened in the {{conflict}} by suspending both of the rival NECs from office and moving {{the date of the}} 7th Convention to October 12. The Volkszeitung group accepted this decision; Rosenberg and the deposed NEC did not. On October 2, 1889, the Rosenberg faction opened their convention in Chicago, with the Volkszeitung faction <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> gathering in the same city 10 days later.|$|E

Four days later, he scored three {{goals in a}} 6–0 away win against San Marino during the same {{qualifying}} tournament. On 5 June, against the same opponents in Villarreal, he was again on target in a 9–0 rout. Raúl played every minute of Spain's Euro 2000 finals campaign in Belgium and the Netherlands, <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> 2–1 win over Slovenia at the Amsterdam Arena before a quarter-final elimination by eventual champions France, in which Raúl missed a last minute penalty which would have taken the tie to extra-time.|$|E
25|$|Some early ichthyosaurs were durophagous and had flat convex teeth {{adapted for}} {{crushing}} shellfish. They thus ate benthos {{from the floor}} of more shallow seas. Other species were perhaps suction feeders, sucking animals into their mouths by quickly <b>opening</b> <b>their</b> relatively short jaws. This was first assumed for Shonisaurus, which giant by this means might have secured a constant food supply for its huge body, and in 2011 for the short-snouted Guanlingsaurus liangae. However, in 2013 a study concluded that the hyoid bone of ichthyosaurs, at the tongue base, was insufficiently ossified to support a sucking movement and suggested the alternative that such species were ram feeders, gathering food by constantly swimming forwards with a wide open mouth.|$|E
