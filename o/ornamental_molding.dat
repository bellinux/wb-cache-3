50|$|In July 2000 {{the former}} Studebaker {{showroom}} was the Texas Texas restaurant. The building lost its cornice in 1988 {{but was still}} a fixture of Times Square. Its chamfered corners and broad arched windows were still evident to observers. The absence of its elaborate cornice hurt its chances of gaining national historic landmark protection against demolition. Only three other Manhattan buildings which lacked cornices have received landmark designation. Robert Redlion, an engineer employed by the owner, submitted plans to repair ornamental cornice in October 1999. A 1987 facade inspection filed with New York City concluded the cornice was safe. Redlion and the owner contended that the <b>ornamental</b> <b>molding</b> was dangerous, with pieces having fallen on the ground. However no violations had been filed against the cornice.|$|E
