40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} phenomena <b>of</b> systemic banking <b>crises.</b> The first two chapters {{deal with the}} international dimension, exploring international factors that may increase the probability <b>of</b> <b>crises,</b> and the third chapter studies the medium-term evolution of productivity growth after crises. Chapter 1 aims at answering {{the question of whether}} or not bonanzas (surges) in net capital inflows increase the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>crises.</b> The chapter fits a binary-outcome model for the probability <b>of</b> <b>crises</b> in the period 1973 - 2008. The methodology focuses on separating the effect of windfalls of capital from that of lending booms. The findings indicate that bonanzas are associated with an increased likelihood <b>of</b> <b>crises,</b> and that this effect is present even in the absence of a lending boom. A baseline bonanza raises the likelihood <b>of</b> a <b>crisis</b> from an unconditional probability of 4. 4 % to 12 %. Decomposing flows into FDI, portfolio equity, and debt indicates that bonanzas in all flows increase the probability <b>of</b> <b>crises</b> when taking place jointly with a lending boom. However, surges in portfolio-equity flows seem to be the only type of flow with an independent effect. Chapter 2 explores the involvement of banks in the global economy, using network statistics to proxy for financial integration of banks. The analysis is based on a count-data model for the number <b>of</b> banking <b>crises</b> in the period 1973 - 2007. The results indicate that the level of integration of the average bank, as measured by its international borrowing, is a robust determinant of the incidence <b>of</b> <b>crises.</b> However, the more important the average bank is as a global intermediary (proxied by betweenness), the lower the incidence <b>of</b> <b>crises.</b> Chapter 3 aims at shedding light on the medium-term effects <b>of</b> <b>crises</b> on productivity growth, bringing the `creative destruction' hypothesis to the data. The chapter studies the differences in mean productivity growth before and after a crisis using a differences-in-differences methodology. The results indicate that during the seven years following a crisis, productivity grows faster than during the seven years before the crisis. Furthermore, sectors that rely relatively more on external finance exhibit, on average, comparatively faster post-crisis productivity growth...|$|R

Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times <b>of</b> <b>crisis,</b> and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the pharaoh, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes. In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{whether the}} level of {{financial}} integration of banks in a country increases the incidence <b>of</b> systemic banking <b>crises.</b> The paper uses a de facto proxy for financial integration based on network statistics of banks participating in the global market of interbank syndicated loans. Specifically, the network statistics degree and betweenness are used to proxy for the de facto integration of the average bank in a country. The paper fits a count data model in the cross-section for the period 1980 - 2007 and finds that {{the level of}} integration of the average bank is a robust determinant of the incidence <b>of</b> banking <b>crises.</b> An increased level of de facto integration as mea- sured by borrowing by banks is positively associated with the incidence <b>of</b> <b>crises.</b> A higher level of de jure integration (capital account openness) is also associated with a higher incidence <b>of</b> <b>crises.</b> However, the results also indicate that prudential banking regulation (supervision) plays a crucial and much larger role in reducing the incidence <b>of</b> <b>crises.</b> Interestingly, the results also show {{that the level of}} integration as measured by betweenness of the average bank has a negative effect on the incidence <b>of</b> <b>crises.</b> That is, the more important the average bank of a country is to the global bank network, the fewer the number <b>of</b> <b>crises</b> the country endures. ...|$|R
