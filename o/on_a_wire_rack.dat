50|$|Sliding racks are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> connected to tracks that are suspended from channels {{on the floor and}} ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames. Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|E
40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with <b>a</b> mower <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> hay <b>rack.</b> Results: Drying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hay rack produced very good hay. The upper portion of the hay dried on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that dried <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> hay <b>rack.</b> The lower portion of the hay dried on the floor still contained too much water and was inappropriate for long term storage. Upper and lower portion of hay dried on the floor and hay dried on the rack were all taken wall by dairy cows, indicating no significant difference of the amount taken. (Received June 30, 1977...|$|R
40|$|A {{material}} can enhance or distract from the end-user experience {{and is an}} important decision for designers. As such, material libraries exist to provide designers with a hands-on resource to understanding materials beyond just data sheets. When we took 2. 009, a mechanical engineering capstone class, we {{found it difficult to}} decide which materials to use. Thus, in this work, we sought to create a materials library under an engineering context for student product designers to use. To understand how material libraries function and which materials would best suit the collection, we benchmarked three physical and one virtual material library. We also sought input from those involved in product design classes, such as past students, Professor Wallace who teaches 2. 009, and Pappalardo shop staff who support the students in their creations. We also looked at past receipts to supplement our knowledge as well as looked at distributors and what they offered to expand our selection. Our six main categories of materials were: woods, metals, composites, polymers, fabrics, and Smooth-On products. The material libraries key criteria were to be well organized, portable, and useful. We went through several design sketches before deciding <b>on</b> utilizing <b>a</b> modular <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> so we could place dividers and shelves as necessary. A coding system was also implemented that included main categories and subcategories with associated colors to help with the user experience of quickly locating, using, and returning. Each material comes attached with information and a more complete overview is located in an information packet. While this first version the materials library was met with excitement, {{it is by no means}} complete. As such, there are also a number of ways to improve the experience and the collection. by Patricia Das and Roget Mo. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the following study was to evaluate the most efficacious pH for treatment of post-chill, cleaned broiler paws with the Precure™ (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) antimicrobial. Precure™ is listed as a solution of GRAS acids for use by FDA and is listed as a safe and suitable ingredient by USDA for use on poultry. This study was done {{at the request of}} a poultry processor who was being asked by the customer to adhere to strict microbial standards for poultry paws. Thus, a bag of randomly collected, chilled and cleaned paws was obtained from a local broiler processing facility and was transported on ice to MCA Services (Rogers, AR). Upon arrival at the laboratory, the bag of paws was held frozen (o F) for 2 days and was then tempered (40 to 42 o F) for two days prior to initiation of the study. For the experiment, there was a control group and three treatment groups. The control group and each of the three treatment groups consisted of three replicate samples (n= 3). Each replicate sample consisted of three randomly selected paws. Thus, a treatment group consisted of a total of nine paws. The three treatment groups evaluated were Precure™ at pH= 1. 5, Precure™ at pH= 1. 7 and Precure™ at pH= 1. 85. For treatment of the product, the nine paws for each treatment group were placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> and were allowed to touch and overlap as would be typical in a processing environment. Each treatment group of paws was sprayed with the appropriate Precure™ treatment at 20 mL per second for 5 seconds. Thus, each group of nine paws was sprayed with 100 mL of the appropriate Precure™ treatment solution. The sprayed paws were then allowed to drain for 10 seconds. After draining, paws were placed three to a bag in sterile rinse bags and were held at 40 o F for Escherichia coli, as well as for presence or absence of Salmonella in accordance with USDA/FSIS standard laboratory procedures using 100 mL Butterfield’s Phosphate Diluent. Petrifilm™ 3 was utilized for enumeration of organisms and Salmonella incidence was determined using the BAX ® 4 System PCR assay. The lower detection level for all quantified groups of organisms was 1 colony forming unit per mL. The control group of paws had an Aerobic Plate Count of 4. 3 logs, a coliform count of 1. 6 logs and an E. coli count of 1. 6 logs. Two of the three control groups of paws were positive for Salmonella. Log reductions in Aerobic Plate Count were 0. 3, 0. 2 and 0. 6 for the Precure™ treatments at pH = 1. 85, 1. 7 and 1. 5, respectively. Reductions in coliform levels were 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 logs at pH= 1. 85, 1. 7 and 1. 5, respectively. The reduction in E. coli was log 0. 2 for all pH treatment groups. It {{should be noted that the}} control level of E. coli was only 0. 2 logs, thus all treatment groups resulted in no recovery of E. coli. As for Salmonella incidence, 0 of 3 samples was positive in the Precure™ pH= 1. 85 group, and 1 of 3 samples was positive in both the pH= 1. 7 and pH= 1. 5 treatment groups. Results from these trials indicate that a Precure™ spray at pH= 1. 5 is the most effective Precure™ treatment for reduction and elimination of microorganisms on chilled, cleaned broiler paws. However, it should be noted that microbial reductions were not greatly enhanced by lowering the pH of the Precure™ treatment from 1. 85 to 1. 5. In summary, effective application of Precure™ to broiler paws can provide the processor with an approved and very economical means of controlling spoilage and potentially pathogenic microorganisms...|$|E
