5|$|Past Alabama, NY63 {{continues}} northward {{across the}} Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge and into Orleans County. It traverses open, undeveloped {{areas of the}} town of Shelby to reach the village of Medina. This village begins at a junction with NY31 and NY31A. The latter highway continues eastward while the former joins NY63 through the village's historic central district <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> Street. At Center Street, NY31E comes in from the west and NY31 leaves NY63 to continue east. NY63 continues northwest <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> and Commercial streets {{to the edge of the}} village, where it turns northward onto Prospect Avenue and subsequently crosses over the Erie Canal. The northernmost two blocks of the overlap with NY31 are maintained by the village of Medina, as are the two blocks of Main Street leading away from the north end of the concurrency. This is the only segment of NY63 not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E

5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{adequate and}} reliable on secondary services throughout their working lives, their utility compounded by their light weight and steady handling.

5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|At this point, NY75 turns northeastward, {{overlapping}} with US62 into {{the nearby town}} of Hamburg along Gowanda State Road. Development along the highway quickly rises in density from a large farm and a pocket of homes {{at the start of the}} concurrency to a series of residential streets across the town line that make up the hamlet of Water Valley. The influx of homes brings US62 and NY75 across the main channel of Eighteenmile Creek and into the village of Hamburg, where the highway changes names to Pierce Avenue. The two routes remain concurrent for three blocks to an intersection with Lake Avenue, where Pierce Avenue becomes Main Street. While US62 continues east into Hamburg's central business district <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> Street, NY75 follows Lake Street northward along the mostly residential western edge of the village.|$|E

The western terminus was {{at the corner of}} West Chicago Road and US12 (Pulaski Highway) east of the US12/US31 interchange. From there, the business loop followed Chicago Road northeasterly through residential areas {{on the west side of}} town. Bus. US12 turned north along Lincoln Avenue and then east <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> Street, crossing the St. Joseph River. The loop intersected the southern end of M-139 at Front Street one block east of the river in downtown Niles. Four blocks further east, Bus. US12 met M-51. The two highways merged along Main Street and then turned south along 11th Street at an intersection that also marks the western terminus of Bus. M-60 (Oak Street). Bus. US12/M-51 continued south along 11th Street to the corner of US12 (Pulaski Highway) and M-51 (South 11th Street) where the business loop terminated.|$|E

Instead of following Willow Point Road, the highway remained on modern Gate Hill Road to {{the vicinity of}} Stony Point, where it entered the hamlet <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> Street. It was rerouted again between 1968 and 1973 to bypass Main Street to the south on Central Drive.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, NY12 and NY28 were shifted westward onto a new bypass {{around the}} village of Remsen. NY28B was {{extended}} southward along NY12 and NY28's former alignment <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> Street and westward on Steuben Street to meet the new highway. The NY28B designation was eliminated in the mid-1960s and replaced with NY920V, an unsigned reference route. Around the same time, NY287 was realigned onto the bypass that now carries NY365 around the northern fringe of {{the village of}} Prospect, truncating NY920V to its current length.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, the New York State Legislature created Route8-a, an {{unsigned}} legislative route connecting legislative Route8 in {{the center}} of Oxford to the Relief Corps Home by way of the east bank of the Chenango River. The Route8-a designation was removed in 1921 as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative routes. Its former routing became part of NY220, a new route extending from Smithville Flats to Oxford, in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY220 was rerouted near Oxford in 1982 to follow a new bridge over the Chenango River. The realignment created a short overlap with NY12 on North Canal Street between the former routing of NY220 <b>on</b> <b>Main</b> Street and the new river crossing to the north. The route was truncated from the New York State Veterans' Home at Oxford to NY12 in Oxford by January2017.|$|E
