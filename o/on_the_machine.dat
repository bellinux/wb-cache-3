5|$|The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), {{also known}} as the Baby, was {{designed}} as a test-bed for the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory, rather than as a practical computer. Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E
5|$|Steiner, Mitchell, and Hill {{feel they}} are ready to present, but at the event, Blanchard places acid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> when {{everyone}} is unaware, causing an explosion. The funding for Steiner's project is ended instantly, however, Mitchell later discovers that the device has been tampered with. Steiner goes to Blanchard's house, where Lembach and Latham are having dinner. He presents the men with the evidence that his machine was deliberately tampered with, and Lembach allows him to have another chance. Steiner decides to try to project himself to Lembach's house, and, with help from his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), he begins the procedure. However, right then, Mitchell and Hill return to the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Tammi Peyton enters AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators {{and plays}} her message machine, which {{contains}} the victim's {{phone call from}} the previous night. She attempts to get into her right desk drawer, when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about a message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine.</b> She mentions the murder to Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that {{it would be difficult to}} miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E
5|$|The Nimrod, {{built in}} the United Kingdom by Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain, was an early {{computer}} custom-built to play a computer game, {{one of the first}} games developed in the early history of video games. The twelve-by-nine-by-five-foot (3.7-by-2.7-by-1.5-metre) computer, designed by John Makepeace Bennett and built by engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams, allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of Nim against an artificial intelligence. The player pressed buttons on a raised panel corresponding with lights <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> to select their moves, and the Nimrod moved afterward, with its calculations represented by more lights. The speed of the Nimrod's calculations could be slowed down to allow the presenter to demonstrate exactly what the computer was doing, with more lights showing the state of the calculations. The Nimrod was intended to demonstrate Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain, though Festival attendees were more interested in playing the game than the logic behind it. After its initial exhibition in May, the Nimrod was shown for three weeks in October 1951 at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E
