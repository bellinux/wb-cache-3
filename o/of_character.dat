5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination.

5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive.

40|$|The modular {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> {{representations of}} a family of W-superalgebras extending the affine Lie superalgebra of gl(1 | 1) are considered. Modules fall into two classes, the generic type and the non-generic one. <b>Characters</b> <b>of</b> non-generic modules are expressed in terms of higher-level Appell-Lerch sums. We compute the modular transformations <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> and interpret the Mordell integral as an integral over <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> generic representations. The -span of a finite number <b>of</b> non-generic <b>characters</b> together with an uncountable set <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> <b>of</b> the generic type combine into a representation of SL(2;). The modular transformations are then used to define a product on the space <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> The fusion rules of the extended algebras are partially inherited from the known fusion rules for modules of the affine Lie superalgebra of gl(1 | 1). Moreover, the product obtained from the modular transformations coincides with the product of the Grothendieck ring <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> if and only if the fusion multiplicities are at most one.

On the Joystiq blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative urgency and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending. Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character.

The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations.
