5|$|Virgil Hodge {{was placed}} in heat four, {{competing}} against athletes like Jamaica's Sherone Simpson and the United States' Muna Lee. She ran her event in 23.17seconds, earning fifth of eight in her heat and falling 0.02seconds behind Bulgaria's Ivet Lalova. Overall, however, Hodge raked 19th out of 31. Hodge fell short <b>of</b> <b>Simpson,</b> who ranked first in quarterfinals, by 0.57seconds.|$|E
5|$|Sherone Simpson {{also participated}} in the women's 200 meters dash. During the August 18 {{qualification}} round, Simpson competed in the sixth heat, which included eight athletes.

5|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966–67. Playing in a side defeated 1–3, Chappell struggled to make an impression. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each. On the advice <b>of</b> <b>Simpson,</b> he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal. In the first Test of 1967–68 against India, he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but he rode his luck to score 151 – his innings contained five chances that the Indians failed to take. However, {{in the remainder of}} the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings, so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty {{chocolate}} milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} toaster while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost. The next morning at the breakfast table, Lisa asks if there could ever be any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range <b>of</b> <b>Simpson</b> families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colombian film director Simon Brand, in Los Angeles between April 6 and April 8, 2001, and was choreographed by Dan Karaty. Shot in a set with futuristic backdrops, Simpson assumes {{the role of a}} spy on a mission in the video. It begins with Simpson exiting a helicopter then entering a building to compromise evidence in a laboratory there. Simpson takes the elevator which opens onto a pathway. While she is walking, a gadget appears on the floor followed by a small explosion. In the next scene, Simpson walks through a water tunnel, out of which she is pulled by a robotic hand. As the video progresses, Simpson is shown dancing {{in a room full of}} mirrors. Scenes of ninjas climbing up a rope hanging from top of the building are inter-cut with scenes <b>of</b> <b>Simpson</b> dancing until the laboratory explodes. Simpson is next shown dancing on the rooftop alongside the ninjas before a helicopter arrives and Simpson boards it.|$|E

25|$|Sigourney and her {{squadron}} continued {{operations with}} TF31 until 6 May 1944.

On the night of 29 February1 March, Sigourney, with DesRon 22, engaged in an antishipping sweep <b>of</b> <b>Simpson</b> Harbor and then bombarded Rabaul and the airfield on Duke of York Island in the Bismarck Archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Finding many {{families}} unwilling to sign provisions, Finlayson felt {{pressure to get}} a number of willing emigrants as previously ordered.

This new clause came with a major stipulation, as Finlayson later explained to his superiors. The sales would happen only if the Oregon Question was settled with British receiving the northern bank of the Columbia River, rather than a direct continuation of the 49th parallel.|$|E

25|$|After {{driving to}} midfield, the Chargers faced third and 10 with 2:08 remaining. Buffalo sent safety Steve Freeman on a blitz {{for the next}} play, leaving Smith, San Diego's No. 3 receiver, one on one with Simpson. Earlier in the game, Simpson had knocked {{the ball out of}} Smith's hands during a catch attempt and then picked it off in mid air. But this time, Smith managed to get one step ahead <b>of</b> <b>Simpson,</b> make the catch, and evade his desperate diving tackle attempt, leaving Simpson face down on the turf as he raced 50 yards for a touchdown. Edwards sealed the victory for the Chargers after the ensuing kickoff by {{recording}} his second interception from Ferguson with 1:16 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Jones now led Ranger {{back across}} the Irish Sea, hoping to make another attempt at the Drake, still {{anchored}} off Carrickfergus. This time, {{late in the afternoon}} of April 24, 1778, the ships, roughly equal in firepower, engaged in combat. Earlier in the day, the Americans had captured the crew of a reconnaissance boat, and learned that Drake had taken on dozens of soldiers, with the intention of grappling and boarding Ranger, so Jones made sure that did not happen, capturing Drake after an hour-long gun battle which cost the British captain his life. Lieutenant Simpson was given command of Drake for the return journey to Brest. The ships separated during the return journey as Ranger chased another prize, leading to a conflict between Simpson and Jones. Both ships arrived at port safely, but Jones filed for a court-martial <b>of</b> <b>Simpson,</b> keeping him detained on the ship.|$|E
25|$|Although the wicket at the Gabba usually favours fast bowlers {{both teams}} used a leg spinner and two off-spinners in the match, Bob Barber, Fred Titmus and Dave Allen for England and Peter Philpott, Tom Veivers and Bob Cowper for Australia. Vice-captain Brian Booth took command as Bobby Simpson had broken his wrist, and elected to bat {{after winning the}} toss. The 19-year-old Doug Walters was called up for his Test debut after having made 129 for New South Wales against the {{tourists}} {{and so was the}} fast bowler Peter Allan on his home ground. Bill Lawry's Victorian teammate Ian Redpath was brought in to open instead <b>of</b> <b>Simpson.</b> The veteran batsman Peter Burge ensured his place with innings of 52, 50, 114 not out and 60 against the MCC. The tourists had had the best run of games of any MCC team since the war, beating Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, drawing with Queensland, when they needed two more wickets to win, and losing to Victoria by 32 runs after a run-chase. As a result, the bookies reduced the odds of their winning the Ashes from 7/2 to evens. The England vice-captain Colin Cowdrey was unable to play and was replaced by the in form Scottish opener Eric Russell.|$|E

25|$|In May 1977 Kerry Packer {{announced}} he was organising a breakaway competition – World Series Cricket (WSC) – after the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) refused to accept Channel Nine's bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia's Test matches in 1976. Packer secretly signed leading international cricketers to his competition, including 28 Australians. Almost all of the Australian Test team {{at the time were}} signed to WSC – notable exceptions including Gary Cosier, Geoff Dymock, Kim Hughes and Craig Serjeant – and the Australian selectors were forced to pick what was generally considered a third-rate team from players in the Sheffield Shield. Former player Bob Simpson, who had retired 10 years previously after a conflict with the board, was recalled at the age of 41 to captain Australia against India. Jeff Thomson was named deputy in a team that included seven debutants. Australia managed to win the series 3–2, mainly thanks to the batting <b>of</b> <b>Simpson,</b> who scored 539 runs, including two centuries; and the bowling of Wayne Clark, who took 28 wickets. Australia lost the next series 3-1 against the West Indies, which was fielding a full strength team, and also lost the 1978–79 Ashes series 5–1, the team's worst Ashes result in Australia. Graham Yallop was named as captain for the Ashes, with Kim Hughes taking over for the 1979–80 tour of India. Rodney Hogg took 41 wickets in his debut series, an Australian record. WSC players returned to the team for the 1979–80 season after a settlement between the ACB and Kerry Packer. Greg Chappell was reinstated as captain.|$|E
