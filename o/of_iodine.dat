5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog <b>of</b> <b>iodine,</b> {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it probably has a higher melting point than that <b>of</b> <b>iodine.</b> Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those <b>of</b> <b>iodine.</b> It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} producers <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> {{today are}} Chile and Japan. Iodine {{and its compounds}} are primarily used in nutrition. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material.

50|$|As in {{the case}} <b>of</b> Lugol's <b>iodine,</b> the role <b>of</b> iodide in the {{solution}} is to increase the solubility <b>of</b> the elemental <b>iodine,</b> by turning it to the soluble triiodide anion I3−. However, since iodine has moderate solubility in ethanol, it is also assisted by this solvent directly. Lugol's iodine, by contrast, has no alcohol, and has twice the mass of potassium iodide as <b>of</b> elemental <b>iodine.</b>|$|R

5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess <b>of</b> <b>iodine,</b> particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> {{is concentrated in}} thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, fetal thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.|$|E

40|$|Equilibrium {{dialysis}} on povidone-iodine-solutions (Braunol, standardized Betadine and non-standardized iso-Betadine {{reveal that}} the amount <b>of</b> available <b>iodine,</b> free iodine, iodide and triiodide varies significantly both in the undiluted and diluted forms. These differences {{are reflected in the}} different bactericidal activity against Staphyloccus aureus as determined by the standard quantitative in vitro suspension test. The amount <b>of</b> available <b>iodine</b> is not an appropriate measure for an assessment of the microbicidal activity. For this, the free iodine has to be determined by means of equilibrium dialysis. The free iodine concentration in the Braunol concentrate was found to be 22 mg/L, in the standardized Betadine 9. 7 mg/L and in the non-standardized Betadine concentrate only 2. 1 mg/L. Because of the atypical behaviour of iodophores and the increase <b>of</b> free <b>iodine</b> at dilution and because of a bactericidal level <b>of</b> free <b>iodine</b> <b>of</b> 5 mg/L, Braunol and standardized Betadine can be employed as disinfectant as such, iso-Betadine has to be diluted before use.

5|$|Unlike {{chlorine}} and bromine {{which have}} one significant main use dwarfing all others, iodine {{is used in}} many applications of varying importance. About half of all produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds; another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form potassium iodide, and another 15% for other inorganic iodine compounds. The remaining 5% is for minor uses. Among the major uses <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from tincture <b>of</b> <b>iodine),</b> and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, cloud seeding, and various uses in analytical chemistry.|$|E

All dips contained 1. 0 % available iodine and high levels <b>of</b> free <b>iodine</b> for germicidal efficacy. Barrier 1 was an experimental dip containing 14 to 20 ppm <b>of</b> free <b>iodine,</b> barrier 2 contained 8 to 14 ppm <b>of</b> free <b>iodine,</b> and the nonbarrier control contained 12 to 16 ppm <b>of</b> free <b>iodine.</b> The average free iodine for barrier 1 and barrier 2 combined was 14 ppm, which was equal to the average free iodine for the positive control.

5|$|Iodine deficiency, {{most common}} in inland and mountainous areas, can {{predispose}} to goitre – if widespread, known as endemic goitre. Pregnant women deficient <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency.

5|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} element for life and is the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms. (Lanthanum and the other lanthanides, as well as tungsten, are used by a few microorganisms.) It {{is required for the}} synthesis of the growth-regulating thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T4 and T3 respectively, named after their number <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> atoms). A deficiency <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 and a concomitant enlargement of the thyroid tissue in an attempt to obtain more iodine, causing the disease known as simple goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a'). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes; thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.|$|E

5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women.

In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often in the form of Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, new studies suggest that Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets.

5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
