Her repairs were completed at Sheerness Dockyard on 25 May. During {{the initial stages of}} the evacuation from Dunkirk the ship provided cover {{in the northern part of}} the Channel to the evacuation forces and took part in the rescue of 33 survivors on 28 May from the coaster , which had been torpedoed by an E-boat. She made one trip to Dunkirk during the night of 28/29 May and was caught in Dunkirk harbour by German Stukas during the following day. Grenade was hit by two bombs which set her afire and killed 14 sailors and mortally wounded another four men. The ship was cast off from her berth, in case she sank there, and then drifted into the harbour channel. The trawler John Cattling towed Grenade over to the west side of the <b>outer</b> <b>harbour</b> where her magazines exploded later that evening.|$|E

40|$|The INRAM {{project is}} an {{integrated}} project {{funded by the}} Belgian Science Policy to develop practical techniques and procedures to detect the risks of micropollutants occurring in the Belgian coastal zone. The underlying objective of the INRAM project {{is to develop a}} novel, multidisciplinary methodology - based on a suite of chemical, biological and ecological measurements - to evaluate the health of marine ecosystems. To this end, an extended list of micropollutants will be analyzed in water, sediment and suspended solids of 18 sampling stations in the Belgian coastal harbours, the Belgian Continental Shelf and the Scheldt Estuary. In addition, body burdens of these compounds will be determined in biota (mussels, oysters, shrimps and flatfish). These will be linked with in situ biometric and biomarker responses in resident and transplanted organisms. Field samplings and insitu studies run over four years (January 2007 - December 2010). The field study allows an identification of potential problem chemicals which will be evaluated through laboratory exposures. Preliminary results show organotin concentrations in the water column to vary within and between the harbours with maxima of up to 12 ng - 1 in <b>outer</b> <b>harbours</b> and increasing up to 7 ng. l - 1 in the inner harbours. The adverse effect of the presence of these micropollutants (and possibly other contaminants not yet analyzed) were studied in a pilot test with caged bivalves and in lab experiments with larval oysters. The health condition indicators of the caged oysters decreased significantly towards the inner harbour.

40|$|This study {{provided}} {{a picture of}} the spatial and temporal distributions of Cr, Co, Ni Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb in bottom sediments of Tolo Harbour. The concentrations of the eight heavy metals differed significantly between sites due to the poor tidal flushing in Tolo Harbour. The levels of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were generally enriched in sediments from inner Tolo Harbour, while sediments from <b>outer</b> Tolo <b>Harbour</b> (Tolo Channel) had higher levels of Cr, Co and Ni. The redox sensitive element arsenic showed no distinct spatial pattern in Tolo Harbour. The decreasing levels of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in sediments with increasing distance from land demonstrated a typical diffusion pattern from land to the direction of sea. Two hot spots of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in sediments were located near Tai Po and Sha Tin new town, indicating that Cu, Zn, Pb and Zn were from land-derived sources. The sites with relatively high levels of Cr, Co and Ni in sediments were located in areas close to waste spoil in sea floor. The natural and anthropogenic inputs from Sha Tin and Tai Po to Tolo Harbour were mostly responsible for Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb enrichment in sediments from inner Tolo Harbour. The waste spoil in sea floor was believed to contribute to the Cr, Co and Ni in <b>outer</b> Tolo <b>Harbour.</b> The results of correlation coefficient between the eight heavy metals showed that Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were strongly positively correlated, and Cr, Co and Ni were also significantly correlated with each other. The best explanation of strong correlation was their similar source. As, however, is not well correlated with the other seven heavy metals. The average concentrations of Cu and Zn displayed general increasing trends from 1978 to 2006 in Tolo Harbour, while the mean levels of Cr and Pb displayed a substantial decrease from 1978 to 1987, then a slight increase after 1987. No distinct temporal trends of the concentrations of Ni and As were observed from 1978 due to the inconsecutive data. On the other hand, the increasing trends of Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were observed since 1996. © 2009 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
