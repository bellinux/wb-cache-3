5|$|Serevi did not {{represent}} Fiji in sevens in 2003, being controversially <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> Fiji's Hong Kong Sevens squad. Serevi {{had been unable to}} return to Fiji for a fitness test and national tournament due to commitments with his club Stade Montois in France. Because of this he was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the team, despite being available to play in the tournament.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} series against Pakistan, Kartik was only {{selected in the}} first, third and fifth matches, and took two wickets {{at an average of}} 68.00 at an economy rate of 5.23. As a result, Kartik was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the ODI tour of Australia in favour of Chawla.|$|E
5|$|Project M 2.5 was {{featured}} {{for a special}} invitation 16-person tournament at Apex 2013. Version 3.0 {{was featured}} the following year as well, but was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> inclusion at Apex 2015, prompting negative reactions from players.|$|E

60|$|Let us <b>omit</b> <b>from</b> our consideration, for the present, the {{memories}} in which words replace images. These are always, I think, really habit-memories, {{the memories}} that use images being the typical true memories.|$|R
60|$|Young Overton's face {{assumed the}} bothered {{look of the}} man who is more {{accustomed}} to using his muscles than his wits, but by degrees, with many repetitions and obscurities which I may <b>omit</b> <b>from</b> his narrative, he laid his strange story before us.|$|R
5|$|With {{the advent}} of new media, pro-PAP views in {{mainstream}} media are countered by websites expressing the views of Internet users which have been <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> newspapers and television, thus providing additional platforms for expression which are vital in inculcating a more open and democratic society.|$|E
5|$|Anthony LaPaglia {{was cast}} as Al Capone and filmed a single scene, which was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the final cut, {{and can be}} found in the DVD's deleted scenes. Mendes {{believed}} that Capone was more menacing as an unseen presence. Actor Alfred Molina was approached to portray Capone, but Molina was forced to turn the role down due to scheduling conflicts with Frida (2002).|$|E
5|$|Because Wells Cathedral was secular {{rather than}} monastic, cloisters {{were not a}} {{practical}} necessity. They were <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> several other secular cathedrals but were built here and at Chichester. Explanations for their construction at these two secular cathedrals range from the processional to the aesthetic. As at Chichester, there is no northern range to the cloisters. In monastic cloisters it was the north range, benefiting most from winter sunlight, that was often used as a scriptorium.|$|E
60|$|<b>Omitting</b> <b>from</b> our {{count the}} two minor and ill-finished {{sketches}} of the Black Dwarf and Legend of Montrose, and, {{for a reason}} presently to be noticed, the unhappy St. Ronan's, the memorable romances of Scott are eighteen, falling into three distinct groups, containing six each.|$|R

Including eight earlier plays that he chose to <b>omit</b> <b>from</b> his published works, the total is sixty-two.|$|R
5|$|Boyd {{suffered}} from a fear of flying, which had on occasion caused difficulties in his football career. Chosen by the Birmingham County Football Association for a representative match in Hamburg in 1953, the players were already at the airport when he requested to be <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the team. While his teammates flew to Birmingham's Fairs Cup match in Milan, Boyd travelled across the English Channel by boat and then across France and into Italy by train.|$|E
5|$|But {{he failed}} to ensure the {{fighting}} qualities of these soldiers earned them a proportionate share of recognition and honours. Further, despite claims that Chauvel alone had {{a clear view of}} the battle, that his coolness and skill were crucial in gaining the victory, his name was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the long list of honours published on New Year's Day 1917. Murray did offer Chauvel a lesser award (a Distinguished Service Order) for Romani which he declined.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the gains}} {{provided}} by Harvey were outweighed by Lindwall's absence, which severely hampered Australia's bowling {{and made their}} eventual victory much more difficult. England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 on the final afternoon to complete an eight-wicket victory. Due to his injury, Lindwall was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the team for the two matches {{leading up to the}} Second Test. Australia proceeded to defeat Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire.|$|E

50|$|It {{would not}} be fair to <b>omit</b> <b>from</b> {{consideration}} what {{is probably one of}} the chief factors tending to restrict families. This is the desire of parents with small incomes to educate their children more satisfactorily than they themselves were educated, and to give their children the means for rising in the social scale.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to official localizations, {{for example the}} one by CD Projekt for the Polish market, fan communities developed Spanish, Hungarian, and Italian fan translations of the game. When Interplay dropped support for Planescape: Torment after the official 1.1 patch, several not yet fixed bugs were corrected by fan created unofficial patches. Other mods add back items and quests <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> {{the final version of}} the game or new features such as widescreen support.|$|E
5|$|In his 12 starts {{before the}} All-Star break, Lin {{averaged}} 22.5points and 8.7assists, and New York had a 9–3 record. He {{played in the}} Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star Weekend. He was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the original Rising Stars roster, but was added after his sudden rise to stardom. Some media outlets—including USA Today, Los Angeles Times, and CBSSports.com—stated that he deserved {{to play in the}} All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|Kisnorbo {{was part}} of the Leeds defence, who were {{defeated}} 3–0 by Swindon Town. Kisnorbo was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the Leeds squad in the next game against Colchester United after being ruled out by injury.

These are the health problems that Dr. Harris has been investigating in New York City among large groups of the population...|$|R
60|$|You {{see this}} prayer {{is simply the}} {{expansion}} of that clause of the Lord's Prayer which most men eagerly <b>omit</b> <b>from</b> it,--Fiat voluntas tua. In being so, it sums the Christian prayer of all ages. See now, in the third place, how far this king's letter I am going to read to you sums also Christian Policy.|$|R
5|$|Nani {{made his}} first {{appearance}} for the senior Portuguese team on 1 September 2006, and marked his debut with a goal in Portugal's 4–2 friendly defeat to Denmark. Nani was <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> Portugal's 1–1 draw with Armenia, but was recalled for Euro 2008 qualifiers against Poland and Serbia in September. He also provided the assist for Ricardo Quaresma's goal in a friendly against Italy on 6 February 2008. Nani was ruled out of Portugal's friendly with Greece in March 2008 due to injury.|$|E
5|$|Opposition MPs {{complained that}} several {{recommendations}} for access-to-information reform were <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the bill, and were instead sent to committee for further review. New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin {{suggested that this}} deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future. Martin later {{made a deal with}} Baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee, in return for the Conservatives accepting some NDP amendments.|$|E
5|$|The {{avionics}} were unsuitable due to poor {{risk analysis}} and necessary requirements <b>omitted</b> <b>from</b> the procurement contract. The Times {{claimed that the}} Ministry of Defence planned to perform software integration itself, without Boeing's involvement, {{in order to reduce}} costs. While lacking certification, the helicopters were only permitted to fly in visual meteorological conditions and subsequently stored in climate controlled hangars.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of rhyming slang involves replacing a common word with a phrase {{of two or}} more words, the last of which rhymes with the original word; then, in almost all cases, <b>omitting,</b> <b>from</b> the end of the phrase, the secondary rhyming word (which is thereafter implied), making the origin and meaning of the phrase elusive to listeners not in the know.|$|R
