25|$|After the Pigeon Roost Massacre in 1812, the Becks built {{two small}} forts on the {{property}} to protect against Indians, and perhaps also due to Indians stealing three barrels of whiskey from George Beck. The new protection began to draw new residents. In 1814 the settlement of Beck's Mill was in consideration to be the county seat of Washington County, only for Salem to eventually get the coveted position. Today the settlement, a few yards uphill from the mill, is the crossroad of Beck's Mill Road and Old Vincennes trail, with a former fire station and country store being its main signs of civilization. The Stage Coach stop from New Albany, Indiana was also located at the SW corner and is still standing. The Beck's Hill store has been reopened and is {{owned and operated by}} Bill and Annie Smith. It is operated as an old general store and museum. Food is also served, the menu consists of soups, sandwiches and soft ice cream.An extremely <b>old</b> <b>dwelling</b> on the SE adjoining the store and also belonging to Smith's is being restored.|$|E

60|$|Originally El Cajon {{had been}} a Spanish grant of several {{thousand}} acres, and three generations of Spanish dons had resided there.

60|$|Surgical evidence, however, {{is a fact}} 'that winna ding,' and I do {{not rely}} on the theory of suicide. But, if Godfrey was murdered by Catholics, it seems odd that nobody has suggested, as the {{probable}} scene, the Savoy, which lay next {{on the right to}} Somerset Yard. The Savoy, so well described by Scott in Peveril of the Peak, and by Macaulay, was by this time a rambling, ruinous, labyrinth of lanes and dilapidated dwellings, tenanted by adventurers and skulking Catholics. It was an Alsatia, says Macaulay, more dangerous than the Bog of Allen, or the passes of the Grampians. A courageous magistrate might be lured into the Savoy to stop a fight, or on any similar pretence; and, once within a rambling <b>old</b> <b>dwelling</b> of the Hospital, would be in far greater peril than in the Queen's guarded residence. Catholic adventurers might here destroy Godfrey, either for his alleged zeal, or to seize his papers, or because he, so great a friend of Catholics as he was, might know too much. The body could much more easily be removed, perhaps by water, from the Savoy, than from the guarded gates of Somerset House. Oates knew the Savoy, and said falsely that he had met Coleman there.* If murder was done, the Savoy was as good a place for the deed as the Forest of Bondy.|$|E
