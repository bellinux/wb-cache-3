500|$|In his career, Russell {{won five}} regular season MVP awards (1959, 1961–63, 1965)—tied with Michael Jordan for second all-time behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's six awards. He was {{selected}} {{three times to}} the All-NBA First Teams (1959, 1963, 1965) and eight Second Teams (1958, 1960–62, 1964, 1966–68), and was a twelve-time NBA All-Star (1958–1969). Russell was elected to one NBA All-Defensive First Team. This took place during his last season (1969), {{and was the first}} season the NBA All-Defensive Teams were selected. In 1970, The Sporting News named Russell the [...] "Athlete of the Decade". Russell is universally seen {{as one of the best}} NBA players ever, and was declared [...] "Greatest Player in the History of the NBA" [...] by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980. For his achievements, Russell was named [...] "Sportsman of the Year" [...] by Sports Illustrated in 1968. He also made all three NBA Anniversary Teams: the NBA 25th Anniversary All-Time Team (1970), the NBA 35th Anniversary All-Time Team (1980) and the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team (1996). Russell ranked #18 on ESPN's 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century in 1999. In 2009, SLAM Magazine named Russell the #3 player of all time behind Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain. Former NBA player and head coach, Don Nelson, described Bill Russell in a quote that says, [...] "There are two types of superstars. One makes himself look good at the expense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guys</b> on the floor. But there's another type who makes the players around him look better than they are, and that's the type Russell was." ...|$|E

In November 2003 Mariani remembered [...] "CCR's 'Down on the Corner' at my very first gig. I knew it note for note but then when I went to play it, nerves kicked in... And I didn't play 'Down on the Corner' that's for sure!!" [...] His other early influences were The Raspberries, Badfinger and Big Star. After high school, Mariani attended college.|$|E
2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guys</b> in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to}} me to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch me play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In a lot of cases I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E

[...] "The (Ferrari 126C) turbo pressure was very, very difficult to control. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reason {{that they were able to}} pass one another so evenly was that one would go through a sticky patch and sort of only be giving 4-bar of boost or 4.2, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> would be getting a burst of 4.5, so it would have <b>the</b> legs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy.</b> It wasn't quite as spectacular as it appeared at the time." ...|$|R

50|$|In 2010, he {{starred in}} the drama Mother and Child and portrayed an {{interrogator}} who attempts to locate several nuclear weapons in the direct-to-video film Unthinkable.

5000|$|The {{album was}} hugely {{compared}} with their first installment. Whereas the album was given positive response by critics. In the review by Julien Loeper the album is given a positive review saying, [...] "The album has {{its fair share of}} problems. As mentioned before, not all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beats are great and while they are different in sound, they never really experiment past beyond their basic grooves. There is decent rapping on here too, but this reeks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> overshadowing <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> They need to balance out the rapping more. On a plus note, the guest spots from 4-Zone, Apathy and Celph Titled are awesome and are really worth hearing. A decent album in and of itself, but it needs major improvement." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars and states [...] "Soundtrack, stomps with all <b>the</b> fury <b>of</b> a live gospel choir trying to claim Saturday night for God instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy...</b> <b>The</b> band is {{in a heavy}} Latin mood, where the blues, samba, bossa, hard bop, modal, and even soul are drenched in the blues. With only four tunes presented, the Charles Lloyd Quartet, while a tad more dissonant {{than it had been}} in 1966 and 1967, swings much harder, rougher, and get-to-the-groove quicker than any band Lloyd had {{previously}} led... This band would split soon after, when Jarrett left to play with Miles Davis, but if this was a live swansong, they couldn't have picked a better gig to issue".|$|R

5000|$|In February 2005, LaBeouf {{was arrested}} by police in Los Angeles and charged with {{assault with a deadly}} weapon after {{threatening}} his neighbor by driving into his car. A bystander claimed that LaBeouf [...] "lost his cool" [...] after he had to wait to get access to his garage while the neighbor, who was blocking his path, chatted to his girlfriend. The onlooker said: [...] "Shia began honking his horn and yelling at the guy, but the neighbor told him to wait a minute, and carried on talking to his girlfriend.

He was more child-like than the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guys</b> in the band. So it's a song about Spencer Dryden being the old guy but still being a child.

[...] Still, Rockies fans will always remember his terrific 1994 season for an upstart club, as evidenced by their playoff berth the next year. He finished the 1994 season with a 10-2 win-loss record and a 2.80 ERA, which still stands as Rockies record. He finished his MLB career with the hometown Chicago White Sox in 1996.|$|E

5000|$|... {{the narrator}} explores his own {{relational}} shortcomings but continues to delude himself {{into thinking that}} everything is alright. The first verse expresses his guilt, admitting “I treat her so mean, I don’t deserve what I have / And I think that she’ll forget just by making her laugh”. The second verse, half of which is repeated after the bridge, discusses his jealousy and insecurity, hinting at his emotional abuse of her. He sings, “I get so jealous <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> / And then I’m not happy till I make her break down and cry”. But he also recognizes his hypocrisy: “When I look at other girls, it must kill her inside”. But all these issues, in his mind at least, are taken care <b>of</b> by <b>the</b> fact that “she can tell I really love her”. The choruses express the sentiment that because she knows him so well, {{none of these things}} matter. They do, of course, but his delusion makes for a more interesting song.|$|R

The song [...] "Plaza" [...] refers to Sydney's Plaza Hotel, where Don Walker was living in Kings Cross at the time. Walker later said, [...] "As a whole set of songs, it painted a picture of a certain time and a certain place which is very close to my heart. And in many ways that set of songs is quite {{personal}} to me rather than any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guys</b> because they all moved out of the Cross within three weeks.

There wasn't any authentic meaning going into the creation. However, before I presented the song {{to the rest of}} the guys in the band, I made sure I had enough material composed, to compile an entire song. The guitar riffs were ready, and the basic idea of the vocals and melody I had ready. And to finish off the actual lyrics, I wrote them in a few minutes, right in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guys</b> that same night at band practice. And to be completely honest, I didn't know what I was writing about (lyrically). I just wrote in words that naturally fit with the flow of the vocal phrasing and melody.

I love Vicky and Marc so much because they truly, truly believed in our band and put their own asses on the line for us. The Vicky thing was devastating to me personally. It was just like this reunion bullshit with Axl in that I had no say in it whatsoever. I didn't want to see Vicky leave as our manager, not at ALL, but a couple, a couple <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guys</b> did.

2500|$|Ragano {{also claimed}} that Trafficante, four {{days prior to}} his death, {{delivered}} a deathbed confession which suggested that Marcello was meant to assassinate Robert F.
