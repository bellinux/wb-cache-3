5|$|At the hospital, Natasha blames Andrew for the crash. She learns Ed has a {{fractured}} collarbone and sits with {{him until he}} wakes up. When he does, Natasha kisses him. They begin dating, but Natasha worries {{that they do not}} have much in common. Natasha helps organise a ball for the university and takes an immediate dislike to Ed's vintage suit. She spills coffee on it and then lends Ed a nicer <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> found. Ed realises what she has done and they fight. After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too different. When Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul.

However, at that moment, Iwate caught sight of the protective charm that the woman had on her, giving Iwate a great surprise. It was the very same <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> left for her daughter when she left the capital. The woman she had just killed was none other than her very own daughter.|$|E
25|$|By 3:30 on 1 September Psyche {{had caught}} up with the Dutch vessels and run them ashore. She went as close as the water depth would allow, {{anchored}} and exchanged fire with them. All three surrendered quickly. <b>One</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> captured was the 24-gun corvette Scipio, which had a crew of 150 men. Scipio was badly shot up and her commander, Captain-Lieutenant Jan Hendrik Correga, had been mortally wounded. The largest armed merchant ship was the Resolutie, of 700 tons. She had a valuable cargo and as passengers the colours and staff of the Dutch 23rd European Battalion. The third vessel was the brig Ceres, of 12 guns and 70 men. Pellew had too few men to {{be able to deal with}} the prisoners so he paroled the officers to the governor of Samarang and gave up the all the other men against a receipt. The British took Scipio into service under her existing name, but then renamed her Samarang.|$|E

25|$|Thirty-five years later, Babette Hersant (Stéphane Audran) {{appears at}} their door. She carries only {{a letter from}} Papin, {{explaining}} {{that she is a}} refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris, and recommending her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to take Babette in, but she offers to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next 14 years, producing an improved version of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation, and slowly gaining their respect. Her only link to her former life is a lottery ticket that a friend in Paris renews for her every year. One day, she wins the lottery of 10,000 francs. Instead of using the money to return to Paris and her lost lifestyle, she decides to spend it preparing a delicious dinner for the sisters and their small congregation {{on the occasion of the}} founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice; Babette tells no <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is spending her entire winnings on the meal.|$|E
25|$|Maxwell {{approached}} her agent for ideas. The agent {{suggested that she}} look into thrillers, romance novels and horror fiction, as all three were becoming very popular. After reading several horror novels, Maxwell realized {{that she would not}} enjoy writing that type of fiction. Her husband brought her five Silhouette novels, three of which were for a brand-new line, Sihouette Desire. Although Maxwell thought the novels were well written, she did not really enjoy the first four stories. The last <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> read, Corporate Affair by Stephanie James (a.k.a. Jayne Ann Krentz) made her {{fall in love with the}} genre. Because she had never read romance novels before, Maxwell picked up over fifty additional category romances to familiarize herself with the expected format and then set out to write her own romance. The resulting novel, Summer Thunder, published in 1982, was the debut of her romance career. This novel, and the more than thirty that have followed, are published under the pseudonym Elizabeth Lowell, a combination of Ann's middle name (Elizabeth) and Evan's middle name (Lowell), even though the books are written solely by Ann.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} an {{interviewer}} about her thought {{process for the}} performance, Knowles described [...] "Laundromat" [...] {{as one of her}} most-played songs, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> always wanted to cover.

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by EMI Music Publishing {{on the website}} Musicnotes.com, [...] "Poison" [...] is a slow-tempo song with hundred beats per minute. It was composed using common time in the key of G major. Beyoncé's vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of D5. In the song, Beyoncé sings about a relationship that she knows {{is not good for}} her, but still <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> cannot give up.

500|$|The {{song was}} added to the set list for Gaga's 2012 Born This Way Ball. The [...] {{performance}} featured the original choreography, with Gaga wearing a white, ram-style outfit designed by Haus of Gaga. During the European leg of the tour, Gaga began the performance in an egg-shaped container reminiscent of the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> emerged from at the 53rd Grammy Awards. In 2014, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was included on the setlist of her show at South by Southwest, where she performed it in a country version, and performed it during her residency show, Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom, while strapping on a rose-covered keytar. In the same year, Gaga performed the song on her [...] tour, in a neon anime inspired dress. In July 2016, Gaga performed it in a piano medley along with [...] "You and I" [...] and the Beatles' [...] "Come Together" [...] at the [...] "Camden Rising" [...] concert at the BB Pavilion in Camden, New Jersey, which was part of the 2016 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
500|$|Iger {{subsequently}} contacted Tom Hanks {{to consider}} {{playing the role}} of Walt Disney, which would become the first-ever depiction of Disney in a mainstream film. Hanks accepted the role, viewing it as [...] "an opportunity to play somebody as world-shifting as Picasso or Chaplin". Hanks made several visits to the Walt Disney Family Museum and interviewed some of Disney's former employees and family relatives, including his daughter Diane Disney Miller. The film was subsequently dedicated to Disney Miller, who died shortly before it was released. In April 2012, Emma Thompson entered final negotiations to star as P. L. Travers, after the studio was unable to secure Meryl Streep for the part. Thompson said that the role was the most difficult <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has played, describing Travers as [...] "a woman of quite eye-watering complexity and contradiction." [...] "She wrote a very good essay on sadness, because she was, in fact, a very sad woman. She'd had a very rough childhood, the alcoholism of her father being part of it and the attempted suicide of her mother being another part of it. I think that she spent her whole life in a state of fundamental inconsolability and hence got a lot done." [...] Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, B. J. Novak, and Ruth Wilson were cast in July 2012.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Carey {{signed a}} new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she {{released}} her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey {{back to the top}} of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the most}} anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and not anything to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She describe E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album [...] "It's hard for me to sit here and talk about it without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album. I think that having the success with the last record allowed me to have more [...] freedom...and just make records that I like. Its kind of a really fun record.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Anime News Network, Mikhail Koulikov {{wrote that}} readers would have various reactions to The One I Love: {{he felt that}} some would regard it as [...] "charming" [...] and others would find it upsetting that the female protagonists were primarily defined by their worry over their relationships. While considering it one of Clamp's minor works, he stated that it was [...] "unusual" [...] for including some colored pages when the majority of manga is printed in black and white; being a slice-of-life manga; and featuring Tsubaki Nekoi's art, as prior {{to the time of}} his review, most of their works translated into English had been drawn by another member of Clamp. Koulikov wrote that [...] "insecurity and self-doubt" [...] served as the theme of the anthology. Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, wrote that some of the stories were worrisome, particularly <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> felt [...] "justifies having an interest in whatever your boyfriend likes," [...] and contained stereotypes as a result of limited space. She also stated that the essays included generalizations about women and [...] "quickly become redundant." [...] In , Mason Templar suggested a possible theme of being one's self in [...] relationships, but felt that it appeared [...] "almost anti-feminist in execution," [...] as only the female characters underwent a change in behavior. Templar rated the series one-and-a-half out of four stars, and criticized it as a naïve take on romance; Templar suggested Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, or Man of Many Faces as better examples of Clamp's romantic manga. A reviewer of the French edition wrote that repetitive nature of the stories detracted from the manga's appeal, and made for a [...] "laborious" [...] reading experience, although the reviewer felt that a [...] "romantic" [...] reader would not mind this. Conversely, another reviewer for Anime News Network, Liann Cooper, wrote that the stories were [...] "incredibly sweet and touching" [...] and were best read a few stories at a time. According to Cooper, The One I Love would appeal to fans of Clamp or shōjo, manga targeted towards girls.|$|E

She cited that Lost Love is also central to soap operas and film. The romance of Tad and Dixie is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> took note of.|$|E

50|$|Although {{not seen}} on-panel, Psylocke's {{counterpart}} of the Marvel Comics 2 universe (Earth-982) {{was at least}} mentioned. Apparently, this Psylocke acted as a godmother to Wild Thing, the daughter of Wolverine and Elektra, and she also trained her {{in the use of}} her psychic powers. Wild Thing had no real claws but psionic <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could use in similar ways to Psylocke's psychic katana.|$|R

[...] Kennedy then requested the keys to his mother's car from his chauffeur, Crimmins. Asked why he did not have his chauffeur drive them both, Kennedy explained that Crimmins and some other guests [...] "were concluding their meal, enjoying the fellowship and it didn't appear to me necessary to require him to bring me back to Edgartown."

2500|$|In her 1977 [...] Christie made {{a slight}} mistake {{with the name}} of the {{serialisation}} and refers to it as Anna the Adventuress (possibly confusing it with the 1904 book of the same name by E. Phillips Oppenheim). Irrespective of this mistake, the change from her preferred title was not of her choosing and the newspaper's choice was <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> considered to be [...] "as silly a title as I have ever heard". She raised no objections, however, as the Evening News were paying her £500 (£ in current terms) for the serial rights which she and her family considered an enormous sum. At Archie (her first husband)'s suggestion, Christie used the money to purchase a grey, bottle-nosed Morris Cowley. She later stated that acquiring her own car ranked with dining at Buckingham Palace as one of the two most exciting incidents in her life.|$|E

2500|$|By 2006, {{after six}} years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she {{did not need to}} commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had {{recently}} appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, [...] "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products". Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.|$|E
2500|$|Natalie was {{the elder}} {{daughter}} of Christopher Davis, a talented ventriloquist who billed himself as [...] "The Great Rainone". [...] Natalie had a younger sister named Chloe. [...] Natalie {{was jealous of}} the attention Chloe received from their father, but the two sisters got along reasonably well until their mother died. Soon after, in 1981, Natalie's jealousy drove her over the edge, and she pushed Chloe out of a treehouse to her death. [...] This {{was the first of}} her series of murders, and the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not recreate in miniature. [...] When Natalie looked down from the treehouse at Chloe lying dead, the scene looked like a miniature, and Natalie became obsessed with creating miniatures of her subsequent victims and crime scenes. She later would witness her father cleaning up Chloe's blood with bleach, and bleach would become a psychotic trigger for her killings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1820, Cooper's wife Susan wagered that {{he could}} write a book better than the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was reading. In {{response}} to the wager, Cooper wrote the novel Precaution (1820). Its focus on morals and manners was influenced by Jane Austen's approach to fiction. He anonymously published [...] Precaution and it received favorable notice from the United States and England. By contrast, his second novel The Spy (1821) {{was inspired by a}} tale related to him by neighbor and family friend John Jay. It was more successful and became a bestseller; the setting of this Revolutionary War tale is widely believed to have been John Jay's family home [...] "The Locusts" [...] in Rye, New York. In 1823, Cooper published The Pioneers, the first of the Leatherstocking series. The series features Natty Bumppo, a resourceful American woodsman at home with the Delaware Indians and their chief Chingachgook. Bumppo was also the main character of Cooper's most famous novel The Last of the Mohicans (1826), written in New York City where Cooper and his family lived from 1822 to 1826. The book {{became one of the most}} widely read American novels of the 19th century.|$|E
