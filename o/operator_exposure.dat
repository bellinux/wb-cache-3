This prospective study included all consecutive patients who underwent elective or emergency CA ± PCI from September 2014 to March 2015.

CD was significantly lower in RFA (3  μSv [1 to 7]) compared with RRA (12 μSv [6 to 29], p < 0. 001). The LRA showed lower CD compared with RRA (p < 0. 001).

There is a worldwide rapid increase {{in the use of}} call centers with headset phone operators for quick satisfaction of consumer demand. <b>Operator’s</b> <b>exposure</b> to noise from communication headsets above specified limits can result in permanent hearing loss.

The ISO 11904 standard is used for measurement the noise exposure of headphone users, considering two methods: Part 1 – mini microphone in real ear (MIRE technique) and Part 2 – manikin technique.

40|$|Background—Radiofrequency current {{ablation}} of {{atrial fibrillation}} (AF) requires high technical skills to achieve optimal catheter stability and {{is associated with}} an individually high x-ray exposure to both {{the patient and the}} operator. To facilitate catheter navigation and to reduce the operator’s x-ray burden, remote navigation (RN) systems have been developed. Considerations for navigation of a novel remote robotic navigation system in pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedures are reported. Methods and Results—In 65 patients with drug-refractory AF (43 paroxysmal, 22 persistent), complete circumferential PVI was performed using RN in conjunction with different electroanatomic mapping systems. Acute complete PVI using exclusively RN was achieved in 95 %. The procedure time was 19540 minutes. The <b>operator’s</b> x-ray <b>exposure</b> time was reduced by 64 minutes (35 %) using RN. In 7 of 14 patients with persistent AF, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved by radiofrequency current ablation. During a median follow-up period of 239 days (range, 184 to 314 days), 47 of 65 patients (73 %) remained free of any documented atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrences after a single procedure. The relative proportion of patients remaining free of AF was 76 % and 68 % for paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively.

For the application task in low crops and high crops a normal scenario and a dense scenario (frequent contact with treated crop) are available.

The nature of a crane operator's duties does not allow for any error in judgement since this can have disastrous consequences. Colour vision and contrast sensitivity tests were performed on all 30 operators and on the control group. The results obtained from analysing air samples using OVM badges revealed levels of toluene ranging from 0 to 0. 477 ppm. These levels are well below the threshold limit value (TLV) for toluene which is 50 ppm. Hydrocarbon levels were also determined by biological monitoring.

More than 30 unpublished GLP exposure studies conducted between 1994 and 2009 mainly for the purpose of plant protection product authorisation were chosen for evaluation according to a set of quality criteria defined by an expert group. All data including information about the studies were compiled in a database and used for a statistical analysis of exposure factors. The statistical analysis resulted in six validated models for typical scenarios of pesticide mixing/loading, and application outdoors including downwards and upwards spraying with vehicle-mounted/-trailed or hand-held equipment. As a major factor contributing to the exposure of operators, the amount of active substance used per day was identified. Other parameters such as formulation type, droplet size, presence of a cabin or density of the canopy were selected as factors for particular sub-scenarios. However, in the case of knapsack mixing/loading, and hand-held application directed downwards, the number of data was too small for identifying reliable exposure factors; instead the relevant percentiles of the exposure distribution were used.

40|$|Many private {{infrastructure}} projects mix regulation that subjects the private company to considerable risk, a government or regulator that {{is reluctant to}} see the company go bankrupt, and high leverage {{on the part of}} the company. If all goes well, equityholders make a profit, debtholders are repaid, customers pay no more than they expected, and the government is not called on to bail the company out. If all goes badly enough, however, the prospect of bankruptcy will loom. Unwilling to see the company go bankrupt, however, the regulator will have to permit an unscheduled price increase, or the government will have to inject taxpayers'money into the firm. In other words, the combination means customers and taxpayers bear more risk than would appear from the regulations governing the private infrastructure project. The authors examine how these problems have played out in five cases. Then they describe how governments and regulators can quantify the extent of the problems and, using option-pricing techniques, value the customer and taxpayer guarantees involved. Finally, the authors analyze three options for mitigating the problem: making bankruptcy a more credible threat, limiting the private operator's leverage, and reducing the private <b>operator's</b> <b>exposure</b> to risk. The authors conclude that appropriate policy depends on the tax system, the feasibility of enforcing bankruptcy, and the benefits of risk transfer from taxpayer to theprivate sector.
