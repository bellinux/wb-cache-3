5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office {{in front of}} it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith. The tower began to become too small for storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books were kept in the tower.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1913, a train {{leaving for}} High Wycombe {{collided}} with another arriving from Leicester, killing one passenger and injuring 23 {{people on the}} incoming train. The cause was blamed on the intermediate starter signal being lowered before the main starter was ready; {{the view of the}} latter was <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smoke.|$|E
60|$|This {{important}} paragraph is <b>obscure</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> translator's {{ignorance of}} the true import of the German 'soll', which does not answer to our 'shall;' but rather to our 'ought', that is, 'should' do this or that,--is under an obligation to do it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name, [...] "Pasquino", remains <b>obscure.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> mid-sixteenth century it was {{reported}} that the name [...] "Pasquino" [...] derived from a nearby tailor who was renowned for his wit and intellect; speculation had it that his legacy was carried on through the statue, in [...] "the honor and everlasting remembrance of the poor tailor".|$|R
50|$|Furrina, also spelled Furina, was {{an ancient}} Roman goddess whose {{function}} had become <b>obscure</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time of Varro. Her cult dated to the earliest period of Roman religious history, {{since she was}} one of the fifteen deities who had their own flamen, the Furrinalis, one of the flamines minores. There is some evidence that Furrina was associated with water.|$|R
5|$|These {{facts are}} <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{omission}} of the solvent from the expression that is normally {{used to define}} pKa, but pKa values obtained in a given mixed solvent {{can be compared to}} each other, giving relative acid strengths. The same is true of pKa values obtained in a particular non-aqueous solvent such a DMSO.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is {{a manifestation}} of the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women and is an antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E
50|$|The {{information}} contained in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica gives the full information from the 1897 census, the only one held in the Russian Empire before 1917, and helps illuminate a situation rendered <b>obscure</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> vagaries of Soviet Nationalities policy in the 1920s and 1930s. The population numbered 1,571,243 in 1897, and of that number 707,132 were women and 286,369 were urban.|$|R

5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.|$|E
5|$|The west {{window was}} <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> organ until the 1860s {{when it was}} moved {{to make way for}} a {{depiction}} of the Annunciation which was designed by John Hardman Powell of Hardman & Co. and funded by Sholto Hare. Attempts to achieve some conformity with the installed work and subsequent designs lead to a further commissions for Clayton and Bell and Hardman & Co. generally as memorials to wealthy local dignitaries who had contributed to the restoration of the church.|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Mike B. Anderson {{stated that}} at least three {{different}} acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern. It {{was not until the}} editing process that the material used was decided upon. The episode was still being animated three weeks before it was due to air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the closing credits. The production team liked the scene so much that they did not want it to be <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> credits and gave it its own segment {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

He found steady {{work in the}} cities of Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. In the late 1940s, he toured with Eddie Vinson {{at the same time}} that John Coltrane was in Vinson's band. His creativity and playing ability continued to improve, though he was still somewhat <b>obscure.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> time he became a pianist for Miles Davis, he was influenced by Ahmad Jamal and Charlie Parker's pianist Walter Bishop.|$|R

5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E
5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing {{his concern for}} the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia. Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, {{is a symbol of}} the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand. The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008. It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> thickness of the shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
50|$|In ancient Roman religion, the Lucaria was {{a festival}} of the grove (Latin lucus) held July 19 and 21. The {{original}} meaning of <b>the</b> ritual was <b>obscure</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time of Varro (mid-1st century BC), who omits {{it in his}} list of festivals. The deity for whom it was celebrated is unknown; if a ritual for grove-clearing recorded by Cato pertains to this festival, the invocation was deliberately anonymous (Si deus, si dea). The dates of the Lucaria are recorded in the Fasti Amiterni, a calendar dating from the reign of Tiberius found at Amiternum (now S. Vittorino) in Sabine territory.|$|R
5000|$|Galkovsky's {{first major}} work was the {{philosophical}} novel Бесконечный тупик (The Infinite Deadlock). The work {{consists of three}} parts. The first part, completed in 1984 and entitled [...] "The Round World," [...] is a brief analysis of, and homage to, {{the work of the}} Russian philosopher Vasily Rozanov. Rozanov's writings were not published during Soviet rule, and he had become somewhat <b>obscure</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time Galkovsky was writing. [...] "The Round World" [...] argues that Rozanov's work is [...] "very modern and relevant" [...] to Russia in the late 20th century, and that he is [...] "perhaps...the most modern Russian philosopher." ...|$|R

5|$|With the 1st Light Horse Brigade in reserve, Chauvel {{sent the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{to move on}} Magdhaba by the north and {{north-east}} {{to cut off the}} possibility of retreat while the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade followed the telegraph line straight to Magdhaba. The 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced mounted to the attack but fierce shrapnel fire forced them to advance up the wadi bed. By midday all three brigades and the Camel Brigade, despite support from machine-guns and artillery, were hotly engaged. Aerial reconnaissance from Australian and British aircraft, which scouted out the Turkish positions, greatly assisted the attack, although the Turkish positions were <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> effect of a mirage and dust clouds.|$|E
5|$|Fort 56 {{consisted}} of three wings, each surrounded by its own earthwork, stockades and a moat. Partially <b>obscured</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> trees of Brühl's Garden, the central wing was further reinforced by the St. Laurence's Church and the surrounding monastery. The fort, commanded by General Józef Sowiński, was manned by two battalions of the 8th Regiment of Line Infantry (1,200 men), with 40 sappers, 13 cannon, two Congreve rocket launchers, and a small detachment from the 14th Regiment of Line Infantry (170 men). Directly in front of it, on a hill overlooking the battlefield, lay the smaller, irregularly-shaped Fort 57 manned by 300 men under Maj. Józef Krassowski, armed with four pieces of artillery and two Congreve rocket launchers. To the north lay Fort 59 (four cannon and 400 men under Maj. Józef Borzęcki), while to the south Fort 54 (up to 350 men under Maj. Ignacy Dobrzelewski and six guns under Lt. Julian Konstanty Ordon). Even though the remaining forts of Wola (Forts 55, 58, 60 and 61) were deprived of their garrisons to strengthen the defence, the most important Polish positions were still severely undermanned.|$|E
