Conversion of crude <b>olive</b> pomace into exhausted <b>olive</b> pomace resulted in 10 % reduction in calorific value. The net calorific value of crude <b>olive</b> pomace amounts to 92 % of its gross calorific value. The ultimate and proximate analyses of crude <b>olive</b> pomace representing the 2006 - 2008 <b>olive</b> harvest seasons were determined and compared with analyses pertaining to the 2009 - 2011 <b>olive</b> harvest seasons in Jordan.

Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild stony <b>olives.</b> Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild stony <b>olives,</b> mulberry, dried apricots, watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E

5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed <b>olives</b> were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the <b>olives,</b> a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed <b>olives,</b> and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The <b>olives</b> were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E

These areas included the provinces of Jericho, Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah, Salfeet, Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarem and Qalqilyah. The study began in October 2007 and ended in July 2008.
