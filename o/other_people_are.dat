25|$|There is {{also the}} {{cognitive}} perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations.

25|$|Social {{psychology}} is the {{scientific study of}} how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, scientific refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be imagined or implied suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{are also}} {{influenced}} by aspects of social time: the hours when <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> awake, the hours when work is required, {{the time on the}} clock, etc. Time zones, standard times used to unify the timing for people in the same area, correspond only approximately to the natural rising and setting of the sun. The approximate nature of the timezone can be shown with China, a country which used to span five time zones and now uses only one (UTC +8).|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} context, the king remains in this {{position}} and has the final executive power of government. The high chiefs are now limited to 33 titles and called nobles (nopele), but some nobles carry more than one title. They are still estate holders, and as such have some influence, {{but they are not}} the government (although many of them are high ranking civil servants). The lower chiefs have disappeared (and the word fototehina now means 'brothers'). The matāpule have also largely disappeared except those who keep the protocol and serve as official spokesmen for the king and nobles. And also the royal undertaker, Lauaki. Tax collection is a task for the central government only. Slavery is abolished, since the emancipation of 1875, and all <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> just the 'commoners'.|$|E

25|$|Festinger’s other {{well-known}} {{theory of}} cognitive dissonance, proposed in 1957 offers further evidence for {{why such a}} process might occur. Because emotional experiences are unexpected, they can affect one’s self-concept and thus challenge one’s system of beliefs. According to Festinger, when people’s expectations do not manifest themselves, a cognitive dissonance is created between the expectations and reality and people seek to reduce this dissonance by rationalizing the discrepancy. So after experiencing an emotion, people {{would be expected to}} communicate the event with others in order to help reduce their cognitive dissonance. An article by Thoits emphasizes the importance of the ability of others to assist in the process of coping. <b>Other</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> able to offer new perspectives on interpretations of the emotional event. In previous studies, Rimé concluded that emotions necessitate “cognitive articulation” because of their dense, complex nature. By using language to express an experience, people are forced to classify and organize the contents of the emotions, and furthermore can concretize and objectivize the experience into a script that can be more easily understood.|$|E

500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves like a human being in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness. Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois. and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the storyline {{which saw}} Kyla's Alcoholics Anonymous {{companion}} Stuart McElroy (Conor Mullen) violently attack her colleague, Ward Sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Ayola has stated: [...] "It makes her finally accept what Stuart was capable of. She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts about <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has no excuses – {{all she can}} think is that she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll have less to worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze." [...] When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: [...] "I hope so. Kyla's had trouble being a good parent to Max, but she's had lots of time to reflect on why this is." ...|$|E

[...] According to Davies, Taking Back Sunday writes two kinds of songs: [...] "energetic pop rock with whiny vocals, and midtempo power rock, again with whiny vocals." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone wrote that the group [...] "amped up their sound," [...] with Valentine [...] "delivering a turbocharged attack spiked with dark, catchy melodies and giant choruses." [...] Hoard called most of the album's songs [...] "skull-rattling slasher with enough pop smarts to keep the heartbroken agony from becoming too much to handle." [...] For Stylus Magazine, Ian Cohen wrote that the album [...] "tables the discussion" [...] of whether Taking Back Sunday [...] "embrace their arena destiny or disappear into the basement for cred that never really existed." [...] Cohen concluded, [...] "As was the case with pop-metal, 'albums' weren't the objective, so much as a few ace singles and album tracks that hold serve, which is Louder Now in a nutshell." ...|$|E

500|$|Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney {{states that}} estrangement from {{the self and}} others is the primary theme of the fourth season. To {{illustrate}} the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam {{was not the first}} re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. [...] "Some Assembly Required" [...] in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and [...] "Beauty and the Beasts" [...] in the third includes references to Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel Frankenstein (1818) tells his creator that he is the [...] "Adam of your labours". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to [...] "find the stillness" [...] in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's [...] "flawed but impressive performance" [...] includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying. Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts [...] "to compensate for human vulnerability". The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.|$|E
