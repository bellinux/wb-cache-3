Many residents also evacuated to motels and homes in neighboring communities. Some residents of Grand Forks criticized the National Weather Service for its incorrect prediction of the river level, as it had prevented them from securing their possessions from their homes. One resident said: [...] "If they'd said earlier the river would hit , I would have moved my stuff <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> At 49, it was safe." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the trial}} in November 1929, Shuler's lawyer cross-examined Cryer about {{allegations}} that he [...] "pitched dice at in Farmer Page's place," [...] and about his accumulation of wealth during his eight years as mayor.

2500|$|In 2014, the Chick tract Unforgiven was {{distributed}} by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract {{tells the story}} of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. [...] Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t my grandma, I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” he screams. “Get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E
