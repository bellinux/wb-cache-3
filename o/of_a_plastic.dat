The QuickWindow case consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> shell with a polyurethane flip cover.

5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material shrinkage. In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E

25|$|The {{body was}} {{an entirely new}} design by Pininfarina {{featuring}} panels made of Kevlar, carbon fiber, and aluminum for strength and low weight, and intense aerodynamic testing was employed. Weight was further minimized through the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> windshield and windows. The cars did have air conditioning, but had no sound system, door handles, glove box, leather trim, carpets, or door panels.

NLA {{did not have an}} air operator's certificate to begin with and subcontracted operations to Mørefly. High operating costs caused NLA to switch operators to Partnair from 1 May 1979. They proposed moving the base to Oslo Airport, Fornebu to cut costs, but this was rejected. In its first year of operation, the base carried out 216 missions. Until Stavanger Heliport, Central Hospital opened in 1981, Lørenskog was the only ambulance helicopter base in Norway.|$|E
25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as microplastics, these particles act like sponges and soak up Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) around them. Thus laden {{with high levels of}} POPs, the microparticles are often ingested by organisms in the biosphere.|$|E

25|$|The sealing {{materials}} of aluminum electrolytic capacitors {{depend on the}} different styles. For larger screw-terminal and snap-in capacitors the sealing washer is made <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> material. Axial electrolytic capacitors usually have a sealing washer made of phenolic resin laminated {{with a layer of}} rubber. Radial electrolytic capacitors use a rubber plug with a very dense structure. All sealing materials must be inert to the chemical parts of the electrolyte and may not contain soluble compounds that could lead to contamination of the electrolyte. To avoid leakage, the electrolyte must not be aggressive to the sealing material.|$|E
25|$|Tullio phenomenon, {{another of}} the more {{identifiable}} symptoms leading to a positive SCD diagnosis is sound-induced loss of balance. Patients showing this symptom may experience a loss of equilibrium, a feeling of motion sickness or even actual nausea, triggered by normal everyday sounds. Although this {{is often associated with}} loud noises, volume is not necessarily a factor. Patients describe a wide range of sounds that affect balance: the 'rattle' <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag; a cashier tossing coins into the register; a telephone ringing; a knock at the door; music; the sound of children playing and even the patient's own voice are typical examples of sounds that can cause a loss of balance when this condition is present, although there are countless others. The presence of Tullio may also mean that involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), sometimes rotational, are set off by sound, giving the sufferer the impression that the world is tipping, clockwise or anticlockwise, depending {{on the site of the}} dehiscence. Some patients report this tilt as being as much as 15°. For such persons, a visit to the concert hall or to a noisy playground may seem like being at the epicenter of an earthquake. A change of pressure within the middle ear (for example when flying or nose-blowing) may equally set off a bout of disequilibrium or nystagmus.|$|E
