5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands <b>of</b> <b>foreigners.</b> The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team <b>of</b> <b>foreigners.</b> The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5|$|Following a long {{record of}} instigating {{localised}} conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937. On 12 September, the Chinese representative, Wellington Koo, {{appealed to the}} League for international intervention. Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai, {{a city with a}} substantial number <b>of</b> <b>foreigners.</b> The League was unable to provide any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the Nine Power Treaty Conference.|$|E

5|$|In 1705 he {{was elected}} a member of Parliament (MP) for Northallerton in a by-election. He {{remained}} an MP until 1713, usually voting with the Whigs and working on committees concerned with regulating servant wages and the naturalisation <b>of</b> <b>foreigners.</b> After leaving Parliament, he was appointed to a commission dealing with stamp duties, then later was a commissioner of excise. He remained in that position until 1735, when Robert Walpole had him removed to free the post for one of Walpole's friends.|$|E
5|$|King Stanisław August's {{acquiescence}} to the Russian intervention encountered some opposition. On February 29, 1768, several magnatesincluding Józef Pułaski and {{his young}} son Kazimierz Pułaski (Casimir Pulaski)vowing to oppose Russian influence, declared Stanisław August a lackey of Russia and Catherine, and formed a confederation at the town of Bar. The Bar Confederation focused on limiting the influence <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> in Commonwealth affairs, and being pro-Catholic was generally opposed to religious tolerance. It began a civil war to overthrow the King, but its irregular forces were overwhelmed by Russian intervention in 1772.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters {{narrowly}} {{approved by}} 50.3% a ballot initiative {{launched by the}} national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx <b>of</b> <b>foreigners.</b> This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected it. Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} the first Allied victory over the Central Powers in the First World War. Serbia's triumph on the {{battlefield}} drew worldwide attention {{to the country and}} won the Serbs sympathy from both neutral and Allied countries. A number <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> flocked to Serbia in late 1914, offering financial, political, humanitarian and military aid. Articles in defence of Serbia became more frequent in the British press. Certain cultural circles in Italy advocated entering the war on the Allied side, citing Serbian and Montenegrin battlefield successes.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between king and magnates {{was caused by}} dissatisfaction with the influence <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> at court, and Henry's high level of taxation. In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford, that essentially left royal government {{in the hands of}} a council of magnates, but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements. In 1263, as the country was on the brink of civil war, the two parties agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by the French king. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and decided clearly in favour of Henry.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{accounts}} <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> visiting Hawaii {{before the arrival}} of James Cook, in 1778. However, the earliest Western depictions of the isle, including Mauna Kea, were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Contact with Europe and America had major consequences for island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the number of Singaporeans pre-booking niches at private crematoria, even though some people consider talking about death and pre-booking a final resting place inauspicious. Reasons for pre-booking include wanting one's ashes to be close to those of loved ones, and hedging against higher prices for niches in future. The bodies <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> (regardless of where they die) can be cremated in Singapore, but their ashes have to be placed in private columbaria. There are also irregular instances of Singaporeans dying overseas, such as the 2015 accident surrounding Huang Lin Davina, a high-profile demise of a Singaporean abroad.|$|E
5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist forces were attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the pig bristles from the city by air. The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist forces were concerned about the presence <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> in China, and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|E
5|$|Between {{these two}} systems, {{that of the}} {{political}} order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness {{of the city was}} historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center. The forbidding <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of the social and political order, rather than the religious order. By respecting these systems of symbolism, successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom. However, adherence to cardinal division and symbolism of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment of the significance of vertical space and elevation as an indicator of rank. The site of each new compound within the royal city was selected less for its cardinal direction than for {{the extent to which it}} was located on higher ground than the compound that predated it.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} Hindu pilgrimages, Haridwar Kumbh Mela, takes place in Uttarakhand. Haridwar {{is one of the}} four places in India where this mela is organised. Haridwar most {{recently}} hosted the Purna Kumbh Mela from Makar Sankranti (14 January 2010) to Vaishakh Purnima Snan (28 April 2010). Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> joined Indian pilgrims in the festival which is considered the largest religious gathering in the world. Kumauni Holi, in forms including Baithki Holi, Khari Holi and Mahila Holi, all of which start from Vasant Panchami, are festivals and musical affairs that can last almost a month. Ganga Dashahara, Vasant Panchami, Makar Sankranti, Ghee Sankranti, Khatarua, Vat Savitri, and Phul Dei are other major festivals. In addition, various fairs like Kanwar Yatra, Kandali Festival, Ramman, Harela mela, Nauchandi mela, Uttarayani mela and Nanda Devi Raj Jat Mela take place.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{slavery was}} {{not based on}} race. Slaves were drawn from all over Europe and the Mediterranean, {{including}} Gaul, Hispania, Germany, Britannia, the Balkans, Greece... Generally slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority <b>of</b> <b>foreigners</b> (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent, while the Jewish ones never fully assimilated into Roman society, remaining an identifiable minority. These slaves (especially the foreigners) had higher mortality rates and lower birth rates than natives, and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at death for the slaves {{of the city of}} Rome was extraordinarily low: seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).|$|E
5|$|The Catholic {{community}} in Afghanistan is mainly made <b>of</b> <b>foreigners,</b> especially aid workers, and no Afghans {{are known to}} be currently part of the Church, mainly due to great social and legal pressure not to convert to non-Islamic religions. Some Afghans have converted while overseas, but they keep it secret when they return. Two Christian groups, Church World Service and Norwegian Church Aid, were accused of proselytizing while doing aid work in Afghanistan, which they denied, and 1,000 Afghans protested in Mazar-i-Sharif and burned the pope in effigy. Despite this, the community has grown from only a few sisters to a full Sunday Mass of around 100. Church attendance dipped in 2012 due to security concerns and less emphasis on religion among the foreigners in Afghanistan in recent years.|$|E
