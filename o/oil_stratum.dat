The Shannon <b>oil</b> <b>stratum</b> lies at an average depth of 1100 feet in a 30 ft layer of sand. Of about 150 wells drilled in the Shannon deposit about 15 were dry. Peak production from the Shannon was 3,600,000 barrels in 1919. Later development {{took place in the}} Dakota sandstone at a depth between 4200 ft and 4500 ft. 51 wells had been drilled in the Dakota deposit by 1949 with a production of 2,436,830 barrels of API 35 green oil. The Lakota and Stray sands were exploited in later years, with 1,367,316 barrels produced by 1949 from eleven wells. Since the Lakota wells produced large quantities of water, production concentrated on Dakota wells. The Big Muddy filed produced little gas, although more gas came from the Wall Creek wells, and 549 million cubic feet of gas was produced in 1957, most of which was used locally in production work.|$|E

30|$|Fractional {{calculus}} means differentiation {{and integration}} of a noninteger order. The idea of fractional calculus was introduced by Leibniz and L’Hopital in 1695. However, the study of noninteger order derivatives did {{not appear in the}} literature until 1819, when Lacroix [1] presented a definition of the fractional derivative based on the usual expression for the nth derivative of the power function. Within years the fractional calculus became a very attractive topic for mathematicians. Fractional calculus has many applications in science and engineering such as memory of a variety of materials, signal identification, temperature field problems in <b>oil</b> <b>strata,</b> diffusion problems, etc. (see [2 – 5]). Many different forms of fractional differential operators like the Grunwald-Letnikow, Riemann-Liouville, Hadamard, Caputo, Riesz and conformable ones have been presented (see [6 – 10]). Recently, researchers have started to deal with the discrete versions of fractional calculus benefitting from the theory of time scale (see [11 – 16]). For example, Benkhettou et al. [17] introduced the concept of the CF derivative of order α on T. They explained all properties of the CF derivative on T. The CF derivative of a function defined on T reduces to the Hilger derivative when α= 1. Before expressing the CF derivative of order α∈(0, 1] on T, we should give a historical development of time scale calculus.|$|R

Not only is gas the principal energy resource in Russia, it also subsidises other sectors of the economy. Status of the main European gas exporter strengthens also Russia's importance in the international arena. New regional in-security: Ten years have passed since the Central Asian states declared their independence, but their relationship with Russia still remains close, and the latter treats them as its exclusive zone of influence. A crucial reason for keeping Central Asia within the orbit of Moscow·s influence is the fact that Russia exercises control over the most important transport routes out of the region of raw materials for the power industry, on which the economic development of Asia depends on. But this is the only manifestation of Central Asia·s economic dependence on Russia. Moscow lacks solid economic instruments (i. e. investment input or power industry dependence) to shape the situation in the region. Caspian oil and gas: Caspian stocks of energy resources are not, and most probably will not be, of any great significance on the world scale. Nevertheless it is the Caspian region which will have the opportunity to become an oil exporter which will reduce the dependence of the European countries on Arabian oil, and which will guarantee Russia the quantities of gas which are indispensable both for meeting its internal demands and for maintaining its current level of export.

40|$|Fracture {{mechanics}} {{has been}} used for many years to study the mechanical behavior of brittle and quasi-brittle materials like concrete, rock, wood, and ceramics. To date, the application of fracture mechanics to soils has been limited to dry and partially saturated soils where soil consistency changes due to suction and tends to be harder exhibiting a quasi-brittle behavior. Of late, studying fracture propagation in clays and mudrocks has become of interest as it provides a means to extract oil from <b>oil</b> bearing <b>strata.</b> While crack initiation in soils can be analyzed using basic soil mechanics theories, development and propagation of a crack is energy driven and requires application of fracture mechanics principles. An essential parameter in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), the main analytical tool in studying fracture in rock, is the critical stress intensity factor that defines stress concentration near a crack tip beyond which a fracture would propagate. The basic mode of crack loading can be obtained by applying a normal stress that has a corresponding opening mode of crack surface displacement, called mode-I (tensile mode), with a critical stress intensity factor termed fracture toughness, denoted by KIC. In this experimental research, KIC is measured indirectly using a modified Brazilian Test configuration where load is applied normally on flattened Brazilian disk specimens without the need to introduce a flaw into the specimen. Intact natural specimens from four different deposits; Boston Blue clay, San Francisco Bay Mud, Presumpscot Maine clay, and Gulf of Mexico clay; are tested in oven-dried state under atmospheric conditions. In addition, two Clay-like materials; molded Gypsum and Plaster of Paris; have been investigated. Based on the analysis of the test data, the relation between mode I fracture toughness and tensile strength for the six tested materials agrees to a great extent with reported trends in the literature even for different fracture toughness and tensile strength testing techniques and for wider tested range of soils, rocks, geomaterials, clay-like, and rock-like materials. However, no clear relation between mode I fracture toughness and elastic modulus or any other physical parameter was determined. by Shehab Sherif Wissa Agaiby. Thesis: S.

Some of these hydrocarbons are located within the longwall relaxation zone of the overlying strata and, as a result, can migrate to the goaf and active workings subsequent to extraction. A number of new exploration techniques, which are in common use by the petroleum industry, have been adopted by Illawarra Coal in order to more accurately locate these zones and determine the potential impact on future mining.

Although most of {{the oil and gas}} reserves discovered so far are mainly distributed in Mesozoic, Cenozoic, and upper Paleozoic <b>strata,</b> <b>oil</b> and gas exploration in the Proterozoic–Lower Paleozoic (PLP) strata—the oldest marine strata—has been very limited. To more clearly understand the oil and gas formation conditions and distributions in the PLP marine carbonate strata, we analyzed and characterized the petroleum geological conditions, oil and gas reservoir types, and their distributions in thirteen giant oil and gas fields worldwide. This study reveals the main factors controlling their formation and distribution. Our analyses show that the source rocks for these giant oil and gas fields are mainly shale with a great abundance of type I–II organic matter and a high thermal evolution extent. The reservoirs are mainly gas reservoirs, and the reservoir rocks are dominated by dolomite. The reservoir types are mainly karst and reef–shoal bodies with well-developed dissolved pores and cavities, intercrystalline pores, and fractures. These reservoirs are highly heterogeneous. The burial depth of the reservoirs is highly variable and somewhat negatively correlated to the porosity. The cap rocks are mainly thick evaporites and shales, with the thickness of the cap rocks positively correlated to the oil and gas reserves. The development of high-quality evaporite cap rock is highly favorable for oil and gas preservation. We identified four hydrocarbon generation models, and that the major source rocks have undergone a long period of burial and thermal evolution and are characterized by early and long periods of hydrocarbon generation. These giant oil and gas fields have diverse types of reservoirs and are mainly distributed in paleo-uplifts, slope zones, and platform margin reef-shoal bodies. The main factors that control their formation and distribution were identified, enabling the prediction of new favorable areas for oil and gas exploration.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Sepsis is {{a leading}} cause of {{mortality}} in critically ill patients on the intensive care unit (ITU). Death from sepsis in the ITU is frequently preceded by the development of multiple organ failure as a result of uncontrolled inflammation. Treatment with omega- 3 (fish oil) has been demonstrated to attenuate the effects of uncontrolled inflammation and may be clinically beneficial in reducing morbidity from organ dysfunction. Method: A randomised control trial investigating the effects of parenteral omega- 3 (OmegavenTM), given early in the course of sepsis, was carried out in a single institution. Consecutive patients diagnosed with sepsis were entered into the study. Patients were randomised to receive either parenteral fish oil and standard medical care or standard medical care only. The primary outcome measure was a reduction in organ dysfunction using the SOFA score as a surrogate marker. The secondary outcome measures were mortality, length of stay, mean C-reactive protein (CRP), days free of organ dysfunction/failure and fatty acid (FA) analysis. Results: Sixty patients were included in the study. The baseline demographics were matched for the two cohorts. Patients treated with parenteral fish oil were associated with a significant reduction in new organ dysfunction (delta-SOFA 2. 2 ± 2. 2 vs. 1. 0 ± 1. 5, p= 0. 005 and maximum-SOFA 10. 1 ± 4. 2 vs. 8. 1 ± 3. 2, p= 0. 041) and mean CRP (186. 7 ± 78 vs. 141. 5 ± 62. 6, p= 0. 019). There was no significant reduction in the length of ITU and total hospital stay between cohorts. Patients treated with fish <b>oil</b> in the <b>strata</b> of less severe sepsis had a significant reduction in mortality (p= 0. 042). Conclusion: The treatment of critically ill septic patients with parenteral fish oil is safe. N- 3 FAs are rapidly taken up by circulating white cells. It is associated with a significant reduction in organ dysfunction and CRP. It may be associated with a reduction in mortality in patients with less severe sepsis.

The authors analyzed {{the cause of the}} anomalous overpressures with a 3 -dimensional, numerical model of the evolution of the basin, including compaction disequilibrium and hydrocarbon generation as possible mechanisms. The numerical model builds the basin through time, coupling the structural, thermal and hydrodynamic evolution, and includes in situ hydrocarbon generation and migration. They used the evolution model to evaluate overpressure mechanisms and oil migration patterns for different possible conceptual models of the geologic history. Model results suggest that observed overpressures in the Uinta basin are probably caused by ongoing <b>oil</b> generation in <b>strata</b> with specific conditions of permeability, relative permeability, TOC content, and oil viscosity. They conducted a sensitivity analysis that suggests for oil generation to cause overpressures, the necessary conditions are: oil viscosity is {approximately} 0. 05 cP or higher, intrinsic permeability is {approximately} 5 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 18 } m{sup 2 } or lower, and source rock TOC values are {approximately} 0. 5 % or higher. The authors also analyzed hydrocarbon migration patterns in the basin and how they are affected by the basin`s structural history. Oil migration patterns produced by the model are consistent with published oil production maps: oil moves from the deep Altamont source rocks toward Redwash, the eastern Douglas Creek Arch area, and southward towards the Sunnyside tar-sands and Book Cliffs. Peak oil generation occurs from the time of maximum burial in the mid-Tertiary ({approximately} 35 to {approximately} 30 Ma). Most differential uplift of the basin`s flanks probably occurs well after this time, and most oil migration to the basin`s southern and eastern flanks occurs prior to uplift of these flanks. Model results show that if the basin`s flanks are uplifted too soon, reduced temperatures increase viscosity enough to inhibit migration of oil to the southern and eastern flanks...|$|R

The oil and condensate reservoirs of the sedimentary basins in northwestern Taiwan generally are in the deltaic-littoral-neritic sandstones of Upper Oligocene to Upper Miocene <b>strata.</b> <b>Oils</b> and condensates produced from these basins are terrigenous, with a variable delta C- 13 % ratio - 30. 07 to - 27. 50 %/PDB, and Pristane/Phytane ratio from 4. 79 to 9. 22. A large set of condensate and oil samples were collected from major gas fields across the Hsinchu-Miaola basin, and the Koval Index was used to identify C- 7 light hydrocarbons in the samples. The isomeric parameters of C- 7 included single-branched and multiple-branched heptanes and isomeric pairs, such as nC(7) /Methylcyclohexane ratio vs. Toluene/nC(7) ratio, 2 -MH+ 2, 3 -DMP vs. 3 -MH+ 2, 4 -DMP, n-Heptane ratio vs. iso-Heptane ratio. The ratios for parent (PI), mono-branch (P 2) and poly branch (P 3) heptane isomers ranged from 37 to 64 %, 29 to 45 % and 6 to 19 %, respectively. The ratios for nC(7) /Methyleyclohexane and Toluene/nC(7) ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 60 and 1. 52 to 10. 58, respectively. The n-Heptane value and iso-Heptane value ranged from 10 to 26 and 0. 8 to 1. 8 respectively and the iso-alkanes (3 RP), cyclopentanes (5 R-P), cyclohexanes (6 RP) ratios ranged from 6 to 29 %, 5 to 13 % and 53 to 90 %, respectively with the 2 -MH+ 2, 3 -DMP vs. 3 -MH+ 2, 4 -DMP found to be constant for the linear equation Y = 1. 1458 X- 0. 0755. The use of this technique as a qualitative tool shows that all the oils from the northwestern Taiwan were mature, free of biodegradation, affected by evaporative fractionation and derived from the same petroleum system.

This area includes the Eagle Ford Shale. For decades this geographic region has produced gas and <b>oil</b> from other <b>strata</b> using conventional methods, but {{recent developments in}} hydrofracturing technology has allowed extensive development of natural gas resources from within the Eagle Ford. Our study surveys small-magnitude seismic events and evaluates their correlation with fluid extraction and injection in the Eagle Ford, identifying and locating 62 probable earthquakes, including 58 not reported by the U. S. Geological Survey. The 62 probable earthquakes occur singly or in clusters at 14 foci; of these foci, two were situated near wells injecting recently increased volumes of water; eight were situated near wells extracting recently increased volumes of oil and/or water; and four were not situated near wells reporting significant injection/extraction increases. Thus in this region, {{while the majority of}} small earthquakes may be triggered/induced by human activity, they are more often associated with fluid extraction than with injection. We also investigated the MW 4. 8 20 October 2011 Fashing earthquake—the largest historically reported earthquake in south-central Texas—that occurred two weeks after the removal of the temporary USArray stations. A field study indicated that the highest-intensity (MMI VI) region was about 10 km south of 2010 – 2011 foreshock activity, and that there were no high-volume injection wells within 20 km of the MMI V–VI region or the foreshocks. However, the 20 October 2011 earthquake did coincide with a significant increase in oil/water extraction volumes at wells within the MMI V–VI region, and this was also true for previous earthquakes felt at Fashing in 1973 and 1983. In contrast, our study found significant increases in injection prior to an mbLG 3. 6 20 July 1991 earthquake near Falls City, Texas. Thus the Eagle Ford geographic region, with seismic activity associated both with extraction and injection, appears to be more complex than the Barnett Shale of northeast Texas, where a similar survey found possible correlations only with fluid injection...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} stratigraphic variations in the spatial distribution and density of natural hydraulic and other fractures within <b>oil</b> mature, shale-dominated <b>strata</b> from the Cleveland Basin, northeast England. The studied interval includes the Pliensbachian Cleveland Ironstone and Toarcian Whitby Mudstone Formations. The Cleveland Ironstone Formation (ca. 25 m thick) consists of silt- and mudstone units with discrete ironstone layers (seams). Ironstones account for 20 % of the thickness of the formation. The Whitby Mudstone Formation is up to ca. 100 m thick; up to 2 % of its total thickness consists of discrete calcium carbonate horizons, such as the Top Jet Dogger. Natural hydraulic fractures, characterised by plumose marks and concentric arrest lines on fracture surfaces are ubiquitous throughout both formations; shear fractures with mm- to cm-scale displacements occur locally, particularly within silt- and mudstones. Natural hydraulic fractures locally contain thin, sometimes fibrous, calcite fills and are commonly observed to terminate at bedding plane interfaces between silt- or mudstone and carbonate beds. We have recorded fracture locations and apertures along 139 transects in both shale (i. e. silt- and mudstone intervals) and carbonate strata. Natural hydraulic and shear fractures, measured along transects up to 50 m long within all lithologies in both formations, typically display uniform distributions. There is no correlation between spacing distribution and bulk extension in any lithology. Median fracture densities recorded within the Cleveland Ironstone Formation are higher in intervening ironstone beds (< 2. 1 fractures per m in ironstone layers) compared with dominant shales (< 0. 9 fractures per m in silt- and mudstones). A qualitatively similar pattern occurs within the Whitby Mudstone Formation. However, the absolute values of median fracture density within different members of the Whitby Mudstone Formation range from 2. 2 - 4. 3 fractures per m, consistent with field observations that this formation is more highly fractured than the Cleveland Ironstone Formation. Semi-quantitative estimates of the mineralogical "brittleness index" suggest the highly fractured, clay-rich Mulgrave Shale Member of the Whitby Mudstone Formation has a low brittleness. Our results are therefore inconsistent with the widely held assumption that natural fracture density is greatest within units characterised by a high brittleness index. We propose that stratigraphic variations in fracture densities are more likely to result from the different distributions of crack driving stresses; formations containing decimetre-scale, and most likely stiff, carbonate layers (such as the Cleveland Ironstone Formation) will have differing crack driving stresses compared with silt- and mudstone dominated successions (such as the Whitby Mudstone Formation). The high fracture density observed within the Mulgrave Shale Member is also consistent with propagation of natural hydraulic fractures driven by fluid overpressure caused by maturation of organic matter concentrated within this unit. The next step is to investigate the relative importance of maturation-driven overpressure v. mechanical heterogeneity by analysing the stratigraphic variations in fracture density within the underlying, organic-matter lean Redcar Mudstone Formation...|$|R
