40|$|On a contour-parallel {{tool path}} {{that is often}} used in die/mold machining, there are many regions where the tool is subject to a {{significant}} variation of cutting forces. In a finish-ing process, such a variation of cutting forces easily causes the degradation of machining accuracy and surface finish. This pa-per proposes algorithms to generate <b>offset</b> <b>tool</b> paths that main-tain a constant cutting engagement in a 2 - 1 / 2 dimensional end milling. By maintaining the cutting engagement angle con-stant, the cutting force can be regulated approximately con-stant, which significantly reduces the variation of tool deflec-tion, and then improves the machining accuracy. The validity of the proposed tool path generation schemes is investigated by machining experiments on hardened steel...|$|E
40|$|One {{major problem}} {{encountered}} in NC machining is that cutting load fluctuates in twisty tool paths and increases momentarily when milling concave corners where stock material concentrates. Much {{research has been}} conducted on controlling milling forces but the problem remains unsolved. This paper presents a solution to reduce and stabilise cutting load in NC milling operation by applying computational techniques to isolate the concave corners of a machining region, thereby forming a major region and a number of disjoint sub-regions. Due to the suppression of concave corners, the boundary profile of the major region will become smoother. Contour-parallel <b>offset</b> <b>tool</b> paths can then be used to remove the material in the major region. For the isolated sub-regions, special corner removing tool paths with the use of different cutter sizes will be employed. By using this approach, the adverse effects caused by excessive undulation of milling tool path can be reduced. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{setting of}} machine tool is to {{position}} the machined surfaces to each other relative to the reference of the machine. Traditionally the position of each cutting tool is corrected after each machining operation to get a conform part. The Total Inertial Steering (TIS) allows correcting in one time all deviations of the measured points on the work piece relative to the CAD model. In {{the case of the}} production by machine tool with numerical control, it seeks to link the parameters part to adjustable parameters on the machine (<b>tool</b> <b>offsets).</b> The relationship between part parameters and <b>tool</b> <b>offsets</b> is obtained thanks to the incidence matrix. This matrix is easily and automatically calculable in the case of matrix connecting points to <b>tool</b> <b>offsets.</b> This is not the case for a matrix linking a parameterization of the surface with dimensions to <b>tool</b> <b>offsets.</b> This paper proposes an algorithm to pass from the matrix on the points to the matrix on the dimensions, in order to obtain it automatically. This original approach allows exporting the TIS approach to apply it to the geometric tolerancing. An example of a relatively simple 2 D part is used to illustrate this problem...|$|R

As such, process monitoring and diagnosis is critical towards continuous quality improvement. This becomes more challenging when involving two or more correlated variables (multivariate). The traditional statistical process control (SPC) charting schemes are known to be effective in monitoring aspect but nevertheless, they are lack of diagnosis. In recent years, the control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) schemes have been developed for solving this issue. Design consideration involved the modeling of manufacturing process data to select input representation based on raw data. Proper design of artificial neural network (ANN) model is important in developing an effective CCPR scheme. In this research, the multivariate model ANN pattern recognizer, namely Statistical Features – ANN was investigated in monitoring and diagnosing process variation in manufacturing of hard disc drive component.

40|$|During {{logging-while-drilling}} (LWD) operations, complex {{drill string}} movements {{and the weight}} of the drill pipe often lead to a measurement tool that is not centralized. Therefore, studies of the response of an off-center acoustic LWD tool are essential to facilitate better interpretation of measurements made in an actual drilling environment. Such studies will be helpful for tool design and data processing. We used a finite-difference method to simulate the response of a noncentralized monopole acoustic LWD tool at high frequency (10 kHz). We analyzed the effects on the waveforms for receivers at different azimuths caused by an off-center tool with differing amounts of offset. We used velocity-time semblance and dispersion analysis methods to help us to understand the modes in the waveforms at different azimuth receivers for different <b>tool</b> <b>offsets.</b> We have found that the waveforms {{in the direction of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>offset,</b> that is, where the fluid column is smallest, were affected the most. Waveforms in the orthogonal direction were less affected by <b>tool</b> <b>offset.</b> Collar flexural and collar quadrupole modes appear when the tool is off center. In addition, the formation flexural and quadrupole modes contaminate the Stoneley wave. Waveforms in a fast formation are more strongly affected by the <b>offset</b> of the <b>tool</b> than those in a slow formation. In a fast formation, the new collar modes make it difficult to determine the P-wave velocity in the direction of <b>tool</b> <b>offset</b> whereas it is easier in the orthogonal direction. However, P-waves are less contaminated by new modes in a slow formation. Due to the significant changes in waveforms with azimuth when the tool is off center, the simple addition of all waveforms from an azimuthal distribution of receivers will not result in a clean waveform that is sensitive to only the surrounding formation.

A solution for the capture and control based compensation of deterioration-contingent geometric errors on tool edges is described. The current shape of the cutting edge is captured by optical measurement and serves as input for the new developed compensation algorithms.

In bivariate cases, which involve two correlated quality variables, the traditional statistical process control (SPC) charts are known to be effective in monitoring but they are lack of diagnosis. As such, process monitoring and diagnosis is critical towards continuous quality improvement. This becomes more challenging when involving two correlated variables (bivariate), whereby selection of statistical process control (SPC) scheme becomes more critical. In this research, a scheme to address balanced monitoring and accurate diagnosis was investigated. Investigation has been focused on an integrated SPC - ANN model. This model utilizes the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control chart and ANN model in two-stage monitoring and diagnosis technique.

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of orthopaedic joint bearings surfaces requires exceptionally {{high levels of}} control of not only the surface finish but also the surface form. In the case of hip joints, the form of femoral head should be controlled to within ± 50 ìm from a given diameter. It {{has been shown that}} a better form control of bearing component could enhance clearances creating the correct volume of lubrication to fill the bearing surface gap and reduce wear particle generation. This element is especially critical for the new generation non-spherical head designs. Bonnet polishing which is used successfully in the area of optics is potentially an excellent finishing process to control the form and finish of artificial joints. In the process of form control polishing an “influence function” which defines the material removal rate is of vital importance in developing a corrective polishing procedure. However, the effects of polishing parameters (such as precess angle, head speed, tool pressure and <b>tool</b> <b>offset)</b> on influence function are not very clear for CoCr alloys. These elements must be assessed if a deterministic polishing process is to be developed. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand the contribution of each polishing factors to influence function and consequent part polishing. This study has investigated the effects of polishing parameters on influence function, including geometric size and volumetric material removal rate (MRR). The experimental results indicate that the polishing parameter of precess angle and <b>tool</b> <b>offset</b> affect the geometric size of influence function significantly; the polishing parameter of head speed and tool pressure affect the geometric size of influence function to a lesser degree; the polishing parameter of precess angle, head speed and <b>tool</b> <b>offset</b> affect MRR greatly...|$|R
50|$|The Morris Major and Austin Lancer Series II models, {{designated}} DO1115, {{were released}} in 1959. The Series I Morris Major / Austin Lancer had sold reasonably well and was profitable to build due to greatly <b>offset</b> <b>tooling</b> costs and {{extensive use of}} shared components. However, BMC Australia quickly invested in the thoroughly re-engineered and subsequently better received Series II. Thenceforth, the Australian cars became quite distinctive from their siblings. Outwardly, the cars were now longer by 9 in, including an extended wheelbase, tailfins and new front sheet metal. Series II's styling {{seems to have been}} more inspired by American ideas and, to many eyes, this gave the cars a more handsome appearance. Several updates to the original design were introduced, many of these changes intended to make the cars more suitable for the tough Australian driving conditions, and to bolster its competitiveness with top selling rivals such as Holden and Volkswagen. The suspension was strengthened, extra reinforcement of the chassis was added and the interiors were given a front bench seat in place of buckets, ventilation and demisting ducts and a new instrument cluster. Also, the rear axle (a Morris Minor unit which in hindsight was not well suited to the more powerful engine) had acquired an unfortunate reputation for weakness in Series I. The axle and differential were improved though, sadly, this early failing had already damaged the car's image and that of its maker. Series II's engine retained its single SU HS2 carburettor/SU fuel pump and received a modified oil sump to afford greater ground clearance. The Series II received highly favourable reviews from the motoring press of the time with its sweeping array of detail improvements, enhanced handling characteristics and attractive price earning much praise.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the development of a dynamic force model for drilling and reaming. It can predict the static forces, dynamic forces and vibrations under various cutting conditions. In this model, the cutting forces during drilling are determined by modeling the drill to consist of two distinct regions: the cutting lips and the chisel edge. The cutting forces due to the drill lips are modeled based on Oblique cutting mechanics. The tool vibrations are modeled based on the mechanistic approach and the effects of tool vibrations on the cutting forces are also modeled. Using this new force model, the chatter limits can be determined for the cutting process. The reaming model is then developed for reamers and it can estimate the static and dynamic cutting forces during reaming of holes. The reaming model can also model the forces at entry when holes have chamfer. The model for both drilling and reaming account for the effects of <b>tool</b> <b>offset</b> and <b>tool</b> asymmetry on the cutting forces.
