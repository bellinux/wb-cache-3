On 4 August, McEntee announced the make-up of the committee, to be chaired by herself, which would include people from professions such as politics, health, mental health, charities, and sport. She also announced {{the establishment of a}} Young Persons’ Reference Group, co-chaired by singer Niall Breslin and mental health adviser Emma Farrell. Speaking about the initiative, McEntee said that its work would [...] "ensure that the voices <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> are at the core of a more open, more engaging, more supportive national conversation about mental health and wellbeing".

There is a fear that the active involvement of business will encourage governments to retreat from their role as the primary funders of education (Torjman, 1998). [...] Other issues of corporate involvement in schools reveal disquieting implications of a corporate ideology and ethos entering the learning experience <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> (Hill and McGowan, 1996). Teachers are concerned that partnerships with corporations involved in military research and development send a clear message to students. The presence of military contractors in classrooms suggests that schools are not concerned with violence and oppression in the world (Hill and McGowan, 1996).|$|E
40|$|Thinking {{of cutting}} {{physical}} education? Think again. Even as we bemoan children's sedentary lifestyles, we often sacrifice school-based {{physical education in}} the name of providing more time for academics. In 2006, only 3. 8 percent of elementary schools, 7. 9 percent of middle schools, and 2. 1 percent of high schools offered students daily physical education or its equivalent for the entire school year (Lee, Burgeson, Fulton, & Spain, 2007). We believe this marked reduction in school-based physical activity risks students' health and can't be justified on educational or ethical grounds. We'll get to the educational grounds in a moment. As to ethical reasons for keeping physical activity part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> school days, consider the fact that childhood obesity {{is now one of the}} most serious health issues facing U.

School-based physical education programs engage students in regular physical activity and help them acquire skills and habits necessary to pursue an active lifestyle. Such programs are directly relevant to preventing obesity. Yet they are increasingly on the chopping block...|$|R

And, by God's grace, a great good was indeed accomplished! The common hope and vision expressed by my brother bishops during those several days and reflected in the two historic documents produced by the Conference caused a refreshing and invigorating breeze to blow across this continent, opening the doors of our Orthodox congregations with hope and joyful anticipation. But sadly and all too quickly, dark storm clouds blew in from the East, causing those doors to be slammed shut once more. Some of those doors were and remained locked to this very day, while others stand ajar, awaiting another refreshing and invigorating breeze to open them once again.

2500|$|In 2001, Youngstown State head {{football}} coach Jim Tressel took over as Buckeye head coach. Unlike his predecessor John Cooper, Tressel put a special emphasis on the rivalry. In his introductory speech at halftime of a January basketball game, against Michigan, he said [...] "I {{can assure you that}} you will be proud <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> in the classroom, in the community, and most especially in 310 days in Ann Arbor, Michigan on the football field." [...] In his first year, Tressel registered the Buckeyes' first defeat of the Wolverines in Ann Arbor in 14 years, by a 26–20 score. Led by senior running back Jonathan Wells, the Buckeyes raced to a 23–0 halftime lead. With Wells out, Michigan mounted a second half comeback that fell just short. The next year, Tressel achieved what Cooper could not: Beating Michigan in consecutive years with a 14–9 victory. The game was decided on the last play when defensive back Will Allen intercepted a pass at the two yard line as time expired to clinch the victory. The Buckeyes were led by freshman running back Maurice Clarett, who ran for 119 yards and one touchdown. He also had a key reception to set up Maurice Hall's game-winning score. The Buckeyes {{went on to win the}} national championship that season, as they defeated Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.|$|E
