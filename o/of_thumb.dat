5|$|There's now no {{need for}} rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wherever {{possible}} the concise first method is used. The following rules <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> cover most cases.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is {{that for}} {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is {{in the opposite direction}} of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
50|$|The ulnar {{collateral}} ligament <b>of</b> the <b>thumb</b> {{runs along}} the ulnar side of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint <b>of</b> the <b>thumb.</b> The ulnar collateral ligament is an important stabilizer <b>of</b> the <b>thumb.</b>|$|R
50|$|Symptoms <b>of</b> gamekeeper's <b>thumb</b> are {{instability}} <b>of</b> the MCP joint <b>of</b> the <b>thumb,</b> {{accompanied by}} pain and {{weakness of the}} pinch grasp. The severity of the symptoms {{are related to the}} extent of the initial tear of the UCL (in the case <b>of</b> Skier's <b>thumb),</b> or how long the injury has been allowed to progress (in the case <b>of</b> gamekeeper's <b>thumb).</b>|$|R
50|$|The radial {{collateral}} ligament <b>of</b> the <b>thumb</b> {{extends from}} the first metacarpal head to the proximal phalanx <b>of</b> the <b>thumb.</b> It {{is located on the}} radial side of the joint and is weaker than the ulnar collateral ligament <b>of</b> the <b>thumb.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the study}} of natural selection, the {{population}} of Soay sheep that remain {{on the island of}} Hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success. Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively. The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of}} these advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E

5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
5|$|The mane of {{the adult}} male lion, unique among cats, {{is one of the}} most {{distinctive}} characteristics of the species. Although having a ruff is not so unusual for a lioness, in rare cases, a female lion can have a mane. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and testosterone production; the rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> is the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favours males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in Tanzania also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male–male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary and}} most common symptom in {{patients}} with CMC OA <b>of</b> the <b>thumb</b> is pain. Pain at the base <b>of</b> the <b>thumb</b> is mainly experienced when moving the thumb or when applying pressure with the thumb. However, in advanced stages of CMC OA, pain might persist at rest. Another prominent symptom is loss of strength <b>of</b> the <b>thumb.</b> Patients struggle to grab or hold an object due to weakening <b>of</b> the <b>thumb.</b> For example, tying a knot or holding a saucepan becomes increasingly difficult.|$|R
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule <b>of</b> <b>thumb,</b> 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E
5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules <b>of</b> <b>thumb</b> for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E

50|$|Trapeziometacarpal {{osteoarthritis}}, {{also known}} as carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis (OA) <b>of</b> the <b>thumb</b> or osteoarthritis at the base <b>of</b> the <b>thumb,</b> is a reparitive joint disease affecting the first carpometacarpal joint (CMC1). This joint is formed by the trapezium bone of the wrist and the first metacarpal bone <b>of</b> the <b>thumb.</b> Because <b>of</b> its relative instability, this joint is a frequent site for osteoarthritis. Carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA) <b>of</b> the <b>thumb</b> occurs when the cushioning cartilage of the joint surfaces wears away, resulting in damage of the joint.|$|R
