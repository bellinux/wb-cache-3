5|$|In most cases, {{the owner}} and {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; <b>obviously,</b> <b>he</b> could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E

Suppiluliuma {{claims to have}} plundered the area, and to have brought loot, captives, cattle, sheep and horses back to Hatti. He also claims that Tushratta fled, though <b>obviously</b> <b>he</b> failed to capture the capital. While the {{campaign}} weakened Mitanni, it did not endanger its existence.|$|E

I think we come off as a couple that has that has a genuine and deep connection. He is always there for me, but he's not impressed. I feel like we are sort of The Honeymooners, only I'm the Jackie Gleason character. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>he</b> irritates me on a significant basis, as everyone's significant other does.|$|E

5000|$|... "Player" [...] {{was written}} by Tinashe, Chris Brown, its {{producers}} Lulou and Alexander Kronlund, and Chloe Angelides. It features guest vocals from Brown. Regarding the collaboration, Tinashe stated: [...] "I've always kinda {{wanted to do a}} song with Brown. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>he's</b> one of the best entertainers of our generation... It's just exciting {{to be able to work}} with him".|$|R
500|$|Davis's {{breakout}} year led to compliments {{from his}} peers. Teammate Adam Jones summarized his style: [...] "Most {{of his home}} runs are just line drives that get out. <b>Obviously</b> <b>he</b> hits some moonshots too." [...] Cliff Lee, Davis's teammate in Texas in 2010, said, [...] "Watching his highlights, you can totally tell that he's relaxed and just letting it happen. He's not putting anything extra into it. It's just nice and easy, and it's impressive to watch[...] [...] [...] He and Miguel Cabrera are the two best power hitters in the game, in my opinion." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So <b>obviously,</b> <b>he</b> was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E
500|$|When the Thirteenth Amendment was {{submitted}} to the states on February 1, 1865, it was quickly taken up by [...] several legislatures. By {{the end of the}} month it had been ratified by eighteen states. Among them were the ex-Confederate states of Virginia and Louisiana, where ratifications were submitted by Reconstruction governments. These, along with subsequent ratifications from Arkansas and Tennessee raised the issues of how many seceded states had legally valid legislatures; and if there were fewer legislatures than states, if Article V required ratification by three-fourths of the states or three-fourths of the legally valid state legislatures. President Lincoln in his last speech, on April 11, 1865, called the question about whether the Southern states were in or out of the Union a [...] "pernicious abstraction." [...] <b>Obviously,</b> <b>he</b> declared, they were not [...] "in their proper practical relation with the Union"; whence everyone's object should be to restore that relation. Lincoln was assassinated three days later.|$|E

He was really buzzing about it all, which is great because, <b>obviously,</b> <b>he's</b> done all right for himself".|$|R

500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and <b>obviously,</b> <b>he</b> messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Karofsky's newly revealed sexual orientation, {{other aspects of}} his personality have been explored. In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", when the football team is forced {{to spend a week}} working with the glee club that Karofsky and other members have been bullying, the [...] "softer side" [...] of his personality is seen, especially when he's performing with the club. After the club's director surprises him with a compliment on his performing, Karofsky is the one who suggests that the team perform an extra musical number for the halftime show they are preparing for, though he comes up with a rationale that makes it sound like a necessity to keep up their social status rather than something he particularly wants to do. Adler said, [...] "I feel like that it did make him happy and, <b>obviously,</b> <b>he</b> has some natural abilities that Mr. Schuester was able to spot. I don't think he's ever allowed himself to do that ever in his life, to dance or learn a song, especially to do that in public. ...Doing that was such an obstacle to overcome." [...] In [...] "Furt" [...] and [...] "Born This Way", it is revealed that he had been kind, a cub scout, and an [...] "A" [...] student. However, his behavior had changed for the worse in the former episode before returning to the good in the latter. Although the anti-bullying club formed by Karofsky and Santana in [...] "Born This Way" [...] is created with ulterior motives in mind, Karofsky subsequently makes a tearful apology to Kurt in [...] "Prom Queen", and then insists that Kurt wait for his safety escort after the next class period.|$|E
2500|$|The A's {{had been}} looking for a right-handed-hitting first baseman to {{complement}} left-handed-hitting Brandon Moss since they traded Moss's platoon-mate, Chris Carter, to Houston in February 2013.

(Margareta) [...]...|$|R
60|$|The {{voice of}} the good citizen was broken by his contending feelings. <b>He</b> <b>obviously,</b> while <b>he</b> professed to contemn the {{pedigree}} of his Highland kinsman, attached a secret feeling of consequence to the connection, and he spoke of his friend in his prosperity with an overflow of affection, which deepened his sympathy for his misfortunes, and his regret for their consequences.|$|R

2500|$|There was no written church {{policy on}} interracial marriages, {{which had been}} {{permitted}} since before the 1978 Revelation on the Priesthood. In 1978, church spokesman Don LeFevre said, [...] "So there is no ban on interracial marriage. If a black partner contemplating marriage is worthy {{of going to the}} Temple, nobody's going to stop him... if he's ready to go to the Temple, <b>obviously</b> <b>he</b> may go with the blessings of the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} day of the attack, 16 April, there had been 120,000 casualties; [...] Nivelle had said there would be about 10,000. [...] Nivelle had promised the Government that the attack would either be a success or be stopped. [...] But <b>obviously</b> <b>he</b> did not have the same {{interpretation}} of 'success' as them; [...] he ordered the attacks to continue. [...] On the 19th, Minister Paul Painlevé came to see him to get the offensive stopped; but Nivelle was convinced that the attacks must continue. Gradually the whole thing had developed into the Somme-like action that all had feared. [...] (Griffiths, p.39) ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Peter Guralnick, for Elvis and {{the guys}} [...] "Hollywood was just an open {{invitation}} to party all night long. Sometimes they would hang out with Sammy Davis, Jr., or check out Bobby Darin at the Cloister. Nick Adams and his gang came by the suite all the time, {{not to mention the}} eccentric actor Billy Murphy ..." [...] When Buzz Cason asked Lamar Fike [...] "how Elvis did it – this partying nearly every night," [...] he [...] "answered, 'A little somethin' to get down and a little something to get up.' <b>Obviously,</b> <b>he</b> was referring to the pills that started a trend that sadly in only a few years would lead to Elvis's untimely death." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later, Dick lit a {{cigarette}} and blew smoke in Jen's direction while she was eating. Jen asked for Dick to stop, but he did not. Jen then reached to get the cigarette from Dick several times to which Dick began to burn Jen with his cigarette. Jen began to yell that Dick burned her on purpose. This incident ended with Dick yelling at Jen. Jen burst into tears and Jameka pulled Jen away from the confrontation and to the bathroom. Neither Jen nor Dick was expelled from the House and Jen was evicted on Day 55. Jen said to the Associated Press: [...] "I definitely think he should have been kicked out, but <b>obviously</b> <b>he</b> was definitely entertainment for the show, so that's why he was not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Six months [...] {{while most}} of the younger members of the family were still {{struggling}} with French, it was young Jimmy who acted as their interpreter. <b>Obviously</b> <b>he</b> was quite at home in Paris and like any other boy he was fascinated by the Cirque d'Été, the Summer Circus, which used to be pitched halfway down the Champs Elysees, a stone's throw from his home on the avenue Montaigne. It was here that he developed a love for horses which was to remain with him {{for the rest of his}} life. He got on well with the circus people, who let him ride the horses at rehearsals. The acrobats and trapeze artists, too, were his friends and he learned many of their tricks. At 18 he could do a double somersault between two trapezes – quite a feat.|$|E
2500|$|While United {{were eager}} to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated {{that he had made}} a promise to his family and his club to return on 12 March. This was {{confirmed}} on 20 February, when Larsson announced {{that he would not be}} extending his loan period. Despite this, Sir Alex Ferguson was full of praise for the striker, who scored 3 goals in 13 matches in all competitions during his three-month stay, saying, [...] "He's been fantastic for us, his professionalism, his attitude, everything he's done has been excellent." [...] "We would love him to stay but, <b>obviously,</b> <b>he</b> has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg and I think we should respect that – but I would have done anything to keep him." [...] Larsson scored Manchester United's only goal in their win against Lille at Old Trafford in the Champions League. He made his final appearance for United on 10 March in an FA Cup sixth round tie away to Middlesbrough, ending in a 2–2 draw.|$|E
50|$|He {{was well}} {{connected}} to the great religious events of the time - for example the religious revivals in Scotland, (see The 'Cambuslang Wark'), England (Methodism)and America (The Great Awakening). <b>He</b> <b>obviously</b> thought <b>he</b> was living in eventful times. In church politics he {{was the leader of}} the evangelical party, often seen as opponents of the Moderate Party, though his friendship with that Party's great leader, Principal Robertson belies this simple opposition.|$|R
5000|$|Despite halting his advance {{under orders}} of Hitler, the Nazi leader impatiently commented, [...] "von Leeb is {{in a second}} childhood; he can't grasp and carry out my plan for the speedy capture of Leningrad. He fusses over his plan of {{assuming}} the defensive in the northwestern sector and wants a drive in the centre on Moscow. <b>He's</b> <b>obviously</b> senile, <b>he's</b> lost his nerve, and like a true Catholic he wants to pray but not to fight." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Kosminski" [...] is also {{mentioned}} in Sir Melville Macnaghten's Memoranda in {{a list of}} three individuals who were suspected of being the Ripper. Macnaghten, however, thought that Montague Druitt {{was more likely to}} be the killer, and he did not mention anything about any alleged identification of Kosminski that had been withdrawn by a witness. That was strange because Macnaghten was an Assistant Chief Constable in the Criminal Investigation Department and Anderson was in charge of that department. Kosminski was sent to Colney Hatch Asylum, via the Mile End Old Town asylum, in February 1891, and we may suppose that the identification at the [...] "seaside home" [...] took place a little earlier, perhaps in January of that year. Macnaghten went to Scotland Yard in 1889 and so would have been there when the identification took place. Quite <b>obviously</b> <b>he</b> was not told about it and, if Anderson was confident that Kosminski had been the Ripper, he would have thought that {{there was no reason for}} Macnaghten to compile his memorandum, speculating about the Ripper's identity. Of the three men suspected at the time of the murders, Macnaghten thought Druitt was the most likely but in 1972, two years before she died, Macnaghten's daughter told her friend Michael Thornton that in nominating Druitt her father was [...] "only following the official line. The truth could make the throne totter." [...] Thornton reported this in the Sunday Express in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|Elvis {{preferred}} {{men around}} him who were loyal, trustworthy and deferential. Thus {{family members and}} friends of his youth were very important to him. [...] "For {{the first time in his}} life, he had a group of male friends to pal around with, and he relished being the leader of the pack." [...] The group began with Elvis' first cousins Junior and Gene Smith (Gladys Presley's sister Levalle's children) who accompanied Elvis everywhere, along with Elvis' high school friend Red West and rockabilly singer Cliff Gleaves. At that time Judy Spreckels seems to have been the only woman. She describes herself as having been like a sister to Elvis, a companion, confidante and keeper of secrets in the exciting days of his early career. [...] "Elvis was surrounded by the first wave of what would become known as the Memphis Mafia." [...] She says that she [...] "was with him and the guys all the time." [...] They drove bumper cars in Las Vegas Valley, rode horses in California and hung out at Graceland. [...] "There wasn't a crowd then, just a few guys," [...] and she emphasizes that she [...] "had nothing to do with being a yes man for him and <b>obviously</b> <b>he</b> trusted me." [...] Among [...] "the first to live, travel and play with Elvis" [...] were Delbert B. [...] "Sonny" [...] West (died 24 May 2017, Nashville, TN), Billy Smith, who was with Elvis from the start to the end and the only original member still with Elvis after 1976, Charlie Hodge, Lamar Fike, and Joe Esposito.

I think when he felt that part of his heart open up and to have it close again was devastating. I also think the image of a Nazi doctor going into an oven is sort of a brilliant metaphor of him literally paying. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>he's</b> a terrible character but I thought his end was very justified and somewhat poetic." ...|$|R
