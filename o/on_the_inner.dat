5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E

50|$|The castle {{consists}} of two sections in a single outer rampart. There are 44 bastions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rampart. <b>The</b> <b>inner</b> castle is in the southern section. There are also utility vaults used for storage.|$|R

5|$|In males, the semen {{is forming}} in the testis. The sperm {{structure}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius. Then semen travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally {{it goes through}} the vas deferens to the penis. The penis is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> side of the right tentacle.|$|E
5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> side of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E
5|$|As in all oryzomyines, {{the upper}} molars all have one root <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> (lingual) side and {{two on the}} outer (labial) side; in addition, the first upper molar in Pseudoryzomys and some other species has another labial root. The first lower molar has large roots at {{the front and back}} of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two roots at the front, one labial and one lingual, and another at the back.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Thomas Coke, {{the fifth}} Earl of Leicester, placed the castle into the {{guardianship}} of the state. Major archaeological excavations {{were carried out}} between 1972 and 1983, focusing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> bailey. In the 21st century, the castle and the bailey gate are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors. The castle and the settlement defences are protected under UK law as a scheduled ancient monument, and the bailey gate is further protected as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|In December 1876, six trains {{per hour}} ran <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> circle between Mansion House and Aldgate. The District {{operated}} four trains per hour from Mansion House to Hammersmith. Also leaving every hour from Mansion House were two GWR middle circle services to Aldgate via Addison Road and two L services to Broad Street via Willesden Junction. Three services an hour travelled between West Brompton and Earl's Court.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} not certain how many people died <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E

5|$|Johann Lamont {{was born}} in the Anderston {{district}} of Glasgow on 11 July 1957. Her parents, Archie and Effie, were both Gaelic speakers from crofting families <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> Hebridean island of Tiree, who met after both had moved to Glasgow. Archie was a carpenter employed by the Scottish ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne, working on the Mallaig to Skye route. He took part in the Seamen's Strike of 1966. The family were Presbyterians, and Lamont's mother was influenced in her faith by the American evangelist Billy Graham. Her first experiences of public speakers was listening to the preachers her mother took her to see as a girl.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric units <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> circle {{until later}} that day a Met multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District and the Met service was withdrawn. An incompatibility {{was found between the}} way the shoe-gear was mounted on Met trains and the District track and Met trains were withdrawn from the District and modified. Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May, Livingstone {{called a}} caucus of his supporters; announcing his intent to {{challenge}} McIntosh's leadership, he invited those assembled {{to stand for}} other GLC posts. The meeting ended at 4:45pm having agreed on a full slate of candidates. At 5 o'clock, McIntosh held a GLC Labour meeting; the attendees called an immediate leadership election, in which Livingstone defeated him by 30 votes to 20. The entire left caucus slate was then elected. The next day, a leftist coup deposed Sir Ashley Bramall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> London Education Authority (ILEA), replacing him with Bryn Davies; the left group now controlled both the GLC and the ILEA.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> {{surface of}} the nasal section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, which may have {{supported}} cartilage that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, the layer of tissue that detects odors. These ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness because they may have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, the nasal cavity of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E
5|$|Powers were renewed in 1926 {{for four}} tracks from Hammersmith to west of Acton Town, {{with the concept}} of the Piccadilly running {{non-stop}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> pair. The proposed service split, with the Piccadilly running through to Harrow and Hounslow, was clarified by 1929. District services would run mainly through to Wimbledon, Richmond, Hounslow and Ealing, with shuttles from South Harrow to Uxbridge and Acton Town to South Acton.|$|E
5|$|Szigetvár {{was divided}} into three {{sections}} divided by water: the old town, the new town and the castle—each of which {{was linked to the}} next by bridges and to the land by causeways. Although it was not built on particularly high ground the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today's castle, was not directly accessible to the attackers. This was because two other baileys had to be taken and secured before a final assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> castle could be launched.|$|E

Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the outer edges of the tubes) are absent.

Pleurocystidia (cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> walls of the tubes) are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm.
