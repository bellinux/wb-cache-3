40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{successful}} application of sequence to sequence learning for {{neural machine translation}} systems, interest has surged in its applicability towards language generation in other problem domains. Recent work has investigated {{the use of these}} neural architectures towards modeling open-domain conversational dialogue, where it has been found that although these models are capable of learning a good distributional language model, dialogue coherence is still of concern. Unlike translation, conversation is much more a one-to-many mapping from utterance to a response, and it is even more pressing that the model be aware of the preceding flow of conversation. In this paper we propose to tackle this problem by introducing previous conversational context in terms of latent representations of dialogue acts over time. We inject the latent context representations into a sequence to sequence neural network in the form of dialog acts using a second encoder to enhance the quality and the coherence of the conversations generated. The main task of this research work is to show that adding latent variables that <b>capture</b> <b>discourse</b> relations does indeed result in more coherent responses when compared to conventional sequence to sequence models...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} methods for {{condensing}} large documents into highly concise summaries, achieving compression rates {{on par with}} human writers. While {{the need for such}} summaries in the current age of information overload is increasing, the desired compression rate has thus far been beyond the reach of automatic summarization systems. The potency of our summarization methods is due to their in-depth modelling of document content in a probabilistic framework. We explore two types of document representation that capture orthogonal aspects of text content. The first represents the semantic properties mentioned in a document in a hierarchical Bayesian model. This method is used to summarize thousands of consumer reviews by identifying the product properties mentioned by multiple reviewers. The second representation <b>captures</b> <b>discourse</b> properties, modelling the connections between different segments of a document. This discriminatively trained model is employed to generate tables of contents for books and lecture transcripts.

40|$|Discourse {{structure}} and discourse relations {{are an important}} ingredient in systems {{for the analysis of}} text that go beyond the boundary of single clauses. Discourse relations often indicate important additional information about the connection between two clauses, such as causality, and are widely believed to have an influence on aspects of reference resolution. More so than for referential annotation, discourse relation annotation is rendered difficult by the absence of a general consensus on the underlying linguistic phenomena that should be targeted, as well as by a lack of strong predictions on the possible or permissible interactions between these phenomena. While it is sometimes claimed that the structuring of discourse is only weakly constrained and as a result <b>capturing</b> <b>discourse</b> {{structure and}} discourse relations will always result in poor reproducibility of the annotation task, we want to argue in this paper that an explicit notion of the relata of discourse relations allows to delimit annotation scope and to make use of theoretical accounts of the linguistic phenomena involved without giving up the goal of theory-neutrality that is essential in making sure that a given resource stays useful to a large community of users.

A general introduction including stellar nucleosynthesis, nuclear cosmochronometry,available neutron facilities and neutron reaction features is given. Dedicated measurements of the 186; 187; 188 <b>Os</b> <b>capture</b> cross sections have been performed at the CERN neutron time-of- ight facility, n TOF, in the neutron energy range from 1 eV up to 1 MeV. The details of the measurement and the data treatment are reported. Using obtained capture yields, resolved resonance region analysis is completed. Resonance parameters have been extracted from a full R-matrix fit. A statistical analysis has been performed and the related averaged resonance parameters are derived. This information is crucial for a complete understanding and modelling in terms of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model of the capture and inelastic reaction channels, required for the evaluation of the stellar reaction rates of these isotopes. The neutron capture cross sections averaged over the thermal neutron spectrum, Maxwellian averaged cross sections, for the range of temperatures relevant for s-process nucleosynthesis have been derived from the combined information of the experimental data in the resolved and unresolved resonance regions. The im plications of this analysis in the estimation of the s-process component of the 187 Os abundance and the related impact on the evaluation of the time-duration of the Galactic nucleosynthesis through the Re/Os cosmochronometer is shown. Moreover, further considerations for a realistic stellar condition, phenomena of 187 Re decay and s-process branchings are discussed.

40|$|Recent {{research}} in psycholinguistics {{has seen a}} growing interest {{in the role of}} prediction in sentence processing. Most attempts to computationally model predictive processing have focused on syntactic prediction. Examples include Hale (2001) ’s surprisal model, which relates processing effort to the conditional probability of the current word given the previous words in the sentence. Recent work has attempted to integrate semantic and discourse prediction with models of syntactic processing. This includes Mitchell et al. (2010) ’s approach, which combines an incremental parser with a vector-space model of semantics. However, this approach only provides a loose integration of the two components, and the notion of semantics is restricted to lexical meaning approximated by word co-occurrences. At the discourse level, Dubey (2010) has proposed a model that combines an incremental parser with a probabilistic logic-based model of co-reference resolution. However, this model does not explicitly model discourse effects in terms of prediction, and again only proposes a loose integration of co-reference and syntax. Furthermore, the Dubey (2010) model has not been evaluated on broad coverage data. Here, we propose a computational model that <b>captures</b> <b>discourse</b> effects on syntax in terms of prediction.
