25|$|The {{key element}} of the paro was the {{stoppage}} of production at the state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which was effected by management's locking workers out of facilities, along with the shipping shutdown. Many low and mid-level employees ignored the strike and reported for work. Unlike the previous strikes, this oil strike included not only the PDVSA management but also substantial parts of its <b>operational</b> <b>staff,</b> including virtually all of its marine flotilla captains. Within days the company was paralyzed.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the Cold War Belgium and the Netherlands signed an {{agreement}} settling the cooperation between the Belgian and Dutch navies in 1995, as well in peacetime as in wartime. As a result of this agreement the <b>operational</b> <b>staffs</b> of both navies were integrated in a joint staff under the command of the Admiral Benelux headquartered in Den Helder from 1 January 1996 on. It led to a unique form of cooperation of both navies in operational matters, training, logistics and maintenance. Both countries remain fully sovereign concerning the deployment of their forces.|$|R
25|$|Cooperation was {{hindered}} by Fighter Command retaining rigid {{control of its}} units. The Admiralty complained that RAF methods did not permit direct contact by RAF <b>operational</b> <b>staff</b> liaising with the naval command. Time was lost and the fluidity of aerial warfare, meant that RAF aircraft came into action {{at the wrong time}} or place, often in numbers too small to defend the evacuation ships. Vice Admiral Max Horton the Commander-in-Chief Dover, responsible for organising the evacuation (Operation Dynamo), asked to meet Dowding in late June, to prevent the operational difficulties occurring again. Horton was told to put his complaints on paper and send them to Dowding, with a copy to the Air Ministry and they never met. It was felt by the Admiralty that the RAF was fighting a separate war, with little consideration given to joint operations.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 Giddings {{attended}} the Empire Test Pilots' School at RAF Cranfield in Bedfordshire. Upon graduating {{he was sent}} to the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, to test new jet fighters for three years. He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 January 1950, and awarded the Air Force Cross (AFC) in June. He then spent five years as a Staff Officer at RAF Fighter Command, during which he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1952 Birthday Honours. He was then appointed as Commanding Officer of a wing based at RAF Waterbeach. He held this position from 1954 to 1956. He was promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1956, as part of the new-year promotions, and was awarded a Bar to his AFC the following day. His next appointment was to Central Fighter Establishment and he commanded their tactics wing. His next flying role was as Commanding Officer of No. 57 Squadron RAF that flew the Handley Page Victor. On 1 July 1960, Giddings was promoted to the rank of group captain, and served on the <b>operational</b> <b>staff</b> of Bomber Command.|$|E
25|$|Past {{projects}} {{financed by}} KfW include a water supply project in Wadi Musa; an integrated poverty-oriented project targeted at refugees and squatters which included investments in {{water supply and}} sanitation; sewage disposal for Greater Irbid; and a trunk sewer and associated pumping stations linking up to the wastewater treatment plant As-Samra near Amman. In Wadi Musa the Euro 11.3 million project achieved, for a brief period, continuous water supply {{as well as a}} reduction in distribution losses. The project was co-financed by France and, concerning sanitation, by the US. The Euro 16.3 m poverty-oriented infrastructure project implemented by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) of Jordan increased access to water and sanitation in two squatter settlements and four refugee camps. The investments in the camps were chosen in close dialogue with the residents who were organized in Community Improvement Committees, and were carried out between 1999 and 2002. The project complemented the World Bank-financed Community Infrastructure Development Project. The Euro 60.1 m Greater Irbid sewage disposal project (1994–2002) included the construction of two wastewater treatment plants and the associated sewer infrastructure connecting 202,000 residents, as well as training for <b>operational</b> <b>staff.</b> Both treatment plants operated satisfactorily four years after they had been completed.

500|$|Mackay and Berryman were {{determined}} that the Battle of Bardia {{would not be a}} repeat of the disastrous landing at Anzac Cove in 1915. [...] Berryman's talent for <b>operational</b> <b>staff</b> work came to the fore. From studies of aerial photographs, he selected a spot for the attack where the terrain was most favourable. His plan provided for the coordination of infantry, armour and artillery. While at times he proved secretive and hard to deal with, during the battle his forceful personality provided a good foil to the sometimes indecisive Mackay. Later that month Berryman planned the equally successful Battle of Tobruk. For his services in this campaign, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).|$|E
500|$|This {{was built}} in 1983 to replace the {{original}} (1900) swing bridge. [...] It is built of steel and powered by electricity. [...] The replacement work cost £0.5M and {{was part of a}} wider upgrade of the Navigation to conform to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard (see Later Development section of this article). [...] An elevated control house was built for the sole use of <b>operational</b> <b>staff,</b> but in recent years a freestanding low level standard control console has been built for the use of boaters when the bridge is not staffed. [...] Sykehouse Lift Bridge (downstream of Barnby Dun) was built to the same technical specification. [...] Although the bridge carries an unclassified road linking Barnby Dun and Bentley, the bridge also provided the only access for heavy loads to the nearby Thorpe Marsh power station, so the bridge was designed to carry abnormal loads of up to 180 tons gross weight. [...] Although Thorpe Marsh Power Station has now been demolished, the bridge is still busy with road traffic. [...] This is because {{it is one of the}} few crossings of the Navigation in this area.|$|E
500|$|Vasey {{returned}} to Australia in December 1941 to become Chief of Staff of Home Forces, with {{the rank of}} major general, which became substantive on 1 September 1942. At age 46, this made him the youngest general in the Australian Army for a time. His new command had the role of training and organising the Army in Australia, a task which became urgent with the entry of Japan into the war. In March 1942, Vasey, along with Major General Edmund Herring and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister Frank Forde with a proposal that all officers {{over the age of}} 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson appointed Commander in Chief. The [...] "revolt of the generals" [...] collapsed with the welcome news that Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief. In the reorganisation that followed his return, Blamey appointed Vasey as Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS). The two men worked closely, with Vasey conveying Blamey's orders to commanders in the field. With the establishment of Advanced Land Headquarters (Landops) at St Lucia, Queensland, Vasey became the principal <b>operational</b> <b>staff</b> officer there.|$|E

500|$|The battalion's most {{significant}} action around Tobruk came on 3 August, when 'A' and 'B' Companies attacked a German outpost {{on the right}} flank of the [...] "Salient", designated [...] "R7" [...] by the Allied <b>operational</b> <b>staff.</b> The attack {{was part of an}} attempt to reduce the German-held Salient, which had developed in the line south-west of Bianca. In conjunction with the 2/43rd's attack, the 2/28th Battalion attacked the left flank around posts [...] "S6" [...] and [...] "S7" [...] from the north. Heavy fighting around R7 resulted in 100 Australian casualties, the majority being borne by 'B' Company, and the fighting ended in the Australian assault being repulsed followed by a temporary truce for both sides to collect casualties. During the truce, German sappers led the Australian stretcher bearers through the German-laid minefields. Finally, in October, {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the Australian garrison from Tobruk by sea. By this time, the 2/43rd was holding the Bardia Road sector, and after two successful raids on Italian positions, which resulted in around 75 Italian casualties, the battalion was withdrawn. As part of the evacuation, the 2/43rd was taken aboard the Australian destroyer HMAS Nizam and the Royal Navy's HMS Latona on 17 October 1941. The Australians were replaced by British troops from the 70th Division, with the 2/43rd handing over to troops from the Durham Light Infantry. Casualties for the battalion during the siege of Tobruk amounted to 38 killed in action, 13 died of wounds, 156 wounded, and four captured.|$|E
