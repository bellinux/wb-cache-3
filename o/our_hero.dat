25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. <b>Our</b> <b>hero</b> is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E
500|$|The artwork {{has drawn}} some {{unintended}} mirth: American writer Susan Sontag included {{it on her}} [...] "canon of Camp" [...] in her 1964 essay [...] "Notes on 'Camp'", and Spiegelman admitted that the scenes of [...] "the depiction of <b>Our</b> <b>Hero</b> idyllically skipping through the glen with the Wife and their child makes [...] snicker".|$|E

"The Pit and the Pendulum is {{even better}} than its predecessor…The plot is heady stuff, and Roger Corman drives it forward—with {{wonderful}} matte shots of the castle perched on the seaside cliff, odd camera angles, the thickest cobwebs in horror-movie history, a spider in the face, and an iron maiden—all before <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> is strapped under the pendulum...in a sequence that still stands one's hair on end." ...|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is revenge. Bond is stopped from leaving Zanzarim by Breed and {{subsequently}} shot and badly wounded by Ogilvy-Grant; he tracks down the pair to Washington and attempts to get his revenge. According to the Sunday Business Post, [...] "this is where the author comes into his own, along with <b>our</b> <b>hero,</b> and it's all taken up a notch." [...] Associated with the revenge is treachery: it is a subject that recurred through Fleming's works, and Boyd uses it to provide a motive for Bond's mission of revenge.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety called Edge of Tomorrow [...] "a cleverly crafted and propulsively {{executed}} sci-fi thriller", {{saying that}} the film was director Doug Liman's best since The Bourne Identity (2002). Chang said that the screenwriters, {{with the assistance of}} the editors, [...] "tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times, sleight-of-hand), transforming what must surely be an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> into a deft, playful and continually involving viewing experience". Regarding the relationship between Cruise and Blunt's characters, Chang said [...] "Liman handles it with a pleasing lightness of touch that extends to the proceedings as a whole." [...] He also commended the visual effects of the [...] "expertly designed Mimics" [...] as well as Dion Beebe's cinematography.|$|E
500|$|Sepinwall {{complained that}} viewers went into [...] "the episode already {{knowing that the}} Britten family's car crash was {{anything}} but". Sepinwall noted that [...] "as it played {{not only with the}} structure of the show, but the emotions of <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> by showing us what happens if he stops going to sleep in one reality and waking up in the other". According to Sepinwall, [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] was [...] "effective" [...] as it [...] "forced [...] to finally confront a truth about his situation", and that he finally needs to grieve, by recognizing that one of his two loved ones is dead. Sepinwall praised how the episode [...] "kept mirroring moments in the pilot", while Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman called the installment itself [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "compelling". Yeoman compared Awake to , writing that [...] "with just two episodes left", Awake has to go into Mission: Impossible mode to [...] "provide answers".|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{consider}} Agneepath to be a {{homage to}} {{the era of the}} melodramatic, over-the-top action films of the 1980s and 90s. Critic Rajeev Masand analysed, [...] "Agneepath is a throwback to those heightened action dramas of the 90s, so every dialogue is delivered as a punch-line; <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> may be battered and stabbed, yet he'll rise like the phoenix, and the women are flung around to be raped or sold as sex slaves." [...] He added, [...] "The film is enhanced by uncompromising, brutal action, and by its striking camerawork, especially those scenes framed against a monsoon sky, heavy with dark clouds." [...] Writing for Hindustan Times, Mayank Shekhar explained that the film, like several other Bollywood films was inspired by the Indian mythological tale of the Ramayana. He also added that [...] "the external logic of a star driven, fantasy fed film" [...] would [...] "not be easy to gulp for many." [...] While writing a critique for Deccan Chronicle, Suparna Sharma quoted, [...] "Agneepath is more than a remake or a {{homage to the}} original. It’s about a son righting a wrong and this emotion makes us connect with the film immediately." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the work}} in Shaun of the Dead, blood and gore was {{prevalent}} throughout the film. Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: [...] "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail." [...] The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the additional effects was that [...] "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> characters really do have it all going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [...] seemingly very trivial enhancements {{can make a difference}} when combined across a sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|Francis Iles, {{writing in}} The Guardian, noting the short-story format, [...] "thought {{it better than}} the novels" [...] and wrote that [...] "the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities, {{but one of the}} others has a {{positively}} Maughamish flavour." [...] Iles also thought that [...] "it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although the downside is that [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along. Perhaps all that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond".|$|E

500|$|Sify {{felt that}} the film was {{strictly}} for Mahesh's fans but praised Jagannadh's work saying that the [...] "story sounds far fetched, demanding logic. The screenplay is a saving grace, which works like magic, making the audiences forget the monotony in between." [...] The reviewer highlighted Mahesh's performance, the dialogues and the songs as the film's stronger elements. Ramchander of Oneindia Entertainment called Businessman a serious film with limited appeal, which might be enjoyed by Mahesh's fans but which would be an average for others. B. V. S. Prakash of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and stated [...] "Businessman is a typical Mahesh Babu film all the way, evoking laughs with comic one-liners and subtle expressions. However, his efforts could go in vain thanks to a contrived and highly exaggerated plot." [...] IndiaGlitz called Businessman a [...] "Mahesh-Magnified film" [...] and stated [...] "It {{is clear that the}} director throws all logic to the winds in the hope that Mahesh the Prince and a few cheeky one-liners will salvage the film. There is so much meaningless lecturing in the movie {{in the form of the}} demented arguments that <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> employs in many a scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Dante was Nate's {{old friend}} who halfway helps him find a lost city of Spaniards and an {{antagonist}} of Uncharted: Golden Abyss. He has a rivalry with Marisa Chase and after Jason betrays Nate, <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> teams up with Marisa to stop Dante {{and his band}} of pirates. A Geiger counter in Chase's pack indicates that the gold in the Throne of Gold is radioactive. Dante arrives and reveals {{he knew about the}} treasure being radioactive and plans to strip-mine Quivira and litter the gold through the black market. Nate and Dante get into an intense fist-fight with Nate coming out on top. Nate and Chase leave Dante by the Throne of Gold, after he refused Nate's offer to leave with him and Chase with his last words to Nate and Marisa being [...] "Drake, Drake, you goin' all soft? It's Sully's fault! That's why you always leave empty handed Drake! EMPTY HANDED...EMPTY HANDED!" [...] Chase then detonates the bombs in the caverns to seal it. As she and Nate flee, the caverns begin to collapse, killing Dante and any of his mercenaries still in the cave system. Dante's personality is known as greedy, selfish and the only thing he cares about is himself, even while he and Nate were friends and in the end, his greedyness {{is the only thing that}} got him killed. He is voiced by Jason Spisak.|$|E
500|$|Critics adulated the {{character}} development of Rick Grimes, {{as well as}} the concluding scene of [...] "Nebraska". Kine appreciated the attempt to incorporate a suspenseful feeling in the series. She wrote: [...] "Mazzara wants to infuse some horror movie suspense back into the show and his intentions are evident in this scene. Even though I personally didn’t find it that tense, I appreciated the effort. It means that the show is trying to expand and become about something bigger." [...] Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre felt that Rick emulated Justified character Raylan Givens, and Halden commented that Rick was becoming [...] "something of a badass". Halden further praised the conclusion of the episode, calling it the series' best scenes. [...] "This {{is one of the best}} scenes I’ve seen on the show so far, and it does any number of things that The Walking Dead has struggled with in the past," [...] he opined. [...] "The tension builds naturally , the dialogue has actual subtext, and there’s a clear sense of risk here that never pauses to telegraph itself." [...] Meslow affirmed that the scene was an achievement for the writers. [...] "There are characters with new information ," [...] Meslow commented. [...] "There is dialogue with subtext [...] There is intriguing parallel plotting [...] And there's the surprisingly swift, violent dénouement, when Rick guns down Dave and Tony before they can do the same to him. It's a necessary action, given the circumstances, but it also rings in an honest-to-god character change for <b>our</b> <b>hero,</b> who, having dispatched zombie Sophia, seems to have developed a new recognition of the ruthlessness and self-centeredness it may take to survive in this new world order." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall appreciated James' performance, and opined that the scene was [...] "as suspenseful as any the show has ever done featuring actual monsters".|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Bianculli, {{writing in}} the New York Daily News, stated {{that the idea of}} putting Monk in New York [...] "sound great" [...] on paper but it did not take {{advantage}} of what could be [...] "a delightful study in contrasts." [...] Bianculli called it a [...] "misstep", criticizing its premise and how it was not able to keep the balance between comedy and drama that made it [...] "too outrageous." [...] A review for The Beaver County Times considered it a [...] "stunt episode" [...] and its humor [...] "uncharacteristically forced", saying it [...] "really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms." [...] Steve Johnson of Chicago Tribune affirmed that while the premise is funny, [...] "the writers {{go out of their way}} to play the city against his condition." [...] He continued by saying it [...] "wouldn't be so bad" [...] if he went to solve crimes [...] "but Friday's first case is a real stretch." [...] Although excited for the episode's premise prior its broadcast, Austin Smith of the New York Post was very critical of it. Smith said in this episode [...] "the producers have him [...] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming <b>our</b> <b>hero</b> into a full-blown mental patient." [...] He also criticized the [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York" [...] scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions [...] "caricature". Stasi wrote, [...] "It's one thing to be an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain." [...] As Smith, Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the jokes [...] "predictable" [...] and said [...] "If you aren't a Monk fan, these devices may strike you as altogether shopworn." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, the {{character}} {{was not well}} received. She came off as too angry and bitchy to some viewers.

[...] Burton stated, [...] "She was catching a lot of flack. , 'Oh, she's this cheerleader. She's like, you know, this cute little girl. She wants to be all hard and angry.'"

2500|$|Moore-Jones {{executed}} several {{versions of}} 'The Man with the Donkey', {{the first of}} which was completed in Dunedin the evening after he was given the photograph.

This version is now at the Australian War Memorial, while others hang at the Aigantighe Art Gallery in Timaru and the Christchurch Officers Club. Although at least six versions of the painting are known, all are dated '1915' by the artist rather than with the date of their execution.|$|E
