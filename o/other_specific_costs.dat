40|$|This {{research}} paper had a defined purpose of {{investigation of the}} internal policies and procedures {{that were used to}} administer and manage the day-to-day functioning of the workers’ compensation program at MidWest Regional Hospital. The goal of this study was a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the workers’ compensation internal policies and procedures program at MRH using an author-designed list of best practices. 3 As a starting place, a literature review focused on an internal multidisciplinary case management model. Analysis of approximately 100 journal articles, books and original research data from North America and Europe indicated, when properly implemented, that this type of management program may significantly reduce the overall costs of an organization’s workers’ compensation program. <b>Other</b> <b>specific</b> <b>cost</b> reduction factors were reviewed for compatibility with the multidisciplinary case management model. Information from the literature review suggests there are several functions such as illness and injury trend analysis and hazard abatement, that utilized many of the same resources as an established multidisciplinary case management model and could be efficiently combined to further reduce incidence of accident...|$|R

Strong academic performance {{is part of the}} eligibility criteria. Loans are not subject to credit approval. Loan applicants must be enrolled for undergraduate study in a postsecondary institution in Korea. Students do not qualify for this loan program if they are in a graduate school, a continuing education program through an academic credit bank system, or a school outside of Korea.Loan must be used for tuition, qualifying school fees, and <b>other</b> <b>specific</b> education-related <b>costs,</b> including living expenses during study. Loan payments may not exceed the student’s financial need; there is no other upper limit on the amount borrowed (loan program permits full coverage of tuition and expenses). In the case of applying loan towards both tuition/school fees and in-study living expenses, the lower limit is KRW 600,000 (at least KRW 100,000 for tuition/school fees plus at least KRW 500,000 for living expenses).Under the income contingent repayment system, a borrower does not have to pay the loan principal amount or interest until he or she has income above a certain minimum threshold level for repayment. Once the borrower’s annual income is greater than the repayment minimum threshold level, the borrower is under obligation to begin repayment.|$|R

Loans are subject to credit approval.Loan must be used for tuition, qualifying school fees, and <b>other</b> <b>specific</b> education-related <b>costs,</b> including living expenses during study. Loan payments may not exceed the student’s financial need. Depending on the type of school (i.e. undergraduate, graduate), the upper limit on the amount borrowed ranges from KRW 40 million to KRW 90 million. If applying loan towards both tuition/school fees and in-study living expenses, the lower limit is KRW 600,000 (at least KRW 100,000 for tuition/school fees plus at least KRW 500,000 for living expenses).The repayment system offers a borrower grace period of 10 years or less during which payments only need to be made towards the interest on the loan. This maximum period of time is determined by the borrower’s year in school and the remaining number of years within the standard period of the borrower’s program. After the grace period, the borrower is given up to 10 years in which to repay the loan principal amount and interest. The repayment period is dependent upon the borrower.|$|R

50|$|The initial {{economic}} {{cost of building}} materials is the purchase price. This is often what governs decision making about what materials to use. Sometimes people {{take into consideration the}} energy savings or durability of the materials and see the value of paying a higher initial cost in return for a lower lifetime cost. For example, an asphalt shingle roof costs less than a metal roof to install, but the metal roof will last longer so the lifetime cost is less per year. Some materials may require more care than <b>others,</b> maintaining <b>costs</b> <b>specific</b> to some materials may also influence the final decision. Risks when considering lifetime cost of a material is if the building is damaged such as by fire or wind, or if the material is not as durable as advertised. The cost of materials should be taken into consideration to bear the risk to buy combustive materials to enlarge the lifetime. It is said that, 'if it must be done, it must be done well'.|$|R

40|$|The Up-THERM heat {{converter}} is an unsteady, two-phase thermofluidic oscillator {{that employs}} an organic working fluid, {{which is currently}} being considered as a prime-mover in small- to medium-scale {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) applications. In this paper, the Up-THERM heat converter is compared to a basic (sub-critical, non-regenerative) organic Rankine cycle (ORC) heat engine with respect to their power outputs, thermal efficiencies and exergy efficiencies, as well as their capital and <b>specific</b> <b>costs.</b> The study focuses on a pre-specified Up-THERM design in a selected application, a heat-source temperature range from 210 °C to 500 °C and five different working fluids (three n-alkanes and two refrigerants). A modeling methodology is developed that allows the above thermo-economic performance indicators to be estimated for the two power-generation systems. For the chosen applications, the power output of the ORC engine is generally higher than that of the Up-THERM heat converter. However, the capital costs of the Up-THERM heat converter are lower than those of the ORC engine. Although the <b>specific</b> <b>costs</b> (£/kW) of the ORC engine are lower than those of the Up-THERM converter at low heat-source temperatures, the two systems become progressively comparable at higher temperatures, with the Up-THERM heat converter attaining a considerably lower <b>specific</b> <b>cost</b> at the highest heat-source temperatures considered...|$|R

40|$|CO 2 capture is an {{alternative}} to decrease CO 2 emissions from industries. A {{large part of the}} cost for carbon capture is related to the heat supply to the capture plant. In this study four alternatives to supply the heat demand in the capture plant at five industries in the Skagerrak area are evaluated. These industries are Preem Göteborg, Preem Lysekil, Esso Slagentangen, Borealis Stenungsund and Yara Porsgrunn. The heat supply alternatives are; Natural Gas Combined Cycle, Natural Gas Boiler, Biomass Boiler and Excess heat from the process alone or in combination with a Heat Pump. The lowest <b>specific</b> capture <b>costs</b> are found when excess heat is utilized. In those plants where the available amount of excess heat is not large enough to cover the whole heat demand in the capture plant, via direct heat exchange, the lowest <b>specific</b> capture <b>cost</b> is found when a heat pump also is used. <b>Specific</b> capture <b>costs</b> of 45 to 60 €/ton can be reached in such systems. The <b>specific</b> avoidance <b>costs</b> are the same for these systems since no fossil fuel is used.
