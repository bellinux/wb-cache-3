25|$|He {{was also}} a major {{character}} in the original season of the animated television series Super Friends (1973). In this series, Aquaman was shown to display superstrength—hefting a bulldozer blade over his head, for example, and using it to help stop a tidal wave. He also had encyclopedic knowledge of oceanography and <b>oceanology,</b> {{in addition to his}} more familiar water-breathing power and aquatic telepathy. However, this series has been blamed for making Aquaman unpopular, and even laughable, by reinforcing a weak image of the character. In the first two seasons of Super Friends, he was voiced by Norman Alden, {{and for the rest of}} the series he was voiced by Bill Callaway.|$|E
25|$|Gupta's {{researches}} {{have been}} focused on the study of earthquakes and he is known to have developed methodology for discriminating normal earthquakes from reservoir-induced ones. He has developed procedures to estimate the potential of reservoir-triggered earthquakes at a given site. His later studies are reported to have assisted in understanding the genesis of stable continental region earthquakes. He has conducted investigative studies on the structure of the regional crust of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. His studies have been documented by way of over 200 scientific papers in national and international journals and five books, namely, Disaster Management, <b>Oceanology,</b> Geothermal Energy: An Alternative Resource for the 21st Century, Reservoir Induced Earthquakes (Developments in Geotechnical Engineering), and Three Great Tsunamis. He has also edited 15 books, which included the Encyclopedia of Solid Earth Geophysics.|$|E
