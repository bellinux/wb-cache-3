25|$|Before the {{construction}} of the windmills, Golden Gate Park was paying the Spring Valley Water Works up to 40 cents per 1000 gallons of water. To avoid this expense the North (Dutch) Windmill was commissioned in 1902 when Superintendent John McLaren deemed the Park's pumping plant insufficient to supply the additional water essential {{to the life of the}} Park. A survey and inspection of the vast area west of Strawberry Hill revealed a large flow of water toward the ocean. The North windmill was constructed to reclaim the drainage towards the Pacific Ocean and direct fresh well water back into the park. Alpheus Bull Jr., a prominent San Franciscan, designed the North Windmill. The Fulton Engineering Company received the bid for the ironwork, and Pope and Talbot Lumber Company donated sails ("spars") of <b>Oregon</b> <b>pine.</b> The North Windmill was installed, standing 75 feet tall with 102 foot long sails. The Windmill pumps water up an elevation of 200 feet with a capacity of 30,000 gallons of water per pump per hour, supplying and replenishing Lloyd Lake, Metson Lake, Spreckels Lake and Lincoln Park. The water is pumped from the valley into a reservoir on Strawberry Hill from there the water runs downhill into Falls and Stow Lake. The North Windmill was successful causing another system of wells and a second windmill at the southwestern corner of the Park to be recommended. Samuel G Murphy provided from his own means, $20,000 to erect the windmill. The South Windmill (Murphy Windmill) stands as the largest in the world, having the longest sails in the world, since its construction, with the ability to lift 40,000 gallons of water per hour.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Lodgepole pine (Pinus conorta) is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} forest type across western North America. Central <b>Oregon</b> lodgepole <b>pine</b> forests are ecologically unique {{when compared to other}} lodgepole pine ecosystems. Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. murrayana) is the dominant variety and often exists as the climax species on pumice soils, while in most other regions lodgepole pine is an early successional species. Most lodgepole pine research has been conducted at high elevations in the Rocky Mountains. Research findings from other geographic locations may not by applicable to central <b>Oregon</b> lodgepole <b>pine</b> ecosystem. Forest and tree biomass distribution and utilization is currently of interest in the northwestern United States due to large outbreaks of MPB, changes in fuel distribution, and the desire utilize lodgepole pine for wood products and biomass. Understanding natural stand dynamics and responses to disturbance on individual tree physiology and canopy biomass distribution requires detailed studies on the structural differences of central <b>Oregon</b> lodgepole <b>pine</b> ecosystems. Little is currently known about the influence of vertical position and crown aspect within the canopy and their effect on the distribution of canopy biomass, herbivory and foliage retention in central <b>Oregon</b> lodgepole <b>pine.</b> This thesis describes the influence of both vertical crown position and crown aspect on the distribution of live biomass, herbivory and foliage retention in central <b>Oregon</b> lodgepole <b>pine</b> crowns. We randomly selected and sampled 33 trees within a stand in the Deschutes National Forest in central Oregon. We systematically sampled 36 branches from each tree, from which we measured total biomass, the percentage of consumed leaf area (visually estimated) and the foliage retention in years of each branch. Linear mixed models (LMMs) were used for this study to describe the responses of crown structure attributes to live biomass distribution, herbivory distribution and foliar retention distribution. A nested experimental design was used, where plots were nested within the stand to account for the differing levels of between plot variability. We found strong evidence that the vertical position of the branch within the tree crown has a significant effect on the distribution of total biomass per branch, percentage of consumed leaf area and needle longevity. We also found that crown aspect has a significant influence on the distribution of branch biomass, but does not {{have a significant effect on}} herbivory or foliage retention. The biomass findings were consistent with findings in previous Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine studies; however there were inherent differences present with needle longevity and the distribution of the foliage retention. There are differences between lodgepole pine ecosystems in the intermountain west and central Oregon, which need to be accounted for when further studying crown architecture and canopy structure...|$|R
