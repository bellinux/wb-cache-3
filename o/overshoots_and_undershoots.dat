40|$|Feedback {{control in}} neural systems is ubiquitous. Here we study the {{mathematics}} of nonlinear feedback control. We compare models {{in which the}} input is multiplied by a dynamic gain (multiplicative control) with models in which the input is divided by a dynamic attenuation (divisive control). The gain signal (resp. the attenuation signal) is obtained through a concatenation of an instantaneous nonlinearity and a linear low-pass filter operating on {{the output of the}} feedback loop. For input steps, the dynamics of gain and attenuation can be very different, depending on the mathematical form of the nonlinearity and the ordering of the nonlinearity and the filtering in the feedback loop. Further, the dynamics of feedback control can be strongly asymmetrical for increment versus decrement steps of the input. Nevertheless, for each of the models studied, the nonlinearity in the feedback loop can be chosen such that immediately after an input step, the dynamics of feedback control is symmetric with respect to increments versus decrements. Finally, we study the dynamics of the output of the control loops and find conditions under which <b>overshoots</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoots</b> of the output relative to the steady-state output occur when the models are stimulated with low-pass filtered steps. For small steps at the input, <b>overshoots</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoots</b> of the output do not occur when the filtering in the control path is faster than the low-pass filtering at the input. For large steps at the input, however, results depend on the model, and for some of the models, multiple <b>overshoots</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoots</b> can occur even with a fast control path. ...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized the study of human brain activity, in both basic and clinical research. The commonly used blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in fMRI derives from changes in oxygen saturation of cerebral blood flow {{as a result of}} brain activity. Beyond the traditional spatial mapping of stimulus–activation correspondences, the detailed waveforms of BOLD responses are of high interest. Especially intriguing are the transient <b>overshoots</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoots,</b> often, although inconclusively, attributed to the interplay between changes in cerebral blood flow and volume after neuronal activation. While physically simulating the BOLD response in fMRI phantoms, we encountered prominent transient deflections, although the magnetic field inside the phantom varied in a square-wave manner. Detailed analysis and modeling indicated that the transients arise from activation-related partial misalignment of the imaging slices and depend heavily on measurement parameters, such as the time between successive excitations. The results suggest that some transients encountered in normal fMRI recordings may be spurious, potentially compromising the physiological interpretation of BOLD signal <b>overshoots</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoots...</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{models of}} the {{insurance}} risk process use a Lévy process to generalise the traditional Cramér-Lundberg compound Poisson model. This paper {{is concerned with the}} behaviour of the distributions of the <b>overshoot</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoots</b> of a high level, for a Lévy process which drifts to − ∞ and satisfies a Cramér or a convolution equivalent condition. We derive these asymptotics under minimal conditions in the Cramér case, and compare them with known results for the convolution equivalent case, drawing attention to the striking and unexpected fact that they become identical when certain parameters tend to equality. Thus, at least regarding these quantities, the “medium-heavy ” tailed convolution equivalent model segues into the “light-tailed ” Cramér model in a natural way. This suggests a usefully expanded flexibility for modelling the insurance risk process. We illustrate this relationship by comparing the asymptotic distributions obtained for the <b>overshoot</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoots,</b> assuming the Lévy process belongs to the “GTSC ” class...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{performance}} {{is a very}} important evaluation index of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells used for real application, which is mostly related with water, heat and gas management. A commercial PEM fuel cell system of Nexa module is employed to experimentally investigate the dynamic behavior and transient response of a PEM fuel cell stack and reveal involved influential factors. Five groups of dynamic tests are conducted and divided into different stage such as start-up, shut-down, step-up load, regular load variation and irregular load variation. It is observed that the external load changes the current output proportionally and reverses stack voltage accordingly. The purge operation benefits performance recovery and enhancement during a constant load and its time strongly depends on the operational current level. <b>Overshoot</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoot</b> behaviors are observed during transience. But the current undershoot does not appear due to charge double-layer effect. Additionally, magnitudes of the peaks of the voltage <b>overshoot</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoot</b> vary at different current levels. The operating temperature responds fast to current load but changes slowly showing an arc-like profile without any <b>overshoot</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoot</b> events. The air flow rate changes directly following the dynamic load demand. But the increased amount of air flow rate during different step-change is not identical, which depends on the requirement of internal reaction and flooding intensity.

Pinnacle(3) SSIMRT plans consisting of 5, 10, and 15 identical 5 x 5 cm(2) MLC defined segments and MU/segment values of 5 MU, 10 MU, and 20 MU were utilized and delivered at 600 / 300 MU/min. Independent of the number of segments the <b>overshoot</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoot</b> at 600 MU/min were approximately +/- 10 %, +/- 5 %, and +/- 2. 5 % for 5 MU/segment, 10 MU/segment, and 20 MU/segment, respectively. At 300 MU/min, each of these values is approximately halved. Interfractional variation of these effects (10 fractions), as well as dosimetric variations for intermediate segments, are reduced at the lower dose rate. QA point-dose measurements for a sample (n = 29) of head and neck SSIMRT beams were on average 2. 9 % (600 MU/min) and 1. 7 % (300 MU/min) higher than Pinnacle 3 planned doses. In comparison for prostate beams (n = 46), measured point doses were 0. 8 % (600 MU/min) and 0. 4 % (300 MU/min) higher. The reduction in planned-measured point-dose discrepancies at 300 MU/min can be attributed in part to the inclusion of the first segment (overshoot) in the admixture of segments that deliver measured dose. Pinnacle(3) plans for 10 / 9 head and neck/prostate treatments were adjusted by +/- 0. 5 MU to include the effects of <b>overshoot</b> <b>and</b> <b>undershoot</b> at 600 MU/min.
