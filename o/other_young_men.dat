5|$|Florentine {{court records}} of 1476 show that Leonardo and three <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> {{were charged with}} sodomy but acquitted; {{homosexual}} acts were illegal in Renaissance Florence. From that date until 1478 {{there is no record}} of his work or even of his whereabouts. In 1478, he left Verrocchio's studio and was no longer a resident at his father's house. One writer, called the Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and working in the Garden of the Piazza San Marco in Florence, a Neo-Platonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers that the Medici had established. In January 1478, he received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio; in March 1481, he received a second independent commission for The Adoration of the Magi for the monks of San Donato a Scopeto. Neither commission was completed, the second being interrupted when Leonardo went to Milan.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{conflict}} {{flared up}} {{once again in}} 1306, when Robert the Bruce killed his rival John Comyn and declared himself the King of the Scots. Edward I mobilised a fresh army, but decided that this time his son would be formally {{in charge of the}} expedition. Prince Edward was made the Duke of Aquitaine and then, along with many <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> he was knighted in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey called the Feast of the Swans. Amid a huge feast in the neighbouring hall, reminiscent of Arthurian legends and crusading events, the assembly took a collective oath to defeat Bruce. It is unclear what role Prince Edward's forces played in the campaign that summer, which, under the orders of Edward I, saw a punitive, brutal retaliation against Bruce's faction in Scotland. Edward returned to England in September, where diplomatic negotiations to finalise a date for his wedding to Isabella continued.|$|E

25|$|In autumn 1940, {{following}} the Second Vienna Award which granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary, Negoiţescu followed the Cluj University's Romanian section as it relocated {{to the south}} of the new border, in Sibiu.

25|$|While {{a student}} at YU, Miller joined a chavurah {{together}} with five <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> (who were all to become notable Hareidi rabbis) to study Mussar from the sefer Mesillas Yesharim. The organizer of the chavurah was Yaakov Yosef Herman, a builder of Orthodox Judaism in New York City of the early 20th-century. Herman encouraged Miller to travel to Europe to learn Torah in the yeshivas there. Miller met Rabbi Isaac Sher, the son-in-law of Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, who was in New York collecting funds for the Slabodka yeshiva at the time. Sher did not raise much money, since this was during the Great Depression. But Sher would later declare this to be his most successful trip to America, since {{he was able to}} recruit and bring such a bright student to Slabodka.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Nilsen {{experienced}} domestic contentment with Gallichan; however, {{within a}} year of their moving to Melrose Avenue, the superficial relationship between the two men began to strain. They slept in separate beds, and both began to bring home casual sexual partners. Although Gallichan insisted Nilsen had never been violent towards him, he was regularly berated by Nilsen, and by early 1976, the pair began arguing with increasing frequency. Nilsen later stated that, following a heated argument in May 1977, he had demanded Gallichan leave the residence. (Gallichan was to later inform investigators that he had himself chosen to end the relationship.) Although Nilsen formed brief relationships with several <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> over the following 18 months, none of these relationships lasted more than a few weeks, and none of the individuals expressed any intention of living with Nilsen on a permanent basis.|$|E
25|$|Joan married Roger Mortimer, {{eldest son}} of Edmund Mortimer, 2nd Baron Wigmore, and Margaret de Fiennes on 20 September 1301 at the manor of Pembridge. Marriage to Joan was highly {{beneficial}} to Mortimer as it brought him much influence and prestige {{in addition to}} the rich estates he gained through their matrimonial alliance. Three years later in 1304 he succeeded as Baron Mortimer, making Joan Baroness Mortimer. He was knighted on Whitsunday 22 May 1306 by King Edward I. The knighting ceremony took place in Westminster Abbey and was known as the Feast of the Swan as all those present made their personal vows upon two swans. Two hundred and fifty-nine <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> received knighthoods along with Mortimer including the Prince of Wales who would shortly afterwards succeed his father as Edward II. Following the ceremony was a magnificent banquet held at the Great Hall of Westminster.|$|E

25|$|Bevan Spencer von Einem was {{the leading}} suspect in the unsolved murders of four <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> between 1979 and 1982, and police {{continued}} to pursue leads on those cases {{in the years after}} his murder conviction. The four murdered were Alan Barnes in June 1979, Neil Muir in August 1979, Peter Stogneff in August 1981 and Mark Langley in February 1982. In February 1988, the State Coroner at the time in South Australia, Kevin Ahern, ordered an inquest into the deaths of these four young men, and on 24 March 1988, the State Coroner in his findings stated that manner and circumstances in which the four were murdered were very similar to {{that in the case of}} Richard Kelvin, particularly the murders of Barnes and Langley. The reward for any information leading to an arrest for the murders was increased to $250,000, and this was later increased to $500,000 in September 1989.|$|E
25|$|As {{numerous}} male names {{had been}} found scrawled upon various stenographer's pads at Berdella's address, the detectives began attempting to trace each individual. One of these individuals traced, {{a young man named}} Freddie Kellogg, was able to state to detectives he and several <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> had intermittently lodged with Berdella since the early 1980s, and that he (Berdella) had been in the habit of plying his lodgers with drugs—typically intravenously—before engaging in sex with them regardless of whether they consented or not. Kellogg also stated Berdella had expressly stated that a condition of his lodging with him was for Kellogg to persuade young men whom he (Berdella) found attractive to attend parties at Charlotte Street in order that Berdella could drug them. Should Berdella ever discover any of these individuals was a police informant, he would use this knowledge as a tool in which he could blackmail the individual to his own advantage. In spite of this condition of his living with Berdella, Kellogg further stated that numerous male prostitutes and addicts had been reluctant to engage in any form of contact with Berdella because of rumors regarding his links to the 1984 disappearance of Jerry Howell.|$|E
25|$|The young {{crown prince}} grew {{up having to}} live up to a prophecy at his birth, which claimed that he would {{grow up to be a}} great warrior just like Minye Kyawswa. (According to the prophecy, Tabinshwehti was the reincarnation of a prince named Minye Kyawswa who was put to death by his father King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy. The prince {{supposedly}} prayed the same prayer as Prince Bawlawkyantaw of Hanthawaddy before the latter was put to death by his father King Razadarit in 1390. As Minye Kyawswa of Ava, who was believed to be the reincarnate of Bawlawkyantaw, grew up to be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy, Tabinshwehti, believed to be the reincarnate of Minye Kyawswa of Hanthawaddy, the prophecy claimed, would be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy.) The prophecy of a Minye Kyawswa reincarnate may have been popular in the superstitious world of Burmese politics since Upper Burma was going through immense political turmoil and decades-long internecine warfare. Since the 1480s, the once dominant power of Upper Burma, Ava, had been unable to prevent its key vassal states from breaking away. His father, who himself had broken away from Ava since 1510, required his son to receive an education in military arts. Tabinshwehiti along with Ye Htut and <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> at the palace received training in martial arts, horseback riding, elephant riding, and military strategy.|$|E
