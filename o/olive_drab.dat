5|$|Green was the {{traditional}} color worn by hunters in the 19th century, particularly the shade called hunter green. In the 20th century most hunters began wearing the color <b>olive</b> <b>drab,</b> a shade of green, instead of hunter green.|$|E
5|$|In the US in the 1960s, {{military}} clothing {{became increasingly}} common (mostly <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> rather than patterned camouflage); {{it was often}} found worn by anti-war protestors, initially within groups such as Vietnam Veterans Against the War but then increasingly widely {{as a symbol of}} political protest.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, anecdotal sources {{attribute}} {{the naming of}} the bombs to a pumpkin color: While the bombs were painted <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> or khaki in the field, photographs show that at least the units delivered to Tinian were shipped in the same yellow zinc chromate primer color worn by Fat Man.|$|E
5000|$|In World War II, Ballantine made a {{beer can}} that was painted <b>drab</b> <b>olive,</b> so it wouldn't reflect light and {{give away the}} {{position}} of the American soldiers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> or olive-grey bird, the {{mangrove}} vireo has yellow lores and {{two white}} wing bars. Sexes are similar. It is approximately 10 cm long. There are two disjunct populations of this vireo: Caribbean and Pacific. The Caribbean population has both yellow and grey colour phases, while the Pacific population has no colour phases.|$|R
40|$|Zooming {{through the}} ever-changing, lofty clouds, a Lockheed Lightning Interceptor came into view, her wings {{outspread}} {{as a huge}} eagle. Queen of the airways, she seemed propelled by some forceful, hidden power, concealed from the human eye. The sun reflecting the <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> green wings as the P- 38 made a gliding left bank was startlingly blinding...|$|R
5|$|PS90 Standard: The PS90 Standard is {{the current}} model of the PS90 offered by FN Herstal. It {{features}} a MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail fitted {{to the top of}} the receiver, which allows the shooter to mount their preferred optical sight. The rail includes a set of integrated iron sights, as backup in case the primary sight is damaged. The PS90 Standard is available with either an <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> or black frame.|$|E
5|$|Some United States Army Air Forces {{aircraft}} used {{a variation}} of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the top side of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged in <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> above and neutral gray below, though some had the edges of flying surfaces painted in medium green. In the later stages of the war camouflage was often dispensed with, both to save time in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish.|$|E
5|$|By 1945, Roane-Anderson was {{divesting}} {{itself of}} many of its tasks. American Industrial Transit took over the transport system, and Southern Bell the telephone system. Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime <b>olive</b> <b>drab.</b> Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for security reasons, was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. The dental service was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.|$|E
50|$|The Temminck's sunbird is 10 cm (female) -12.5 cm (male) long. The longer-tailed male {{is mostly}} scarlet, {{except for a}} greyish belly, yellow and purple bands between the back and tail, and four purple bands on the head emanating from the beak. The female is <b>drab</b> <b>olive,</b> except for rufous fringes to the wing and tail feathers.|$|R
50|$|The male Seychelles fody has {{a yellow}} face in {{breeding}} plumage which the female lacks. The plumage is in general a <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> and the beak is black. This bird grows to {{a length of}} about 12.5 cm. The female and juvenile resembles the female and juvenile red fody (Foudia madagascariensis), but can be distinguished by having upper parts with less streaking.|$|R
50|$|The {{dwelling}} is a modern, {{unique in}} design, {{and has been}} featured in numerous architectural books and magazines. The cubic shape, with trapezoidal openings, mirrors the surrounding landscape, which is dominated by fragmented monzogranite boulders. Building colors also reflect the surroundings with an orange gazebo found on some boulders and flowers. A <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> from shrubs and cacti and blue colors mimic distant ridgelines and the sky.|$|R
5|$|PS90 USG: The PS90 USG is now discontinued. In {{the same}} fashion as the P90 USG, this model has an {{aluminium}} reflex sight housing with a revised reticle. The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell of}} animals from natural {{habitats}} is usually olivaceous (<b>olive</b> <b>drab)</b> in color. The {{width of the}} shell of adults snails is 6–10mm.|$|E
25|$|The service {{uniform of}} the Austrian army is <b>olive</b> <b>drab,</b> the dress uniform is grey; for formal {{occasions}} a white uniform may be worn. The air force uniform is identical, {{with the addition of}} wings worn on the right jacket breast—gold for officers and silver for enlisted personnel. Branches of service are identified by beret colours: scarlet for the honour Guard; green for infantry; black for armour; cherry for airborne; and dark blue for quartermaster. Insignia of rank are worn on the jacket lapel of the dress uniform (silver stars on a green or gold shield) and on the epaulets of the field uniform (white, silver or gold stars on an <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> field). In 2018 a new service uniform with a six colour camouflage pattern will be launched.|$|E
50|$|The obscure berrypecker is a <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> {{coloured}} {{bird with}} a greyish wash on its upperparts. It resembles the female black berrypecker except that its wing linings and pectoral tufts are yellowish {{and the bill}} is pale coloured. The species is arboreal (Gregory & Webster 2004) and probably is a solitary forager of fruit and small invertebrates obtained by hover-gleaning (like {{the rest of the}} berrypeckers).|$|R
50|$|Dorsal {{coloration}} varies, but tends {{towards a}} <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> or a silvery green, sometimes with brown mottling. The flanks and belly are silvery. In males during the breeding season, the eyes become blue {{and the lower}} head, throat, and anterior belly turn bright red. The throat and belly of breeding females can turn slightly pink. A few populations, however, have breeding males which are all black or all white.|$|R
50|$|The {{streambank}} froglet {{is a small}} frog (2.5 centimetres {{measured from}} snout to posterior). The colouring can be red, brown, tan, to <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> green colour with many shades in between. Like its relatives Crinia signifera, this frog is of extremely variable markings, with great variety usually found within confined populations. The dorsal and ventral surfaces are very variable. The dorsal surface may be smooth or warty. The tympanum of this frog is not visible.The colour under the throat is pale grey, the ventral surface backwards from the front legs is white with granular, mottled black.|$|R
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to burn food in a solar cooker. Food that has been cooked even an hour longer than necessary is usually indistinguishable from minimally cooked food. The exception to this rule is some green vegetables, which quickly change from a perfectly cooked bright green to <b>olive</b> <b>drab,</b> while still retaining the desirable texture.|$|E
25|$|AWE {{stations}} and the Special Escort Group use the Armoured MacNeillie Mercedes Protected Patrol Vehicle. Where used on public roads, these are coloured dark blue, with Battenburg markings. When used only within Ministry of Defence establishments, they are coloured <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> with black 'Police' markings. This vehicle replaced the MDP's previous armoured vehicle, the Alvis Tactica, in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, the Department of the Air Force, via {{an update}} to Air Force Instruction 36-2903, {{authorized}} the wear of the President's Hundred Tab on the Airman Battle Uniform (<b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> version) and the Air Force service uniform (miniature full color replica) through the authorization for Airmen to wear any military badge they have earned given it is worn within uniform regulations.|$|E
40|$|Hat {{of olive}} green/gray felt. The low, domed crown is of a <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> green/gray felt, {{divided into four}} quadrants. Around {{the base of the}} crown is a band of {{similarly}} colored grosgrain ribbon, with bow at right side. The brim is of the same felt, and slopes downwards at front, and turns upwards at back. The hat is unlined, with an inner hatband of black grosgrain ribbon at inside base of crown. Attached to the inner band is an elasticized cord to help secure hat to wearer's head. Stamped in gold on inner hatband: "Made in France especially for / Best & Co...|$|R
50|$|The {{backs of}} adult animals {{is more or}} less uniform yellow green to <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> green with the males tending to be greener than the more olive brown females. The females may show a pale stripe along the backbone, light lines on the ridges and warts, these are less common in males. The newly metamorphosed young often have a bright, light green stripe along the middle of the back, with gold-brown {{speckles}} and black markings on their dark green skin and the lips and extremities where they form black bars. The lower half of the body is uniformly white or cream, although the male has a dark yellow throat.|$|R
500|$|As {{the result}} of the {{disagreements}} [...] with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit, Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits. Production of A Christmas Carol was not without problems. The first printing contained <b>drab</b> <b>olive</b> endpapers that Dickens felt were unacceptable, and the publisher Chapman and Hall quickly replaced them with yellow endpapers, but, once replaced, those clashed with the title page, which was then redone. The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843. Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red Morocco leather and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.|$|R
25|$|After the Korean War, khaki {{utilities}} {{were replaced}} by <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> versions, which were in turn replaced in the mid-70s by ERDL pattern uniforms. The Battle Dress Uniform became the standard utilities in the early 1980s, with the woodland and 6-color desert patterns available. After the Gulf War, the 3-color desert pattern was developed to address deficiencies, and worn until the MCCUU was adopted in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 19th century, the Austro-Hungarian army {{were issued}} with shakos, {{originally}} in black leather {{and later in}} pike grey wool. Gradually, {{the height of the}} shako decreased and the cardboard stiffening removed until, by 1908, it had evolved into the ski cap. This was worn by Austrian officers and enlisted personnel during both World Wars, but when the postwar Austrian Bundesheer was established in 1955 an <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> peaked cap and American style uniform were introduced.|$|E
25|$|To {{facilitate}} control among {{thousands of}} bombers, the USAAF devised {{a system of}} aircraft tail markings in 1943 to identify groups and wings. Both the Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces used a system of large, readily-identifiable geometric symbols combined with alphanumerics to designate groups when all USAAF bombers were painted <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> in color, but as unpainted ("natural metal finish") aircraft became policy {{at the start of}} 1944, the system evolved gradually to one using large areas of color in conjunction with symbols or patterns of color identifying the wing and often different colors for the group.|$|E
25|$|For the 1954 Universal International Pictures film The Glenn Miller Story, {{directed}} by Anthony Mann, a wartime performance {{set in a}} U.K. air base hangar was shot in Hangar No. 1 at Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, on 10 July 1953, with the late-production B-17G command aircraft of Gen. John G. Sprague, commanding officer of Lowry, as a backdrop. It received a wartime coat of <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> paint for the appearance, but the chin turret has been removed. Anachronistic B-29 engine cowlings line {{the back wall of}} the hangar, none of which operated in the ETO.|$|E
25|$|The ACU is {{worn with}} tan Army Combat Boots and <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> cotton socks. Commercial {{versions}} of this boot are authorized without limitation, complying with the following regulations—must be 8 to 10inches in height, be made of tan rough side out cattle hide leather with a plain toe and tan rubber outsoles, and be without zippers, metal cleats, or side tabs. The Mountain Combat Boot is available for difficult terrain, and the Extreme Cold Vapor Barrier Boots for cold weather. As with the T-shirt, coyote brown boots are authorized with OCP and will become the sole boot authorized following {{the completion of the}} transition in 2019.|$|E
25|$|Luxembourg {{military}} uniforms {{are similar}} to British uniforms, consisting of dress, service or garrison, and field uniforms, often worn with a black beret. Dress uniforms are worn mostly on formal occasions, while service uniforms are worn for daily duty. Luxembourg Army uniforms consist of service and field attire for summer and winter, {{as well as a}} dress uniform and mess jacket for officers. The winter service dress uniform, of <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> wool, consists of a single-breasted coat having patch pockets with flaps, a khaki shirt and tie, and trousers that are usually cuffless. The summer uniform is similar, but made of light tan material. Combat uniforms in olive-green, khaki-drab, or woodland camouflage pattern, worn with the United States PASGT helmet, are virtually indistinguishable from those worn until the 1990s by the United States Army.|$|E
25|$|The 58th Bomb Wing {{had been}} the first to deploy, {{beginning}} combat in June 1944 with only a handful of B-29's painted in the standard <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> camouflage. Each of its four groups employed a different method while based in the China Burma India Theater as part of XX Bomber Command. The 40th BG painted four horizontal stripes across the upper tail fin with the letter identification of the airplane below it. The 444th BG numbered its aircraft and placed it within a large blue diamond outlined in yellow on the tail fin. The 462nd BG painted its rudders but otherwise did not designate the group. The 468th painted two diagonal stripes on the rudders of its aircraft. When the wing and its groups transferred to Tinian in April 1945 the 58th Wing changed to a letter-symbol system.|$|E
25|$|Headgear {{included}} a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a field cap or bush hat worn with fatigues. IDF personnel generally wear berets {{in lieu of}} the service cap and there are many beret colors issued to IDF personnel. Paratroopers are issued a maroon beret, Golani brown, Givati purple, Nahal lime green, Kfir camouflage, Combat Engineers gray, navy blue for IDF Naval and dark grey for IDF Air Force personnel. Other beret colors are: black for armored corps, turquoise for artillery personnel; <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> for infantry; grey for combat engineers. For all other army personnel, except combat units, the beret for men was green and for women, black. Women in the navy wore a black beret with gold insignia. Males in the navy once wore a blue/black beret but replaced it with the US Navy's sailor cap.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence {{to produce}} a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design {{reflected}} the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and <b>olive</b> <b>drab.</b> Production was discontinued in 2002.|$|E
500|$|PS90 TR: The PS90 TR is now discontinued. It {{featured}} a [...] "Triple Rail" [...] receiver assembly {{identical to that}} of the P90 TR. The top of the receiver consisted of an MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail, allowing the shooter to mount his or her preferred optical sight. Two polymer side rails—one {{on each side of the}} receiver—were included for mounting secondary accessories, such as lasers or tactical lights. Like the PS90 Standard, the PS90 TR was available with either an <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> or black frame. As of 2013, the PS90 TR model is no longer listed by FNH USA.|$|E
500|$|Holsters for the Type 94 pistol were {{generally}} made from either pigskin or cowhide leather and ranged in color from tan to dark reddish brown. Holsters faced the same degradation in quality as the Type 94 pistol. As supplies of leather were exhausted in Japan, holsters manufactured in 1944 became fabricated from <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> fabric. The Type 94 pistol holster is distinguishable from other Japanese holsters having a pointed closure flap and a vertically positioned magazine pouch. The pouch tow has a narrow extension {{to accommodate a}} cleaning rod. The majority of holsters were made in civilian owned tanneries with some ink stamped with arsenal and inspection marks. A belt loop and two shoulder strap [...] "D" [...] rings are provided on {{the rear of the}} holster and are made from brass, galvanized steel, or nickel plating.|$|E
500|$|A third set of {{alternate}} uniforms {{honoring the}} 1978 Sounds are worn for Thursday home games {{in conjunction with}} Throwback Thursday promotions. The jerseys, similar to those worn by the 1978 team, are white pullover v-necks with bands of red, white, and blue around the neck, with larger bands at the sleeve openings. The word [...] "Sounds" [...] is written across the chest in red-on-blue music note-like script, with the player's number below the team name on the player's left chest in blue block characters surrounded by red. The right sleeve bears the round [...] "Slugger" [...] patch. White pants are worn with blue belts and blue stirrups. The cap is blue with a red brim, displaying an [...] "N" [...] styled like a music note in white, bordered by red. The team wears <b>olive</b> <b>drab</b> jerseys paired with white pants and home caps for all Sunday home games {{as a part of}} Military Sundays. These jerseys have the same [...] "Sounds" [...] wordmark and back numbers as appear on home uniforms, but they are presented in two-tone gray and tan camouflage instead of red. The player's number is located on the front, an American flag appears on the left sleeve, and ribbon honoring military personnel is found on the right sleeve. The team's batting practice cap is solid red with the guitar patch on the front.|$|E
