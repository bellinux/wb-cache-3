5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned <b>out</b> <b>right</b> in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
25|$|Some clocks have a timing {{adjustment}} (a fast-slow control). When {{the owner}} compared his wall clock's {{time to the}} reference time, he noticed that his clock was too fast. Consequently, he could turn the timing adjust a small amount to make the clock run a little slower (frequency). If things work <b>out</b> <b>right,</b> his clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of weekly adjustments, the wall clock's notion of a second would agree with the reference time (locked both in frequency and phase within the wall clock's stability).|$|E
25|$|Moreover {{at a spot}} in the Park {{where there}} is a charming wood he has another Palace built of cane, of which I must give you a description. It is gilt all over, and most elaborately {{finished}} inside. It is stayed on gilt and lackered columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail of which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the architrave, and the claws likewise are stretched <b>out</b> <b>right</b> and left to support the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes, covered with a varnish so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will rot them. These canes are a good 3 palms in girth, and from 10 to 15 paces in length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are split so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house is roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent the wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these canes, which (I may mention) serve also for a great variety of other useful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can be taken down and put up again with great celerity; and it can all be taken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When erected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200 cords of silk.|$|E

500|$|Angry Birds {{was praised}} by critics for its success for {{leveraging}} {{a combination of}} addictive gameplay, comical style, and low price into a viable franchise with long-term potential for profit.

500|$|However, {{the music}} on Ecstasy has been criticised as being [...] "directionless and floundered about within the {{framework}} of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas," [...] which was due to the band's in-studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound. In hindsight, Shields said that [...] "even when we'd finished it we didn't like half the songs we'd done. The record never came <b>out</b> <b>right</b> and it made us realise that we were still too twee". In response to the band's [...] "unwanted reputation for jangly feyness", My Bloody Valentine later incorporated elements of American indie rock music and Shields customised his guitars' tremolo systems, resulting in the band pioneering an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing. The term [...] "shoegazing", which was considered derogatory, was coined by Sounds journalists in the early 1990s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor".|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1463, Mehmed {{gathered}} an army of 150,000 men in Adrianople and prepared to march towards Bosnia. In his despair, Stephen Tomašević turned to the Sultan himself and tried {{at the last moment}} to procure a 15-year-long truce with him. Konstantinović claimed that he was present when the Ottomans duped the Bosnian envoys into thinking that the King's request for truce was granted, and that he tried to warn them about the deceit. Mehmed's army set <b>out</b> <b>right</b> after the envoys. Fortresses fell rapidly, and King Stephen fled with his family and possessions from Bobovac to Jajce. The Ottoman army under the leadership of Mahmud Pasha Angelović laid siege to Bobovac on 19 May, with the Sultan joining them the following day and tasked Angelović with capturing the King.

500|$|The {{collaboration}} {{was originally}} {{planned to be}} a remix of the song, while the solo version would have been included on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud.

Regarding Drake's inclusion on the song, Rihanna told MTV News, [...] "Drake is the hottest rapper <b>out</b> <b>right</b> now and we've always been trying to work together." [...] According to her, when he heard the song he liked it and wrote his verse after three days. Rihanna has further described the song as very youthful, playful and very melodic track; according to her that's why Drake was the perfect choice to be on it, [...] "cause he's a young rapper who has incredible melodies". [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was released as the second single from Loud; it was sent to contemporary hit and rhythmic radio in the United States on October 26, 2010. The single was made available for digital download on November 12 via the iTunes Store. A CD single featuring the song and a remix of it was released on January 21, 2011 in Germany.|$|E

During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's <b>out</b> <b>right</b> now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come <b>out</b> <b>right</b> / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride {{to tell you how}} I feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?".

But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist <b>out</b> <b>right</b> now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses.
