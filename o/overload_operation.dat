50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time <b>overload</b> <b>operation.</b> By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two forced draught fans which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced draught fans which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|E

40|$|The flow {{unsteadiness}} {{generated in}} the draft tube cone of hydraulic turbines affects the turbine operation. Therefore, several swirling flow configurations are investigated using a swirling apparatus in order to explore the unsteady phenomena. The swirl apparatus has two parts: the swirl generator and the test section. The swirl generator includes two blade rows being designed such that the exit velocity profile resembles that of a turbine with fixed pitch. The test section includes a divergent part similar to the draft tube cone of a Francis turbine. A new control method based on a magneto rheological brake is used {{in order to produce}} several swirling flow configurations. As a result, the investigations are performed for six operating regimes in order to quantify the flow from part load operation, corresponding to runaway speed, to <b>overload</b> <b>operation,</b> corresponding to minimum speed, at constant guide vane opening. The part load operation corresponds to 0. 7 times the best efficiency discharge, while the <b>overload</b> <b>operation</b> corresponds to 1. 54 times the best efficiency discharge. LDV measurements are performed along three survey axes in the test section. The first survey axis is located just downstream the runner in order to check the velocity field at the swirl generator exit, while the next two survey axes are located at the inlet and at the outlet of the draft tube cone. Two velocity components are simultaneously measured on each survey axis. The measured unsteady velocity components are used to validate the results of unsteady numerical simulations, conducted using the OpenFOAM CFD code. The computational domain covers the entire swirling apparatus, including strouts, guide vanes, runner, and the conical diffuser. A dynamic mesh is used together with sliding GGI interfaces to include the effect of the rotating runner.

40|$|Feeding {{more and}} more {{multiple}} non-linear and unsymmetrical power consumers (TV, Computers etc…) cause serious disturbances for the grid quality in terms of voltage harmonics and distortion power in particular in decentralised low power supplies like solar photovoltaic (PV) in households. The use of inverter-fed power devices with modern high speed micro-controllers and an intelligent management of the different powers to be generated can help improving the power quality under any operating conditions. The invention provides a compensation algorithm implemented in a micro-controller combining the use of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters to extract the different harmonics from the original voltage signal and applies a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) to every extracted harmonic signal, which is finally compensated via a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. All the PI controllers outputs are superposed in the final voltage source {{in such a way}} that they don’t conflict with each other, leading to a stable voltage source generation with a total harmonic distortion (THD) smaller than the limit of 8 % requested by the global European power quality norm EN 50160.

AD {{is concerned with}} the accurate and e cient computation of derivatives of complicated mathematical functions represented by computer programs. Source transformation techniques for AD, whilst complicated to imple- ment, are known to yield derivative code with better run-time e ciency than methods using overloading support of the underlying language. We present results from MSAD that con rm the increase in e ciency using source trans- formed code for MATLAB AD. Most importantly, we demonstrate the use of a unique compiler code specialisation method to implement AD. We also assert the need for compiler optimisations in MATLAB, especially in the con- text of AD, and showcase MSAD as an extensible infrastructure to implement new optimisations and algorithms for AD or other applications. Where other e orts on MATLAB AD are implemented using operator overloading or a mix of overloading and source transformation, MSAD (Springer LNCS, Vol. 3994, 2006) was the rst to generate di erentiated MATLAB code using source transformation alone. MSAD is also the only e ort to implement source transformed AD by resolving overloaded MAT- LAB code.
