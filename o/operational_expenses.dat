5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted <b>operational</b> <b>expenses,</b> or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor <b>operational</b> <b>expenses</b> to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E

25|$|MARTA {{was formed}} through the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Act of 1965, {{an act of}} the Georgia General Assembly.

While the enabling legislation put restrictions on how MARTA could manage its money, MARTA has never received any operational funding from the State of Georgia, making it the largest public transportation agency in the United States and the second-largest transit agency in Anglo-America (after the Toronto Transit Commission) not to receive state or provincial funding for <b>operational</b> <b>expenses.</b> The funding restrictions on MARTA were removed in 2015, with the passage of House Bill 213 by the General Assembly.|$|E

The population of this research are all government and private bank at the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

The result of this study are : there were differences in government and private bank performance for ratio CAR, NPL, ROE, BOPO dan LDR. But there is no differences for ROA. According to the Paired T-Test it has a significant difference at CAR, ROE, BOPO, LDR and NPL in the period of 2010 until 2012. Meanwhile for ROA there is no significant differences.

Our findings suggest that MFIs should increase their credit officer productivity and decrease the personnel expenses per employee in order to increase the overall cost-efficiency. Moreover, the MFIs should put more of their staff into income generating activities. Our findings also indicate that the MFIs should focus on more costefficient operations to avoid increased average loan amount and mission drift. Performance pay had no significant effect on the MFIs overall efficiency, which indicates that the MFIs incentive schemes motivate other performance measures than cost-efficiency.

2500|$|Managing the corporation's {{working capital}} {{position}} to sustain ongoing business operations {{is referred to}} as working capital management. These involve managing the relationship between a firm's short-term assets and its short-term liabilities. In general this is as follows: As above, the goal of Corporate Finance is the maximization of firm value. In the context of long term, capital budgeting, firm value is enhanced through appropriately selecting and funding NPV positive investments. These investments, in turn, have implications in terms of cash flow and cost of capital. The goal of Working Capital (i.e. short term) management is therefore to ensure that the firm is able to operate, and that it has sufficient cash flow to service long-term debt, and to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming <b>operational</b> <b>expenses.</b> In so doing, firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital exceeds the cost of capital; See Economic value added (EVA).

According to the Royal Household, [...] "he purpose of these resources is to ensure that the Head of State may carry out his tasks with the independence which is inherent to his constitutional functions, as well as with due effectiveness and dignity". The annual budget pays the remunerations for senior management staff, management staff and career civil servants, other minor staffing positions, and for general office expenses. The Head of Household, Secretary General, and other management staff salaries must be comparable to other administration ministers within the government, though in no way do they form part of the government or administration. As such, the management staff experience increases, decreases, or freezes to their pay in accordance with the fluctuations of government minister salaries.

Traditional systems utilize Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units to pressurize a raised floor plenum with cool air that is passed to equipment racks via ventilation tiles {{distributed throughout the}} raised floor. Temperature is typically controlled at the hot air return of the CRAC units away from the equipment racks.

The sensor network is attached to standard racks and provides a direct measurement of the environment in close proximity to the computational resources. A calibration routine is used to characterize the response of each sensor in the network to individual CRAC actuators. A cascaded control algorithm is used to evaluate the data from the sensor network and manipulate supply air temperature and flow rate from individual CRACs to ensure thermal management while reducing <b>operational</b> <b>expense.</b> The combined controller and sensor network has been deployed in a production data center environment. Results from the algorithm will be presented that demonstrate the performance of the system and evaluate the energy savings compared with conventional data center environmental control architecture...|$|R
