On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E

Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first letter to a Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul.

25|$|The Greek Catholic church, which {{functions}} in communion with the Latin Rite Catholicism, could have hoped {{to receive a}} better treatment in Poland, whose leadership, especially the endecja party, saw the Catholicism {{as one of the}} main tools to unify the nation where non-Polish minority comprised over one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizenry.</b> Nevertheless, the Poles saw the Greek Catholic Galicia Ukrainians as even less reliable and loyal as the Orthodox Volhynia Ukrainians. Also, despite the communion with Rome, the UGCC attained a strong Ukrainian national character of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a visit with the Ukrainian Catholic believers in North America and western Europe, the head of the UGCC was initially denied reentry to Lviv until after a considerable delay. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Rite faithful, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|John II succeeded {{his father}} as ruling basileus in 1118, but had already been proclaimed co-emperor by AlexiosI on September 1, 1092. Niketas Choniates alone tells of the actions by which JohnII secured his own {{accession}} to power. AlexiosI had favoured John to succeed him over his wife Irene's favourite, the Caesar Nikephoros Bryennios, who was married to their daughter Anna Komnena. Alexios resorted to dissimulation in order to avert Irene's criticism of his choice and her demands that Nikephoros should succeed. As Alexios lay on his deathbed in the monastery of the Mangana on 15 August 1118, John, consorting with relatives whom he could trust, among whom was his brother, the sebastokratōr Isaac Komnenos, stole into the monastery and took the imperial signet ring from his dying father. Then, taking up arms, he rode to the Great Palace, gathering the support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> who acclaimed him emperor. Irene was taken by surprise and was unable either to persuade her son to desist, or to induce Nikephoros to act against him. Although the palace guard at first refused to admit John without proof of his father's wishes, the mob surrounding the new emperor simply forced entry.|$|E
50|$|Especially {{the cathedral}} chapter evolved into <b>the</b> actual adversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Speyer <b>citizenry.</b> There were {{frequent}} threats against each other, economic sanctions, punitive and counter measures concerning taxes and revenues. The church neither wanted to forego revenues nor pay dues to the city. In turn, <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> refused {{payments to the}} church. Bishop Beringer of Entringen, for example, threatened to excommunicate those citizens that did not fulfill their interest payments to the Speyer canons. The power struggle between the pope and the emperor added to <b>the</b> heat <b>of</b> this conflict. <b>The</b> <b>citizenry</b> always sided with the emperor while the clergy took sides with the pope. Emperor and pope rewarded their followers with privileges. Thus, in 1239, Frederick II returned the Speyerbach {{to the city and}} permission for the fall fair in 1245 must be seen in that light. In 1239 and 1244, the popes Gregory IX and Innocent confirmed estates in Heiligenstein and Deidesheim and extensive rights for the cathedral chapter. On July 30, 1246, Pope Innocent even took people and estates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral under his special protection. At this, Frederick II ordered <b>the</b> expulsion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clergy from Speyer. It is not known whether this order was executed.|$|R

25|$|To the {{north-east}} the {{war with}} the Khazars persisted and in 700 Khan Asparukh perished in battle with them. Despite this setback the consolidation of the country continued under Asparukh's successor, Khan Tervel (r.700–721). In 705 he assisted the deposed Byzantine Emperor Justinian II to regain his throne in return of the area Zagore in Northern Thrace, {{which was the first}} expansion of Bulgaria to the south of the Balkan mountains. In addition Tervel obtained the almost imperial title Caesar and sitting enthroned besides the Emperor received the obeisance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> of Constantinople and numerous gifts. However, three years later Justinian tried to regain the ceded territory by force, but his army was defeated at Anchialus. Skirmishes continued until 716 when Khan Tervel signed an important agreement with Byzantium that defined the borders and the Byzantine tribute, regulated trade relations and provided for prisoners and fugitives exchange. When the Arabs laid siege to Constantinople in 717–718 Tervel dispatched his army to help the besieged city. In the decisive battle before the Walls of Constantinople the Bulgarians slaughtered between 22,000 and 30,000 Arabs forcing them to abandon the undertaking. Most historians agree that Byzantine-Bulgarian victory was the most important one for stopping the Arab offences against Europe.|$|E

Abetted by dry weather and strong winds, the flames spread north and west, moving rapidly among tightly packed homes and businesses. Residents poured into the streets, clutching what possessions they could and found refuge on the grassy town commons (today, City Hall Park). The fire crossed Broadway near Beaver Street and then burned {{most of the city}} between Broadway and the Hudson River. The fire raged into the daylight hours and was stopped by changes in wind direction as much as by the actions of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizenry</b> and British marines sent, according to Henry, [...] "in aid of the inhabitants."

500|$|During {{the time}} that he lived at 38 Rue Vanneau in Paris (from October 1843 until January 1845), Marx engaged in an {{intensive}} study of [...] "political economy" [...] (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, James Mill, etc.), the French socialists (especially Claude Henri St. Simon and Charles Fourier) and the history of France. The study of political economy is a study that Marx would pursue {{for the rest of his}} life and would result in his major economic work—the three-volume series called Capital. Marxism is based in large part on three influences: Hegel's dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics. Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of [...] "Marxism" [...] (or political economy as Marx called it) were in place by the autumn of 1844. [...] Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economy. Not only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally editing a radical newspaper and later the organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>citizenry.</b> Still Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies.
