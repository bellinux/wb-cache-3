5000|$|The Drum Buddy, {{invented by}} New Orleans Ninth Ward one-man band Quintron, is a light-activated <b>oscillating</b> <b>drum</b> machine which {{operates}} {{on the principles}} of an optical sound theremin. An electronic instrument developed in the Spellcaster Lodge QElectronics laboratory, only 44 units hand-assembled by Quintron exist. Its four voices - Space, Snare, Bass and Kick, are triggered by activating a photoelectric cell either intermittently or with an on/off DIP switch in combination with exposure to light.|$|E
5000|$|Playing a melodious {{synthesis}} of symphonic hard rock, that has occasionally {{been compared to}} Pink Floyd, Hanover Krautrockers Jane can trace their origins back to the late sixties psychedelic band The J.P.s (Justice of Peace). Releasing a single [...] "Save Me"/"War" [...] in 1968, the band featured future Jane members Peter Panka on vocals, Klaus Hess on bass and Werner Nadolny on saxophone. By late 1970 The J.P.s had dissolved and regrouped as Jane with Panka on vocals and drums, Hess switching to guitar and Nadolny assuming keyboards. Charly Maucher joined on bass and power vocalist Bernd Pulst completed the band in April 1971 and their first LP Together was released on the Hamburg-based record label Brain Records {{in the spring of}} 1972. Singing in broken English, which helped create passionate effects, a heavy expressive bluesy sound emerged with blistering Les Paul solos and slabs of Hammond organ backdrops, that was consolidated by Peter Panka's almost hypnotic <b>oscillating</b> <b>drum</b> beats, that would characterize Jane's music for almost 40 years. Together was warmly received by the German music press including Sound magazine, who had declared Pulst its vocalist of the year for 1971.|$|E
5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber cause it to <b>oscillate</b> rapidly, creating <b>drumming</b> sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|R
40|$|As animals {{travel through}} the environment, {{powerful}} reflexes help stabilize their gaze by actively maintaining head and eyes in a level orientation. Gaze stabilization reduces motion blur and prevents image rotations. It also assists in depth perception based on translational optic flow. Here we describe side-to-side flight manoeuvres in honeybees and investigate how the bees’ gaze is stabilized against rotations during these movements. We used high-speed video equipment to record flight paths and head movements in honeybees visiting a feeder. We show that during their approach, bees generate lateral movements with a median amplitude of about 20 mm. These movements occur with a frequency of up to 7 Hz and are generated by periodic roll movements of the thorax with amplitudes of up to ± 60 °. During such thorax roll oscillations, the head is held close to horizontal, thereby minimizing rotational optic flow. By having bees fly through an <b>oscillating,</b> patterned <b>drum,</b> we show that head stabilization is based mainly on visual motion cues. Bees exposed to a continuously rotating drum, however, hold their head fixed at an oblique angle. This result shows that although gaze stabilization is driven by visual motion cues, it is limited by other mechanisms, such as the dorsal light response or gravity reception...|$|R
