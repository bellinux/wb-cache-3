Research was focused on effects of pCO 2 treatments on phytoplankton densities, genera composition, and correlations between dominant genera and pCO 2 treatments.

40|$|AbstractIn an era {{of human}} activities, global {{environmental}} changes, habitat loss and species extinction, conservation strategies are a crucial step toward minimizing biodiversity loss. For instance, <b>oceans</b> <b>acidification</b> and land use are intensifying in many places with negative and often irreversible consequences for biodiversity. Biodiversity hotspots, despite some criticism, have become a tool for setting conservation priorities and {{play an important role}} in decision-making for cost-effective strategies to preserve biodiversity in terrestrial and, to some extent, marine ecosystems. This area-based approach can be applied to any geographical scale and it is considered to be one of the best approaches for maintaining a large proportion of the world’s biological diversity. However, delineating hotspots includes quantitative criteria along with subjective considerations and the risk is to neglect areas, such as coldspots, with other types of conservation value. Nowadays, it is widely acknowledged that biodiversity is much more than just the number of species in a region and a conservation strategy cannot be based merely on the number of taxa present in an ecosystem. Therefore, the idea that strongly emerges is the need to reconsider conservation priorities and to go toward an interdisciplinary approach through the creation of science-policy partnerships...|$|R
5000|$|Coral reefs {{appear to}} be both {{negatively}} and positively affected by pH and temperature changes. Corals in currently warmer waters appear to break down and die off {{as a consequence of}} lower pH and higher water temperatures, whereas corals in cooler waters {{appear to be}}come hardier and grow faster due to pH changes and temperatures rising. This change in coral community composition will allow formerly cold water corals to slowly move into areas previously occupied by warm water species. This shift in regional locality will likely be a slow, laborious process and the mean time could actually lead to more pronounced ‘dead zones’ throughout the <b>oceans.</b> <b>Acidification</b> and temperature increase leads to ‘dead zones’, because it allows for eutrophication to occur. Blooms of algae and phytoplankton explode removing oxygen during their eventual death and decomposition. The Southern Ocean is an area of particular high risk. A decrease in coral reef cover leads to less viable fish habitat and a breakdown in the food chain, further exacerbating ‘dead zones’. [...] In 2008, it was estimated that global fisheries dependent upon species associated with coral reefs topped US$5.7 billion annually.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ocean</b> warming, <b>acidification,</b> {{deoxygenation}} {{and reduced}} productivity are widely {{considered to be}} the major stressors to ocean ecosystems induced by emissions of CO 2. However, an overlooked stressor is the change in ocean circulation in response to climate change. Strong changes in the intensity and position of the western boundary currents have already been observed, and the consequences of such changes for ecosystems are beginning to emerge. In this study, we address climatically induced changes in ocean circulation on a global scale but relevant to propagule dispersal for species inhabiting global shelf ecosystems, using a high resolution global ocean model run under the IPCC RCP 8. 5 scenario. The ¼ degree model resolution allows improved regional realism of the ocean circulation beyond that of available CMIP 5 -class models. We use a Lagrangian approach forced by modelled ocean circulation to simulate the circulation pathways that disperse planktonic life stages. Based on trajectory backtracking, we identify present-day coastal retention, dominant flow and dispersal range for coastal regions at the global scale. Projecting into the future, we identify areas of the strongest projected circulation change and present regional examples with the most significant modifications in their dominant pathways. Climatically-induced changes in ocean circulation should be considered as an additional stressor of marine ecosystems in a similar way to <b>ocean</b> warming or <b>acidification...</b>|$|R

5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so <b>ocean</b> <b>acidification</b> is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are important parts of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E

Our experiments show synergistic effects of <b>ocean</b> warming and <b>acidification</b> on eggs and hatching larvae of crustaceans and fish.

In turn, respiration rates of developing embryos were significantly (p < 0. 05) increased under high PCO 2, suggesting higher energy demand due to e. g. increased acid-base regulation leaving less energy for larval growth.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of atmospheric [CO 2] continues to warm and acidify oceans concomitant with local disturbances, such as eutrophication. These changes can modify plant- herbivore grazing interactions by affecting the physiology of grazers and by altering the nutritional value of plants. However, such environmental changes are often studied in isolation, providing little {{understanding of their}} combined effects. We tested how <b>ocean</b> warming and <b>acidification</b> affect the per capita grazing by the sea urchin Amblypneustes pallidus on the seagrass Amphibolis antarctica and how such effects may differ between ambient and eutrophic nutrient conditions. Consistent with metabolic theory, grazing increased with warming, but in contrast to our expectations, acidification also increased grazing. While nutrient enrichment reduced grazing, it did not fully counterbalance the increase associated with warming and acidification. Collectively, {{these results suggest that}} <b>ocean</b> warming and <b>acidification</b> may combine to strengthen topdown pressure by herbivores. Localised nutrient enrichment could ameliorate some of the increased per capita grazing effect caused by warming and acidification, provided other common negative effects of eutrophication on seagrass, including overgrowth by epiphytes and herbivore aggregation, are not overwhelming.

40|$|Predicting {{the impacts}} of <b>ocean</b> warming and <b>acidification</b> on marine {{ecosystems}} requires an evolutionary perspective because, for most marine species, these environmental changes will occur {{over a number of}} generations. Acclimation through phenotypic plasticity and adaptation through genetic selection could help populations of some species cope with future warmer and more acidic oceans. Coral reef species are predicted to be some of the most vulnerable to climate change because they live close to their thermal limits. Yet, their evolutionary history may indicate that they possess adaptations that enable them to cope with a high CO 2 environment. Here, we first explore the evolutionary history of reef fishes and how their history has shaped their physiological adaptations to environmental temperatures and pCO 2. We examine current-day thermal and CO 2 environments experienced by coral reef fishes and summarize experimental studies that have tested how they respond to elevated temperatures and pCO 2 levels. We then examine evidence for acclimation and adaptation to projected <b>ocean</b> warming and <b>acidification.</b> Indeed, new studies have demonstrated the potential for transgenerational plasticity and heritable genetic variation that would allow some fishes to maintain performance as the oceans warm and become more acidic.
