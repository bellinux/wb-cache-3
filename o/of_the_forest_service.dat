5|$|Every year of its 17-year run on CBS, Lassie placed {{first in}} its time slot, Sunday 7:00 P.M. EST, and often {{ranked among the}} top 25 shows on television. The show's highest ranking years in the Nielsen ratings were the Martin years when the show placed #24 in 1957, #22 in 1958, #15 in 1959, #15 in 1961, #21 in 1962, #13 in 1963, and #17 in 1964. The only Martin year Lassie did not climb into the top twenty-five was 1960, when it ran {{opposite}} Walt Disney Presents on ABC and Shirley Temple Theater on NBC. However, Lassie still ran opposite Disney when the Disney anthology television series moved to NBC in 1961, and still managed to climb into the Top 25. With the advent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> seasons, the show began a steady decline in ratings.|$|E
5|$|The show's title {{character}} is {{portrayed in the}} two pilots by Pal, the MGM film Lassie. Thereafter, five of his male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again. His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light crashed to the floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work. Spook played the role {{in the spring and}} fall of 1960. Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> seasons. Baby died at eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.|$|E

25|$|The tunnel was {{constructed}} in two segments. Original construction commenced in early 1997 at the City Creek Portal, and mining progressed along an uphill gradient from east to west. After two years of mining effort, and more than 8,000 feet into the tunnel alignment, groundwater flows into the excavated tunnel began to steadily increase. Following extensive consultation with the United States Forest Service, MWD decided to halt mining on the east tunnel and install the final 12-foot diameter pipe liner in the excavated portion of the tunnel. MWD and the Forest Service worked to determine how best to complete the remaining 22,458feet of the tunnel. This collaboration resulted in significant revisions to the original design, revisions that would ultimately allow the tunneling effort to meet the strict groundwater inflow requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> Special Use Permit. The tunnel was redesigned to use bolted and gasketed precast concrete tunnel segments. Not only were these segments designed to provide structural support to the mined tunnel, but they also were capable of delivering a nearly watertight environment inside the tunnel to dramatically {{limit the amount of}} groundwater inflow during the mining operations. Construction resumed from the Strawberry portal, working toward the original City Creek Portal construction.|$|E

2500|$|One {{year after}} the 1910 forest fire inferno, Great Fire of 1910, the {{religious}} Greeley succeeded in receiving a promotion to a high administration job in Washington. In 1920, he became Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service.</b> The fire of 1910 convinced him that Satan was at work, the fire converted him into a fire extinguishing partisan who elevated firefighting to the raison d'être — the overriding mission — <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service.</b> Under Greeley, the Service became the fire engine company, protecting trees so the timber industry could cut them down later at government expense. Pinchot was appalled. The timber industry successfully oriented the Forestry Service toward policies favorable to large-scale harvesting via regulatory capture, and metaphorically, the timber industry was now the fox in the chicken coop. Pinchot and Roosevelt had envisioned, at the least, that public timber should be sold only to small, family-run logging outfits, not to big syndicates. Pinchot had always preached of a [...] "working forest" [...] for working people and small-scale logging at the edge, preservation at the core. In 1928 Bill Greeley left the Forest Service for {{a position in the}} timber industry, becoming an executive with the West Coast Lumberman's Association.|$|E

2500|$|Pinchot rose to {{national}} prominence under the patronage of President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1905, his department also {{gained control of}} the national forest reserves, thereby dramatically increasing the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service.</b> Pinchot developed a plan by which the forests could be developed by private interests, under set terms, {{in exchange for a}} fee.

2500|$|Because {{they are}} a fragile eco-system, even small climate changes can have a {{profound}} effect.

The agency states that [...] "global climate change and drought are helping to poise the Pinaleños for epidemic insect or disease outbreaks and catastrophic, stand-replacing fires. Indeed, both of these events have taken place in recent years. The flora and fauna have not evolved to tolerate these new conditions or catastrophic events, so {{there is a need to}} use silvicultural management and prescribed burning to begin to restore the natural balance in the remaining forests and woodlands." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his safari, Roosevelt {{traveled}} North {{to embark}} on a tour of Europe. Stopping first in Egypt, he commented favorably on British rule of the region, giving his opinion that Egypt was not yet ready for independence, paralleling his views about the Philippines. He refused a meeting with the Pope due to a dispute over a group of Methodists active in Rome, but met with Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, King George V of Great Britain, and other European leaders. In Oslo, Norway, Roosevelt delivered a speech calling for limitations on naval armaments, a strengthening of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, {{and the creation of a}} [...] "League of Peace" [...] among the world powers. He also delivered the Romanes Lecture at Oxford, in which he denounced those who sought parallels between the evolution of animal life and the development of society. Though Roosevelt attempted to avoid domestic politics during his time abroad, he met with Gifford Pinchot, who related his own disappointment with the Taft Administration. Pinchot had been forced to resign as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>service</b> after clashing with Taft's Interior Secretary, Richard Ballinger, who had prioritized development over conservation.

2500|$|Timber salvage {{operations}} began {{shortly after the}} fire suppression ended. [...] The Forest Service worked with the Collins Timber Company and the Fremont sawmill in Lakeview to remove dead trees that were still marketable. [...] However, the salvage process {{was not an easy}} one. [...] In September 2012, the Fremont-Winema National Forest offered to sell 25 million board feet of salvage timber to Collins. [...] This was because Collins operated the only sawmill in Lakeview, the nearest mill to the salvage area. [...] However, Collins declined to buy the Forest Service timber, choosing instead to focus on salvaging its own burned timber first. [...] Then in December 2012, the Forest Service offered its salvage timber in a sale open to all bidders, but there were no interested parties. This was due to concerns {{about the quality of the}} damaged timber and the distance it would have to be transported. [...] Finally, the Forest Service broke the timber sale into smaller lots near existing roads. [...] By then, Collins had removed much of its burned timber so they acquired some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> salvage timber. [...] Ultimately, the Forest Service only salvaged about 9 percent of the timber burned by the Barry Point Fire.|$|E

2500|$|Considerable {{controversy}} has surrounded Nestlé's bottled water brand Arrowhead sourced from wells alongside a spring in Millard Canyon {{situated in a}} Native American Reservation {{at the base of}} the San Bernardino Mountains in California. While corporate officials and representatives of the governing Morongo tribe have asserted that the company, which started its operations in 2000, is providing meaningful jobs in the area and that the spring is sustaining current surface water flows, a number of local citizen groups and environmental action committees have started to question the amount of water drawn in the light of the ongoing drought, and the restrictions that have been placed on residential water use. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> failed to follow through on a review process for Nestlé's permit to draw water from the San Bernardino wells, which expired in 1988.

2500|$|Fuchs and Reagan then {{met with}} representatives of the General Services Administration (GSA) who {{suggested}} that the exchanges be conducted without going through the Air Force Museum, and instead have the Forest Service become directly involved. In this version of the plan, the Air Force would declare that the aircraft were [...] "excess property" [...] and transfer them to GSA, who could then legally make the planes available to other government agencies, but with the provision that any agencies receiving them would be required to retain ownership. This plan was agreed upon, and Fuchs was given responsibility for coordinating the exchange program for the Forest Service. He did not, however, discuss the plan with the Forest Service's Office of General Counsel. The letter authorizing the program on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Service</b> stated that it complied with various provisions of the federal regulations, when in actuality it did not. In addition, Fuchs provided bills of sale to the contractors, transferring actual ownership of the planes to the companies, in violation of the applicable regulations, as well as the provisions laid down by the GSA. Further, Fuchs told his USFS superiors that the transfer of ownership had been approved by the GSA when in fact it had not. In the ensuing criminal trial, three Air Force generals testified that they were not aware that the government would be losing title to the aircraft; if they had, they said, they would not have approved the program.|$|E
