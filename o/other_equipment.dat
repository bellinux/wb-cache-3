5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the <b>other</b> <b>equipment.</b> A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the <b>other</b> <b>equipment.</b> Without ARC, the audio output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E
5|$|Independencia ran her {{sea trials}} in December 1877 and {{purchased}} by the Royal Navy in March 1878 and renamed Neptune, after the Roman god of the sea.

5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or <b>other</b> <b>equipment</b> that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use that route.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{training on}} 10 September, {{she returned to}} Barrow in order to correct some defects. Between 5 October and 12 January 1945, she was equipped with new radar equipment and <b>other</b> <b>equipment</b> to prepare her for deployment in the Far East. She arrived in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka on 1 March 1945 prior to her first war patrol. En route from Britain, she had stopped at Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said and Ismailia in Egypt and Aden, Yemen.|$|E
5|$|After the {{problems}} with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics. The seven astronauts for the mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools.

Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and <b>other</b> <b>equipment</b> to make Vanguard suitable for operations in the Arctic. An Action Information Centre was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around Vanguard.|$|E
5|$|CV-22B : U.S. Air Force variant for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).

5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and <b>other</b> <b>equipment</b> have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{obligation}} {{for a given}} dive profile must {{be calculated}} and monitored {{to ensure that the}} risk of decompression sickness is controlled.

5|$|Every year, Florida averages 10 {{deaths and}} 30 {{injuries}} from lightning strikes, {{with several of}} these usually occurring in or around Tampa. University of Florida lightning expert Martin A. Uman has calculated that the average resident is within a half-mile of 10 to 15 lightning strikes every year. TECO Energy, the local electric utility, spends over USD $1,000,000 annually to repair transformers and <b>other</b> <b>equipment</b> damaged by lightning strikes.|$|E
50|$|The buddy {{check is}} a {{procedure}} {{carried out by}} scuba divers using the buddy system where each diver checks that the <b>other's</b> diving <b>equipment</b> is configured and functioning correctly just {{before the start of}} the dive. A study of pre-dive equipment checks done by individual divers showed that divers often fail to recognize common equipment faults. By checking each <b>other's</b> <b>equipment</b> as well as their own, it is thought to be more likely that these faults will be identified prior to the start of the dive.|$|R
