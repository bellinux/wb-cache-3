40|$|Amongst {{the many}} {{mediators}} {{that have been}} implicated in the pathophysiological changes seen in sepsis and septic shock, nitric oxide (NO) {{is one of the}} most recent to be described. Its role in mammalian cell biology is enormous (reviewed in Nathan 1992; Bredt and Snyder 1994), but this chapter focuses on its role in sepsis. While the functions of NO are legion, we concentrate on a few central roles that NO plays in sepsis. In particular, we discuss its hypotensive, cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, cardiovascular, and cerebral effects. In common with other mediators in sepsis there are problems in extending the results obtained in animal models to humans. We therefore discuss the clinical data pertaining to the role of NO in sepsis separately. NO is one example of a potentially toxic <b>oxygen</b> <b>compound,</b> and many others have been identified as possible mediators in sepsis which we do not have space to review.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{near-infrared}} absorption spectra of three oxygen compounds of membrane-bound cytochrome oxidase (ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1. 9. 3. 1) shows that the formation of compound A (oxycytochrome oxidase) causes no significant infrared absorbance changes at - 103 degrees. At - 64 degrees, the formation of compound C from the mixed-valence state of the oxidase leads to increased absorption at 740 - 750 nm. The formation of compound B at - 84 degrees from the fully reduced state of the oxidase causes increased absorption at 790 - 800 nm. Further oxidation of cytochrome oxidase results in increased infrared absorption at 820 - 830 nm at - 60 degrees. The position of the infrared absorption band in compound C thus depends at least upon the oxidation-reduction state of heme a and its associated copper atom. Compound C contains two types of oxidized (cupric) copper; that associated with heme a is initially oxidized, and that associated with heme a 3 is oxidized as a second step in the reaction with <b>oxygen.</b> <b>Compound</b> C exhibits a unique intense absorption band at 606 - 609 nm that is tentatively assigned to a charge transfer interaction between heme a 3 in the reduced state and its associated copper in the oxidized state, with heme a and its associated copper in the oxidized state...|$|E
40|$|B[e] supergiants (B[e]SGs) are evolved {{massive stars}} in a {{short-lived}} transition phase. During this phase, these objects eject large amounts of material, which accumulates in a circumstellar disk-like structure. The expelled material is typically dense and cool, providing the cradle for molecule and dust condensation and for a rich, ongoing chemistry. Very {{little is known about}} the chemical composition of these disks, beyond the emission from dust and CO revolving around the star on Keplerian orbits. As massive stars preserve an oxygen-rich surface composition throughout their life, other oxygen-based molecules can be expected to form. As SiO is the second most stable <b>oxygen</b> <b>compound,</b> we initiated an observing campaign to search for first-overtone SiO emission bands. We obtained high-resolution near-infrared L-band spectra for a sample of Galactic B[e]SGs with reported CO band emission. We clearly detect emission from the SiO first-overtone bands in CPD- 52 9243 and indications for faint emission in HD 62623, HD 327083, and CPD- 57 2874. From model fits, we find that in all these stars the SiO bands are rotationally broadened with a velocity lower than observed in the CO band forming regions, suggesting that SiO forms at larger distances from the star. Hence, searching for and analyzing these bands is crucial for studying the structure and kinematics of circumstellar disks, because they trace complementary regions to the CO band formation zone. Moreover, since SiO molecules are the building blocks for silicate dust, their study might provide insight in the early stage of dust formation.
