40|$|<b>Old</b> <b>age</b> {{has many}} images, {{with the one}} of a crisis regaining momentum. While images of {{activity}} and opportunity gained ground during recent decades, this trend now seems to reverse. The current economic crisis drains the financial resources of older people, which increases <b>old</b> <b>age</b> poverty. Moreover, governments react to the double-pressure of economic crises and population ageing through budget cuts, which reduces support systems for older people. It, moreover, centers public discourses more strongly on social problems associated with <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Both developments underline the needs associated with <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and draw our {{attention away from the}} potentials of <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> In other words, they bring discussions on <b>old</b> <b>age</b> back to the topic of crises. This working paper discusses how the economic crisis affects older people, how governments, labour markets, and families react to the double-pressure of population ageing and economic crisis, and how individuals perceive their <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> It concludes with reflections on the implications of growing crisis-centrism in discussions on <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Such crisis-centrism can lead us to overlook social inequalities in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and to neglect the subjective character of the perception of <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> The public image of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> might, thus, be stronger associated with the idea of crisis than what older people’s lived experience suggests...|$|R
40|$|Background/Purpose: Measures {{to prevent}} the {{development}} of muscle mass decline should be initiated from midlife. However, the impact of physical activity at midlife on muscle mass in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> remains uncertain. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} whether physical activity at midlife influences muscle mass and physical performance in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Methods: A total of 272 Japanese women aged 65 years and older were enrolled in the study. Information about physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> were collected using a retrospective questionnaire. We calculated the skeletal muscle mass index in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and recorded the participants' walking speed and hand grip strength in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> We then classified the participants into four groups according to their physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and conducted multiple linear regression analysis to determine whether the physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> were associated with skeletal muscle mass index and physical performance in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Results: The participants in the groups that were physically inactive at midlife had a significantly lower skeletal muscle mass index in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> than those who were physically active at midlife (p <  0. 01). Participants in the groups that were physically inactive in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> also had significantly slower walking speeds at <b>old</b> <b>age</b> than those who were physically active (p <  0. 01). These associations remained significant after adjustment for age and body mass index. Conclusion: Physical activity at midlife may be associated with a higher muscle mass in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and physical activity in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> may be associated with higher walking speeds in <b>old</b> <b>age...</b>|$|R

5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly <b>older</b> <b>age</b> group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E
