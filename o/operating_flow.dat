Current <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows,</b> as proxy for future <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows,</b> are regressed on past one, two and three years of earnings, <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows,</b> <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> combined with aggregated/disaggregated accruals and EBITDA as predictors. The sample was collected from annual financial statements of 97 listed corporations from 1999 to 2009 (11 years) and categorised into two subsamples; the within sample (1999 to 2008) to develop the models and the holdout sample (2009) to validate the robustness of the models. Results from the regression analyses revealed that all the accounting measures examined have significant predictive abilities but differing powers. Earnings are superior to <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> but EBITDA are stronger than both earnings and <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> while the <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> have the weakest predictive powers. The model comprising of both <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> and disaggregated accrual components have the strongest predictive abilities. This suggests that disaggregating earnings into <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> and accruals and further decomposing the aggregated accruals into the individual accrual components enhance the predictive abilities. These findings revealed that accruals have incremental explanatory powers beyond that contained in <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> and disaggregated accrual components provided incremental explanatory powers exceeding that provided by aggregated accruals. Aggregated earnings masked the contributions of each accrual component. Disaggregating earnings and further decomposing the aggregated accruals unmask the contributions and effects of each accrual component.

40|$|Purpose - In {{response}} to recent concerns on earnings quality and a firm's fundamental performance, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to re-examine salient questions under accrual accounting: how earnings quality affects the role of earnings and <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> in a firm's valuation. Design/methodology/ approach - Using a large sample ranging from 1989 to 2008, the authors contrast the effects of three representative accrual-based earnings quality measures on the association between earnings, <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> and a firm's abnormal stock returns. Findings - In the univariate analysis it was found that earnings explain returns similarly to <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows.</b> With control of earnings quality, the results indicate that earnings' role in explaining contemporaneous abnormal returns remains unchanged when earnings quality is better. Conversely, <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> explain more contemporaneous abnormal returns when earnings quality is better. The findings could suggest that the market reacts to <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> conditionally on earnings quality. Intriguingly, the results also indicate that the market perceives better earnings quality captures superior performance of <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> rather than that of earnings. These findings are further fortified by additional analyses revealing that the earnings quality measure with control of <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> affects the supplemental role of <b>operating</b> cash <b>flows</b> most. Originality/value - The paper's findings provide insights on how the market processes firm value signals embedded in earnings quality, which have direct implications for regulators, standard setters, academics and practitioners.
