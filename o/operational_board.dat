It opened in October 1882 and provided room for a further 18 beds. The only other boarding school to have operated in Townsville prior to this was a small private establishment operated by Mrs Deakin O'Reilly in 1875. The longevity of this establishment is unknown. Three other short-lived schools operated in the late 1870s through to the mid 1880s. The last of these, Dr Thomatis's grammar school operated briefly between 1881 and 1886. Townsville Grammar, established in 1888 housed boarders, as did St Anne's Anglican girls' school, which started with six boarders in 1917 thereby making St Patrick's the oldest <b>operational</b> <b>boarding</b> school in Townsville.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{important}} role governing boards play in organisational life our understanding of their strategic function is limited. This paper embarks on theory development to explain the notion of board strategic capability and to identify the factors and their relationships influencing strategic capability of sport boards. This little-used construct, we argue, can guide future governance research. In reflecting on the extant literature from the nonprofit, for-profit and sport governance domains, we derived six distinct and central factors of board strategic capability: increasing contribution of volunteer board members (2 ̆ 7 will and skill 2 ̆ 7); <b>board</b> <b>operational</b> knowledge; <b>board</b> integrating regional entities into the governing role; board maintaining the monitoring and control function; board co-leading strategy development; and board co-leading integration of strategy into board processes. In considering the relationships between these six factors, we propose a theory of 2 ̆ 7 board strategic balance 2 ̆ 7 that explains these influences in a holistic model. We conclude that the theory of board strategic capability is encapsulated by understanding how creating and maintaining. equilibrium in these roles and functions is managed by sport boards...|$|R
