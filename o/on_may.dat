5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa <b>on</b> <b>May</b> 14, which {{is believed to have been}} the impetus to Barbara.

It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC <b>on</b> <b>May</b> 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very light wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E
