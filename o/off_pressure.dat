He came under pressure from José María López until {{he retired from the}} ePrix with power issues, handing the lead to López. Di Grassi and Jérôme d'Ambrosio made early pit stops for the switch into their second cars and di Grassi became the leader on lap 26 {{when the rest of the}} field made their stops. D'Ambrosio held <b>off</b> <b>pressure</b> from Vergne for second place until he was passed on the 43rd lap and di Grassi remained the leader for the rest of the race after conserving electrical energy to win. There were three lead changes among four different drivers and three safety car periods during the course of the race.|$|E
25|$|Kurzweil says {{evolutionary}} progress looks smooth, {{but that}} really it {{is divided into}} paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels <b>off,</b> <b>pressure</b> builds to find or develop a new paradigm. So {{what looks like a}} single smooth curve is really series of smaller S curves. For example Kurzweil notes that when vacuum tubes stopped getting faster, cheaper transistors became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.|$|E
25|$|Leimer fended <b>off</b> <b>pressure</b> {{from the}} fast-starting Coletti to {{maintain}} his pole position advantage in the opening sequence of corners. Leimer pulled out an healthy advantage in the following laps and ceded the lead to Adrian Quaife-Hobbs for ten laps after making an mandatory pit stop for tyre changes. He retook first place after Quaife-Hobbs made his pit stop and held the position to win the race. Tom Dillmann started from pole position in the sprint race but lost the lead to teammate Bird {{before the end of}} the first lap. Coletti and Nasr gained on Bird in the final two laps as his tyres were worn out. Coletti bowed out after running wide and lost second to Nasr before the start of the final lap. Bird successfully fended off Nasr to win the race by 0.080 seconds, the closest margin of victory in GP2 Series history.|$|E

25|$|During {{the ensuing}} Battle of Spion Kop (24 January), Wilson was {{critical}} of Buller’s lack of a proper staff, of his lack of communication, and of his interference with Warren whom he had placed in charge. In an account written after the battle (possibly a report which he wrote for Roberts in January 1902) {{he claimed to have}} wanted to draw <b>off</b> <b>pressure</b> by sending two battalions – the Scottish Rifles (Cameronians) and 60th King's Royal Rifle Corps, as well as Bethune’s Buccaneers (a Mounted Infantry unit), to occupy the Sugar Loaf two miles East-North-East of Spion Kop, where Warren’s men were under fire from three sides. Lyttelton – 25 years later – claimed that Wilson had suggested to him to send reinforcements to help Warren. Wilson’s contemporary diary is ambiguous, claiming that “we” had sent the 60th to take the Sugar Loaf, whilst Bethune’s men and the Rifles went to assist Warren, and that as the Kop became crowded Lyttelton refused Wilson’s request to send the Rifles to the Sugar Loaf to assist the 60th.|$|E
500|$|During {{the months}} that the {{expedition}} remained in Kabul, Habibullah fended <b>off</b> <b>pressure</b> to commit to the Central war effort with what {{has been described as}} [...] "masterly inactivity". He waited for the outcome of the war to be predictable, announcing to the mission his sympathy for the Central Powers and asserting his willingness to lead an army into India—if and when Turco-German troops were able to offer support. Hints that the mission would leave if nothing could be achieved were placated with flattery and invitations to stay on. Meanwhile, expedition members were allowed to freely venture into Kabul, a liberty which was put to good use on a successful hearts and minds campaign, with expedition members spending freely on local goods and paying cash. Two dozen Austrian prisoners of war who had escaped from Russian camps were recruited by Niedermayer to construct a hospital. Meanwhile, Kasim Bey acquainted himself with the local Turkish community, spreading Enver Pasha's message of unity and Pan-Turanian jihad. Habibullah tolerated the increasingly anti-British and pro-Central tone being taken by his newspaper, Siraj al Akhbar, whose editor—his father-in-law Mahmud Tarzi—had accepted Barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916. Tarzi published a series of inflammatory articles by Raja Mahendra Pratap and printed anti-British and pro-Central articles and propaganda. By May 1916, the tone in the paper was deemed serious enough for the Raj to intercept the copies intended for India.|$|E

As the five red lights went out to signal the beginning of the event, Leimer fended <b>off</b> <b>pressure</b> from the fast-starting Coletti to maintain his pole position advantage in the opening sequence of corners. Coletti had forced Leimer to defend the lead at the fourth turn and drew alongside the latter through turns five and six but could not overtake him. Bird made a quick start and was able to move past Rossi and Quaife-Hobbs in the centre of the circuit for third position. Palmer also made a fast getaway and ran in fifth place after he passed Rossi heading down the main straight. De Jong became the race's first retirement after the first lap was over when he limped back to the pit lane. He was joined by Varhaug on lap five who had mechanical trouble.|$|E

50|$|Managing {{laboratory}} tests {{can be quite}} challenging, especially if tests take place over a long time, across multiple locations, or in infrastructures where many tests occur. Such tests include creep tests for a material, reaction tests of a certain chemical or wireless transmission tests of a circuit.
