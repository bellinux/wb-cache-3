A discussion with Saddington had provided the name, [...] "I was with [...] one night <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> 'Chez Ivy's' and we just started talking about names for groups. You know, raging along and we suddenly hit on Sylvia ... and 'Synthetics' just seemed to go so well". Chez Ivy's was a wine bar in Bondi Junction which was frequented in the 1970s by gays and lesbians. Sylvia and the Synthetic's history [...] "paralleled {{the early years of the}} gay rights movement" [...] in Oxford Street, Sydney.|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{focused on}} the [...] "{{delegate}} math." [...] He won the total delegate count in Texas, and he stayed close to Clinton on the delegate count in Ohio. [...] "No matter what happens tonight," [...] he said, [...] "we have nearly the same delegate lead that we did this morning, and we are <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> winning this nomination." [...] In fact, March 4 was the first election day in which Clinton won more delegates than Obama (though the Florida and Michigan primaries would later be honored by seating half of the states' delegations). After winning contests in Wyoming and Mississippi the following week, Obama erased Clinton's March 4 gains. On March 15, he increased his lead by 10 delegates at the Iowa county conventions, when former supporters of withdrawn candidates switched their support to him.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the stage}} sat four Indian men, {{one of whom}} was Sitting Bull. [...] There were two women and two {{children}} with them. [...] A white man came on stage and introduced Sitting Bull as the man who had killed General Custer (which, of course, was absolutely false). [...] Sitting Bull arose and addressed the audience in the Sioux tongue, as he did not speak nor understand English. [...] He said, ‘My friends, white people, we Indians are <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Washington to see the Grandfather, or President of the United States. [...] I see so many white people and what they are doing, that it makes me glad to know that some day my children will be educated also. [...] There is no use fighting any longer. [...] The buffalo are all gone, as well {{as the rest of the}} game. [...] Now I am going to shake the hand of the Great Father at Washington, and I am going to tell him all these things.’ Then Sitting Bull sat down. He never even mentioned General Custer’s name.|$|E
2500|$|Lowell's {{letter to}} the {{president}} was his first major political act of protest, {{but it would not}} be his last. During the mid to late 1960s, Lowell actively opposed the Vietnam War. In response to American air raids in Vietnam in 1965, Lowell rejected an invitation to the White House Festival of the Arts from President Lyndon Johnson in a letter that he subsequently published in The New York Times, stating, [...] "We are in danger of imperceptibly becoming an explosive and suddenly chauvinistic nation, and may even be drifting <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the last nuclear ruin." [...] Ian Hamilton notes that [...] "throughout , [...] was in demand as a speaker and petition signer [...] He was vehemently opposed to the war, but equivocal about being identified too closely with the 'peace movement': there were many views he did not share with the more fiery of the 'peaceniks' and it was not in his nature to join movements that he had no wish to lead." [...] However, Lowell did participate in the October 1967 March on the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. against the war {{and was one of the}} featured speakers at the event. Norman Mailer, who was also a featured speaker at the rally, introduced Lowell to the crowd of protesters.|$|E

2500|$|Blake {{was given}} {{command of the}} gunboat [...] {{stationed}} in the James River, engaged in transporting troops and in occasional engagements with the enemy. The {{most important of these}} was on 24 January 1865, when a powerful Confederate squadron launched an attack on the Union blockade of the river at Trent's Reach. Sailing downriver the Confederate force drove away the Union pickets, and commenced removing the boom and obstructions. William A. Parker, the Union naval commander, instead protecting the defences, retired and allowed them to be removed, leaving a clear passage for the enemy. However, two rams went aground, and the Confederates had to wait until high water the following night before proceeding. On the morning of the 25th, Parker was relieved of his command and Blake was made temporary commander of the naval division. Blake ordered the monitor [...] to put herself into a position within the range of enemy batteries, such that, if sunk, she would take the place of the removed obstructions. Subsequent attacks by Union ships and shore batteries sank two and badly damaged six of the Confederate ships, who eventually withdrew. After dark a party from Eutaw, commanded by Acting-Ensign Thomas Morgan boarded the abandoned [...] and re-floated her, finding her not as damaged as believed. In a letter Admiral David Dixon Porter wrote to Blake, [...] "Had your predecessor done as well, we should now be in possession of the entire rebel navy, and <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Richmond." [...] Blake continued to command the ironclads and naval picket line until the fall of Richmond and end of the war in April 1865. He was then {{was in charge of the}} removal of the torpedoes and obstructions from the James River.|$|E
