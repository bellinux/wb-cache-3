5|$|Adders execute integer {{addition}} {{in electronic}} digital computers, usually using binary arithmetic. The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight improvement is the carry skip design, again following human intuition; <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not perform all the carries in computing , but one bypasses {{the group of}} 9s and skips to the answer.|$|E
5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not make an observation passively, but rather is {{actively engaged in}} distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E

5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or jug), oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (incense burner), {{and in the case}} of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E

5|$|In {{the modern}} world, dance {{has come to}} be {{regarded}} as something <b>one</b> <b>does</b> for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history—that is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity—combat—has obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>does</b> {{not only}} feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while {{the probability of a}} planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E

5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that <b>one</b> <b>does</b> not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
