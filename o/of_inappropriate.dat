5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List <b>of</b> <b>inappropriate</b> medications for older adults.|$|E

Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} control which genes are being transcribed, the cell {{separates}} some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical {{access to the}} DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels <b>of</b> <b>inappropriate</b> gene expression. For example, {{in the case of}} NF-κB-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-κB. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{assess the}} use <b>of</b> {{potentially}} <b>inappropriate</b> medications among older adults. METHODS This is a population-based cross-sectional study with 1, 451 older individuals aged 60 {{years or more}} {{in the city of}} Pelotas, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in 2014. We have investigated the use of medications in the last 15 days. Using the Beers criteria (2012), we have verified the use <b>of</b> potentially <b>inappropriate</b> medications and their relationship with socioeconomic and demographic variables, polypharmacy, self-medication, and burden of disease. RESULTS Among the 5, 700 medications used, 5, 651 could be assessed as to being <b>inappropriate.</b> <b>Of</b> these, 937 were potentially inappropriate for the older adults according to the 2012 Beers criteria (16. 6 %). Approximately 42. 4 % of the older adults studied used at least one medication considered as potentially <b>inappropriate.</b> The group <b>of</b> medications for the nervous system accounted for 48. 9 % of the total <b>of</b> the potentially <b>inappropriate</b> medications. In the adjusted analysis, the variables female, advanced age, white race, low educational level, polypharmacy, self-medication, and burden of disease were associated with the use <b>of</b> potentially <b>inappropriate</b> medications. CONCLUSIONS It is important to known the possible consequences of the use of medication among older adults. Special attention should be given to the older adults who use polypharmacy. Specific lists should be created with more appropriate medications for the older population in the National Essential Medicine List...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that a high {{proportion}} of patients attending accident and emergency (A&E) departments have only trivial or non-urgent complaints. A&E staff treat these inappropriate attenders while recognizing that this detracts from the care given to more serious cases.

In this study, the authors examined the feasibility of methods <b>of</b> reducing <b>inappropriate</b> attendance. The authors investigated patients' ability to accurately assess the urgency of their condition and, hence, their need for A&E services. The authors concluded that there is probably no practical way <b>of</b> reducing <b>inappropriate</b> attendance that does not involve risk to a proportion of patients. The possibility of extending the role of the A&E department to provide more general primary care is discussed...|$|R

5|$|After Birmingham were relegated {{at the end}} of the season, {{the club}} took up their option of an extra year on Doyle's contract, despite accusations <b>of</b> <b>inappropriate</b> late-night {{drinking}} after the club's end-of-season dinner. He made 16 appearances in the 2011–12 season, including three matches in Birmingham's UEFA Europa League campaign, and both legs of the Championship play-off semi-final. He made an error in a 2–1 win over Maribor, where he misjudged a pass from Jonathan Spector to allow Dalibor Volaš to score the match's opening goal. In the FA Cup, Doyle saved two penalties from Juan Mata in the FA Cup; one in the initial fifth-round match, which finished 1–1, and one in the replay, which ended in a 2–0 defeat. His performance in the initial match against Chelsea resulted in him being named as the man of the match. At the end of the season, he received a special award for completing ten senior seasons with the club, extended to an eleventh when he signed a one-year contract, despite expectations that youngster Jack Butland might be first choice goalkeeper.|$|E

5|$|By October 1943, the fractious {{relationship}} came to {{the surface}} again. Galland met with Göring at Göring's estate, Schloss Veldenstein. During the conversation {{the need for new}} and improved interceptor aircraft arose. The demands made by Göring, that heavily cannon-armed fighters be used in mass numbers to defeat bomber formations, were unreasonable to Galland. Göring, prompted by the desires of Hitler, wanted cannons of some 2,000 lb in weight which fired at a rate of one shell per second. Galland explained that such a weapon could not be used effectively in an aircraft; the cannon would be prone to jamming and the aircraft would be too difficult to manoeuvre. Galland also asserted the use <b>of</b> <b>inappropriate</b> weaponry such as the Messerschmitt Me 410, a favourite of Hitler's, had caused heavy losses. Galland argued such measures were deplorable and irresponsible. Göring ignored Galland's arguments and continued his frequent attacks on the fighter force, accusing them of cowardice. Galland, as he always did, defended them, risking his career and, {{near the end of the}} war, his life in doing so. Galland stated that he could not agree to follow Göring's plans and requested to be dismissed from his post and sent back to his unit. Göring accepted, but two weeks later he apologised to Galland and attributed his behaviour to stress. Galland continued in his post.|$|E
5|$|In April 1995, the State Duma {{considered}} {{the first draft}} of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions. In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised about the use of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country. Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections? In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek, author of the book Punitive Medicine, a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event <b>of</b> <b>inappropriate</b> behavior. Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity. A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.|$|E

All individuals aged 65 [*]years and older were included (n[*]=[*] 1, 346, 709; both community-dwelling and institutionalized persons). We applied all drug-specific criteria included in the 2012 Beers Criteria, the Laroche's list, the PRISCUS list, the NORGEP criteria and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare criteria. Main outcome was the potentially inappropriate drug use according to each set of criteria, separately and combined.

The prevalence <b>of</b> potentially <b>inappropriate</b> medication use varied between the explicit criteria from 16 % (NORGEP criteria) to 24 % (2012 Beers criteria). Overall, 38 % of the older people were exposed to potentially inappropriate drug use by {{at least one of the}} five sets of criteria. While controlling for other possible covariates, female gender, institutionalisation and polypharmacy were systematically associated with inappropriate drug use, regardless of the set of explicit criteria we considered.
