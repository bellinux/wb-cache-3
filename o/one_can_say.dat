He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E

25|$|To {{explain the}} {{categories}} in more detail, {{they are the}} preconditions {{of the construction of}} objects in the mind. Indeed, to even think of the sun and stone presupposes the category of subsistence, that is, substance. For the categories synthesize the random data of the sensory manifold into intelligible objects. This means that the categories are also the most abstract things <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> of any object whatsoever, and hence one can have an a priori cognition of the totality of all objects of experience if one can list all of them. To do so, Kant formulates another transcendental deduction.|$|E

25|$|The {{fear of the}} end of {{life and}} its {{existence}} is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the lives of our ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. <b>One</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear.

25|$|Subramanian {{also points}} out the {{limitation}} of book to explain the recent economic development in China and India. Under an authoritarian regime (theoretically extractive political institutions), China has achieved rapid economic development while democratic India (theoretically inclusive political institutions) has lagged much behind. According to Surbramanian, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that China and India are outliers or {{that it is still}} too early to decide (that is, China might collapse and India might catch up according to the book's prediction). However, it is still unsatisfying that the theory is unable to explain the situation of 1/3 of the world's population, and it is unlikely that China or India will change drastically in the near future, according to the prediction.|$|E

25|$|The riders {{of early}} domesticated horses {{probably}} used {{some type of}} bitless headgear made of sinew, leather, or rope. Components of the earliest headgear {{may be difficult to}} determine, as the materials would not have held up over time. For this reason, no <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> with certainty which came first, the bitted or the bitless bridle. There is evidence of the use of bits, located in two sites of the Botai in ancient Kazakhstan, dated about 3500-3000 BC. Nose rings appear on the equids portrayed on the Standard of Ur, circa 2600 BC - 2400 BC. To date, the earliest known artistic evidence of use of some form of bitless bridle comes in illustrations of Synian horseman, dated approximately 1400 BC.|$|E
25|$|This {{notation}} {{means that}} the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the configuration interaction expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given transition. For example, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has {{to keep in mind}} that electrons are fermions ruled by the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when electron correlation is large.|$|E
25|$|Another {{representation}} is obtained {{by noting that}} the image of any closure operator on a complete lattice is again a complete lattice (called its closure system). Since the identity function is a closure operator too, this shows that the complete lattices are exactly the images of closure operators on complete lattices. Now the Dedekind-MacNeille completion can also be cast into a closure operator: every set of elements is mapped to the least lower (or upper) Dedekind cut that contains this set. Such a least cut does indeed exist and one has a closure operator on the powerset lattice of all elements. In summary, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that every complete lattice is isomorphic to the image of a closure operator on a powerset lattice.|$|E
