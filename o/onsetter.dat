5000|$|Brown, William Michael, 21 Feb 1902, aged 57, Master Shifter, {{deceased}} signalled to {{the winding}} engineman {{to take the}} cage from the 5/4 to main coal seam and then attempted {{to get into the}} cage, but the engineman, not knowing there was no <b>onsetter</b> there, dropped the cage at once, and Brown was caught and killed ...|$|E
50|$|Wilkinson, John, 13 Oct 1846, aged 12, while {{standing}} {{waiting to be}} drawn up from the High Main Coal seam at Ludworth Pit on 13 October, John Wilkinson, aged 12, was accidentally knocked {{through a hole in}} the brattice by the <b>onsetter,</b> who was taking a tub out of the cage. The boy fell down the opposite section of the shaft, a distance of about 10 fathoms, and was killed.|$|E
50|$|There was {{no damage}} to the Tilley seam and the men working there had been saved, {{so it was not}} {{considered}} further. The only seam left was the Busty coal. The <b>onsetter,</b> Matthew Elliott, was the only man to have survived from the Busty seam and his evidence is quoted at length. Critically the electric lights went out at the time the explosion was heard ("Yes, it was instantaneous"), some time before the cloud was observed by a safety lamp. Two mining engineers who had arrived at 8p.m. following the explosion were cross examined and agreed that the explosion occurred in the Busty seam and was due to a coal dust. Neither could say how the dust was ignited.|$|E
40|$|In {{criminal}} career research, {{the existence}} of an adult onset trajectory has been identified more or less regularly over recent decades, providing indications of {{the existence of}} a group of serious offenders that resembles the early onset chronic offenders. The aim {{of this study is to}} further explore the origins and development of the adult onset females with regard to familial and social predictors and life events. Results are based on the Project Metropolitan data for 7, 398 girls up to age 30 using logistic regression. The adult onset group showed a markedly higher prevalence of all covariates when compared with non-offenders and they are largely similar to the high level chronics. A logistic regression model including 11 covariates identified only two predictors on which the adult <b>onsetters</b> could be separated from the high level chronics. The authors conclude that there is support for the actual existence of the adult onset group, and that the group is difficult to separate from the high level chronics on the basis of structural factors. Using additional variables, including individual factors, further research should focus on answering the question of how the delayed onset of this group might be explained...|$|R
50|$|Some {{or other}} {{commission}} had criticized mine managements for employing {{large numbers of}} unskilled whites 'often entirely ignorant of mining, and whose principal and often only recommendation is their physical fitness and their suitability for rough work'. Yet when the commission reported in 1910, it submitted draft regulations that were heavy with colour bars. Some appeared {{in the interpretation of}} terms, as when the words 'white person' were inserted in the definition of banksman, <b>onsetter,</b> ganger and mine manager. Some took the form of an injunction to employ only whites in specified occupations, such as blasting, running elevators, driving engines, supervising boilers and other machinery; or as shift boss and mine overseer. Furthermore, only whites would be allowed to obtain the certificates of competence required, for instance, by engine drivers and boiler attendants. With some modifications, these draft regulations served as model for the MINES & WORKS REGULATIONS ACT of 1912.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} act {{was passed}} in 1908 (Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908) limiting the hours of work for workmen below ground. It enacted that, subject to various provisions, a workman {{was not to be}} below ground in a mine for the purpose of his work, and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours in any consecutive twenty-four hours. Exception was made in the case of those below ground for the purpose of rendering assistance {{in the event of an}} accident, or for meeting any danger, or for dealing with any emergency or work incompleted, through unforeseen circumstances, which requires to be dealt with to avoid serious interference in the work of the mine. The authorities of every mine must fix the times for the lowering and raising of the men to begin and be completed, and such times must be conspicuously posted at the pit head. These times must be approved by an inspector. The term [...] " [...] workman [...] " [...] in the act means any person employed in a mine below ground who is not an official of the mine (other than a fireman, examiner or deputy), or a mechanic or a horse keeper or a person engaged solely in surveying or measuring. In the case of a fireman, examiner, deputy, <b>onsetter,</b> pump minder, fanman or furnace man, the maximum period for which he may be below ground is nine hours and a half. A [...] must be kept by the authorities of the mine of the times of descent and ascent, while the workmen may, at their own cost, station persons (whether holding the office of checkweigher or not) at the pit head to observe the times. The authorities of the mine may extend the hours of working by one hour a day on not more than sixty days in one calendar year (s. 3). The act may be suspended by order in council in the event of war or of imminent national danger or great emergency, or in the event of any grave economic disturbance due to the demand for coal exceeding the supply available at any time. The act came into force on 1 July 1909 except for the counties of Northumberland and Durham where its operation was postponed until 1 January 1910.|$|E
