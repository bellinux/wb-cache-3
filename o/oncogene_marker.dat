40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{refinement}} of prognostic variables using traditional pathologic markers integrated with oncogene proteins, enzymes, and hormonal factors may enhance {{the ability to}} predict for recurrence or survival in patients with mammary carcinoma. Although various oncogenes and oncogene products {{have been identified in}} human breast carcinoma, their relationship to disease outcome remains controversial. METHODS: Using the monoclonal antibodies cS 93. 1, 9 E 1. 0, F 235 - 1. 7. 1, and PAb 1801 against each oncogene protein studied, the avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method provided immunohistochemical staining of bound oncogene protein for c-fos, c-myc, Ha-ras, and p 53, respectively. Analyses were made on archival pathology tissues of 85 breast cancer patients (stages I, IIA, and IIB). Forty patients (47 %) had recurrence of disease; 45 remained free of local-regional or distant disease at mean follow-up of 48 months (range 6 - 180 months). Molecular biological data were merged with clinicopathologic demographics 1) to determine the frequency of single or co-expression of oncogenes in this patient population; 2) to evaluate the value of these molecular protein markers to predict probability of recurrence; and 3) to determine worth of the studied oncogenes to correlate with traditional clinical pathologic parameters and overall survival. RESULTS: In this study, oncogene expression had statistical correlation for recurrence with increasing co-expression: one oncogene 17. 2 %, two oncogenes 56. 3 %, three or four oncogenes, 100 % (p = 0. 001). Increasing oncogene or co-oncogene expression correlated with statistically significant reduction in disease-free and overall survival; with no expression of oncogenes, disease-free survival was 30 (SE +/- 5. 7) months and overall survival was 56. 4 (SE +/- 4. 57) months. With expression of three oncogenes, disease-free survival was 12 (SE +/- 1. 23) months (p = 0. 0018) and overall survival was 23. 4 (SE +/- 3. 38) months (p = 0. 0025). In univariate Wilcoxon analysis, oncogene expression was the most significant variable to determine survival (p = 0. 035); in multivariate analysis, age and oncogene co-expression each emerged as the most significant variables for overall survival. For the proportional hazards regression model, oncogene co-expression was significant (p = 0. 0104, risk-ratio 1. 914) and correlated with age and tumor size as significant variables. Ha-ras and c-fos both emerged as important individual oncogene proteins to affect survival (p = 0. 0925, risk-ratio 3. 517 and p = 0. 025, risk-ratio 4. 214, respectively). The proto-oncogene c-myc and the antitumor suppressor gene p 53 did not have significant effects as individual oncogenes to influence survival. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one fifth of the breast cancer patients in this analysis (disease-free and recurrent) expressed only a single <b>oncogene</b> <b>marker</b> (c-fos, c-myc, Ha-ras, or p 53); one quarter of patients with recurrent disease expressed only one oncogene protein. Single oncogene expression did not possess independent prognostic significance for prediction of recurrence. Further, p 53 mutations did not function as independent correlates for prognosis. The co-expression of the studied proto-oncogenes (c-myc, Ha-ras) and the nuclear transcriptional protein (c-fos) functioned as a strong prognostic correlate for recurrence and survival; the effect of individual oncogenes to predict survival was greatest for Ha-ras and c-fos. Immediate or early co-expression of three oncogene proteins in neoplastic transformation endowed cells of invasive carcinoma with an aggressive phenotype. This aggressive phenotype was evident in {{a small percentage of the}} studied population (11 %) and predicted adverse disease-free and overall survival. These findings suggest that oncogene co-expression possesses significant prognostic and potential therapeutic value; incorporation of this molecular technology into future prospective randomized trials is advisable...|$|E
40|$|PLK (polo-like kinase) {{belongs to}} a family of serine/threonine kinases and {{represents}} the human counterpart of polo in Drosophila melanogaster and of CDC 5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is strongly involved in spindle formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis. We have shown previously that PLK mRNA expression correlates with the mitotic activity of cells and the prognosis of lung cancer patients. In this report, the level of PLK protein was analyzed using immunohistochemical techniques. PLK protein was found expressed in the nuclei of tumor cells from lung and breast cancer {{as well as in}} several tumor cell lines. Furthermore, in peripheral lymphocytes treated with phytohemagglutinin, elevated proliferative activity of the cells correlated with the up-regulation of PLK protein expression. In contrast, in U 937 and HL- 60 cells after induction of differentiation with phorbol ester, PLK immunostaining disappeared under conditions of terminal differentiation. Most of the PLK protein was found in the nucleus of proliferating cells with diffuse but distinct staining also in the cytoplasm. Taken together, high levels of PLK protein are associated with cellular proliferation. Combined with other proliferative and <b>oncogene</b> <b>markers,</b> PLK may be useful for improved prediction of the clinical prognosis of cancer patients and for early cancer diagnosis. Due to its activity late in the cell cycle, it may be a target for cancer chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of chemotherapy {{for the treatment of}} childhood leukemia more than 50 years ago, the results of childhood cancer have improved dramatically. The 5 -year survival rate of disease, many of which were uniformly fatal in the prechemotherapy era, reached to more than 75 %. This remarkable improvement in survival {{is a direct result of}} the incorporation of chemotherapeutics into treatment regimens that previously relied only on surgery or radiotherapy for the primary tumor. The multimodality approach, which integrates surgery and radiotherapy to control local disease with chemotherapy to eradicate systemic or metastatic disease, has become the standard approach to treating most childhood cancers. The overall improvement in outcomes in childhood solid tumors has been related to the development of multidisplinary cooperative studies that has permitted the development of well-designed tumor treatment protocols characterized by uniform staging criteria, sharing informations in pathologic classification, uniform methods for tumor <b>markers,</b> <b>oncogenes,</b> and other biologic and genetic factors. Important advances in the biologic study of cancer and its genetic basis led to a number of observations that impact directly on the management of childhood solid tumors.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a mouse model for ovarian carcinoma by using an avian retroviral gene delivery technique for the introduction of multiple genes into somatic ovarian cells of adult mice. Ovarian cells from transgenic mice engineered to express the gene encoding the avian receptor TVA were efficiently infected in vitro with multiple vectors carrying coding sequences for <b>oncogenes</b> and <b>marker</b> genes. When target cells were derived from TVA transgenic mice deficient for p 53, the addition of any two of the oncogenes c-myc, K-ras, and Akt were sufficient to induce ovarian tumor formation when infected cells were injected at subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or ovarian sites. We demonstrated that the ovarian surface epithelium is the precursor tissue for these ovarian carcinomas, and that introduction of oncogenes causes phenotypic changes in the ovarian surface epithelial cells. The induced ovarian tumors in mice resembled human ovarian carcinomas in their rapid progression and intraperitoneal metastatic spread...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days, {{chromosome}} walking from genetically linked DNA markers {{was used to}} identify and clone disease genes. However, the large molecular distance between known markers and the gene of interest was complicating the cloning process. In 1987, a human chromosome jumping library was constructed to clone the cystic fibrosis gene. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease affecting 1 in 2000 Caucasians. This was the first disease in which {{the usefulness of the}} jumping libraries was demonstrated. Met <b>oncogene</b> was a <b>marker</b> tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene on human chromosome 7, and the library was screened for a jumping clone starting at this marker. The cystic fibrosis gene was determined to localize 240kb downstream of the met gene. Chromosome jumping helped reduce the mapping “steps” and bypass the highly repetitive regions in the mammalian genome. Chromosome jumping also allowed the production of probes required for faster diagnosis of this and other diseases.|$|R
40|$|Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are {{multipotent}} {{adult stem}} cells which are recruited to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and influence tumor progression through multiple mechanisms. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} MSCs on the tunmorigenic capacity of 4 T 1 murine mammary cancer cells. It was found that MSC-conditioned medium increased the proliferation, migration, and efficiency of mammosphere formation of 4 T 1 cells in vitro. When co-injected with MSCs into the mouse mammary fat pad, 4 T 1 cells showed enhanced tumor growth and generated increased spontaneous lung metastasis. Using in vivo fluorescence color-coded imaging, the interaction between GFP-expressing MSCs and RFP-expressing 4 T 1 cells was monitored. As few as five 4 T 1 cells could give rise to tumor formation when co-injected with MSCs into the mouse mammary fat pad, but no tumor was formed when five or ten 4 T 1 cells were implanted alone. The elevation of tumorigenic potential was further supported by gene expression analysis, which showed that when 4 T 1 cells were in contact with MSCs, several <b>oncogenes,</b> cancer <b>markers,</b> and tumor promoters were upregulated. Moreover, in vivo longitudinal fluorescence imaging of tumorigenesis revealed that MSCs created a vascularized environment which enhances the ability of 4 T 1 cells to colonize and proliferate. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the promotion of mammary cancer progression by MSCs was achieved through the generation of a cancer-enhancing microenvironment to increase tumorigenic potential. These findings also suggest the potential risk of enhancing tumor progression in clinical cell therapy using MSCs. Attention has to be paid to patients with high risk of breast cancer when considering cell therapy with MSCs...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acid synthase (FAS) {{activity}} {{is a potential}} therapeutic target to treat cancer and obesity. Here, we have identified a molecular link between FAS and HER 2 (erbB- 2) <b>oncogene,</b> a <b>marker</b> for poor prognosis that is overexpressed in 30 % of breast and ovarian cancers. Pharmacological FAS inhibitors cerulenin and C 75 were found to suppress p 185 HER 2 oncoprotein expression and tyrosine-kinase activity in breast and ovarian HER 2 overexpressors. Similarly, p 185 HER 2 expression was dramatically down-regulated when FAS gene expression was silenced by using the highly sequence-specific mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi). Pharmacological and RNAi-mediated silencing of FAS specifically down-regulated HER 2 mRNA and, concomitantly, caused a prominent up-regulation of PEA 3, a transcriptional repressor of HER 2. A cytoplasmic redistribution of p 185 HER 2 was associated with marked morphological changes of FAS RNAi-transfected cells, whereas chemical inhibitors of FAS promoted a striking nuclear accumulation of p 185 HER 2. The simultaneous targeting of FAS and HER 2 by chemical FAS inhibitors and the humanized antibody directed against p 185 HER 2 trastuzumab, respectively, was synergistically cytotoxic toward HER 2 overexpressors. Similarly, concurrent RNAi-mediated silencing of FAS and HER 2 genes synergistically stimulated apoptotic cell death in HER 2 overexpressors. p 185 HER 2 was synergistically down-regulated after simultaneous inhibition of FAS and HER 2 by either pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA. These findings provide evidence of an active role of FAS in cancer evolution by specifically regulating oncogenic proteins closely related to malignant transformation, strongly suggesting that HER 2 oncogene may act as the key molecular sensor of energy imbalance after the perturbation of tumor-associated FAS hyperactivity in cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|FOXP 2 shares {{partially}} overlapping {{normal tissue}} expression and functionality with FOXP 1; an established diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) <b>oncogene</b> and <b>marker</b> of poor prognosis. FOXP 2 {{is expressed in}} the plasma cell malignancy multiple myeloma but has not been studied in DLBCL, where a poor prognosis activated B-cell (ABC) -like subtype display partially blocked plasma cell differentiation. FOXP 2 protein expression was detected in ABC-DLBCL cell lines, and in primary DLBCL samples tumoral FOXP 2 protein expression was detected in both germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL. In biopsies from DLBCL patients treated with immunochemotherapy (R-CHOP), ≥ 20 % nuclear tumoral FOXP 2 -positivity (n= 24 / 158) correlated with significantly inferior overall survival (OS: P= 0. 0017) and progression-free survival (PFS: P= 0. 0096). This remained significant in multivariate analysis against either the international prognostic index score or the non-GCB DLBCL phenotype (P<	 0. 05 for both OS andPFS). Expression of BLIMP 1, a marker of plasmacytic differentiation that is commonly inactivated in ABC-DLBCL, did not correlate with patient outcome or FOXP 2 expression in this series. Increased frequency of FOXP 2 expression significantly correlated with FOXP 1 -positivity (P= 0. 0187), and FOXP 1 co-immunoprecipitated FOXP 2 from ABC-DLBCL cells indicating that these proteins can co-localize in a multi-protein complex. FOXP 2 -positive DLBCL had reduced expression of HIP 1 R (P= 0. 0348), which is directly repressed by FOXP 1, and exhibited distinct patterns of gene expression. Specifically in ABC-DLBCL these were associated with lower expression of immune response and T-cell receptor signaling pathways. Further studies are warranted to investigate the potential functional cooperativity between FOXP 1 and FOXP 2 in repressing immune responses during the pathogenesis of high-risk DLBCL...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective. It is {{important}} to guarantee the quality of stem cells. Serial passage is the main approach to expand stem cells. This study evaluated effects of serial passage on the biological characteristics of human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs (WJ MSCs). Methods. Biological properties of WJ MSCs in the early (less than 10 passages, P 10), middle (P 11 – 20), and late (more than P 20) phases including cell proliferation, cell cycle, phenotype, senescence, <b>oncogene</b> expression, stemness <b>marker</b> expression, and differentiation capacity were evaluated using flow cytometry, real-time PCR, immunocytofluorescence, and western blot. Results. It was {{found that there were}} no significant differences in cell proliferation, cell cycle, phenotype, and stemness marker expression in different phases. However, the expression of senescence-related gene, p 21, and oncogene, c-Myc, was significantly upregulated in the late phase, which had close relations with the obviously increased cell senescence. Moreover, cardiac differentiation capability of WJ MSCs decreased whereas the propensity for neural differentiation increased significantly in the middle phase. Conclusions. This study reveals that WJ MSCs in the early and middle phases are relatively stable, and effect of serial passage on the lineage-specific differentiation should be considered carefully...|$|R
40|$|Glioblastoma (GBM) is {{the most}} {{malignant}} brain tumor and is highly resistant to intensive combination therapies and anti-VEGF therapies. To assess the resistance mechanism to anti-VEGF therapy, we examined the vessels of GBMs in tumors that were induced by the transduction of p 53 +/− heterozygous mice with lentiviral vectors containing <b>oncogenes</b> and the <b>marker</b> GFP in the hippocampus of GFAP-Cre recombinase (Cre) mice. We were surprised to observe GFP+ vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Transplantation of mouse GBM cells revealed that the tumor-derived endothelial cells (TDECs) originated from tumor-initiating cells and did not result from cell fusion of ECs and tumor cells. An in vitro differentiation assay suggested that hypoxia {{is an important factor}} in the differentiation of tumor cells to ECs and is independent of VEGF. TDEC formation was not only resistant to an anti-VEGF receptor inhibitor in mouse GBMs but it led to an increase in their frequency. A xenograft model of human GBM spheres from clinical specimens and direct clinical samples from patients with GBM also showed the presence of TDECs. We suggest that the TDEC is an important player in the resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, and hence a potential target for GBM therapy...|$|R

Replication-defective retrovirus encoding a human <b>oncogene</b> and a <b>marker</b> (GFP, RFP, antibiotic resistance gene, etc.) is produced by a transient transfection protocol using 293 T cells, a human renal epithelial cell line transformed by the adenovirus E 1 A gene product. 293 cells have the unusual property of being highly transfectable by calcium phosphate (CaPO 4), with up to 50 - 80 % transfection efficiency readily attainable.

The initial transfection is further improved by use of chloroquine. Stocks of ecotropic virus, collected as culture supernatant 48 hrs. post-transfection, can be stored at - 80 °C and used for infection of cell-lines in view of transformation and in vitro studies, or primary cells such as mouse bone marrow cells, that can then be used for transplant in our mouse model...|$|R
40|$|Background: Thyroid {{cancer is}} a rare disease {{characterized}} by the subtle appearance of a nodule. Fine-needle cytology (FNC) is the first diagnostic procedure used to distinguish a benign from a malignant nodule. However, FNC yields inconclusive results in about 20 % of cases. BRAFV 600 E mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC); its high prevalence makes this <b>oncogene</b> a useful <b>marker</b> to refine inconclusive FNC results. However, the prevalence of the BRAFV 600 E mutation depends on detection methods, geographical factors, and age. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the prevalence of BRAFV 600 E mutation and its utility as a diagnostic tool in elderly subjects. Methods: FNC from 92 PTC patients were subjected to the analysis of BRAF mutation by pyrosequencing and direct sequencing; age-dependent prevalence was also determined. Results: BRAF mutation analysis was successful in all FNC specimens. BRAFV 600 E was documented in 62 (67. 4 %) and in 58 (63. 0 %) PTCs by pyrosequencing and direct sequencing, respectively. BRAFV 600 E prevalence did not correlate with patient’s age at diagnosis. Twenty out of 32 PTCs (62. 5 %) were correctly diagnosed by BRAF mutation analysis in inconclusive FNC results. Conclusions: Detection of BRAFV 600 E in cytology specimens by pyrosequencing is a useful diagnostic adjunctive tool in the evaluation of thyroid nodules also in elderly subjects...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of cancer deaths worldwide. New diagnostic and therapeutic options are needed for more effective and early detection and treatment of this malignancy. We identified 703 genes that are highly expressed in HCC using DNA microarrays, and further characterized them in order to uncover novel tumor <b>markers,</b> <b>oncogenes,</b> and therapeutic targets for HCC. Using Gene Ontology annotations, genes with functions related to cell proliferation and cell cycle, chromatin, repair, and transcription were found to be significantly enriched in this list of highly expressed genes. We also identified a set of genes that encode secreted (e. g. GPC 3, LCN 2, and DKK 1) or membrane-bound proteins (e. g. GPC 3, IGSF 1, and PSK- 1), which may be attractive candidates for the diagnosis of HCC. A significant enrichment of genes highly expressed in HCC was found on chromosomes 1 q, 6 p, 8 q, and 20 q, and we also identified chromosomal clusters of genes highly expressed in HCC. The microarray analyses were validated by RT-PCR and PCR. This approach of integrating other biological information with gene expression in the analysis helps select aberrantly expressed genes in HCC that may be further studied for their diagnostic or therapeutic utility. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Melanocytes within benign human nevi are the {{paradigm}} for tumor suppressive senescent cells in a pre-malignant neoplasm. These cells typically contain mutations {{in either the}} BRAF or NRAS <b>oncogene</b> and express <b>markers</b> of senescence, including p 16 INK 4 A 1 - 4. However, a nevus can contain 10 s to 100 s of thousands of clonal melanocytes and approximately 25 % of melanomas are thought to arise in association with a pre-existing nevus 5 - 9. Neither observation is indicative of fail-safe senescence-associated proliferation arrest and tumor suppression. I set out {{to better understand the}} status of nevus melanocytes. Proliferation-promoting Wnt target genes, such as Cyclin D 1 and c-Myc, were repressed in oncogene-induced senescent melanocytes in vitro, and repression of Wnt signaling in these cells induced a senescent-like state. In contrast, Cyclin D 1 and c-Myc were expressed in many melanocytes of human benign nevi. Specifically, activated Wnt signaling in nevi correlated inversely with nevus maturation, an established dermatopathological parameter linked to clinical benignancy 10, 11. Single cell analyses of lone interfollicular epidermal melanocytes and nevus melanocytes in tissue showed that expression of proliferation-promoting Wnt targets correlates with prior proliferative expansion of p 16 INK 4 A-expressing nevus melanocytes. In a mouse model, activation of Wnt signaling delayed, but did not bypass, senescence of oncogene-expressing melanocytes, leading to massive accumulation of proliferation-arrested, p 16 INK 4 A-positive, non-malignant melanocytes. I conclude that clonal hyperproliferation of oncogene-expressing melanocytes to form a nevus is facilitated by transient delay of senescence due to activated Wnt signaling. The observation that activation of Wnt signaling correlates inversely with nevus maturation, an indicator of lower malignant potential, supports the notion that persistent destabilization of senescence by Wnt signaling contributes to the malignant potential of nevi...|$|R

40|$|The {{founding}} {{hypothesis of}} the anti-tumor vaccine is the following: anti-tumor immunity {{results from the}} expression of specific antigens by cancer cells which differentiate them from normal cells. These antigens {{would be able to}} stimulate the immune system and become targets for mediated rejection. Several observations can be pur forward in support of this hypothesis: 1) patients with early stage lung cancer have an activated immune system as is evidenced by the activation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or the increased serum level of soluble IL- 2 receptor. This immune system activation contrasts with the generally observed immune deficiency in advanced stages; 2) antibodies directed against cancer cell antigens (for example, anti-mutant-p 53 antigens) are detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer. In this setting, several monoclonal antibodies have been generated against lung cancer tumor cell lines. Some recognize tumor-associated antigens while others are directed against tumor <b>marker</b> <b>oncogene</b> products, or growth factors. Monoclonal antibodies can be used coupled with radioisotopes, antimitotic agents or toxins, mainly ricin. The goal is to use the monoclonal antibody selectivity to vehicle the active anticancer substance {{to the site of the}} tumor. For small-cell cancer, studies are now being conducted to assess the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies directed against NCAM glycoproteins or GRP. Among the different cell effectors of anti-cancer immunity, NK cells have a spontaneous cytotoxic effect against several histologically distinct tumor cell lines. This activity is independent of previous antigenic sensitization. However, administration of interleukin- 2 or intratumoral injection of BCG can stimulate NK activity. In addition, NK cells express a receptor for the Fc portion of IgG immunoglobulins recognized by CD 16 antibodies. Via the Fc receptor NK cells can induce antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity. Other major effectors, LAK cells, result mainly from interleukin- 2 activation of NK cells. Injected at high doses, interleukin- 2, associated or not with in vitro amplified LAK autologs, provokes tumor response in patients with several types of solid tumors. Unfortunately, it is much less active in lung cancer Conversely, combining autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and interleukin- 2 could be an adjuvant treatment for operated lung cancer patient. The greatest hopes for anti-tumor vaccine are placed in one final effector, probably the most important: the cytotoxic T lymphocyte. These lymphocytes can be stimulated in vitro by autologous tumor cells and produce a specific cytotoxic response against the stimulating tumor. They are activated in the presence of interferon-gamma and tumor rejection antigens. These antigens are produced by the tumor and result either from the expression of normally silent genes in the non-cancerous cells, or from the expression of genes carrying point mutations. Among the tumor rejection antigens detected in patients with lung disease, products of IMAGE genes (which are silent in normal cells) and products of the oncogene HER 2 /neu are noteworthy. The main challenge today is to make these antigens sufficiently "immunogenic" so they can stimulate in vivo a specific tumor rejection response. This is the aim of specific immunotherapy using antigenic peptide vaccines...|$|R
