5|$|On 2 July 2008, U.S. District Court judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York {{dismissed}} the families' suits {{against all the}} U.S. based defendants under the premise of forum non-conveniens. Without ruling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the cases, and while allowing discovery to continue, Cogan recommended the Brazilian court system as a more appropriate jurisdiction for the dispute.|$|E
5|$|Scholars today remain divided <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the {{electronic}} barrier {{system and the}} efficacy of the bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

25|$|The Corrie family {{appealed to}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In September 2007 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the {{dismissal}} on the political question grounds and thus did not rule <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the suit. The Court found that as the bulldozers were {{paid for by the}} U.S. Government as part of its aid to Israel, the Judicial Branch could not rule <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> the case without ruling on whether or not the government's financing of such bulldozers was appropriate and that this was a matter not entrusted to the Judicial Branch.|$|E

25|$|These {{transnational}} {{political and}} legal ramifications threw a veil of secrecy around the disaster and obstructed the discovery of vital medical and toxicologic information. The medical community was often frustrated in its attempts to understand the links between gas exposure and health and devise appropriate treatment strategies.

25|$|In {{the final}} points, the Court {{found that a}} {{judicial}} review of the type brought by the Government against the railroads did not require a three-judge panel to make a ruling; rather, a single judge was the most appropriate course.

25|$|On February 19, 2001, the Volusia County Medical Examiner {{performed}} an autopsy for Earnhardt.

Three days later, Teresa Earnhardt filed a legal brief in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Volusia County, Florida (Case No. 2001-30373-CICI Div. 32). Once the complaint was filed, the coroner's office was barred from releasing the public records, including autopsy photographs, pertaining to Earnhardt, until a formal hearing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> Teresa Earnhardt's case could be heard.|$|E
25|$|The {{concluding}} {{paragraph of}} the advisory opinion (paragraph 123), which is the operative part of the ruling (dispositif) contains three vote tallies: it proclaims that the Court unanimously found that it had jurisdiction to reply to the General Assembly's request for an advisory opinion; given that the case law of the Court recognises that it has the discretion to comply with such requests, the Court decided by nine votes to five to comply with this particular advisory opinion request.

Khajavi was subsequently terminated from his anesthesia group. He sued for wrongful termination under California Business & Professions' Code Section 2053, and the suit was allowed by the California Court of Appeals. In 2000, the court held that Khajavi was not protected from termination on the basis of advocating for what he felt was medically appropriate care.
