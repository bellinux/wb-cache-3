The film explores several themes, including the consequence of violence and father-son relationships.|$|E

5|$|He {{delivered}} the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at Monash University and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term {{plans for the}} management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled {{for the past few}} decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to acquire characteristics under the influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E

5|$|Management {{of human}} {{consumption}} of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} typical {{entanglement}} properties {{of a system}} comprising two independent qubit environments interacting via a shuttling ancilla. <b>The</b> initial preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> is modeled using random-matrix techniques. The entanglement measure used in our study is then averaged over many histories of randomly prepared environmental states. Under a Heisenberg interaction model, the average entanglement between the ancilla and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> remains constant, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter and <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction. We also show that, upon suitable kinematic and dynamical changes in the ancilla-environment subsystems, the entanglement-sharing structure undergoes abrupt modifications associated with {{a change in the}} multipartite entanglement class <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall system's state. These results are invariant with respect to the randomized initial state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments.</b> Comment: 10 pages, RevTeX 4 (Minor typo's corrected.

5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E
