5|$|Harold's forces {{deployed}} in a small, dense formation {{at the top}} of steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to provide protection from attack. Sources differ <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.|$|E
5|$|King Stephen II died {{in early}} 1131. A late sourcethe Ottoman Turkish chronicle known as Tarih-i Üngürüs or The History of the Hungariansnarrates that Béla ascended the throne after his predecessor's nephew, Saul whom Stephen II had {{nominated}} as his heir had died. Béla II was crowned in Székesfehérvár on 28 April, substantiating {{the reliability of}} this report. However, no scholarly consensus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> circumstances of Béla's ascension exists. According to Gyula Kristó, Béla was crowned by Archbishop Felician after a civil war between his and Saul's partisans, but Pál Engel does not mention any conflict related to Béla's succession.|$|E

5|$|More of the {{octagonal}} $50 {{pieces were}} sold {{than of the}} round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> numbers distributed.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces.

Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E

5|$|Battle Mountain {{changed hands}} so often during August {{that there is}} no {{agreement}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> number of times. The intelligence sergeant of the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry estimated the peak changed hands 19 times.

The usual pattern was for the North Koreans to take it at night and the US 24th Infantry to recapture it the next day. This type of fluctuating battle resulted in relatively high losses among artillery forward observers and their equipment. During the period of August 15–31, seven forward observers and eight other members of the Observer and Liaison Section of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion were casualties, and they lost eight radios, 11 telephones, and two vehicles in the process.|$|E
