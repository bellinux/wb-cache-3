According to Vicky Miller of PETA, who reported the raid to newswire services, UC-Riverside [...] "has been using animals in experiments on sight deprivation and isolation {{for the last two}} years and has recently received a grant, paid for with <b>our</b> <b>tax</b> <b>dollars,</b> to continue torturing and killing animals." [...] According to UCR officials, the ALF claims of animal mistreatment were [...] "absolutely false," [...] and the raid would [...] result in long-term damage to some of the research projects, including those aimed at developing devices and treatment for blindness. UCR officials also reported [...] the raid also included smashing equipment and resulted in several hundred thousand dollars of damage.|$|E

[...] She declared, [...] "a road downtown will get paved two or three times before one is paved out here." [...] City officials pointed out that this was not true, that road maintenance was based on need not location. In 2005, Scarborough accounted for 24% of the road repair budget which was commensurate with its population. She narrowly lost by 89 votes.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{concern with}} {{this bill is}} that as it moved through the {{legislative}} process in the Senate it kept changing. By the time the bill was heard and voted upon on the Senate floor it had been loaded up with other sports projects {{from the rest of}} the state which also would have been allowed to apply for state funding. Senator Garcia was only one of four senators who voted against the Dolphins bill. He saw it as a personal insult to the people of Florida who entrust the legislature in Tallahassee to use <b>our</b> limited <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> in the most efficient manner.|$|R

In 1980 he called for the United States to cease its aid to El Salvador following the murder of three nuns, declaring, [...] "As Christians and as Americans, we cannot condone our resources and <b>our</b> <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> being used to help any foreign government repress its own people so brutally."

However, stated preferences also imply a non-zero opportunity cost to existing tax dollars; different income groups reveal statistically equivalent marginal utilities both for income and for reallocating <b>tax</b> <b>dollars.</b> Yet individuals with lower income show a relatively larger increase in their willingness to support land conservation, when the choice shifts from new taxes to reallocation of existing <b>tax</b> <b>dollars.</b> The paper encourages consideration of equity implications that may be obscured when analysts focus on willingness to pay. ...|$|R

40|$|Obama, this Issue Brief {{examines}} the administrative and implementation issues {{that arise from}} one of the major reform proposals: Capping the exclusion of employment-based health coverage from workers ’ taxable income. CURRENT TAX TREATMENT—The amount that employers contribute toward workers ’ health coverage is generally excluded, without limit, from workers ’ taxable income. In addition, workers whose employers sponsor flexible spending accounts are able to pay out-of-pocket expenses with pretax dollars. Employers can also make available a premium conversion arrangement, which allows workers to pay their share of the premium for employment-based coverage with pretax dollars. TAX CAP RECOMMENDATIONS—In 2005, a presidential advisory board concluded that limiting the amount of tax-preferred health coverage could lower overall private-sector health spending. The panel recommended a cap on the amount of employment-based health coverage individuals can exclude from their income tax, as a way to reduce health spending. In his 2008 “Call to Action ” for health care reform, Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, states that “Congress should explore ways to restructure the current tax incentives to encourage more efficient spending on health and to target <b>our</b> <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> more effectively and fairly. ” IMPLEMENTING A TAX CAP—While a tax cap on health coverage sounds simple, for many employers, it coul...|$|E
40|$|This study {{makes an}} {{argument}} for a constructionist understanding of crime in Antigua and Barbuda. Specifically, the study argues that {{the way in which}} members of the public and the news media talk about crime is important because understanding how crime is framed in terms of causes and remedies necessarily influences who we criminalise, what legislation we pass and how we allocate <b>our</b> <b>tax</b> <b>dollars.</b> As such, framing crime in ways that are tinged with hyperbole, or that run contrary to evidence is unlikely to result in effective policy responses. The way in which crime is currently framed in Antigua and Barbuda – as a relatively recent phenomenon that is spiralling out of control and is characterised by increasing violence, as a phenomenon that is perpetuated by predatory young people with individual pathologies, as a phenomenon that is increasing largely because police and politicians are corrupt and young people are being inculcated with foreign cultural values – has resulted in punitive policy and ‘tough on crime’ rhetoric that do not appear to have had a substantial effect on the country’s crime rate. However, this study finds that there might be room for more progressive crime policy – policy that is informed by an understanding of crime that does not have at its heart notions of law and order or getting ‘tough on crime’...|$|E
