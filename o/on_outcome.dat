25|$|However, {{in spite}} of the enthusiasm for EBP over the last decade or two, some authors have redefined EBP in ways that contradict, or at least add other factors to, the {{original}} emphasis on empirical research foundations.

25|$|But school {{counseling}} in the 1980s and early 1990s was absent from educational reform efforts. The profession was facing irrelevance as the standards-based educational movement gained strength with {{little evidence of}} systemic effectiveness for school counselors.

25|$|Liver {{transplantation}} or hepatic transplantation is {{the replacement}} of a diseased liver with the healthy liver from another person (allograft). Liver transplantation is a treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, although availability of donor organs is a major limitation. The most common technique is orthotopic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic position as the original liver. The surgical procedure is complex, requiring careful harvest of the donor organ and meticulous implantation into the recipient. Liver transplantation is highly regulated, and only performed at designated transplant medical centers by highly trained transplant physicians and supporting medical team. The duration of the surgery ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending <b>on</b> <b>outcome.</b> Favorable outcomes require careful screening for eligible recipient, {{as well as a}} well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{the total}} pool {{of money on}} the event is $1028.00. Following {{the start of the}} event, no more wagers are accepted. The event is decided and the winning outcome is {{determined}} to be Outcome 4 with $110.00 wagered. The payout is now calculated. First the commission or take for the wagering company is deducted from the pool; for example with a commission rate of 14.25% the calculation is: $1028 × 0.1425 = $146.49. This leaves a remaining amount of $881.51. This remaining amount in the pool is now distributed to those who wagered <b>on</b> <b>Outcome</b> 4: $881.51 / $110.00 = 8.01 ≈ $8 per $1 wagered.
