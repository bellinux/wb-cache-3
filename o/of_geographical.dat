5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> proximity, minor rivalries exist with Trelleborgs FF and Landskrona BoIS, {{which are}} both also located in Scania. The main rivals {{of the club}} are Helsingborgs IF, IFK Göteborg and IFK Malmö. The rivalry between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF has existed since Malmö FF were {{promoted}} up to Allsvenskan in the 1930s, and is primarily geographic, since both teams are from Scania in southern Sweden. The rivalry with IFK Göteborg relates more to title clashes; the two are the most successful clubs in Swedish football history and the only two to have appeared in European cup finals, IFK Göteborg in the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987 and Malmö FF in the European Cup in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury is {{a popular}} tourist destination: {{consistently}} one of the most-visited cities in the United Kingdom, the city's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism. The city has been occupied since Paleolithic times and served as {{the capital of the}} Celtic Cantiaci and Jute Kingdom of Kent. Many historical structures fill the area, including a city wall founded in Roman times and rebuilt in the 14th century, the ruins of St Augustine's Abbey and a Norman castle, and the oldest extant school in the world, the King's School. Modern additions include the Marlowe Theatre and the St Lawrence Ground, home of the Kent County Cricket Club. There is also a substantial student population, brought about by the presence of the University of Kent, Canterbury Christ Church University, the University for the Creative Arts, and the Girne American UniversityCanterbury campus. Canterbury remains, however, a small city in terms <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> size and population, when compared with other British cities.|$|E
5|$|Chinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote {{accurate}} {{descriptions of}} places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, {{he described the}} sea route going {{into the mouth of}} the Persian Gulf, and that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century.

5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> elements.|$|E

Witnesses in Dharamshala, India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated over and over until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.|$|E

Offers of admission to the medical school are made from a rank list irrespective <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> preference.

5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much {{like that of the}} parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow to the principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the state {{boundaries}} marked by the monument occurred just prior to, and during, the American Civil War, when the United States Congress acted to form governments {{in the area to}} combat the spread of slavery to the region. When the early territories were formed, their boundaries were designated along meridian and parallel lines. Beginning in the 1860s, these lines were surveyed and marked. These early surveys included some errors, but even so, the markers placed became the legal boundaries, superseding the written descriptions <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> meridians and parallels. This includes the Four Corners Monument, which has been legally established as the corner of the four states.|$|E
