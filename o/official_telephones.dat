In the early 20 th century those municipalities {{were part of}} the Italian territory and underwent a massive Italianization process that led to the mutation of the original Slovenian surnames into a derived Italian form. In order to track surname relationships among the examined communities, two different similarity analyses were performed: the first using the surnames as they are recorded in the Italian and Slovenian <b>official</b> <b>telephone</b> directories, and the second restoring the Italianized Slovenian surnames to their original form and then recalculating the populations’ similarity. Both comparisons evidence a separation that depends on nationality, which is less marked after restoring surnames to their original form.

Blogs seem to give significant advantages in organising activities of a research project as well as aid in reflective learning. A survey of scientific literature shows active use of blogs in both medical teaching and training and as an aid to reflective learning. A blog was maintained for 40 weeks between September 2010 and July 2011 by a student of the MSc in Biomedical Informatics course which was overseen by two supervisors.

The internal survey network has made it necessary to evaluate interviewer performance in time, as well as their impact on survey quality. But what indicators should be used to monitor the continuous data collection process? The first aim has been to construct an indicator plan comprising indicators useful to monitor the data collection process and changes in time of the network of interviewers, as well as the panel survey in its entirety, and therefore the impact of its course on sampling error. This indicator plan has been constructed in line with international standards for <b>official</b> face-to-face and <b>telephone</b> surveys (AAPOR 1 Standard Definitions). The second aim has been to analyse these indicators using multidimensional analysis techniques, in order to ensure the comprehension of the “quality” phenomenon, a complex issue in itself. In particular for the network of interviewers, the issue was to evaluate and represent the work of n interviews working in different geographical locations and with different personal characteristics, observing p outcomes of interviews in t time intervals.
