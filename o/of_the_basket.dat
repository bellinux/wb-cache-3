5|$|Rounding a corner, {{they see}} a cat and hide under a basket, but the cat then sits on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> for five hours, {{trapping}} the pair. Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes and the cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> {{along with some of}} stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E

25|$|The {{head was}} {{probably}} relatively large and wide but still elongated. The snout is completely unknown. Frontal bones are absent. The skull roof is rather robust with bosses on the parietals, continuing sideways over the dermopterotica, and the postparietals. The parietals have a notch {{on the front}} midline. A dermosphenoticum is present above the eye socket. The jaws are toothless. Behind the jaw joint a robust hyomandibula is present. The gill basket rests on paired hypohyalia. At least the first two gill arches have ossified hypobranchialia, the lower parts of the gill arch; a third hypobranchiale was likely present. The hypobranchials are attached at their lower ends at an angle of 21,5° via a functional joint that possibly served to increase the gape of the mouth, to about two feet. All five gill arches have ossified ceratobranchialia with a triangular cross-section, the middle sections of the arches. The hypobranchials are fused with their ceratobranchials. The fifth gill arch is fused with the front parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> Higher epibranchialia and pharyngobranchialia are present but poorly known. The fourth arches are supported by a midline fourth basibranchiale. An ossified operculum is present.|$|E
25|$|The TAIC {{released}} its interim {{report on the}} accident on 10 May 2012. Examination of the wreckage showed electrical arcing on the basket {{and one of the}} four propane cylinders, consistent with a power line strike. Details about the maintenance and record-keeping of the balloon were released. The most recent inspection had occurred on 14 September 2011, with several errors made in the records and inspection. The inspection report erroneously recorded the type certificate as B2GL, which is applicable to Cameron Balloons United States for serial numbers 5000 and higher – ZK-XXF was manufactured in the United Kingdom and was serial number 4300, so the correct type certificate was BB12. It also recorded the basket and burners as being of Cameron Balloons, not as being of Thunder and Colt. Anomalies were also identified in the maintenance logbook, including incorrect identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and burners, no record of four airworthiness directives, and no entry regarding the use of the gas bottles. The maintenance provider was also found to be using outdated versions of the Flight and Maintenance Manuals, using the 1992-released Issue 7 rather than the current Issue 10, and that the maintainers had tested the strength of the envelope by hand, rather than the prescribed method of using a spring gauge to measure actual strength.|$|E
500|$|The {{restricted}} area arc rule was implemented in NCAA men's basketball for the 2010–2011 season. The NCAA approved adding a visible restricted-area arc three {{feet from the}} center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> in Division I men’s and women’s games for the 2011–2012 season. The panel delayed implementation of the arc until the 2012-2013 season for Divisions II and III to allow those schools time to plan and place the restricted-area arc in their home arenas. [...] Starting with the 2015-2016 season, the NCAA raised the RA arc to four feet from the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{free throw}} circle has a six-foot (1.8m) radius and is {{centered}} at {{the midpoint of}} the free throw line; the half of that circle on the mid-court side of the free throw line is painted solid.

[...] NBA Rule 1 (g) requires the key to contain two [...] long hash marks, [...] from the free throw line; the marks indicate the so-called lower defensive box. The free throw line is 15feet (4.6m) from the perpendicular projection of the face of the backboard onto the court; this projection is 4feet (1.2m) from the end-line for NBA and NCAA.

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E
500|$|Before the war, the {{government}} spent 13 percent of GNP; in 1918 it spent 59 percent of GNP. The war was financed by borrowing large sums {{at home and}} abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by postponing maintenance and repair, and canceling unneeded projects. The government avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and caused discontent among the working class. In 1913-14, indirect taxes on tobacco and alcohol yielded £75 million, while direct taxes yielded £88 million, including an income tax of £44 million and estate duties of £22 million. That is, 54 percent of revenue came from direct taxes; by 1918, direct taxes were 80 percent of revenue. [...] There was {{a strong emphasis on}} being [...] "fair" [...] and being [...] "scientific." [...] The public generally supported the heavy new taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917. [...] Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main increase in revenue came from income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in the pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate grew to [...] 5s (25%) in 1916, and 6s (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes provided at most 30 percent of national expenditures, with the rest from borrowing. The national debt soared from £625 million to £7,800 million. Government bonds typically paid five percent. Inflation escalated so that the pound in 1919 purchased only a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> it had purchased it 1914. Wages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.|$|E
