5|$|By 1892, Imaginos {{is living}} in a mansion in Cornwall and has a nine-year-old granddaughter. Having by this time spent several decades {{studying}} mysticism and astrology, Imaginos discovers that Elizabethan England's rise as a superpower coincided with John Dee's acquisition of a magic obsidian mirror from Mexico, {{which serves as a}} bridge between Les Invisibles' alien world and <b>ours,</b> <b>and</b> the means to spread their influence on Earth. Some fans see Les Invisibles' actions in favour of England against Spain as a sort of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America, while others view their intervention as only part of the mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries ("In the Presence of Another World").|$|E

25|$|In 1524 the Castilian pilots (ships' captains) Thomas Duran, Sebastian Cabot (son of John Cabot), and Juan Vespuccius (nephew of Amerigo Vespucci) {{gave their}} opinion to the Badajoz Junta, whose failure {{to resolve the}} dispute led to the Treaty of Saragossa. They {{specified}} that the line was 22° plus nearly 9 {{miles west of the}} center of Santo Antão (the westernmost Cape Verde island), which Harrisse concluded was 47°17'W on their sphere (3.1% smaller than <b>ours)</b> <b>and</b> 46°36'W on our sphere.|$|E
25|$|However, because Titor {{asserted}} that the many-worlds interpretation was proved correct by his time, his predictions could refer to another timeline and not ours, making them unfalsifiable. This led to different interpretations, including that he had effectively accomplished his mission by creating another timeline (despite his supposed previous statements {{that it would be}} too difficult), or that he inadvertently traveled to a different timeline (<b>ours)</b> <b>and</b> mistook it as his own, or that all time travel is pointless if the chaotic timeline would not cease to exist.|$|E

He then attacked and drove down three other machines, maintaining the fight until the eight had got back to their lines. He has also, with another officer, destroyed an Albatros scout, which he followed down to a height of 200 feet, in spite of heavy machine-gun fire from the ground.|$|E

500|$|On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, {{exceeding}} the 270 required {{for him to}} be reelected as president. With 51.1% of the popular vote, Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. President Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: [...] "Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not <b>ours.</b> <b>And</b> in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties." ...|$|E

Gen. Henry W. Slocum, and surrendered the city, asking for [...] "protection to non-combatants and private property". Sherman, who was in Jonesborough at the time of surrender, sent a telegram to Washington on September 3, reading, [...] "Atlanta is <b>ours,</b> <b>and</b> fairly won". He then established his headquarters there on September 7, where he stayed for over two months. On November 15, the army departed east toward Savannah, on what became known as [...] "Sherman's March to the Sea".|$|E

500|$|Leonard Boyarsky, art {{director}} of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said [...] "To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed {{that we did not}} get the chance to make the next Fallout game. This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was <b>ours</b> <b>and</b> it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
500|$|The final {{took place}} on the third day of racing. The Australians came to the {{conclusion}} that their wheels and tyres were too heavy, so they sought to buy better cycling equipment from the defeated Germans. The Germans agreed, saying [...] "Have <b>ours</b> <b>and</b> you will win the gold medal." [...] Australia were again pitted against the Czechoslovak Vaclav Machek and Ladislav Foucek. One of the reasons behind Australia's return to form had been the return of Guyatt to a mentoring role. Guyatt had assisted them at the national championships, but they were assigned to another coach at the Olympics. Guyatt was regarded as a marketing-style motivator and he attempted to give Browne and Marchant a psychological boost. Equipped with their new machines, Browne and Marchant employed a tactical trick devised by Guyatt. The Australian staff had noticed that the Czechoslovaks had always made their final burst from a certain point from the finish. During the final, Australian team manager Bill Young stood at the said point as the Australian led out. When Browne came to the point, he pulled upwards and pre-emptively blocked the expected Czechoslovakian attack. This helped to stifle the attack and Australia went on to win the gold medal.|$|E
500|$|Spaihts was {{tasked with}} {{exploring}} unresolved mysteries from Alien, {{such as the}} Space Jockey. He considered the mysteries of Alien to be alien in nature, and said, [...] "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" [...] His solution was to link the alien mysteries {{to the past and}} future of humanity. He said: [...] "if that story is somehow <b>ours</b> <b>and</b> deeply enmeshed with the human story. That story changes meaning within our own life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently." [...] Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, [...] "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?" [...] In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.|$|E
