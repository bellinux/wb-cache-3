The next few years were quiet, although rumors of war with the Indians led to the formation in 1643 of the New England Confederation, designed to facilitate united action by the New England colonies against common external threats as well as internal matters like dealing with escaped slaves and fugitives from justice.|$|E
5|$|The Ninth Amendment {{declares}} {{that there are}} additional fundamental rights that exist outside the Constitution. The rights enumerated in the Constitution are not an explicit and exhaustive list <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights.</b> It was rarely mentioned in Supreme Court decisions before {{the second half of}} the 20th century, when it was cited by several of the justices in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). The Court in that case voided a statute prohibiting use of contraceptives as an infringement of the right of marital privacy. This right was, in turn, the foundation upon which the Supreme Court built decisions in several landmark cases, including, Roe v. Wade (1973), which overturned a Texas law making it a crime to assist a woman to get an abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which invalidated a Pennsylvania law that required spousal awareness prior to obtaining an abortion.|$|E

5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E

25|$|Drawing {{on ideas}} of Adam Smith, {{classical}} liberals {{believed that it}} is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea of the welfare state as interfering in a free market. Despite Smith’s resolute recognition of the importance and value of labor and of laborers, they selectively criticized labour's group rights being pursued at the expense <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> while accepting corporations' rights, which led to inequality of bargaining power.|$|E
25|$|Anarcho-capitalists, voluntaryists {{and other}} right-anarchists oppose {{institutional}} democracy as they consider it {{in conflict with}} widely held moral values and ethical principles and their conception <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights.</b> The a priori Rothbardian argument {{is that the state}} is a coercive institution which necessarily violates the non-aggression principle (NAP). Some right-anarchists also criticise democracy on a posteriori consequentialist grounds, in terms of inefficiency or disability in bringing about maximisation of individual liberty. They maintain the people who participate in democratic institutions are foremost driven by economic self-interest.|$|E
25|$|When a law {{or other}} act of {{government}} is challenged {{as a violation of}} individual liberty under the Due Process Clause, courts now use two forms of scrutiny or judicial review. The inquiry balances the importance of the governmental interest being served and the appropriateness of the method of implementation against the resulting infringement <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights.</b> If the governmental action infringes upon a fundamental right, the highest level of review, strict scrutiny, is used. To pass strict scrutiny, the law or the act must be both narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatrists {{around the}} world have been {{involved}} in the suppression <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> by states wherein the definitions of mental disease had been expanded to include political disobedience. Nowadays, in many countries, political prisoners are sometimes confined to mental institutions and abused therein. Psychiatry possesses a built-in capacity for abuse which is greater than in other areas of medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can serve as proxy for the designation of social dissidents, allowing the state to hold persons against their will and to insist upon therapies that work in favour of ideological conformity and in the broader interests of society.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Hecker {{returned}} to his farm in Illinois. It was with great joy that he heard of the union of Germany {{brought about by the}} victory over France in 1870-71. It was then that he gave his famous address at St. Louis, in which he gave animated expression to the enthusiasm of the German Americans for their newly united fatherland. After the war, he became more and more involved in the German-language press and Republican Party activities. He received a less favourable impression when he visited Germany in 1873 for criticizing lack <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> and the size of government in the new German government organization. He died at his farm in Summerfield, Illinois on March 24, 1881.|$|E
25|$|The current constitution, {{created in}} 1982, states in Article V that no {{organization}} or individual {{is above the}} law and in Article III makes the People’s Congresses and state administration responsible to the people, {{paving the way for}} later efforts to allow enforcement <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights.</b> Passage of the Administrative Litigation Law of 1987 created legal recourse for individuals from arbitrary government action, an avenue previously unavailable. Despite the deep-seated norm against legal proceedings, litigation in the Chinese courts has increased dramatically, especially in recent years. The continuing weakness of courts resulting from their dependence on the local government for financial support and enforcement undermines the effectiveness of these remedies but this has also begun to change with China’s initiatives to increase legal training and the professionalism of the judiciary.|$|E
40|$|My thesis focuses {{upon the}} ad bellum {{criteria}} of just cause and, {{to a lesser}} extent, legitimate authority. I begin by developing an account <b>of</b> the <b>individual</b> <b>right</b> to self-defence, grounded upon the <b>individual</b> <b>right</b> to lead a flourishing life, drawing upon Jeff McMahan’s and Judith Jarvis Thomson’s rights-based accounts of defence, and developing a dual account of liability to attack. I then outline a broadly individualist account of just cause, based upon this account <b>of</b> the <b>individual</b> <b>right</b> to defence. I explain what kinds of just causes for war would exist, based upon the delegation <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> defensive <b>rights</b> to a collective entity. Following this, I develop an asymmetrical account {{of the rights of}} combatants, based upon the dual account of liability. I argue that most unjust combatants are weakly liable, and I propose a general presumption of weak liability for both just and unjust combatants. I suggest that unjust combatants may therefore possess at least some <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> defence, but that just combatants have additional war rights resulting from taking part in a wider act of defence. Finally, I expand upon my argument concerning the delegation <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> defensive <b>rights,</b> by explaining which types of collective entity may receive delegated defensive rights and how such rights are delegated, and I also argue that collective entities which have been delegated <b>individual</b> defensive <b>rights</b> are therefore legitimate authorities, based upon a definition of legitimate authority as moral authority. Overall, my thesis aims to develop an individualist account of just cause, grounded upon the delegation <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> defensive <b>rights</b> to a collective entity, and to use my account to develop an asymmetric account of combatants’ rights and a rights-based account of legitimate authority...|$|R

25|$|As part of {{the project}} to limit the powers of government, various liberal theorists such as James Madison and the Baron de Montesquieu {{conceived}} the notion of separation of powers, a system designed to equally distribute governmental authority among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Governments had to realise, liberals maintained, that poor and improper governance gave the people authority to overthrow the ruling order through any and all possible means, even through outright violence and revolution, if needed. Contemporary liberals, heavily influenced by social liberalism, have continued to support limited constitutional government while also advocating for state services and provisions to ensure equal rights. Modern liberals claim that formal or official guarantees <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> are irrelevant when individuals lack the material means to benefit from those rights and call for a greater role for government in the administration of economic affairs.|$|E
25|$|Human {{rights in}} Somalia {{throughout}} the late 20th-century and early 21st-century were considered dire, but have gradually improved {{over the following}} years. Human rights are guaranteed in the Federal Constitution, which was adopted in August 2012. They fall under the Ministry of Human Rights established in August 2013. The central authorities concurrently inaugurated a National Human Rights Day, endorsed an official Human Rights Roadmap, and completed Somalia's first National Gender Policy. A Human Rights Task Force was also established in February 2013 to firm up on the protection <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights.</b> Additionally, {{the federal government in}} December 2014 organized a public awareness campaign, passed a new 54-point national Child Protection Act, and finished legislation on a Human Rights Commission bill. According to the UN's Independent Human Rights Expert on Somalia, local human rights protection has gradually improved as government institutionalization and legislative reform have taken root.|$|E
25|$|The {{logic of}} this {{concession}} points irresistibly to {{the contention that}} the Thirteenth Amendment operates only to protect the African race. This {{is evident from the}} fact that nowhere in the record does it appear that the parties charged to have been wronged by the defendants had ever been themselves slaves, or were the descendants of slaves. They took no more from the Amendment than any other citizens of the United States. But if, as we have seen, that denounces a condition possible for all races and all individuals, then a like wrong perpetrated by white men upon a Chinese, or by black men upon a white man, or by any men upon any man on account of his race, would come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and that protection <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>rights</b> which, prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, was unquestionably within the jurisdiction solely of the states, would, by virtue of that Amendment, be transferred to the nation, and subject to the legislation of Congress.|$|E

It is tasked with investigating allegations {{of human rights abuses}} and journalist intimidation. At the end of its three-month mandate, the committee is scheduled to publish a report on its findings and recommended courses of action.
