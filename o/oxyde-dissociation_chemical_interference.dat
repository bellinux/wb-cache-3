Crop failures and low yields caused by the reseeding, overseeding, crop rotation and replanting of fruit trees in orchards {{are believed to be}} caused by allelopathic activity. Moreover, the expensive and environmentally impacting herbicides for weed control have motivated studies directed at developing cheaper, environmentally-friendly alternatives. Despite the difficulties in separating <b>chemical</b> <b>interference</b> from other mechanisms, more modern approaches have produced consistent and conclusive data on this topic.

A traditional strength of chemical sensors (optical, electrochemical, etc.) is the minimization of <b>chemical</b> <b>interference</b> between sensor and sample, achieved with the use of inert, “biofriendly ” matrices or interfaces. However, when it comes to penetrating individual live cells, even the introduction of a sub-micron sensor tip can cause biological damage and resultant biochemical consequences. In contrast, individual molecular probes (free sensing dyes) are physically small enough but usually suffer from <b>chemical</b> <b>interference</b> between probe and cellular components. Our recently developed PEBBLE sensors (Probes Encapsulated By Biologically Localized Embedding) are nano-scale spherical devices consisting of sensor molecules entrapped in a chemically inert matrix. This protective coating eliminates interferences such as protein binding and/or membrane/organelle sequestration, which alter dye response. Conversely, the nanosensor matrix also provides protection to the cellular contents, enabling dyes that would usually be toxic to cells to be used for intracellular sensing. In addition, the inclusion of reference dyes allows quantitative, ratiometric fluorescence techniques to be used.

40|$|We {{developed}} a multiscale approach (MultiSCAAL) that integrates {{the potential of}} mean force (PMF) obtained from all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with a knowledge-based energy function for coarse-grained molecular simulations in better exploring the energy landscape of a small protein under <b>chemical</b> <b>interference</b> such as <b>chemical</b> denaturation. An excessive amount of water molecules in all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations often negatively impacts the sampling efficiency of some advanced sampling techniques such as the replica exchange method and it makes the investigation of <b>chemical</b> <b>interferences</b> on protein dynamics difficult. Thus, {{there is a need}} to develop an effective strategy that focuses on sampling structural changes in protein conformations rather than solvent molecule fluctuations. In this work, we address this issue by devising a multiscale simulation scheme (MultiSCAAL) that bridges the gap between all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation and coarse-grained molecular simulation. The two key features of this scheme are the Boltzmann inversion and a protein atomistic reconstruction method we previously developed (SCAAL). Using MultiSCAAL, we were able to enhance the sampling efficiency of proteins solvated by explicit water molecules. Our method has been tested on the folding energy landscape of a small protein Trp-cage with explicit solvent under 8 M urea using both the all-atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics (AA-REMD) and MultiSCAAL. We compared computational analyses on ensemble conformations of Trp-cage with its available experimental NOE distances. The analysis demonstrated that conformations explored by MultiSCAAL better agree with the ones probed in the experiments because it can effectively capture the changes in side chain orientations that can flip out of the hydrophobic pocket in the presence of urea and water molecules.
