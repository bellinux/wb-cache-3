500|$|Kim Neely of Rolling Stone {{dismissed}} the album as [...] "genuinely offensive satanic drivel". However, the magazine would later rank the album 47th on their 2017 [...] "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time" [...] list. Slayer's official biography states: [...] "The new sounds disappointed {{some of the}} band's fans who were more accustomed to the style of earlier releases." [...] Michael Roberts of Westworld Online said {{this was due to}} some of the numbers moving [...] "at the sludgier speed of Black Sabbath". Araya commented that the [...] "album was a late bloomer—it wasn't really received well, but it kind of grew <b>on</b> <b>everybody</b> later".|$|E
500|$|The {{transformative}} {{power of}} the song was investigated by journalist Bill Moyers in a documentary released in 1990. Moyers was inspired {{to focus on the}} song's power after watching a performance at Lincoln Center, where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact <b>on</b> <b>everybody</b> in attendance, unifying them. James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: [...] "there is a transformative power that is applicable... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of Rivera's colleagues credit {{him with}} popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers.

Everybody saw what [...] could do, basically with one pitch. Nobody could throw it like he did, but now, {{you talk about the}} evolution of the cutter—just ask hitters about it and they tell you everybody's throwing one. And they hate it." [...] Al Leiter, whose signature pitch was a cutter, echoed Isringhausen's sentiments: [...] "Now, everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that. Pitchers watched him and marveled at what he did with one pitch." ...|$|E

500|$|Ed Webb and Mark Wardecker, in a {{paper in}} Doctor Who and Philosophy, {{interpreted}} the Dalek history shown in Genesis of the Daleks as a warning that [...] "scientists {{will be the one}} to bring about the ultimate destruction, the ultimate evil, and deliberately so". They also commented that the serial showed that the Daleks were evil by design, rather than evolution. Davros represents a mad scientist who creates a monster that then consumes him. Sarah Honeychurch and Niall Burr, in the same book, wrote that the corruption of the Daleks showed that creatures should not be created with [...] "such limited moral reasoning," [...] and that in our world we cannot [...] "impose our own personal human standards <b>on</b> <b>everybody</b> else".|$|E
500|$|Aretha Franklin and Rod Stewart also {{recorded}} [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] {{around the same}} time, and both of their renditions were popular. All four versions were marketed to distinct types of audiences thereby assuring its place as a pop song. Johnny Cash recorded it on his 1975 album Sings Precious Memories, dedicating it to his older brother Jack, {{who had been killed}} in a mill accident when they were boys in Dyess, Arkansas. Cash and his family sang it to themselves while they worked in the cotton fields following Jack's death. Cash often included the song when he toured prisons, saying [...] "For the three minutes that song is going <b>on,</b> <b>everybody</b> is free. It just frees the spirit and frees the person." ...|$|E
500|$|Scully was {{a writer}} and co-executive {{producer}} <b>on</b> <b>Everybody</b> Loves Raymond for part of season seven and all of season eight, winning an Emmy for his work. Scully co-created (with wife Julie Thacker) The Pitts for Fox and Complete Savages for ABC, which was produced by Mel Gibson. The Pitts was a sitcom about a family suffering from bad luck. Thacker stated the show was designed [...] "as a companion piece for The Simpsons. It had a very cartoony feel to it. We always knew the initial audience for the show would be 12-year-olds to start, and then when families saw that the writing was very Simpsons - like, {{because many of the}} writers were from The Simpsons, [...] families would start to watch it together." [...] It was canceled after six episodes; Scully and Thacker laid the blame for this on the show's timeslot, 9:30P.M., which was too late for the target audience. Complete Savages, which Thacker and Scully wrote with the [...] "Simpsons sensibility" [...] of layered jokes, was canceled in January 2005 due to low ratings and network anger at Scully and Thacker's decision to write to TV critics in what the Hartford Courant labelled [...] "unsanctioned promoting". A fan of NRBQ, Scully produced, with Thacker, a documentary about the band in 2003 entitled NRBQ: Rock 'n' Roll's Best Kept Secret; Scully employed the group as the [...] "unofficial house band" [...] of The Simpsons during his tenure as showrunner. Scully also created a pilot for Fox called Schimmel in 2000, starring Robert Schimmel, which was dropped after Schimmel was diagnosed with cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart objected for the prosecution, {{demanding}} to know the legal purpose of Darrow's questioning. Bryan, gauging the effect the session was having, snapped that its purpose was [...] "to cast ridicule <b>on</b> <b>everybody</b> who believes in the Bible".

In cases like this, the approach is sometimes to restrict certain content from being shown in specific countries." [...] The Jakarta Globe reported that several Muslim religious scholars in Indonesia were critical of Facebook in light of the protest movement. Rohadi Abdul Fatah the Indonesia, Religious Affairs Ministry director of Islam and Shariah Law, announced that Facebook was to be considered haram (forbidden) according to Muslim law. Rohadi Abdul Fatah stated, [...] "We cannot tolerate it. Those who created the account were extremely irresponsible." [...] Indonesia Communication and Information Minister Tifatul Sembiring stated to The Jakarta Globe, [...] "I consider this an act of provocation to mess up religious harmony enjoyed by Indonesians. I call <b>on</b> <b>everybody</b> to stay calm. Let us all just cool down."

2500|$|On May 20, 2010, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch of Reason {{announced}} {{the winners of}} the publication's [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] contest. Gillespie and Welch warned the reader not to view the image [...] "if you are offended by graphical representations of the Prophet Mohammed." [...] Of the images highlighted, Gillespie and Welch explained: [...] "The single most important element–and the thing that ties these selections together–is that each image forces the viewer to do two things. First, they consciously call into question the nature of representation, no small matter in fights over whether it is allowed under Islamic law to depict Mohammed ... Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself." [...] There were two images in the position of runner-up – one was an artistic rendition of a tobacco smoking pipe. The depiction references surrealist artist René Magritte, and includes the text, [...] "This is not a pipe. This is Muhammed." [...] The Reason journalists commented that the image toyed with Magritte's [...] "famous statement about the necessary disjuncture between a picture and the thing it seeks to represent." [...] The second runner-up was a parody of the Where's Waldo? series, and the winner was a connect the dots picture. Commenting on the winner of the Reason contest, Gillespie and Welch concluded, [...] "There is a deeper lesson here: Connect the dots and discover that we all must be Spartacus <b>on</b> <b>Everybody</b> Draw Mohammad Day. And that in a free society, every day is Everybody Draw Mohammed Day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week <b>on</b> <b>everybody.</b> What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E

[...] Ole Jacob Hoel of Adresseavisen described it and [...] "Celluloid Heroes," [...] also from Everybody's in Show-Biz as [...] "two of history's finest pop songs." [...] However, music critic John Mendelsohn finds a note of self-pity in Davies singing about [...] "how used he feels."
