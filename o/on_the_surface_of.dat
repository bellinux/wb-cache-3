5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> water. They can do this because their claws are not at {{the tips of the}} legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} superconductor (SC) on <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> topological insulators (TIs) is {{a mixture}} of s-wave and helical p-wave components when induced by s-wave interactions, since spin and momentum are correlated. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> basis of the Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory, we reveal that unconventional SCs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> TIs are stable against time-reversal symmetric (TRS) impurities within a region of small impurity concentration. Moreover, we analyze the stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SC <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> TIs against impurities beyond the perturbation theory by solving the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation for an effective tight-binding model of a TI.
