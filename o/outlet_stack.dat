40|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory's Nuclear Materials Storage Facility (NMSF) {{is being}} renovated for {{long-term}} storage of canisters {{designed to hold}} heat-generating nuclear materials. A fully passive cooling scheme, relying on the transfer of heat by conduction, free convection, and radiation has been proposed as a reliable means of maintaining material at acceptable storage temperatures. The storage concept involves placing radioactive materials, with a net heat-generation rate of 10 W to 20 W, inside a set of nested steel canisters. The canisters are, in placed in holding fixtures and positioned vertically within a steel storage pipe. Several hundred drywells are arranged in a linear array within a large bay and dissipate the waste heat to the surrounding air, thus creating a buoyancy driven airflow pattern that draws cool air into the storage facility and exhausts heated air through an <b>outlet</b> <b>stack.</b> In this study, an experimental apparatus was designed to investigate the thermal characteristics of simulated nuclear materials placed inside two nested steel canisters positioned vertically on an aluminum fixture plate and placed inside a section of steel pipe. The heat-generating nuclear materials were simulated with a solid aluminum cylinder containing. an embedded electrical resistance heater. Calibrated type T thermocouples (accurate to ~ O. 1 C) were used to monitor temperatures at 20 different locations within the apparatus. The {{purposes of this study}} were to observe the heat dissipation characteristics of the proposed `canister/fixture plate storage configuration, to investigate how the storage system responds to changes in various parameters, and to develop and validate empirical correlations to predict material temperatures under various operating condition...|$|E
40|$|The European {{electric}} power industry has undergone considerable changes {{over the past}} two decades as a result of more stringent laws concerning environmental protection along with the deregulation and liberalization of the {{electric power}} market. However, the pressure to deliver solutions in regard to the issue of climate change has increased dramatically in the last few years and has given rise to the possibility that future natural gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) plants will also be subject to CO 2 capture requirements. At the same time, the interest in combined cycles with their high efficiency, low capital costs, and complexity has grown as a consequence of addressing new challenges posed by the need to operate according to market demand in order to be economically viable. Considering that these challenges will also be imposed on new natural gas-fired power plants in the foreseeable future, this study presents a new process concept for natural gas combined cycle power plants with CO 2 capture. The simulation tool IPSEpro is used to model a 400 MW single-pressure NGCC with post-combustion CO 2 capture using an amine-based absorption process with monoethanolamine. To improve the costs of capture, the gas turbine GE 109 FB is utilizing exhaust gas recirculation, thereby, increasing the CO 2 content in the gas turbine working fluid to almost double that of conventional operating gas turbines. In addition, the concept advantageously uses approximately 20 % less steam for solvent regeneration by utilizing preheated water extracted from heat recovery steam generator. The further recovery of heat from exhaust gases for water preheating by use of an increased economizer flow results in an <b>outlet</b> <b>stack</b> temperature comparable to those achieved in combined cycle plants with multiple-pressure levels. As a result, overall power plant efficiency as high as that achieved for a triple-pressure reheated NGCC with corresponding CO 2 removal facility is attained. The concept, thus, provides a more cost-efficient option to triple-pressure combined cycles since the number of heat exchangers, boilers, etc., is reduced considerably...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a lumped zero dimensional (0 D) {{model for the}} simulation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack thermal dynamics. Particularly, a dedicated sub-model is developed, via a mixed gray/black-box modeling approach, to suitably treat the heat exchange mechanisms between the stack and its surrounding environment. Such a sub-model was embedded into an existing 0 D simulator and then tested via comparison with temperature sensor measurements. The hardware sensor is indeed particularly critical, due to its location and the typically high operating temperature characterizing SOFC. Therefore, suitable experimental transients were performed at Topsoe fuel cell test-bench, thus allowing verifying the accuracy and generalization granted by the 0 D model in reproducing <b>stack</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature trajectories, both in steady-state and dynamic operations. As a result, the modeling approach here proposed is proven effective either to replace the hardware temperature sensor at <b>stack</b> <b>outlet</b> or for redundancy purposes to improve reliability. Moreover, the 0 D model can be deployed for offline design of SOFC systems' control strategies, {{as well as for}} real-time diagnostic and control applications...|$|R

50|$|The {{research}} on high frequency screens {{has led to}} {{new developments in the}} field which enhance the operation and performance of the equipment. These new developments include the stacking of up to 5 individual screen decks placed {{on top of the other}} and operating in parallel. A divider system splits the feed slurry to each Stack Sizer® screen, then to each screen deck on the machine. Each screen deck has an undersize and oversize collection pan which will respectively go into their common <b>outlet.</b> The <b>stacking</b> of the machines thus allows more production while using less space. Another new development is the fabrication of Polyweb urethane screen surfaces that have openings as fine as 45 µm and open areas from 35% - 45%. This leads to the screen being able to separate finer particles. The screens can be used for both wet and dry applications and urethane formulation is still an ongoing process. Thus, research and development is still being invested in high frequency screening equipment to improve the overall separation efficiency and also to lower costs.|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} General Electric Energy and Environmental Research Corporation conducts a {{preliminary}} field {{evaluation of a}} novel technology, referred to as Hg/NO{sub x}, that can reduce emissions of both mercury (Hg) and oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}) from coal-fired power plants. The evaluation takes place in Green Station Unit 2 operated by Western Kentucky Energy. Reduction of Hg and NO{sub x} emissions in Unit 2 is achieved using coal reburning. Activities during first project year (January 23, 2003 [...] January 22, 2004) included measurements of baseline Hg emissions in Unit 2 and pilot-scale testing. Baseline testing of Hg emissions in Green Unit 2 has been completed. Two fuels were tested with OFA system operating at minimum air flow. Mercury emissions were measured at ESP inlet and outlet, and at the stack using Ontario Hydro revised method. Testing demonstrated that baseline Hg reductions at ESP <b>outlet</b> and <b>stack</b> were 30 - 45 % and 70 - 80 %, respectively.

Operation of the stack under various scenarios was simulated such as start-up from room temperature, steady state at full and half load and sudden changes of load (from full to half load and reverse), under constant or variable flow rate of the cooling air. In variable power load operation, the stack temperature is not constant. One interesting finding of this analysis is that liquid water occurs at the <b>outlet</b> whenever the <b>stack</b> temperature falls below 60 °C, although the nominal operating conditions were selected such {{that there is no}} liquid water at the outlet at steady state operation. The results also indicate that this particular stack has insufficient heat exchange area with cooling air resulting in relatively large cooling air flow rates and low temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Historically, boiler {{efficiency}} {{has been limited}} due to the minimum temperature allowed at the stack.

With {{the development of the}} condensing heat exchanger, {{boiler efficiency}} can now exceed 90 %. Approximately 1 % gain in boiler efficiency can be expected for every 40 F (4. 5 C) reduction in flue gas stack temperature. In the CHX ® condensing heat exchanger, all gas wetted surfaces are covered with DuPont Teflon®. The Teflon covered heat exchanger surfaces are impervious to all acids noonally resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels.

40|$|The {{solution}} of applications for {{air pollution control}} in foundries for iron and non-ferrous metals may not only be understood as theobservance of requested emission limit values at the <b>stack</b> <b>outlet.</b> An effective environmental protection already starts with the greatest possible capture of pollutants at the source with {{at the same time}} minimisation of the volume flow necessary for this. Independent of this, the downstream installed filtration system has to realise a degree of separation of definitely above 99 %. Furthermore, when selecting the filter construction, attention has to be paid to a high availability. An even temporarily productionwithout filter will more and more no longer be accepted by residents and authorities. Incidents at the filter lead to a shutdown of the whole production. Additional measures for heat recovery while preparing concepts for filtration plants help to reduce the energy consumption and servefor a sustained conservation of environment.

To recapitulate: What is being developed is a prototype of valves for microfluidic systems and other microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

With {{the exception of the}} actuator, the parts were micromachined from silicon. The linear actuator consisted of a stack of piezoelectric disks in a rigid housing. To make the diaphragm apply a large sealing force on the inlet and <b>outlet,</b> the piezoelectric <b>stack</b> was compressed into a slightly contracted condition during assembly of the valve. Application of a voltage across the stack caused the stack to contract into an even more compressed condition, lifting the diaphragm away from the seat, thereby creating a narrow channel between the inlet and outlet. The positions of the inlet and outlet, relative to the diaphragm and seat, were such that the inlet flow and pressure contributed to sealing and thus to a desired normally-closed mode of operation...|$|R

Therefore, after disassembling the MEA is {{cut into small pieces}} and analyzed in a 1 cm 2 test cell.

The spectra of the segments at different positions do not follow a specified trend from methanol inlet to <b>outlet</b> of the <b>stack</b> flow field. The anode spectra were analyzed with an equivalent circuit simulation. The conductance of the charge transfer was found to increase with current density up to a point where a raising limitation process of the complex methanol oxidation dominates, which is not a bottleneck at low current density. Further, an increase of the double layer capacitance with current density was observed. The diffusion resistance was calculated as an effective diffusion coefficien t in the order of 10 - 10 m 2 s- 1; implying that the diffusion limitation is not the bulk diffusion in the backing layer.

The safety {{performance}} of Kartini research reactor {{related to the}} gaseous releases to the environment has been evaluated. The research covers an evaluation and improvement on the ventilation system and analysis of gas releases dissipating from the reactor building. The method used is calculation of reactor source term and direct measurement of gas release from the reactor stack. The source term analysis showed that the fission product accumulated in the reactor core {{at the start of}} operation was 4. 838 ´ 106 Ci, after of 5 hours operation it became 3. 614 ´ 108 Ci, and after 24 hours decay, the fission product became 4. 727 ´ 106 Ci. The N 16 activity inside the reactor building is 4. 1 ´ 10 - 10 μCi/cm 3 and the Ar 41 escaping to the atmosphere is 5. 7 ´ 10 - 12 mCi/cm 3, which is lower than limit value for radiation worker of 2 ´ 10 - 6 μCi/cm 3.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the gases and particulate emissions from a palm oil mill boiler, the effect of exhaust gas stream recirculation on multi-cyclones performance, and particulates characteristics on the size distribution and elemental composition. A palm oil mill plant situated in Kulai, Johor {{was chosen as the}} study site. The mill was equipped with a multi-cyclones connected with a recirculation duct from the outlet to the inlet of the unit. Different recirculation airflow rates (0 %, 11 % and 17 % of the total exhaust gas flow rate) were available by the means of external induced draft (ID) fan to extract part of the exhaust gas stream from the multi-cyclones outlet back into its inlet. The flue gas volumetric flow rate and particulate concentration were measured at the boiler <b>outlet</b> (cyclone inlet), <b>stack</b> gas (emitting the cyclone) and recirculation duct using US EPA methods. The average concentration of O 2 measured was 16. 9 % while the average concentration (corrected to 7 % O 2) of CO 2, CO, NO and SO 2 measured was 2. 93 %, 5153 mg/Nm 3, 84. 2 mg/Nm 3 and 339 mg/Nm 3, respectively. Besides, the particulate emission factor based on 27, 000 kg/hr fresh fruit bunch (FFB) processed, 6, 000 kg/hr fibre and shell (F and S) burned, and 8, 000 kg/hr boiler capacity (BC) was 5. 45 ± 2. 18 g/kg, 24. 5 ± 9. 82 g/kg, and 18. 4 ± 7. 36 g/kg, respectively. From the result, with the increase of inlet particulate loading, the performance of the multi-cyclones was able to achieve 74 % collection efficiency at 11 % recirculation rate, with an increment of 6 % compared to without recirculation (68 %). The performance, however, dropped to 67 % at 17 % recirculation rate because the recirculated particulates were broken up into smaller size fraction at higher recirculation rate when passing through external ID fan.

40|$|The power {{industry}} in the U. S. is faced with meeting regulations to reduce the emissions of mercury compounds from coal-fired plants. Injecting a sorbent such as powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the flue gas {{represents one of the}} simplest and most mature approaches to controlling mercury emissions from coal-fired boilers. The purpose of this test program was to evaluate the long-term mercury removal capability, long-term mercury emissions variability, and operating and maintenance (O&M) costs associated with sorbent injection on a configuration being considered for many new plants. Testing was conducted by ADA Environmental Solutions (ADA) at Rocky Mountain Power’s (RMP) Hardin Station through funding provided by DOE/NETL, RMP, and other industry partners. The Hardin Station is a new plant rated at 121 MW gross that was first brought online in April of 2006. Hardin fires a Powder River Basin (PRB) coal and is configured with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOx control, a spray dryer absorber (SDA) for SO 2 control, and a fabric filter (FF) for particulate control. Based upon previous testing at PRB sites with SCRs, very little additional mercury oxidation from the SCR was expected at Hardin. In addition, based upon results from DOE/NETL Phase II Round I testing at Holcomb Station and results from similarly configured sites, low native mercury removal was expected across the SDA and FF. The main goal of this project was met—sorbent injection was used to economically and effectively achieve 90 % mercury control as measured from the air heater (AH) <b>outlet</b> to the <b>stack</b> for a period of ten months. This goal was achieved with DARCO® Hg-LH, Calgon FLUEPAC®-MC PLUS and ADA Power PAC PREMIUM brominated activated carbons at nominal loadings of 1. 5 – 2. 5 lb/MMacf. An economic analysis determined the twenty-year levelized cost to be 0. 87 mills/kW-hr, or $ 15, 000 /lb Hg removed. No detrimental effects on other equipment or plant operations were observed. The results of this project also filled a data gap for plants firing PRB coal and configured with an SCR, SDA, and FF, as many new plants are being designed today. Another goal of the project was to evaluate, on a short-term basis, the mercury removal associated with coal additives and coal blending with western bituminous coal. The additive test showed that, at this site, the coal additive known as KNX was affective at increasing mercury removal while decreasing sorbent usage. Coal blending was conducted with two different western bituminous coals, and West Elk coal increased native capture from nominally 10 % to 50 %. Two additional co-benefits were discovered at this site. First, it was found that native capture increased from nominally 10 % at full load to 50 % at low load. The effect is believed to be due to an increase in mercury oxidation across the SCR caused by a corresponding decrease in ammonia injection when the plant reduces load. Less ammonia means more active oxidation sites in the SCR for the mercury. The second co-benefit was the finding that high ammonia concentrations can {{have a negative impact on}} mercury removal by powdered activated carbon. For a period of time, the plant operated with a high excess of ammonia injection necessitated by the plugging of one-third of the SCR. Under these conditions and at high load, the mercury control system could not maintain 90 % removal even at the maximum feed rate of 3. 5 lb/MMacf (pounds of mercury per million actual cubic feet). The plant was able to demonstrate that mercury removal was directly related to the ammonia injection rate in a series of tests where the ammonia rate was decreased, causing a corresponding increase in mercury removal. Also, after the SCR was refurbished and ammonia injection levels returned to normal, the mercury removal performance also returned to normal. Another goal of the project was to install a commercial-grade activated carbon injection (ACI) system and integrate it with new-generation continuous emissions monitors for mercury (Hg-CEMs) to allow automatic feedback control on outlet mercury emissions. This was accomplished and the plant can now be operated to control carbon injection based on either the overall mercury removal or an outlet mercury emission rate. By integrating these systems, it was determined that the plant could reduce powdered activated carbon consumption, especially at low load, because, at Hardin, native mercury capture increases from less than 20 % to about 50 % at low load and the carbon injection rate can be decreased accordingly. Currently, the plant is operating to automatically control emissions to below 0. 9 lb/TBtu (pounds of mercury per million British thermal units) at carbon loadings of 0. 5 to 1. 5 lb/MMacf. During the final phase of the Long-Term test, the ACI system was operated by plant personnel. The estimated O&M cost for a single Hg-CEM system is $ 15, 500 /yr. The Hg-CEMs performed well throughout the project. This project began shortly after Thermo Fisher first offered the Mercury Freedom System™ on a commercial basis and progressed though several iterations, improvements, and upgrades to the hardware and software. Indeed, there was a ten-fold increase in the precision and accuracy of the units during the course of the project due to several successful upgrades. In their present condition, the Hg-CEMs measure mercury to a precision of about ± 0. 05 μg/wscm (micrograms of mercury per wet standard cubic meter of gas), and only require occasional fine-tuning of the calibration coefficients. The quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocol required to keep the units operating at their optimal performance was also developed and perfected during the course of the project. ADA Environmental Solutions (ADA) developed a daily calibration procedure that surpasses the requirements specified in the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), and a weekly diagnostic program that ensures that the systems are operating properly and receive the necessary maintenance. For the most part, the systems passed the daily, weekly, and quarterly QA/QC requirements as well as four performance verification tests using the Ontario Hydro (O-H) and Sorbent Trap Methods (STM) for the first test and the EPA Method 30 A (M 30 A) procedure for the remaining three. However, some improvements are still necessary before the system can meet all of the requirements. These involve tests that challenge the system with oxidized mercury (Hg+ 2). These tests could not be passed at Hardin in spite of trying several improvements suggested by ADA or Thermo Fisher...|$|R
