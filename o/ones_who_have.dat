25|$|A {{stronger}} form of saudade may be felt towards {{people and}} things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as old ways and sayings; a lost lover who is sadly missed; a faraway place where one was raised; loved <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> died; feelings and stimuli one used to have; and the faded, yet golden memories of youth. Although it relates to feelings of melancholy and fond memories of things/people/days gone by, {{it can be a}} rush of sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate and the hope of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide consolation.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} wrist action {{can be seen}} by a skilled batsman and the change of spin allowed for when playing a shot at the ball. Less skilled batsmen, or <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> lost their concentration, can be deceived completely, expecting the ball to move one {{direction}} off the pitch, only for it to move the other direction. If the batsman is expecting a leg break, he will play outside the line of the ball after it spins. This means the ball can either strike the pads for a potential lbw appeal, or may fly between the bat and the pads and hit the wicket, or catch the edge of the bat.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{multitude}} of different ethnic and religious identities of the Muslim Bulgarians, {{it is extremely difficult}} to calculate the exact number {{of the members of the}} community in Bulgaria. An inquiry conducted by the Bulgaran Ministry of the Interior in 1989 estimated their number at 269,000. A summation of the different groups with different religious and ethnic identities (approximately 130,000 Muslim Bulgarians, approximately 55,000-65,000 non-religious Bulgarians, up to 50,000 Muslim Turks, 15,000 to 20,000 undeclared and an unclear number, probably at least several thousands, of Christian Bulgarians) yields approximately the same number. Despite {{the multitude}} of different ethnic and religious affiliations, the predominant ethnic identity would be Bulgarian (approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population) and the predominant religious identity would be Muslim (again approximately 200,000 or three-quarters of the total population). However, if only self-consciousness and self-declaration are taken into consideration, the number of Muslim Bulgarians would be only 131,531, i.e. the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> declared as such at the 2001 census.|$|E

500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wiccans {{celebrate}} {{a variation of}} Samhain {{as one of the}} yearly Sabbats of the Wheel of the Year. It is deemed by most Wiccans {{to be the most important}} of the four [...] "greater Sabbats". Samhain is seen by some Wiccans as a time to celebrate the lives of those who have died, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets and other loved <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> died. [...] In some rituals the spirits of the dead are invited to attend the festivities. [...] It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the wheel by the spring festival of Beltane, which Wiccans {{celebrate a}}s a festival of light and fertility.|$|E

2500|$|Over the red, {{black and}} white canvas there is a poem written in Braille by poet Chloe Mitchell; the braille follows {{the theme of the}} album's singles artwork which also {{features}} the same technique.

[...] During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they [...] "drank" [...] {{and came up with a}} poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled If They Let Us. Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to Rolling Stone magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still be able to stand out while doing what is right for you. She further said that the poem speaks about not conforming to society and being a leader as well as accepting that being misunderstood is a positive thing.|$|E

2500|$|About half {{of colleges}} use a wait list, {{particularly}} those that accept {{fewer than half of}} all applications. Since students on average tend to be sending out more applications, colleges have been having a tougher time knowing for certain whether the students to whom they have offered admission will, in fact, attend in the fall. Some of the uncertainty is related to the phenomenon of students applying to more and more schools, sometimes 15 or more, to increase their chances in a statistical sense, but this adds a new layer of guesswork for colleges trying to predict how many accepted students will say yes, and puts waitlisted students in [...] "limbo" [...] or the [...] "basic equivalent of purgatory," [...] according to US News. In addition, many colleges lose some students due to a phenomenon sometimes called summer melt, meaning that some students, even <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sent in a deposit, will not show up in the fall, and melt away, and this [...] "melt percentage" [...] can be as high as 5% to 10% of persons who have paid a deposit.|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{spending}} on disease prevention is often suggested {{as a way}} of reducing health care spending. Whether prevention saves or costs money depends on the intervention. Childhood vaccinations, or contraceptives save much more than they cost. Research suggests that in many cases prevention does not produce significant long-term cost savings. Some interventions may be cost-effective by providing health benefits, while others are not cost-effective. [...] Preventive care is typically provided to many people who would never become ill, and for those who would have become ill is partially offset by the health care costs during additional years of life. On the other hand, research conducted by Novartis argues that the countries that have excelled in getting the highest value for healthcare spending are the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> invested more in prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. The trick is to avoid getting patients to hospital, which is where highest healthcare dollars are being consumed. Not all preventive measures have good ROI (EG. Global vaccination campaign for a rare infectious diseases). However, preventive measures such as diet, exercises and reduction of tobacco intake would have broad impact on many diseases and will offer good return of investment.|$|E
