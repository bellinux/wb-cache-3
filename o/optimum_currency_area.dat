Moreover, the conclusions reached by the theory of self-fulfilling speculative attacks stress the difference between irrevocably fixed exchange rates and monetary union. As a consequence, I suggest referring to the theory of optimum monetary rather than <b>currency</b> <b>areas.</b> Finally, the difficulty of these criteria to explain the desire of peripheral countries to adhere to a monetary union (as in the case of the EMU), obliges to abandon the static framework. By considering a dynamic approach, it is also possible to interpret political reasons, often deemed to be crucial and considered separately from the economic ones, as referring to the economic, long term, benefits resulting from monetary unification. <b>Optimum</b> <b>Currency</b> <b>Areas...</b>|$|R

50|$|An optimal {{currency}} area is often larger than a country.

40|$|Research {{dealing with}} the theory of {{monetary}} integration is reviewed. After briefly describing {{the genesis of the}} theory as foreshadowed in work on <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> <b>areas,</b> the paper assesses two main areas of recent research â€” the analysis of the effects of disturbances on participating countries in a <b>currency</b> <b>area,</b> and reputational considerations. With regard to disturbances, the paper finds {{that it is difficult to}} draw clear-out inferences from theoretical work on the optimal degree of exchange rate management and from empirical studies on the effects of shocks.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} provide a closer {{integration}} {{of the theory of}} <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> with the theory of international trade. A <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> is treated as a continuous variable ranging from zero to one: zero if there is no enlargement, and some positive value otherwise, corresponding exactly to the percentge of trade in the enlarged area. The benefits of widening a <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> are then regarded, in terms of conventional trade theory, as equivalent to a reduction in transportation cost. The costs of widening a <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> are seen, instead, with reference to open economy macroeconomics, as a drop in the speed of adjustment of the terms of trade to their long-run equilibrium level. On this basis, it is shown that the marginal benefits of enlarging a <b>currency</b> <b>area</b> fall, the marginal costs rise, and an optimum size arises. But this size depends heavily on the optimal composition of the members.

What if we suppose instead that Home and Foreign have an integrated labor market, so that labor {{is free to}} move between them: What effect will this have on the decision to form an <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> <b>area?</b> This includes physical ability to travel (visas, workers' rights, etc.), lack of cultural barriers to free movement (such as different languages) and institutional arrangements (such {{as the ability to}} have pensions transferred throughout the region). For example, suppose Home and Foreign initially have equal output and unemployment. Suppose further that a negative shock hits Home, but not Foreign. If output falls and unemployment rises in Home, then labor will start to migrate to Foreign, where unemployment is lower. If this migration can occur with ease, the impact of the negative shock on Home will be less painful. Furthermore, there will be less need for Home to implement an independent monetary policy response for stabilization purposes. With an excess supply of labor in one region, adjustment can occur through migration.|$|E

40|$|The {{debate on}} EMU {{has been very}} {{influenced}} by the traditional theory of <b>optimum</b> <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> (OCAs). The paper shows that this theory is not an ideal yardstick for an assessment of EMU. Its assumptions are not very realistic and its focus on asymmetric real shocks is much too narrow. In addition, observed past real exchange rate changes are not a good predictor of future real shocks in the European Union (EU). In general, the OCA approach is heavily biased towards very small <b>currency</b> <b>areas.</b> Because of these shortcomings the paper develops a monetary approach {{to the theory of}} OCAs. In this concept the choice between a monetary union and independent national <b>currency</b> <b>areas</b> is analysed from the perspective of monetary policy efficiency.
