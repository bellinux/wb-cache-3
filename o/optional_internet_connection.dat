40|$|My {{thesis is}} about choice of <b>internet</b> <b>connection.</b> In my paper I focus on {{application}} methods of multicriterial evaluation of alternatives (VHV) on {{different types of}} <b>internet</b> <b>connection.</b> In my paper I want to compare different types of VHV and I want to say if they are convenient or not to use them in choice of <b>internet</b> <b>connection.</b> In this paper I compare different tariffs of <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> and different types of <b>internet</b> <b>connections</b> between each other. For comparison I chose ADSL connection, connection trough cable TV and wireless connection. In comparison I used next methods: lexicographical method, ORESTE, WSA, TOPSIS and ELECTRE III. For <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> is the best to use connection trough cable TV, second is ADSL connection and the worst is wireless connection. Lexicographical method is not very good for choice of <b>internet</b> <b>connection.</b> It is usable only in special cases. Other methods are acceptable for choice of <b>internet</b> <b>connection...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of smartphone ability is rapidly increasing the power consumption. Many {{methods have been}} proposed to reduce smartphone power consumption. Most of these methods use the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> control based {{on the availability of}} the battery power level regardless of when and where a waste of energy occurs. This paper proposes a new approach to control the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> based on idle time using user behavior pattern analysis. User behavior patterns are used to predict idle time duration. <b>Internet</b> <b>connection</b> control performed during idle time. During idle time <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> periodically switched on and off by a certain time interval. This method effectively reduces a waste of energy. Control of the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> does not interfere the user because it is implemented on idle time.

50|$|Attacks to {{the user}} network, or {{internet}} provider can disrupt or even cut the connection. Since VOIP is highly dependent on our <b>internet</b> <b>connection,</b> direct attacks on the <b>internet</b> <b>connection,</b> or provider, are highly effective way of attack. This kind of attacks are targeting office telephony, since mobile internet is harder to interrupt. Also mobile applications not relying on <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> to make VOIP calls. are immune to such attacks.|$|R
