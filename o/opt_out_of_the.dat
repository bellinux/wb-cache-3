5|$|In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius {{decided on}} June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court {{ruled that the}} {{individual}} mandate was constitutional when the associated penalties were construed as a tax. The decision allowed states to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medicaid expansion. Several did so, although some later accepted the expansion.|$|E
5|$|This {{estimate}} was made {{prior to the}} Supreme Court's ruling that enabled states to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medicaid expansion, thereby forgoing the related federal funding.

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{the owners}} decided to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1993 arrangement, per the {{agreement}} with the players, with the termination to follow a year with no salary cap in 2010. By the CBA's expiration in March 2011, the NFLPA and the NFL had not yet come to terms on a new agreement. The owners were expected to lock out the players upon termination of the agreement. However, the NFLPA filed papers to decertify as a union on March 11, 2011, and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the lockout with lead plaintiffs quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees. U.S. District Court judge Susan Richard Nelson granted the players' request to end the owners' lockout on April 25. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while they appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Nelson refused. On April 29, the Eighth Circuit granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated the lockout the same day. The Eighth Circuit vacated Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming {{the legitimacy of the}} lockout. During the lockout, players were barred from using team facilities and contacting team coaches; many organized their own workout regimens.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

25|$|The rules {{may create}} social {{problems}} in some situations, {{especially for the}} widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the yibbum obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need {{to wait until the}} brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriage. The widow would not know if the brother would even <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriage. Furthermore, in either event, by that stage the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, there is no time limit on the indication of the brother's intention as to whether he will proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother may already be married.|$|E

25|$|On January 15, Boras {{completed}} a three-year, $35 million contract for Rafael Soriano to pitch for the New York Yankees. The deal is notable for Soriano's right to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract following each season, effectively giving Soriano {{the power to}} leave the Yankees and seek a larger contract elsewhere without sacrificing the full guaranteed value should he suffer injury or poor performance. Soriano would use this to opt out following the 2012 season.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2006 season, Boras advised J. D.

Boras then negotiated a five-year, $70 million contract for Drew with the Boston Red Sox. The contract was not finalized until January 26, 2007, because Boras and the Red Sox had to develop special contract language regarding potential injury to Drew's shoulder. Drew had the shoulder surgically repaired earlier in his career.|$|E

They desired the new constitution to proclaim {{the existence of a}} single 'Irish nation', and the theoretical right of the state to encompass the whole island, while for reasons of pragmatism recognising the de facto reality of partition. What emerged in 1937 was a delicately worded legal balancing act.|$|E
25|$|On December 10, Boras {{completed}} a six-year, $36 million contract for Hyun-Jin Ryu with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ryu had been pitching for the Hanwha Eagles in Korea, and the Dodgers paid $25.7 {{million for the}} exclusive right to sign him. Ryu's contract also contains innings bonuses worth up to $1 million per year, and other salary escalators.
