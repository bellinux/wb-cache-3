50|$|In {{addition}} to 3D cell focusing, acoustic tweezers {{can also be}} used as a unit for cell sorting. A schematic of SSAW-based, on-chip, multichannel cell-sorting technique is shown in Fig. 12, which takes advantages of the tunability offered by chirped interdigital transducers (IDTs). The SSAW-based sorting method manipulates the objects (i.e., cells, particles, and droplets) directly by the acoustic radiation force with excellent controllability and a large range of translation, which renders it capable of precisely sorting cells into a great number (e.g., five) of <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> in a single step. This is a major advantage over most existing sorting methods, which typically only sort cells into two <b>outlet</b> <b>channels.</b> This approach is simple, versatile, and compact, that can be valuable in many chemical or biological analytical processes to facilitate the development of micro total analysis systems (μTAS).|$|R

As the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, lower <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> were exposed. The lake levels at any given time were constrained by the elevation of the lowest drainage channel. As Glacial Lake Bassano, and the proglacial lake system as a whole developed, throughflow in individual channels waxed, waned and reversed, depending on the systemic controls.|$|R

40|$|Liquid fed direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} have drawn increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, a liquid fed direct methanol fuel cell with transparent window {{was designed and}} fabricated for visual investigations of carbon dioxide bubbles behaviour and two-phase flow characteristics in anode interdigital flow bed under different operating conditions. The experimental {{results showed that the}} electrochemical reaction and two-phase flow interacted each other. The gas void fraction of carbon dioxide gas and mean size of CO 2 bubbles increased with increase in current density, as well as cell temperature. The two-phase flow patterns in the interdigital flow bed are different from the phenomena in parallel channels flow bed and serpentine channel flow bed. There were gas columns in the inlet channels. The two-phase flow in <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> was bubbly flow. Slug flow was not observed in <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> of interdigital flow bed. The typical flow pattern in outlet manifold is slug flow. But bubbly flow and slug flow coexisted in the outlet manifold at low temperature. The effect of input flow rate of methanol solution was also studied. High flow rate was helpful for removal of carbon dioxide bubbles from flow bed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulation of a novel passive micromixer The micromixer consists of two inlet tanks, one mixing <b>channel</b> and two <b>outlet</b> <b>channels.</b> In order to maximise the mixing efficiency, the following considerations are made : (i) The inlet tanks are followed {{by a series of}} microchannels, in which the flow is split. The microchannels are arranged in an interdigital manner to maximise the contact area between the two flows. (ii) The microchannels attached to the lower inlet tank have an upward slope while those attached to the upper tank have a downward slope. The higher-density flow is fed to the lower inlet tank and gets an upward velocity before entering the mixing channel. (iii) Two triangular barriers are placed within the mixing channel to impose chaotic advection and perturb the less-mixed flow along the top and bottom surfaces of the channel. (ii) Finally, two <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> are incorporated to discard the less-mixed flow Three-dimensional simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the micromixer Simulations are performed in the absence and presence of the gravitational force to analyse the influence of gravity on the micromixer. Mixing efficiencies of greater than 92 % are achieved using water and a low-density biological solvent as the mixing fluid...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of fluidic switching and mixing, performed in microfluidic channels, integrated with micromachined acoustic transducers. The transducers operate at 400 MHz while the microfluidic channels are made by casting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on silicon moulds. Rapid switching is incorporated by applying pressure waves in one of the two <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> to get preferential flow. Radiation pressure is also utilized to obtain active mixing of fluids within the channel. This method of switching and mixing has the advantages of simple design and ease of integration into larger systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} platform {{developed for}} quantifying {{the dependence of}} erythrocyte (red blood cell, RBC) responses by ABO-Rh blood type via direct current insulator dielectrophoresis (DC-iDEP) is presented. The PDMS DC-iDEP device utilized a 400 × 170 [*]μm 2 rectangular insulating obstacle embedded in a 1. 46 -cm long, 200 -μm wide inlet channel to create spatial non-uniformities in direct current (DC) electric field density realized by separation into four <b>outlet</b> <b>channels.</b> The DC-iDEP flow behaviors were investigated for all eight blood types (A+, A−, B+, B−, AB+, AB−, O+, O−) in the human ABO-Rh blood typing system. Three independent donors of each blood type, same donor reproducibility, different conductivity buffers (0. 52 – 9. 1 [*]mS/cm), and DC electric fields (17. 1 – 68. 5 [*]V/cm) were tested to investigate separation dependencies. The data analysis was conducted from image intensity profiles across inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>channels</b> in the device. Individual channel fractions suggest that the dielectrophoretic force experienced by the cells is dependent on erythrocyte antigen expression. Two different statistical analysis methods were conducted to determine how distinguishable a single blood type was from the others. Results indicate that channel fraction distributions differ by ABO-Rh blood types suggesting that antigens present on the erythrocyte membrane polarize differently in DC-iDEP fields. Under optimized conductivity and field conditions, certain blind blood samples could be sorted with low misclassification rates...|$|R
