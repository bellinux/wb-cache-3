First, we introduce a methodology to identify transient merging and detect implicit permanent merging. Second, we propose an efficient routing protocol between merging networks while in the transient state. Our approach is completely distributed and incurs low routing control overhead. We also investigate a solution to prevent respective intra-network communications from interfering...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} fast {{algorithm}} for the Admixture of Poisson MRFs (APM) topic model [1] and propose a novel metric to directly evaluate this model. The APM topic model recently introduced by Inouye et al. [1] {{is the first}} topic model that allows for word dependencies within each <b>topic</b> unlike in <b>previous</b> <b>topic</b> models like LDA that assume independence between words within a topic. Research in both the semantic coherence of a topic models [2, 3, 4, 5] and measures of model fitness [6] provide strong support that explicitly modeling word dependencies—as in APM—could be both semantically meaningful and essential for appropriately modeling real text data. Though APM shows significant promise for providing a better topic model, APM has a high computational complexity because O(p 2) parameters must be estimated where p {{is the number of}} words ([1] could only provide results for datasets with p = 200). In light of this, we develop a paral-lel alternating Newton-like algorithm for training the APM model that can han-dle p = 104 as an important step towards scaling to large datasets. In addition, Inouye et al. [1] only provided tentative and inconclusive results on the utility of APM. Thus, motivated by simple intuitions and <b>previous</b> evaluations of <b>topic</b> models, we propose a novel evaluation metric based on human evocation scores between word pairs (i. e. how much one word “brings to mind ” another word [7]). We provide compelling quantitative and qualitative results on the BNC corpus that demonstrate the superiority of APM over <b>previous</b> <b>topic</b> models for identi-fying semantically meaningful word dependencies.
