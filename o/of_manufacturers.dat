5|$|During 1960, {{the list}} <b>of</b> <b>manufacturers</b> {{planning}} to build COBOL compilers grew. By September, five more manufacturers had joined CODASYL (Bendix, Control Data Corporation, General Electric (GE), National Cash Register and Philco), and all represented manufacturers had announced COBOL compilers.

5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) {{was formed}} in 1989 as a project {{under the auspices of}} the National Association <b>of</b> <b>Manufacturers.</b> The GCC was formed to {{represent}} the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming, and to challenge the science behind global warming. Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA climatologist James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association <b>of</b> <b>Manufacturers,</b> Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E

40|$|The article {{explores the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer</b> brand {{innovation}} on retailer brands in grocery product categories, drawing on literature from category management, power and product innovation. It {{is argued that}} the consumer packaged goods literature has largely portrayed manufacturer brand innovation in relation to retailer brands as a competitive tool that is employed against the retailer brands. The alternative view <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer</b> brand innovation as an enhancer of retailer brands has not been fully addressed academically. The article further argues that aspects <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer</b> brand innovation that enhance retailer brands have relevance for the determination of strategic policies that govern the coexistence of {{the two types of}} brands in supermarket categories. The paper offers a fresh perspective in explaining the coexistence <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer</b> brands and retailer brands in grocery retail categories. Aspects <b>of</b> <b>manufacturer</b> brand innovation that positively impact on the welfare of retailer brands play a strategic role...|$|R

5|$|There {{were four}} classes when the {{championship}} started in 1949; 500cc, 350cc, 250cc and 125cc. The 50cc class {{was introduced in}} the 1962 season. Due to escalating costs that resulted in a number <b>of</b> <b>manufacturers</b> leaving the championship, the FIM limited the 50cc bikes to a single cylinder, the 125cc and 250cc bikes were limited to two cylinders and the 350cc and 500cc bikes were limited to four cylinders. The 350cc class was discontinued in 1982; two years later the 50cc class was replaced with an 80cc class, which was discontinued in 1989. In 2002, 990cc bikes replaced the 500c bikes and the class was renamed as MotoGP. 600cc bikes replaced the 250cc bikes in the 2010 season, with the class re-branded as Moto2.|$|E
