25|$|Before {{putting on}} the dry suit, the male diver puts on a condom catheter, {{which is similar to}} a condom except that it is made of thicker {{material}} with a cuff or adhesive ring to prevent it from slipping off, and its end connects to a built-on drain tube. After putting it on, he attaches the end of the tube to a drain hose in the crotch of the suit. This hose leads to a fitting through the front of one thigh of the suit, either with a screw-down <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> (P-valve), opened for use, or a non-return valve to prevent water from flowing back in if the hose gets disconnected. There may also be a non-return equalisation valve allowing gas from inside the suit to flow into the hose to avoid squeeze during descent The female diver puts on an external catching device {{in the form of a}} wide-rimmed, low-profile, elongated cup. The rim is affixed onto the skin surrounding the labia with medical grade glue. The cup's outlet connects to the drain hose with similar fitting on the suit.|$|E
2500|$|This {{system uses}} water main {{pressure}} to pre-pressurize a plastic tank located inside [...] what otherwise {{appears to be}} the more typical ceramic flush tank. A flush cycle begins each time a user flushes the bowl. After a user flushes and the water in the pre-pressurized tank has finished emptying into the bowl, the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> in the plastic tank shuts. Then the high pressure water from the main refills the plastic tank. Inside the tank is an air-filled balloon-like rubber diaphragm. As the higher-pressure mains water enters the tank, the rubber diaphragm is also pressurized and shrinks accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|This {{reaction}} is very [...] exothermic, and the released energy raises {{the temperature of}} the mixture to near 100°C, vaporizing about a fifth of it. The resultant pressure buildup forces the entrance valves from the reactant storage chambers to close, thus protecting the beetle's internal organs. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid is expelled violently through an <b>outlet</b> <b>valve,</b> with a loud popping sound. The beetles' glands store enough hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide to allow the beetle to release its chemical spray roughly 20 times. In some cases this is enough to kill a predator. The main component of the beetle spray is 1,4-Benzoquinone, which is particularly irritating to the eyes and the respiratory system.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} is a sorbent-based atmosphere revitalization (SBAR) system using treatment beds each {{having a}} bed housing, {{primary and secondary}} moisture adsorbent layers, and a primary carbon dioxide adsorbent layer. Each bed includes a redirecting plenum between moisture adsorbent layers, inlet and outlet ports connected to inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves,</b> respectively, and bypass ports connected to the redirecting plenums. The SBAR system also includes at least one bypass valve connected to the bypass ports. An inlet channel connects inlet valves to an atmosphere source. An outlet channel connects the bypass <b>valve</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> to the atmosphere source. A vacuum channel connects inlet valves, the bypass <b>valve</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> to a vacuum source. In use, one bed treats air from the atmosphere source while another bed undergoes regeneration. During regeneration, the inlet, bypass, and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> sequentially open to the vacuum source, removing accumulated moisture and carbon dioxide...|$|R
50|$|Valve and Pump SystemsThe {{main parts}} which {{are part of}} the {{pressure}} modulation system are solenoid inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves,</b> a pump, motor and accumulators/reservoirs. The number of the valves differs from model to model due to additional functionalities and the number of brake channels. Based on the input of the ECU, coils operate the in- and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b> During pressure release the brake fluid is stored in accumulators. In this open system approach the fluid is then brought back in the brake circuit via a pump operated by a motor which is felt through pulsation on the brake lever.|$|R
50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} piston {{internal combustion engine}} the water jacket {{is a series of}} holes either cast or bored through the main engine block and connected by inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> to a radiator.|$|R
50|$|Inhalation will {{decrease}} the bellows angle, which reduces the spring loading, {{and the internal}} pressure in the dosage chamber will lift the diaphragm against the spring, opening the dosage <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> and allowing the gas to flow into the breathing circuit until the pressure in the dosage chamber is matched by the spring force, and the diaphragm is pushed back against the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> to close it.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the fourth}} stage the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> opens and the [...] "clean" [...] {{supernatant}} liquor exits the tank.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the chamber}} empties, the presurant valve closes and the inlet valve opens, {{followed}} by the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{backward}} flow of piezoelectric pumps, this paper presents a single-active-chamber piezoelectric membrane pump with multiple passive check valves. Under the condition of a fixed total number of passive check valves, by means of changing the inlet <b>valves</b> and <b>outlet</b> valves’ configuration, the pumping characteristics in terms of flow rate and backpressure are experimentally investigated. Like the maximum flow rate and backpressure, the testing {{results show that the}} optimal frequencies are significantly affected by changes in the number inlet <b>valves</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b> The variation ratios of the maximum flow rate and the maximum backpressure are up to 66 % and less than 20 %, respectively. Furthermore, the piezoelectric pump generally demonstrates very similar flow rate and backpressure characteristics when the number of inlet valves in one kind of configuration is {{the same as that of}} <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> in another configuration. The comparison indicates that the backflow from the pumping chamber to inlet is basically the same as the backflow from the outlet to the pumping chamber. No matter whether the number of inlet valves or the number of <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> is increased, the backflow can be effectively reduced. In addition, the backpressure fluctuation can be significantly suppressed with an increase of either inlet <b>valves</b> or <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b> It also means that the pump can prevent the backflow more effectively at the cost of power consumption. The pump is very suitable for conditions where more accurate flow rates are needed and wear and fatigue of check valves often occur...|$|R
50|$|In {{a poorly}} {{designed}} autoclave, oscillation {{of the pressure}} can result in chattering of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b> One means of preventing this is utilizing large valves for filling and dumping and small valves for trimming at and near the setpoint. Alternatively, modulating valves will avoid this phenomenon.|$|R
50|$|A major {{flood in}} 1974 eroded unweathered granite from an unlined {{spillway}} discharge channel which then {{resulted in the}} destruction of a penstock to the Burrinjuck Power Station. The <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> of the dam were also destroyed during the same flood. These events prompted a review of the safety of the dam which recommended a new remedial works program.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inlet valve}} closes, the outlet and {{pressurant}} valves open. The presurant forces the fluid through the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|The water <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> was {{controlled}} by a rod from the bottom chamber. This {{was used by the}} engine's driver to control the working speed, according to the work required.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the flow}} has stopped, the booster is started, {{and as the}} piston withdraws along the cylinder, {{increasing}} the volume between the cylinder head and the piston crown, the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing {{the volume of the}} space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient to overcome the pressure in the outlet line and the opening pressure of the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve.</b> At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> and port.|$|E
50|$|Airless pumps can be {{powered by}} {{different}} types of motor: electric, compressed air (pneumatic) or hydraulic. Most have a paint pump (also called a lower) that is a double acting piston, in which the piston pumps the paint in both the down and the upstroke. Some airless pumps have a diaphragm instead of a piston, but both types have inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The DCSC {{controls}} the feed gas {{pressure in the}} dosage chamber by changes of bellows angle, which {{is proportional to the}} change in volume in the loop. A mechanical linkage connects the bellows cover plate to an oscillating cam which controls loading of the diaphragm spring. The spring force controls a diaphragm in the dosage regulator which actuates the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{bicycle tire}} pump, like many {{mechanical}} devices, contains several structural {{features that are}} hidden or invisible and must be inferred from {{the function of the}} pump. For the bicycle pump the invisible features are the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> and the three phases of movement of air, entering the pump, moving through the pump, exiting the pump. Each feature received 1 point for a total of 5 possible points.|$|R
50|$|In a force pump, the {{upstroke}} of {{the piston}} draws water, through an inlet valve, into the cylinder. On the downstroke, {{the water is}} discharged, through an <b>outlet</b> <b>valve,</b> into the outlet pipe.|$|E
5000|$|As per the M20, the M21 is water-cooled, has a {{cast iron}} block and a SOHC valvetrain. The {{camshaft}} {{is driven by}} a belt, each cylinder has one inlet and one <b>outlet</b> <b>valve.</b> Compared to the M20, the M21 has reinforced connecting-rods, cylinder heads, pistons, valves and a reinforced crankshaft with seven bearings.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} in the early 1930s for Bellinzona Guest House, which was {{operated}} by the Zelman'a, prominent Swiss Italian settlers. The pool is created by a concrete weir and drystone walling of a natural basin in Spring Creek, and is surrounded by terraced drystone seating. The weir features an <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> which ensures environmental flows into Spring Creek.|$|E
50|$|Heart valves are {{essentially}} inlet and <b>outlet</b> check <b>valves</b> {{for the heart}} ventricles, since the ventricles act as pumps.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{is used to}} operate the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> of {{reciprocating}} steam locomotives. It uses a rocking sector whose motion is driven via a link from a crankpin between the coupling and connecting rods. The ends of this link are circular and offset from the pivots. On these circular bosses the sector is oscillated by a second link from the rod to an extension {{to the rear of}} the sector.|$|R
50|$|The VL I was a V-12 liquid-cooled {{four-stroke}} Otto cycle engine, {{with individual}} {{grey cast iron}} cylinders, with a cylinder bore of 140 mm, piston stroke of 180 mm, and displacement of 33.255 L. The crankshaft was supported in roller-bearings and was fitted with a vibration damper for smooth operation. The overhead valves, one large inlet valve and two smaller <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> per cylinder, were operated by a camshaft running between the cylinder banks, operating the valves with tappets, pushrods and rocker arms.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} presses the brake pedal - or when ESP {{intervenes}} {{to stabilize the}} vehicle - the SBC control unit calculates the desired target brake pressures on each individual wheel. Through the use of independent pressure modulators the system regulates the hydraulic pressure at each wheel. These four pressure modulators consist of one inlet and one <b>outlet</b> <b>valve,</b> controlled by electronic output stages.|$|E
5000|$|Piston-driven {{metering}} pumps commonly work as follows: There is a piston (sometimes called plunger), typically cylindrical, which {{can go in}} and out of a correspondingly shaped chamber in the pump head. The inlet and outlet lines are joined to the piston chamber. There are two check valves, often ball check valves, attached to the pump head, one at the inlet line and the other at the outlet line. The inlet valve allows flow from the inlet line to the piston chamber, but not in the reverse direction. The <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> allows flow from the chamber to the outlet line, but not in reverse. The motor repeatedly moves the piston into and out of the piston chamber, causing the volume of the chamber to repeatedly become smaller and larger. When the piston moves out, a vacuum is created. Low pressure in the chamber causes liquid to enter and fill the chamber through the inlet check valve, but higher pressure at the outlet causes the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> to shut. Then when the piston moves in, it pressurizes the liquid in the chamber. High pressure in the chamber causes the inlet valve to shut and forces the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> to open, forcing liquid out at the outlet. These alternating suction and discharge strokes are repeated over and over to meter the liquid. In back of the chamber, there is packing around the piston or a doughnut-shaped seal with a toroid-shaped sphincter-like spring inside compressing the seal around the piston. This holds the fluid pressure when the piston slides in and out and makes the pump leak-tight. The packing or seals can wear out after prolonged use and can be replaced. The metering rate can be adjusted by varying the strokelength by which the piston moves back and forth or varying the speed of the piston motion.|$|E
50|$|The regular {{discharge}} {{time for a}} tanker of 8 - 9 m³ is about 15 minutes (or 7-10 minutes to unload a tanker of 4000 liters). The outlet is typically 4 to 6 inch cm in diameter. The {{discharge time}} depends on {{the thickness of the}} sludge, the size of the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> and hose, the amount of garbage in the fecal sludge and how often the driver has to stop to clean the dump screen.|$|E
50|$|Laanecoorie Weir or Laanecoorie Reservoir, is a {{water storage}} for {{irrigation}} and domestic purposes on the Loddon River, near {{the towns of}} Laanecoorie, Victoria and Eddington, Victoria. It was designed by construction engineer Andrew O'Keefe (engineer) (died 1904) in conjunction with Joshua Thomas Noble Anderson. This was the second irrigation scheme for Victoria after the Goulburn Weir. Construction commenced in 1889 and took three years to complete. The largest <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> in Victoria, manufactured by the United Iron Work of Abraham Roberts, were installed at the weir in 1891.|$|R
50|$|Rotary {{pumps are}} driven by a {{crankshaft}} that is rotated by handles on two flywheels attached {{to the ends of}} the shaft on each side of the pump. Rotary pumps can be built with two and three cylinders, and are operated by a team of two men. Pistons attached to the crankshaft draw in air through the inlet valves and then pump it through the <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> to an air hose which delivers the air to the helmet of the diver. Cylinders, <b>valves</b> and <b>outlet</b> fittings for air are generally made from brass for corrosion resistance in the marine environment.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the above, a dual-mode exhaust package with a bypass on acceleration was available on C6 Corvettes. The dual-mode exhaust uses vacuum-actuated <b>outlet</b> <b>valves,</b> which control engine noise during low-load operation, but open for maximum performance during high-load operation. The system {{is similar to the}} C6 Z06, but uses a 2.5 in diameter exhaust compared to the Z06's 3 in. Power is boosted to [...] and 428 lbft Nm with this option. A similar system was optional on later model 5th generation Chevrolet Camaros and standard on the 2016-2017 Chevrolet SS, but no horsepower or torque increases were advertised on those vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The Flying Merkel had a {{conservative}} engine-control system featuring an automatic inlet valve and a pre-set <b>outlet</b> <b>valve.</b> The V-shaped engine initially displaced 884 cc and delivered 6 hp through a two-speed gearbox and a belt, {{and had a}} maximum speed of 97 km/h. A motorsports version without brake was available with a 997 cc motor including roller bearings, Bosch magneto ignition, Schebler carburetor and chain drive. The roadworthy version had a band brake on the rear wheel and was sold for $325 USD.|$|E
50|$|This {{system uses}} water main {{pressure}} to pre-pressurize a plastic tank located inside what otherwise {{appears to be}} the more typical ceramic flush tank. A flush cycle begins each time a user flushes the bowl. After a user flushes and the water in the pre-pressurized tank has finished emptying into the bowl, the <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> in the plastic tank shuts. Then the high pressure water from the main refills the plastic tank. Inside the tank is an air-filled balloon-like rubber diaphragm. As the higher-pressure mains water enters the tank, the rubber diaphragm is also pressurized and shrinks accordingly.|$|E
50|$|The {{bombardier beetle}} has a device which {{allows it to}} shoot {{corrosive}} and foul-smelling bubbles at its enemies. The beetle produces and stores hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, in two separate reservoirs in the rear tip of its abdomen. When threatened, the beetle contracts muscles that force the two reactants through valved tubes into a mixing chamber containing water and a mixture of catalytic enzymes. When combined, the reactants undergo a violent exothermic chemical reaction, raising the temperature to near the boiling point of water. The boiling, foul-smelling liquid partially becomes a gas (flash evaporation) and is expelled through an <b>outlet</b> <b>valve</b> with a loud popping sound.|$|E
50|$|A {{spillway}} {{is located}} {{at the top of the}} reservoir pool. Dams may also have bottom <b>outlets</b> with <b>valves</b> or gates which may be operated to release flood flow, and a few dams lack overflow spillways and rely entirely on bottom outlets.|$|R
5000|$|The fluid {{enters and}} fills the chamber {{from the inlet}} <b>valve.</b> The <b>outlet</b> and {{pressurant}} <b>valves</b> are closed.|$|R
25|$|With {{the tunnel}} cleared, it was resurfaced and {{modified}} {{to accommodate the}} force of a river instead of a railroad. Until this time, the Sacramento had still been flowing through the middle of the dam site, between the two nearly completed abutments of the dam. An earth/rock filled cofferdam was constructed across the river, which now began to flow through the tunnel, drying out the dam site and enabling work to begin on the middle section of the dam, which contained the spillway bays. The spillways with their 18 high-pressure river <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> and massive triple drum gates were completed in the summer of 1943. By then, a total of 15 million tons of concrete had been used in the dam's construction, comprising the 16,900 50-foot blocks.|$|R
