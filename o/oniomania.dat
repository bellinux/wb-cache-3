50|$|Researchers at Melbourne University have {{advocated}} its classification as a psychological disorder called <b>oniomania</b> or compulsive shopping disorder.|$|E
50|$|Social {{conditions}} {{also play}} an important role in <b>oniomania,</b> the rise of consumer culture contributing to the view of compulsive buying as a specifically postmodern addiction.|$|E
50|$|What differentiates <b>oniomania</b> from healthy {{shopping}} is the compulsive, destructive and chronic {{nature of the}} buying. Where shopping can be a positive route to self-expression, in excess it represents a dangerous threat.|$|E
50|$|Readily {{available}} {{credit cards}} enable casual spending beyond one's means, and some {{would suggest that}} the compulsive buyer should lock up or destroy credit cards altogether. Online shopping also facilitates <b>oniomania,</b> with online auction addiction, used to escape feelings of depression or guilt, becoming a recognisable problem.|$|E
50|$|Emil Kraepelin {{originally}} described <b>oniomania</b> over {{a century}} ago, and he and Bleuler 1924 both included the syndrome in their influential early psychiatric textbooks. However, little interest was taken in CB until the 1990s, {{and even in the}} 21st century compulsive shopping can be considered a barely recognised mental illness.|$|E

5000|$|The {{consequences}} of <b>oniomania,</b> which may persist long after a spree, can be devastating, with marriages, long-term relationships, and jobs all feeling the strain. Further problems can include ruined credit history, theft or defalcation of money, defaulted loans, general financial trouble {{and in some}} cases bankruptcy or extreme debt, as well as anxiety and a sense of life spiraling out of control. [...] The resulting stress can lead to physical health problems and ruined relationships, or even suicide.|$|E
5000|$|Compulsive buying {{disorder}} (CBD), or <b>oniomania</b> (from Greek ὤνιος ṓnios [...] "for sale" [...] and μανία manía [...] "insanity"), {{is characterized}} by an obsession with shopping and buying behavior that causes adverse consequences. According to Kellett and Bolton, compulsive buying [...] "is experienced as an irresistible-uncontrollable urge, resulting in excessive, expensive and time-consuming retail activity is typically prompted by negative affectivity" [...] and results in [...] "gross social, personal and/or financial difficulties". Most people with CBD meet the criteria for a personality disorder. Compulsive shopping may be considered an impulse control disorder, an obsessive-compulsive disorder, a bipolar disorder, or even a clinical addiction, depending on the clinical source.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of Pick's disease include difficulty {{in language and}} thinking, efforts to dissociate from family, behavioral changes, unwarranted anxiety, irrational fears, CBD (Compulsive buying disorder, or <b>oniomania),</b> impaired regulation of social conduct (e.g., breaches of etiquette, vulgar language, tactlessness, , misperception), passivity, low motivation (aboulia), inertia, over-activity, pacing and wandering. It is a characteristic of Pick’s disease that dysfunctional, argumentative, or hostile social conduct is initially exhibited towards family members and not initially exhibited in a workplace or neutral environment. The changes in personality allow doctors to distinguish between Pick's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Pick's disease {{is one of the}} causes of the clinical syndrome of frontotemporal lobar degeneration which has three subtypes. Pick's disease pathology is associated more with the frontotemporal dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia subtypes than the semantic dementia subtype.|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite growing awareness, stigma against {{mentally ill}} {{individuals}} is still prevalent in society. Different labels attached to mental illnesses receive varying amounts of stigma. Moreover, materialistic societies {{have been shown}} to display a more negative outlook towards mentally ill individuals while compulsive disorders in general, elicit more negative attitudes. However, there has been only little research on the impact of materialism and the use of labels attached to mental illnesses, in relation to mental illness stigma. The current study focused on effects of materialism and label attachment on mental illness stigma in relation to perception of two compulsive disorders: <b>oniomania</b> (compulsive shopping) and kleptomania (compulsive stealing). Materials and methods: A multicultural sample of 120 participants was recruited from Knowledge Village, Dubai. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four conditions; <b>oniomania</b> labeled or <b>oniomania</b> non-labeled (questionnaire depicting <b>oniomania</b> with either illness name present or absent), kleptomania labeled or kleptomania non-labeled (questionnaire depicting kleptomania with either illness name present or absent). Materialism and attitudes towards mentally ill individuals were assessed in two self-report questionnaires and participants were requested to watch a video depicting the illness between filling the questionnaires. Results: No significant influence of materialism or labels on mental illness stigma was found, as ps >. 05. However, this study found that illness type appeared to be a stronger predictor of mental illness stigma than the other predictors of materialism and label attachment. Conclusion: This study suggests that stigma can be reduced more effectively by creating awareness of mental illnesses...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{compulsive}} buying, phenomenon which is a current topic for today's society and its incidence is rising. The area of <b>oniomania</b> includes psychological but also social and financial aspects of the disorder. The thesis focuses mainly on the sphere of introduction of <b>oniomania,</b> as a great danger to man and society, especially in the context of financial illiteracy. Enough room is devoted to explication of main key words from the area of addictions (drug addictions and behavioral addictions). Attention has also been dedicated to an important chapter of the issue of gender in context to the pathological shopping and also to topics of getting to know the possibilities of treatment and prevention. The practical part of the thesis deals with research of level of awareness and orientation issues of shopping addiction among university students Using analysis of submitted questionnaires, this part of the thesis tries to find answers to fundamental questions related to the theme of financial literacy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Compulsive buying can be {{characterized}} as an almost irresistible urge to buy various items. Compulsive buying disorder is a subject of growing interest to health professionals. It is a current issue and the prevalence rate in the global population is around 5 to 8 %. Objectives: The main objective {{of this study was to}} identify predictors of compulsive buying in the Brazilian population, assessing possible relationships between compulsive buying, depression and anxiety. Methods: The Richmond Compulsive Buying Scale was administered to screen for compulsive buying and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression in a sample of 359 participants. Pearson coefficients were used to test for correlations. Results: Our study identified an interaction between female gender and compulsion to purchase. Furthermore, people's occupations also appear to have an influence on the problem. We found a correlation between depressive symptoms and <b>oniomania.</b> Conclusion: Our study has certain limitations, such as the difficulty in recruiting individuals with compulsive buying disorder. Since compulsive buying is a phenomenon that is seldom investigated, it therefore remains unidentified. However, this is nevertheless a pioneering paper on the Brazilian population...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis has {{the title}} Social aspects of {{consumerism}} as {{a phenomenon of}} the present time. The theoretical part is divided into five chapters. The introduction chapter is designed as a theoretical framework of the whole thesis. That is why it describes hedonism as the original philosophy, consumer mentality and also the historical-cultural context {{of the development of}} the consumer society. The second chapter is in order to clarify main concepts devoted to terminological definition of consumerism and it also specifies concepts such as consumer society, consumerism etc. The third chapter focuses on aspects of consumer behaviour from marketing perspective, such as the cultural influences, personality determinants of consumers and impact of advertising. To social aspects of consumer behaviour that are the main object of study in this work is devoted the fourth chapter. The last chapter outlines the negative effects associated with consumer society, what involves issues of environmentalism {{in the context of the}} consumer society, further I mention modern forms of addiction (<b>oniomania,</b> shopaholism) and in the conclusion there are considered questions of what happens to our souls in the time of dominant, increasing, consumer thinking. The aim of this work is to map the social aspects of consumerism in the target group aged 30 - 55 years. Considering the methodological point of view, I applied a qualitative approach. Emphasis was placed on methodological triangulation of techniques therefore there were selected two data collection techniques - narrative interview technique (17 respondents) and the technique off standardized questionnaire (20 respondents). Primary data was coded/indexed and processed according to Ritchie and Spencer frame analysis method. In this diploma thesis there were set for research questions. The results show that two-thirds of respondents are aware of the influence that family has on their consumption patterns. Considering the dominance of married couples are decisions about shopping subordinated to traditional gender role - the dominant person is in two-thirds of families by shopping woman. The results also show that almost three quarters of respondents perceive regardless of their own income or education, their own social prestige as a middle-class one. Results also show that in the higher income categories were respondents more open to the influence of environment, their preference in clothing, choice of car and type of housing and lifestyle. The opinions of respondents on the life on loan have been predominantly unified - the vast majority of respondents rated this method of obtaining finance negatively. Characteristic common features in consumer behaviour in a middle class can be seen in a single perception of own social prestige as a middle-class one. Another common feature is a realistic idea related to the increased income that would bring respondents the feeling of happiness. Respondents also share negative attitude to life on the loan. On the basis of framework analysis and data interpretation, there were induced following theoretical concepts...|$|E
