5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white lead was used during Vermeer’s time, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits {{located in the}} Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and {{in the content of}} trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E

"His {{sandwiches}} of ham or {{cheese with}} an extra slice of bread (three slices in all) for fifteen cents were known everywhere for their value. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to make his profit or he could not stay in business and therefore this story was told rather reverently by his employees and other denizens of the Southwest spaces. On his deathbed, instead of mentioning debts or bequests to his relatives, {{he was supposed to}} have murmured, [...] "Cut the ham thinner, boys." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tillman Johnson said, [...] "Whenever he {{came down}} the stairs from his hotel room, he called for the press. He was a showman. He was a {{handsome}} man, I'd say, {{and he made a}} good appearance and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a reputation for being a killer. So the press all followed Gonzaullas." [...] He also said, [...] "No, he didn't do any real police work himself. He'd get in that car and ride around, {{ask a lot of questions}} about what the other officers had found then he'd release it to the press like it was his information. It got to where after a while some officers wouldn't tell him anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{started on}} May 6, 1935 with Chester Lyons as the cinematographer. Freund insisted on Gregg Toland, whom he got for a {{reported}} [...] "8 days of additional photography". Actress Frances Drake recalled difficulty between Freund, Toland and Considine. Drake said that [...] "Freund {{wanted to be}} the cinematographer at the same time", and that [...] "You never knew who was directing. The producer was dying to, to tell you the truth, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no idea of directing." [...] Several titles for the film were announced, and on May 22, 1935, MGM announced that the title would be The Hands of Orlac. The Mad Doctor of Paris was also suggested, but the studio eventually settled on the original title of Mad Love. Shooting finished on June 8, 1935, one week over schedule. After the initial release, MGM cut about fifteen minutes of scenes from the film. Cut scenes included the surgery to get Rollo's hands, a pre-credit warning scene similar to the one in Frankenstein, and Isabel Jewell's entire portrayal of the character Marianne.|$|E
2500|$|For {{more than}} half a century Sir Neville Cardus was the undisputed king of cricket writing. His style {{influenced}} more than one generation of cricket writers. Moorhouse was no exception. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a few things in common with the great Cardus: they both came from North-West England, Cardus from Manchester, Moorhouse from Bolton, both spent a considerable amount of their professional career at the Manchester Guardian, and most importantly, both greatly loved the game of cricket. [...] The greatest thing about this book is that Moorhouse covers the matches as a cricket writer, not as a cricket reporter, and the difference can be enormous. Following the style of the great man, Moorhouse cares less about the statistics (although the scorecards are provided in details at the end of every match report). Instead, in the spirit of Cardus, he gives characters to the players, describes the scenario, talks about the past heroes of cricket, and even talks about his own emotions. He starts “The Roses Match” recollecting his family connection with the Red Roses. Wherever he goes, he tries to fathom the spirit of the particular match. Thus, this book describes the spirit of the game more than anything else.|$|E

6000|$|... "Smart young fellow," [...] {{he said to}} himself. [...] "Got {{into some}} scrape at home, I suppose, and run away. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> some got-up lie ready. Well, sergeant, what is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{had volunteered}} into the {{national}} guard, when I came last through Dijon; and was hard at work, drilling them. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his old rank of captain." ...|$|E

6000|$|...

60|$|She pitied him sincerely. So, he had {{not told}} his uncle the news, yet! <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{scarcely}} had time. Saunders must have given him the note as he was going up to dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing at all, {{except as}} to the accumulations in his absence. He {{mentioned}} vaguely {{that he was a}} wealthy man. I thought that, as a matter <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> told his brother all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said hurriedly, [...] "I {{knew what}} you would say; it was against the Queen's Regulations--and--there was his {{sensitive}} nature which shrinks from even a harsh word; but I did it, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> me in his power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I blame myself for," [...] said my father, [...] "is that I didn't {{see through}} him before. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{been making a}} mere tool of me from the beginning. I ought to have seen through him. Why didn't I?" ...|$|R
