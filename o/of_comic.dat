5|$|The {{character}} {{was a popular}} comic book figure during the Silver Age <b>of</b> <b>Comic</b> Books, due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age <b>of</b> <b>Comic</b> Books under the Birds of Prey publication and as a disabled icon.

The events of The Killing Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership.

5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} <b>of</b> <b>comic</b> strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing {{to the work of}} artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval <b>of</b> <b>comic</b> book content.

Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E
