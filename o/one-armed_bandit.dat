2500|$|After 1975, Gaidai {{went into}} a period of {{significant}} decline; his only other notable work was a joint Soviet-Finnish film Borrowing Matchsticks ( [...] ; [...] ), completed in 1980. After {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, he directed only one more movie, capitalizing on the early Perestroika business activities and starring Dmitry Kharatyan. Gaidai has a cameo in the final one, There's Good Weather in Deribasovskaya, where he plays an old gambler who tries to beat the <b>one-armed</b> <b>bandit.</b> In real life, Gaidai was addicted to gambling. These proved the most popular of his works filmed after 1975 but lacked the success of his earlier work. Gaidai was made a People's Artist of the USSR several months before the Union's demise and died in Moscow on Friday November 19, 1993. He was buried at the Kuntsevo Cemetery.|$|E

In November 1940 during the Second World War {{he was appointed}} Officer Commanding No. 50 Squadron in which role he earned the Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross {{before moving on to}} become Station Commander at RAF Syerston in April 1942. While working as station commander at RAF Syerston he rushed in a fire truck from the control tower to a taxiing Lancaster bomber when he saw it was on fire. He then tried to remove incendiary bombs from under the bomb bay in the hope that he could prevent a [...] bomb from exploding, but it detonated and he lost his right arm as a result. Returning to active service with an artificial arm, he was referred to by personnel as the <b>one-armed</b> <b>bandit.</b> In February 1945 he was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer at Headquarters No. 4 Group and went on to receive the Croix de Guerre and Légion d'Honneur.|$|E

Machines commonly have three reels, but can be found with four or five reels with around sixteen to twenty-four symbols printed around them. The reels are spun each play, and if certain combinations of symbols appear then winnings are paid by the machine, or a subgame is played. These games often have many extra features, trails and subgames with opportunities to win money; usually more than can be won from just the payouts on the reel combinations.|$|R

50|$|A {{slot machine}} (American English), informally fruit machine (British English), puggy (Scottish English slang), the slots (Canadian and American English), poker machine (or pokies in slang) (Australian English and New Zealand English) or simply slot (American English), is a casino {{gambling}} machine {{with three or}} more reels which spin when a button is pushed. Slot machines are also known as <b>one-armed</b> <b>bandits</b> because they were originally operated by one lever {{on the side of}} the machine as distinct from a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the player in debt and impoverished. Many modern machines are still equipped with a legacy lever in addition to the button.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWith {{the aim of}} validating {{the three}} {{pathways}} hypothesis of pathological gambling (Blaszczynski and Nower in Addiction 97 : 487 - 499, 2002) 372 pathological gamblers meeting DSM IV (2000) criteria were assessed via a structured clinical interview {{as well as being}} subjected to personality tests and evaluation of their gambling practices. Our results show {{that it is possible to}} identify three subgroups corresponding to the three pathways: behaviourally conditioned problem gamblers, emotionally vulnerable problem gamblers and antisocial impulsivist problem gamblers. Our results particularly demonstrate that impulsivist gamblers preferentially choose semi-skilful gambling (horse racing and sports gambling) whereas emotionally vulnerable gamblers are significantly more attracted to games of chance (<b>one-armed</b> <b>bandits,</b> scratch cards, etc.) This led us to propose a functional presentation of the three pathways model which differs somewhat from the Blaszczynski and Nower presentation...|$|R
40|$|Is the {{research}} process an “unbeatable” game, where the odds are always against the student? We see our students sitting blankly in front of computer screens, dropping search terms into databases like coins into <b>one-armed</b> <b>bandits,</b> hoping for the jackpot—full-text articles on their subject seemingly elusive as three cherries in a row. Games generally have a learning curve—the more you play, the better you become. Increasingly, however, gamers turn to tips and tricks resources for shortcuts, strategies and cheat codes that can give them the edge and propel them to the next level. When it comes to research, the stakes for students are often too high for them to invest {{the time it takes}} to master the challenges in the library, but where are the accompanying guides to help them through the tough parts? Library Secrets! is a developing Tips, Tricks and Hints project designed to provide students with the cheat codes to the library—all the information that is already there, imbedded in thickly worded database instructions, dull small type on the policies page, hidden in dusty manuals, but in manageable pieces, like a helpful suggestion passed surreptitiously outside the bookie’s window: “here’s the horse to put your money on, don’t waste your time with the others”. Library Secrets! incorporates social software applications to create a collaborative venue for discussing library research, sharing tips and gloating about successes when users have cashed their chips at the end of the process. Part of the “gamble” on the library’s end is predicting how and if students will take to these new technologies.

40|$|A restless bandit is used {{to model}} a user's {{interest}} in a topic or item. The interest evolves as a Markov chain whose transition probabilities depend on the action (display the ad or desist) in a time step. A unit reward is obtained if the ad is displayed and if the user clicks on the ad. If no ad is displayed then a fixed reward is assumed. The probability of click-through {{is determined by the}} state of the Markov chain. The recommender never gets to observe the state but in each time step it has a belief, denoted by pi(t); {{about the state of the}} Markov chain. pi(t) evolves as a function of the action and the signal from each state. For the <b>one-armed</b> restless <b>bandit</b> with two states, we characterize the policy that maximizes the infinite horizon discounted reward. We first characterize the value function as a function of the system parameters and then characterize the optimal policies for different ranges of the parameters. We will see that the Gilbert-Elliot channel in which the two states have different success probabilities becomes a special case. For one special case, we argue that the optimal policy is of the threshold type with one threshold; extensive numerical results indicate that this may be true in general...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{sequential}} decision-making {{in humans}} frequently find suboptimal performance relative to an ideal actor that has perfect {{knowledge of the}} model of how rewards and events are generated in the environment. Rather than being suboptimal, we argue that the learning problem humans face is more complex, in that it also involves learning the structure of reward generation in the environment. We formulate the problem of structure learning in sequential decision tasks using Bayesian reinforcement learning, and show that learning the generative model for rewards qualitatively changes the behavior of an optimal learning agent. To test whether people exhibit structure learning, we performed experiments involving a mixture of <b>one-armed</b> and two-armed <b>bandit</b> reward models, where structure learning produces many of the qualitative behaviors deemed suboptimal in previous studies. Our results demonstrate humans can perform structure learning in a near-optimal manner...|$|R
40|$|Multi-Armed bandit {{problem is}} a classic example of the {{exploration}} vs. exploitation dilemma in which a collection of <b>one-armed</b> <b>bandits,</b> each with unknown but fixed reward probability, is given. The key idea is to develop a strategy, which results in the arm with the highest reward probability to be played such that the total reward obtained is maximized. Although seemingly a simplistic problem, solution strategies are important because of their wide applicability in a myriad of areas such as adaptive routing, resource allocation, clinical trials, and more recently in the area of online recommendation of news articles, advertisements, coupons, etc. to name a few. In this dissertation, we present different types of Bayesian Inference based bandit algorithms for Two and Multiple Armed Bandits which use Order Statistics to select the next arm to play. The Bayesian strategies, also known in literature as Thompson Method are shown to function well for a whole range of values, including very small values, outperforming UCB and other commonly used strategies. Empirical analysis results show a significant improvement on multiple datasets. In the second part of the dissertation, two types of Successive Reduction (SR) strategies - 1) Successive Reduction Hoeffding (SRH) and 2) Successive Reduction Order Statistics (SRO) are introduced. Both use an Order Statistics based Sampling method for arm selection, and then successively eliminate bandit arms from consideration depending on a confidence threshold. While SRH uses Hoeffding Bounds for elimination, SRO uses the probability of an arm being superior to the currently selected arm to measure confidence. The empirical results show that the performance advantage of proposed SRO scheme increasing persistently with the number of bandit arms while the SRH scheme shows similar performance as pure Thompson Sampling Method. In the third part of the dissertation, the assumption of the reward probability being fixed is removed. We model problems where reward probabilities are drifting, and introduce a new method called Dynamic Thompson Sampling (DTS) which adapts the reward probability estimate faster than traditional schemes and thus leads to improved performance in terms of lower regret. Our empirical results demonstrate that DTS method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, namely pure Thompson Sampling, UCB-Normal and UCB-f, for the case of dynamic reward probabilities. Furthermore, the performance advantage of the proposed DTS scheme increases persistently with the number of bandit arms. In the last part of the dissertation, we delve into arm space decomposition and use of multiple agents in the Bandit process. The three most important characteristics of a multi-agent systems are 1) Autonomy [...] - agents are completely or partially autonomous, 2) Local views [...] - agents are restricted to a local view of information, and 3) Decentralization of control [...] - each agent influences a limited part of the overall decision space. We study and compare Centralized vs. Decentralized Sampling Algorithm in Multi-Armed Bandit problems in the context of common payoff games. In the Centralized Decision Making, a central agent maintains a global view of the currently available information and makes a decision to choose the next arm just as the regular Bayesian Algorithm. In Decentralized Decision Making, each agent maintains a local view of the arms and makes decisions just based on the local information available at its end without communicating with other agents. The Decentralized Decision Making is modeled as a Game Theory problem. Our results show that the Decentralized systems perform well for both the cases of Pure as well Mixed Nash equilibria and their performance scales well with the increase in the number of arms due to reduced dimensionality of the space. We thus believe that this dissertation establishes Bayesian Multi-Armed bandit strategies as one of the prominent strategies in the field of bandits and opens up venues for new interesting research in the future...|$|R
