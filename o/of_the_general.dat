5|$|Following Joseph Stalin's {{consolidation}} {{of power in}} the 1920s the post <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with 'Leader of the Soviet Union' because the post controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet Government. The post <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary; in 1966 Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the communist party, the office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>General</b> Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990. The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader, the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo, the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The President of the Soviet Union, an office created in March 1990, replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.|$|E
