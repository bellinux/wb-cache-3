25|$|Other {{important}} {{industries in}} Rhode Island's past included toolmaking, costume jewelry, and silverware. An interesting by-product of Rhode Island's industrial {{history is the}} number of abandoned factories, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>now</b> being used for condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of the economy of Rhode Island is based in services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. The state's nautical history continues in the 21st century in the form of nuclear submarine construction.|$|E

They are now used as balconies by the adjoining flats. Photographs from the early 20th century show that at the peak of warehouse usage there were many more of these bridges than survive today.|$|E
25|$|From 1842, Eugenia Tadolini was {{primarily}} {{based at the}} Teatro San Carlo in Naples, although she still performed in other Italian theatres and abroad. She sang in the world premieres of at least 12 operas at the Teatro San Carlo, most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>now</b> forgotten, apart from Verdi's Alzira and Donizetti's Poliuto. During that time, she also formed {{a relationship with a}} Neapolitan nobleman by whom she had two children, both of whom died in childhood.|$|E

25|$|The Goražde Psalter, ten {{copies of}} which are known to exist today, is counted among the better accomplishments of early Serb printers.

A transcription of the last leaf from a copy that belonged to the Krka Monastery was published in a Slavist journal in 1901.|$|E
25|$|St. Petersburg prospered {{under the}} rule of two most {{powerful}} women in Russian history. Peter's daughter, Empress Elizabeth, reigned from 1740 to 1762, without a single execution in 22 years. She cut taxes, downsized government, and was known for masqerades and festivities, amassing a wardrobe of about 12 thousand dresses, most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>now</b> preserved as museum art pieces. She supported the Russian Academy of Sciences and completed both the Winter Palace and the Summer Palace, which then became residences of Empress Catherine the Great, who reigned for 34 years, from 1762 to 1796. Under her rule, which exemplified that of an enlightened despot, more palaces were built in St. Petersburg than in any other capital in the world.|$|E

25|$|The Middleham Hoard is a coin hoard {{found near}} Middleham, North Yorkshire in England. It {{dates from the}} period of the English Civil War, and {{consists}} of 5,099 coins, all silver. It is the largest hoard of coins buried during the Civil War to have been discovered. The hoard was discovered in June 1993 by William Caygill while using a metal detector. Though referred to as one hoard, the coins were buried in three pots in two pits. These had slightly different deposition dates; likely in the later 1640s, though the person making the deposits was probably the same. The coins are dispersed between museums and private collections, 54 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>now</b> in the Yorkshire Museum's numismatic collection.|$|E

CE was to be located at Earls Court in London. But on November 22, 2006 StarWars.com announced due to Advance interest in Celebration Europe the event would be moved to the larger venue located at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London. The event also had on display {{some of the largest}} restored Star Wars Arcade collection, estimated at around 30 to 40 machines, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>now</b> rarely seen in the USA or in other parts of Europe.

25|$|The belt loops are of new design, {{much wider}} (double width) {{and there is}} 8 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>now</b> {{compared}} to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs {{at the bottom of}} the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.|$|E

500|$|Two concerts Tchaikovsky {{heard in}} Saint Petersburg in January 1889, where his music shared the {{programs}} with compositions by the New Russian School (as the Belyayev circle was also called), proved a major watershed. Tchaikovsky recognized {{that while he}} had maintained good personal relations with {{some members of the}} Balakirev circle, and perhaps some respect, he had never been recognized as one <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Now</b> with his joint participation in these concerts, he realized he was no longer excluded. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that while he found Cui to be [...] "an individual deeply hateful to me ... this in no way hinders me from respecting or loving such representatives of the school as Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyadov, Glazunov, or from considering myself flattered to appear on the concert platform beside them". This confession showed a wholehearted willingness for Tchaikovsky to have his music heard alongside that of the nationalists.|$|E
500|$|Some of Harrison's designs, {{including}} his buildings at Lancaster Castle, were Gothic in style, {{but most were}} Neoclassical, particularly those at Chester Castle. [...] He was regarded at the time, and since, as a major influence {{in the emergence of}} the Greek Revival in British architecture. [...] A bridge he designed at the start of his career, and another towards the end of his career, incorporated innovative features; Skerton Bridge was the first substantial bridge in England to have a flat roadway, and the Grosvenor Bridge was the longest single-arched masonry bridge in the world {{at the time of its}} construction. [...] Many of Harrison's structures have survived, most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>now</b> designated by English Heritage as listed buildings. [...] Despite his work being nationally admired he spent his entire career in northwest England, visiting London only occasionally; most of his buildings were in Lancashire, Cheshire, and the nearby counties.|$|E
500|$|The {{women and}} {{children}} contributed {{to a sense of}} normality as their presence provided conventional social, family, and gender relations. [...] The internees believed the children's presence made them less selfish, as it forced them to think of the latter's welfare. The women organised Christmas and birthday celebrations. Other diversions such as musicals, plays, recitals, and variety shows were also staged. Although the camp lacked books and educational supplies, the teachers and educational administrators amongst the internees were able to provide lessons for the children at the primary and secondary levels. Additionally, extensive educational opportunities were available for the adults: language courses for Chinese, Malay, and French, and also lectures on photography, yachting, journalism, and poultry-keeping. In addition to the personal diaries kept by internees, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>now</b> held by the Imperial War Museum, a record of life in the camp was created using a double bed sheet. The Day Joyce Sheet was embroidered and appliquéd with 1100 names, signs and figures including a diary in code.|$|E
