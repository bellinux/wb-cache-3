40|$|UnrestrictedBiochemical {{processes}} {{are well known}} for their superior performances in the upgrading of heavy crude oils. Based on a similar experimental strategy, a new technology was developed using biochemical process for the conversion of fossil fuel wastes into valuable biomaterials. The technology, developed by Brookhaven National Laboratory and based on a well-developed "Hydrocarbon to Protein" technology, is able to convert <b>used</b> <b>oils</b> to commercially valuable products through a biochemical process.; Production and utilization of fossil fuels generate wastes that contain EPA priority pollutants, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and toxic metals. <b>Used</b> <b>oil,</b> which often contains metals, chlorinated hydrocarbons and other organic compounds, including many that are listed as EPA priority pollutants, {{is a good example}} that is generated at a rate of more than 1. 5 billions gallons per year in the U. S. As a result, the associated impact to the environment is huge when there is uncontrolled dumping and landfilling of <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> in the environment. <b>Used</b> <b>oil</b> is a valuable resource and a vital source of energy; it still has lubricating value and heat value. Following the proper treatment to remove contaminants, <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> can be re-refined into base lube oil, reprocessed as fuel <b>oil,</b> or <b>used</b> as feedstock to produce petroleum-based products or other commercially valuable products via different processes. The high contamination levels in some <b>used</b> <b>oils,</b> however, increase the difficulties in the operations and generate hazardous byproducts as secondary pollutants. A large portion of the recycled <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> is combusted for energy utilization (often creates air pollution problems) or thermally destroyed by incineration (only when the oil has a high concentration of toxic contaminants that makes recycling impractical or unsafe).; For BNL's process, preliminary results showed that biomass generated from <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> contains 90 % delipidated biomass and 10 % lipids. The live biomass, delipidated biomass, and lipid have been proved successful in many applications and have high market values. However, there are problems encountered in the process, such as the poor quality and inconsistency of the bioproducts. The contaminants in the <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> are toxic to the bacteria strains used in the biochemical process and lower product yields. Another concern is the potential bioaccumulation of these toxins in the bioproducts. A proper pretreatment process is necessary to remove these toxins from the <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> stock to enhance the yield efficiency of the bioconversion process and improve the quality of the bioproducts.; A chemical-aided ultrasonic irradiation method is proposed to remove/degrade the toxins from <b>used</b> <b>oil.</b> Target contaminants that need to remove from <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> include heavy metals, chlorinated hydrocarbons, BTEX compounds, PAHs, and PCBs. Ultrasound irradiation is widely used in environmental cleanup applications to remove/degrade many toxic compounds in contaminated soils and waters; it is proven to be effective on many fossil fuel related applications, including upgrading and recovery. Free radical chain reaction {{is believed to be the}} dominant reaction to cause the effects in these systems. Ultrasonic irradiation has the ability to initiate and enhance the free radical generation from both water molecules and hydrocarbons. Hence, it could effectively remove/degrade the toxins in <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> with appropriate chemical additions. If technically and economically proven feasible, the chemical-aided ultrasonic irradiation process may be used not only as the pretreatment step for BNL's biochemical process, but could also become a pretreatment package in <b>other</b> <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> recycling and reprocessing options.; To develop a pretreatment package for BNL's process (biocoversion of <b>used</b> <b>oil),</b> the chemical-aided ultrasonic irradiation is server as the basic terminology. Accompanied by destructive adsorption process, the removal efficiency for the decontamination of <b>used</b> <b>oil</b> is greatly enhanced. Optimal operating conditions will be examined and from the results of this study, it seems that this process is a feasible option to pre-treat toxic contaminants before further recycle or reuse options are applied to <b>used</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|R

There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas.

First responders to oil spills {{along the coast}} of the Gulf of Mexico in the southern United States have used spunbond nylon fabric bags and fences to separate spilled oil and oil waste from contaminated water.

Nylon bags separated more than 95 % of gear lube oil contaminate from a 4. 5 % oil-in-water emulsion. Field testing of spunbond nylon fences by oil spill first responders has demonstrated the ability of this material to contain the oily contaminate while allowing water to flow through.

Natural food sources regularly included in diets offer a more viable long term solution. Red palm oil (RPO) can emerge as a viable alternative to other vitamin A rich foods, since it contains enormous amounts of natural carotenoids to the tune of around 700 PPM, the predominant ones being a and b carotene which have the highest biological potential for vitamin A conversion.   Value addition of palm oil for edible purposes results in several nutritionally rich products like edible grade red palm oil (RPO), deacidified, deodourised RPOlein, isolated carotenoids and refined, bleached and deodourized palmolein oil RBD palmolein).
