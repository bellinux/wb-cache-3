5|$|Samuelsson's primary {{offensive}} attribute is his shot. Rather {{than relying}} on stickhandling in the offensive zone, his primary tendency is to direct the puck towards the net, hoping for a rebound. Before becoming an <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> later in his career, he established himself first as a defensively responsible forward in the NHL, earning time on the penalty kill and against opposing team's top players. Strong on his skates, he is also noted to play aggressively, as well. As a result, Samuelsson {{is known as a}} versatile, two-way player.|$|E
5|$|Media {{attention}} was also {{directed at the}} teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week {{leading up to the}} game. In {{the first half of the}} 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech had made him a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams dropped him from contention for the Heisman. Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan appeared to be the biggest <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> for Boston College.|$|E
5|$|The Kid Line {{remained}} Toronto's top <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> {{for several}} years; Jackson, Conacher and Primeau were the team's top three scorers for four consecutive seasons between 1932 and 1935. Following his league-leading season, Jackson led Toronto offensively in 1932–33 with 44 points. On November 20, 1934, Jackson set an NHL record {{when he became}} the first player in NHL history to score four goals in a period, notching four markers in the third period of a 5–2 victory over the St. Louis Eagles. The record has not been surpassed through 2012, though eleven players have matched it. He was named to three additional All-Star Teams during this time, placed on the second team in 1932–33 and on the first team in both 1933–34 and 1934–35. Additionally, Jackson played in the Ace Bailey Benefit Game on February 14, 1934. Held in support of injured teammate Ace Bailey, it was the first all-star game in NHL history. Jackson scored two goals for the Maple Leafs in a 7–3 victory over the NHL All-Stars.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers added <b>offensive</b> <b>threats</b> to {{complement}} their solid defense; a healthy Doug Williams played {{his first full}} season and Ricky Bell became the team's first 1,000-yard back, rushing for a career-high 1,263 yards.|$|R

5|$|As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in {{the first}} round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The series drew much media {{attention}} as Vince Carter, a former Raptor who left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances two seasons ago, was now back at the ACC as a Net. In the opening game, while Carter was constantly booed by the home crowd and was not an <b>offensive</b> <b>threat,</b> Toronto's inexperience was evident as they too struggled offensively and were down 65–78 going into the fourth quarter. A late rally by Toronto in the fourth quarter was not enough as they eventually lost 91–96. The Raptors won game 2 89–83 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. The Nets won games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced a game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5. In that game, the Raptors set two post-season franchise records: most number of points going into halftime and biggest lead for a half. The attendance for the game was also a franchise record for a playoff game. In game 6, however, New Jersey won 98–97, sealing the series 4–2 and sending Toronto out of the first round.|$|E
25|$|Chicago Bears’ {{running back}} Walter Payton entered {{the game with}} hopes of surpassing O.J. Simpson's 2,003-yard 1973 season, but was held to 101 yards on 33 carries. Ricky Bell set new {{franchise}} rushing records with 94 yards on 24 carries. Payton scored the game's only touchdown, a three-yard run that {{was set up by}} a 32-yard pass to Steve Schubert from punter Bob Parsons. Lee Roy Selmon sacked quarterback Bob Avellini twice, blocked one of his passes, and hurried him several times. The Buccaneers’ only serious <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> ended with a missed field goal in the first quarter.|$|E
25|$|The Tournament of Champions is {{an annual}} event, since 1997, {{showcasing}} the best {{high school girls}} basketball teams. The 2011 event, held in Phoenix, Arizona, included 96 of the best basketball programs in the country. The C-NS team {{was assigned to the}} Smith Division, where they faced Bolingbrook High School, considered to be the number 1 team by USA Today. Despite being viewed as a 30-point underdog, Stewart helped her team to the first round upset, scoring 15 points in a 43–40 win. In the quarter-final game, Stewart scored 29 points and had 19 rebounds to help the team beat the number 22 ranked team in the country, Dr. Phillips High School from Orlando, Florida. Although double-teamed, she scored ten points in a 12–0 run that gave C-NS a commanding 23-point lead early in the fourth quarter. That win secured a place in the semi-finals of the division. In the semi-final game, C-NS faced St. Mary's, the number 2 ranked team in the country. Stewart had 33 points and 16 rebounds, but it was not enough to overcome the scoring of the eventual champion of the tournament. Although the team lost that game, Stewart's overall performance earned her the most outstanding player of the tournament honors. Stewart was viewed as an <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> in the low post, high post and perimeter, and was effective as a defender because of her long wingspan.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, the Flames re-signed Backlund to a two-year, $3 million {{contract}} extension. That season, Backlund recorded the best totals {{of his career}} in every offensive category, finishing third on the Flames in goals (18) and fourth in points (39). While the team around him regressed to the worst finish in team history, Backlund asserted himself as one of its top <b>offensive</b> <b>threats.</b>|$|R
500|$|Signing him to {{a six-year}} {{contract}} extension worth $3.3 million per season in February 2010, the Flames looked to Bourque to be a top player for the organization. Though prone to inconsistent play, he {{was considered one of}} the Flames' top <b>offensive</b> <b>threats,</b> and a player looked at as potentially succeeding captain Jarome Iginla as the team's scoring leader. [...] He played in the 2011 Heritage Classic, scoring two goals in a 4–0 win over the Montreal Canadiens, and finished the season second on the team with 27 goals.|$|R
50|$|Bards' biggest {{advantage}} {{was their}} use of the rogue advancement table, which was the fastest in the game. Bards cast spells using their actual class level as their caster level. Since bards were usually higher level than the party's wizard, the spells they could cast were often more powerful than the wizard's. A bard who focussed on spells that improved with caster level (such as Magic Missile and Fireball) was a very potent magical threat. Their ability to use any weapon, combined with rogue attack strength, made them credible second-line <b>offensive</b> <b>threats</b> even without magic, provided they had some form of magical Armor Class-boosting equipment.|$|R
500|$|As age and {{injuries}} took their toll, McDonald's role with the Flames changed. [...] His playing time decreased {{in his later}} years as he was no longer counted on to be the team's primary <b>offensive</b> <b>threat.</b> Often left out of the lineup in his final season, McDonald was expected to provide a boost to the team when he drew into the lineup. [...] He was counted on to provide a veteran presence and to act as a mentor for the team's younger players.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, Virginia Tech's offense {{was led by}} running back Cyrus Lawrence, who {{accumulated}} {{what was then a}} school record of 1,221 yards during the regular season. He also set a record for most carries by a Tech player in a season with 271. Tech quarterback Steve Casey was called the [...] "key man in the Tech offense." [...] Casey was Tech's starting quarterback and completed 97 of 176 passes during the regular season for 1,119 yards and 13 touchdowns. At the time, he ranked second among Tech's career passing leaders, and was considered to be an <b>offensive</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although Henry {{played up}} front as a striker during his youth, {{he spent his}} time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger {{immediately}} changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to 4–5–1. This change forced Henry to adapt again {{to fit into the}} Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main <b>offensive</b> <b>threat,</b> on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: [...] "Thierry Henry could take the ball {{in the middle of the}} park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score".|$|E
50|$|Having been groomed by Tanjević {{over the}} {{previous}} years for a main role at the center position, the season saw the full maturation of lanky nineteen-year-old Ratko Radovanović who contributed with 13.3ppg, largely joining Delibašić and Varajić as the team's main <b>offensive</b> <b>threats</b> and squeezing center Zdravko Čečur out of the squad in the process. Though liking Čečur's hustle and willingness to sacrifice his body, Tanjević largely considered him a liability due to his continual lack of fitness and looked to decrease the team's reliance on him under the basket by bringing up young Radovanović who in addition to better agility also had a height advantage over Čečur.|$|R
50|$|On January 15, 2009, Harvin {{announced}} he would forgo his remaining college eligibility {{and participate in the}} 2009 NFL Draft. Harvin finished his college career {{as one of the most}} prolific <b>offensive</b> <b>threats</b> in school history. In three seasons, he totaled 133 catches for 1,929 yards and 13 touchdowns, while rushing the ball 194 times for 1,852 yards with 19 touchdowns. His 32 career touchdowns is the most ever by a University of Florida wide receiver. He averaged an astounding 9.5 yards per carry as a running back and averaged 11.6 yards overall (running back, receiver, return man). He was the first player in University of Florida history to rush for 100 yards and have 100 yards receiving in the same game (against Vanderbilt, 2007).|$|R
5000|$|McGee was {{a captain}} of the memorable 1985 [...] "Sugar Vols" [...] squad, {{and was one of}} the leading {{returning}} <b>offensive</b> <b>threats</b> along with quarterback Tony Robinson (Robinson and McGee were featured on the cover of the team's 1985 Football Guide sitting in the cockpit of an airplane under the words, [...] "Fly Tennessee"). [...] McGee caught 5 passes for 142 yards in the opener against UCLA, and had 6 catches for 163 yards and a touchdown in the Vols' 38-20 upset of #1 Auburn. [...] He caught 6 passes for 91 yards and scored the lone touchdown in the team's 17-10 loss to Florida. [...] McGee had 105 receiving yards against Rutgers, 117 against Ole Miss, and 108 against Kentucky (including two touchdowns that launched a second-half rout).|$|R
500|$|Conacher {{remained}} a leading <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> throughout his tenure with Boston; {{he was one}} of the NHL's top ten scorers in his first four seasons, including the 1939–40 season despite missing 16 games due to a broken wrist. He also finished second in goals in both 1940–41 and 1941–42 with 24 goals in each campaign. [...] By 1941, he had joined with Eddie Wiseman and Bill Cowley to form the [...] "Three Gun Line", so named because all three players were considered top scoring threats. Conacher had only one goal during the 1941 Stanley Cup playoffs, but the Bruins were the NHL's dominant team and swept the Detroit Red Wings in the Final to win their second Stanley Cup in three years.|$|E
500|$|He led {{the league}} in goal scoring all three seasons and was named to the First All-Star Team each year.

Pearson Award as the NHL's most valuable player as selected by the league and his fellow players respectively. His total of 86 goals in 1990–91 is the third highest for a single season in NHL history, after Gretzky's 92 goals in 1981–82 and 87 in 1983–84. Oates left the Blues midway through the 1991–92 season, and while Hull's offensive production dropped, he remained the Blues' top <b>offensive</b> <b>threat.</b> He recorded his fourth and fifth consecutive 50-goal seasons, scoring 54 in [...] and 57 in [...]|$|E
500|$|In April 2000, New York traded wide {{receiver}} Keyshawn Johnson, a major <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> on the 1998 team, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for two 1st-round draft picks.

Having acquired New England's pick in the Belichick compensation, and with their own pick, the Jets had four 1st-round picks. They selected quarterback Chad Pennington as well as defensive linemen John Abraham and Shaun Ellis, and tight end Anthony Becht, all of whom would be key players on the Jets playoff teams of the 2000s. For the first time, the Jets won their first four games, including a victory over Johnson and the Buccaneers.

50|$|Sun Tzu's 'Art of War' {{treatise}} is used {{to provide}} a guiding philosophy throughout the programme, addressing both <b>offensive</b> <b>threats</b> and the defensive measures needed to overcome them. The philosophy also extends to the sections on incident response methodology (i.e. {{how to respond to}} security breaches), computer forensics and the impact of law on security-related activities such as the recovery of information from a computer crime suspect's hard drive. Under the programme, students are given coursework and experience how to set up and maintain a complete enterprise-class security monitoring and defence infrastructure which includes firewalls, network intrusion detection systems, file-integrity checkers, honeypots and encryption. A unique attacker's methodology is also introduced to assist the technical staff with identifying the modus operandi of an attacker and his arsenal and to conduct auditing against computer systems by using that methodology.|$|R

Wide {{receivers}} Mark Clayton (73 receptions, 1,389 yards, 18 touchdowns) and Mark Duper (71 receptions, 1,306 yards, 8 touchdowns) became the first teammates ever to each gain over 1,300 receiving yards in one season, while Clayton's 18 touchdown catches broke the NFL single-season record of 17 set by Don Hutson in 1942. Receiver Nat Moore caught 43 passes for 574 yards and 6 touchdowns, while tight end Dan Johnson contributed 34 receptions for 426 yards. While Miami's main offensive attack was passing, they still had a trio of great running backs: Tony Nathan, Woody Bennett, and Joe Carter. Both Nathan and Bennett finished the season with over 1,000 combined rushing and receiving yards, while Carter contributed 495 rushing yards.

500|$|In {{his first}} {{professional}} season, 1986–87, Roberts shuttled between Calgary and Moncton. [...] He was recalled to the Flames three {{times during the}} season and scored his first NHL goal in his NHL debut on November 11, 1986, against the Vancouver Canucks. He recorded 15 points in 32 games with Calgary and added 38 points in 38 AHL games with Moncton. In his first full season in Calgary, 1987–88, Roberts improved to 28 points in 74 NHL games, while his 282 penalty minutes were ultimately the highest total of his career, and the first of five consecutive seasons which he recorded over 200 minutes in penalties. Roberts joined the Flames as a grinder; He played a physical style and frequently engaged opponents in fights, but credited Nieuwendyk with helping him establish his place as a power forward and <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> with the team. Playing on a line with Nieuwendyk and Håkan Loob, Roberts scored 22 goals in 1988–89. He added 12 points in the 1989 Stanley Cup Playoffs, including two goals in the Flames' 5–3 victory in the fourth game of the Smythe Division final that eliminated the Los Angeles Kings. Roberts and the Flames went on to defeat the Montreal Canadiens in the final to earn the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. advance {{following}} Cobra was extraordinarily rapid. Between 1 August and 4 August, seven {{divisions of}} Patton's Third Army had swept through Avranches {{and over the}} bridge at Pontaubault into Brittany. The German army in Normandy {{had been reduced to}} such a poor state by the Allied offensives that, with no prospect of reinforcement {{in the wake of the}} Soviet summer offensive against Army Group Centre, very few Germans believed they could now avoid defeat. Rather than order his remaining forces to withdraw to the Seine, Adolf Hitler sent a directive to von Kluge demanding [...] "an immediate counterattack between Mortain and Avranches" [...] to [...] "annihilate" [...] the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula. Eight of the nine Panzer divisions in Normandy were to be used in the attack but only four (one of them incomplete) could be relieved from their defensive tasks and assembled in time. German commanders immediately protested that such an operation was impossible given their remaining resources but these objections were overruled and the counter-offensive, commenced on 7 August around Mortain. The 2nd, 1st SS and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions led the assault, although with only 75 Panzer IVs, 70 Panthers, and 32 self-propelled guns between them.

There are going to be hits that are unfortunate but still clean." [...] Brown had never been issued a fine or suspension from the NHL Department of Player Safety until April 24, 2013, when he received two-game suspension for an illegal elbow to the head of Minnesota Wild forward Jason Pominville on April 23, 2013.

Brown's unparalleled success in that area has led several commentators, including ex-NHL referee Kerry Fraser, to say that Brown has acquired a reputation for embellishing infractions in order to draw penalties. Beyond his physicality and agitation, Brown has provided a consistent <b>offensive</b> <b>threat</b> for the Kings, scoring at least 22 goals five consecutive years. Brown plays an effective two-way game and has matured into an elite defensive and penalty-killing forward.|$|E

[...] As the season progressed, however, his performance began to sink, mainly due to Pittsburgh's poor defence.

The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals {{for the first time}} in franchise history. Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks <b>offensive</b> <b>threats.</b> The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim. Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting, after a 39-point performance in Game 6. Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.|$|R
