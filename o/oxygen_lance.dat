As a primary measure, the influence of oxygen was analysed. The oxygen was loaded by an <b>oxygen</b> <b>lance</b> which was installed in the rotary furnace opposite to the burner. In alternative, the burner was driven with natural gas-air and with natural gas-oxygen. In the secondary path, the project comprised the examination of a double-stage-filter in which hydrated lime as well as hydrated lime and mixtures of lime and powdered brown coal coke were applied as sorption agents. Further examinations referred to a single-stage filter in which mixtures of lime and coal were tested as well, partly with recirculation. The most important results were: - A potential in the diminution of PCDD/PCDF emissions can't be derived from the use of oxygen burners. There is a tendency towards a deterioration of the PCDD/PCDF emissions. - The application of the oxygen burners led to a considerable higher emission of nitrogen oxides. In order to obtain an improvement in this field, a correction in the design of the furnace seal on the side of the burner would be necessary. - An <b>oxygen</b> <b>lance</b> could reduce the load to total organic carbon (TOC). However, the required control technique is not yet available. - A double-stage filter improves the separation of dust and consequently of PCDD/PCDF. Furthermore, the application of brown coal coke considerably increases the separation of PCDD/PCDF. - Also single-stage filter shows a similar good purification effect if lime/coke mixtures with recirculation are used as sorption agents. The application of a filter medium made of Gore-Tex caused an increased separation of finest dust, but it didn't result in a considerable improvement of the PCDD/PCDF emissions. (orig.)

40|$|Slag {{formation}} plays {{a decisive}} {{role in all}} steelmaking processes. In top-blowing Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS) i. e., in the LD process, an emulsion consisting of liquid slag, dispersed metal droplets, undissolved particles and solid precipitates will, together with process gases, form an expanding foam. Extensive research has defined the parameters that govern the foaming characteristics of BOS slag-metal emulsions. It is a well-known fact that certain process conditions in the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) will lead to excessive foam growth, forcing foam out through the vessel opening (mouth). This process event {{is commonly known as}} slopping. Slopping results in loss of valuable metal, equipment damage, lost production time, unsafe work environment and pollution. A literature survey covering the slopping phenomena has been carried out, as well as a deeper investigation into the causes behind slopping on the BOF type LD/LBE at SSAB Europe, Luleå, equipped with an automatic system for slopping registration using image analysis Good slag formation and foam-growth control in order to avoid slopping is primarily accomplished by taking preventive “static” measures. The most common pre-blowing operational conditions favouring foam growth and, hence, slopping were found to be linked to <b>oxygen</b> <b>lance</b> positioning, hot metal Si and Mn contents, scrap quality and large additions of iron oxide bearing materials. Improved slopping control may be achieved by developing <b>oxygen</b> <b>lance</b> control schemes with automatic adjustment of the distance between the lance tip and the metal bath (i. e., the lance gap) according to scrap quality and ore additions. If “static” measures cannot be effectuated, a set of in-blow slopping preventive measures is needed. For such “dynamic” measures to be effective, it is necessary to have a system for slopping prediction. Trials with vessel vibration measurements for indirect foam height estimation in industrial scale BOFs, type LD/LBE, have been carried out. FFT spectrum analysis was applied in order to find the frequency band with best correlation to an estimated foam height. The results show that there is a correlation between vessel vibration and foam height which can be used for dynamic foam level and slopping control, and this during the entire blow. The vessel vibration results have been tested against what is the perhaps most commonly implemented technique for dynamic foam height estimation and slopping control, the audiometric system. Parallel vibration and audio measurements have been carried out on 130 -tonne as well as on 300 -tonne BOFs. The results show that during stable process conditions there is good agreement between the two methods in regard to foam height estimation and that combining the two methods will provide a powerful slopping prediction and control system. A feasibility study has been carried out with the aim to describe the possibilities and limitations of multivariate data analysis, including batch analysis, for dynamic BOS process control, mainly in regard to slopping prevention. Two principal modelling approaches were tested. A central part of this PhD work is the performed emulsion characterisation and the subsequent investigation into the influence of emulsion mineralogy and morphology on slopping in the LD process. The results are based on the study of emulsion samples from trial heats conducted in a 6 -tonne pilot plant LD vessel. The main emulsion slag phase mineral species identified were di-calcium silicate, monoxides (mainly FeO, MnO and MgO), calcium ferrites and late-appearing tri-calcium silicate. The study also show that the iron oxidation state has a large influence on the emulsion mineralogy and morphology, as a higher Fe 3 + content facilitates the precipitation of calcium ferrites, raising the emulsion apparent viscosity and, hence, the foam index. The same effect is caused by higher MgO contents (i. e., at saturation), resulting in the precipitation of monoxide phase. However, large volume fractions of emulsion precipitates will not always lead to slopping in the LD process. A second “requirement” for excessive foam growth is a simultaneously high gas generation rate. Vice versa; an LD heat may very well slop at low volume fractions of 2 ndphase particles in the emulsion if the gas generation rate is sufficiently high. It is an indisputable fact that excessive foaming {{is one of the main}} features of the LD process, due to the practice of top-lance oxygen blowing, creating a highly oxidised slag, and heavy batch additions of basic slag formers, causing an initial formation of large quantities of precipitates. Therefore, preventing slopping is primarily a matter of tight process control, most importantly, control of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>lance</b> gap in order to reach a state of sufficiently high liquid MeO phase to minimise the emulsion apparent viscosity, but low enough to avoid over-oxidising and a high gas generation rate.

40|$|In the BOS {{process liquid}} slag {{together}} with dispersed metal droplets, solid particles and process gases form an expanding foam. Certain process conditions {{may lead to}} excessive foam growth, forcing foam out through the vessel mouth, an event commonly known as 'slopping'. Slopping results in loss of valuable metal, equipment damage and lost production time. In the early 1980 s a system for foam level and slopping control was installed at SSAB's steel plant in Lulea, a system based on the correlation between BOS vessel vibration in a narrow low frequency band and foam development. The technique, in this case with an accelerometer mounted on the trunnion bearing housing, soon showed its usefulness, for example when adapting existing lance patterns {{to a change in}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>lance</b> design from a 3 -hole to a 4 -hole nozzle. Estimating the actual foam height in the BOS vessel was of great importance in the recently completed RFCS funded research project "IMPHOS" (Improving Phosphorus Refining). Based on the earlier positive experiences, it was decided to further develop the vessel vibration measurement technique. Trials on an industrial size BOS vessel type LD/LBE have been carried out, this time with a tri-axial accelerometer mounted on the vessel trunnion. FFT spectrum analysis has been used in order to find the frequency band with best correlation to the foam level development. The results show that there is a correlation between vessel vibration and foam height {{that can be used for}} dynamic foam level and slopping controlValiderad; 2011; 20110304 (andbra...|$|E
5000|$|The {{decarburization}} step {{is controlled}} by ratios of oxygen to argon or nitrogen to remove the carbon from the metal bath. The ratios {{can be done in}} any number of phases to facilitate the reaction. The gases are usually blown through a top <b>lance</b> (<b>oxygen</b> only) and tuyeres in the sides/bottom (oxygen with an inert gas shroud). The stages of blowing remove carbon by the combination of oxygen and carbon forming CO gas.|$|R
50|$|The Magnetic {{mine was}} a German {{development}} that allowed naval mines {{to become more}} deadly than ever; by detecting the magnetic charge of a large ship a mine could detonate without ever having {{to make contact with}} the craft, and it would be completely harmless to smaller ships, whose lack of a strong magnetic field allowed them to pass safely, saving the mine for more valuable targets. The <b>oxygen</b> Long <b>lance</b> torpedo, which used pure oxygen instead of air for the oxidizer, was developed by the Japanese just prior to their full involvement in WWII. Despite having more than twice the effective range of the best Allied torpedoes and lacking the tell-tale torpedo wake, the oxygen torpedo was not used to its fullest capacity by the Japanese Imperial Navy, mostly because of inefficient submarine deployment.|$|R
50|$|The {{demonstration}} plant was commissioned with high-pressure (700 kPag) air injected down the lance. Later, after extensive testing of low-pressure lance designs and trials using oxygen enrichment of the lance air, a 70 t/d oxygen plant and a 5 Nm3/s blower with a discharge pressure of 146 kPag were purchased. The new lance design {{was capable of}} operating at pressures below 100 kPag. Using enrichment of the <b>oxygen</b> in the <b>lance</b> air to 35%, the {{demonstration plant}} throughput was lifted to 48 t/h of concentrate, and the gross energy used during smelting was reduced from 25.6 GJ/t of contained copper to 4.1 GJ/t.|$|R
