25|$|The moral {{influence}} <b>or</b> <b>example</b> {{theory of}} the atonement holds that the purpose and work of Jesus Christ was to bring positive moral change to humanity.

25|$|Some large layered {{complexes}} are {{not related}} to mantle plumes, <b>or</b> <b>example,</b> the Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland. Here, the large magma volumes which are created by mid-ocean ridge spreading allow the accumulation of large volumes of cumulate rocks. The problem of creating space for such intrusions is easily explained by the extensional tectonics in operation; extensional or listric faults operating at depth can provide a triangular space for keel-shaped or boat-shaped intrusions such as the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe, or the Narndee-Windimurra Complex of Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|The killings {{started in}} October 1965 in Jakarta, spread to Central and East Java {{and later to}} Bali, and smaller {{outbreaks}} occurred in parts of other islands, including Sumatra. The communal tensions and hatreds that had built up were played upon by the Army leadership who characterised Communists as villains, and many Indonesian civilians {{took part in the}} killings. The worst massacres were in Central and East Java where PKI support was at its strongest. The situation varied across the country {{and the role of the}} Army has never been fully explained. In some areas the Army organised, encouraged, trained, and supplied civilian groups and local militias. In other areas, communal vigilante action preceded the Army, although in most cases killings did not commence before military units had sanctioned violence by instruction <b>or</b> <b>example.</b> It was in the earlier stages of the killings that the army's direct involvement in clashes with the PKI occurred. By the end of October, groups of devout Muslims joined the purge of Communists claiming it was their duty to cleanse Indonesia of atheism.|$|E

In early leadership development programs, [...] learning about leadership was not specifically defined with qualified objectives.

The White Stag program defines leadership behaviors in specific terms as eleven leadership competencies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a taxonomy of constructive induction problems and reports on an empirical comparison of several constructive induction methods. In this paper a representation space {{is said to}} be poorly suited for learning because of three types of problems: 1) inappropriate attributes or attribute values, 2) incomplete attribute values, attribute sets <b>or</b> <b>examples</b> and 3) incorrect attributes <b>or</b> <b>examples.</b> Most current constructive induction methods are designed to correct one of these types (or sub-types) of problems which limits the types of problems for which this method is effective. In order to build a more general multistrategy method of constructive induction an understanding of when some methods for constructive induction are useful and when they fail is important. Five methods of constructive induction are evaluated: DCI attribute construction (AQDCI), HCI attribute construction (AQ-HCI(ADD)), HCI attribute removal (AQ-HCI(REMOVE)), HCI construction and removal (AQ-HCI), and [...] ...|$|R
