5000|$|Sulfadimethoxine {{can either}} be given alone (such as with under the {{commercial}} name Albon) or in combination with <b>ormetoprim</b> to as a [...] "potentiated sulfonamide" [...] to increase antimicrobial activity. <b>Ormetoprim</b> is a diaminopyridine, inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which is further along the pathway for synthesizing folic acid. Though the optimum ratio of sulfadimethoxine to <b>ormetoprim</b> {{has been found to}} be 20:1, it is sold pharmaceutically as a 5:1 mixture.|$|E
50|$|Sulfadimethoxine has a {{relatively}} high solubility at the pH normally occurring in the kidneys, and is easily reabsorbed into the renal tubules, adding to its long half-life. The use of sulfadimethoxine raises concerns that it will precipitate in the kidneys, leading to crystalluria. Though crystallization is not actually a common occurrence in veterinary medicine, it can be avoided entirely by adding a diaminopyrimidine such as <b>ormetoprim.</b> Having the animal stay well-hydrated also is advised.|$|E
50|$|Sulfadimethoxine (or sulphadimethoxine, {{trade names}} Di-Methox or Albon) is a {{long-lasting}} sulfonamide antimicrobial medication used in veterinary medicine. It {{is used to}} treat many infections, including respiratory, urinary tract, enteric, and soft tissue infections and can be given as a standalone or combined with <b>ormetoprim</b> to broaden the target range. Like all sulfamides, sulfadimethoxine inhibits bacterial synthesis of folic acid by acting as a competitive inhibitor against PABA. It {{is the most common}} drug prescribed to dogs who have coccidiosis.|$|E
5000|$|The FDA {{has been}} testing for {{chemicals}} in aquaculture products {{for over two}} decades. In November 2005, the testing program for aquaculture drugs was revised to include antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurans, and quinolones, as well as antimicrobial compounds like malachite green that are not approved for use in aquaculture fish. [...] From October 1, 2006, through May 31, 2007, FDA tested samples of catfish, basa, shrimp, dace, and eel from China, finding twenty-five percent of the samples to contain drug residues. FDA has approved five different drugs for use in aquaculture {{as long as the}} seafood contains less than a mandated maximum residue limit: florfenicol, sulfamerazine, chorionic gonadotropin, oxytetracycline dihydrate, oxytetracycline hydrochloride, as well as a drug combination of sulfadimethoxine and <b>ormetoprim.</b> [...] FDA has approved two drugs—formalin and hydrogen peroxide—for which it has not set a tolerance.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{studied the}} effect of sulfadiomethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> (Rofenaid 40) in {{combination}} with lasalocid (Avatec) and monensin (Coban) on mortality, weight gain, and feed conversion of 2592 male broilers to 47 days of age. Four shuttle treatments were utilized: 1) monensin feeding for the entire trial; 2) sulfadimethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> feeding for the first 2 weeks, followed by lasalocid {{for the remainder of}} the trial; 3) sul-fadimethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> feeding for the first 2 weeks, followed by monensin; and 4) sulfadimethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> feeding through week 3, then lasalocid {{for the remainder of the}} trial. No significant (P>. 05) differences were observed in mortality among the four treatments. The combination of sulfadimethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> plus lasalocid significantly (P<. 01) improved weight gain and final body weight, but the length of time that sulfadimethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> were fed did not have any effect. Sulfadimethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> plus monensin treatment resulted in better feed conversion as compared with the other treatments.

40|$|Antibiotics are a {{class of}} {{pharmaceuticals}} specifically engineered to kill pathogenic bacteria. In addition to medicinal applications for treating people, antibiotics are also used {{in a number of}} agricultural industries {{to prevent the spread of}} harmful and costly diseases. However, the increased prevalence of resistant strains of bacteria has raised concern about the environmental fate of such compounds, particularly once in the natural environment. For many antibiotics, little information is known about their breakdown or fate in natural waters. This work investigated the photochemical transformation of two antibiotics commonly used in aquaculture (catfish), sulfadimethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> and the role that dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition plays on the fate of these compounds. Sulfadimethoxine degradation was found to be dependent on DOM source composition, and degraded via triplet excited state pathways. <b>Ormetoprim</b> was found to degrade through indirect pathways that included transformation via two reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted by DOM- the hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. The effects of source on dissolved organic matter composition were studied, and an intensive investigation was performed to characterize the photoreactivity of a fulvi...|$|E
40|$|The minimum {{inhibitory}} concentrations (MICs) of six {{antimicrobial agents}} were determined for Atlantic coast isolates of V. anguillarum, V. ordalii and A. salmonicida collected between 1985 and 1990. MIC values were calculated by agar dilution at 3 incubation temperatures (10, 20, 30 degrees C) for the following: oxytetracycline, Romet- 30 (5 : 1 sulfadimethoxine + <b>ormetoprim),</b> oxolinic acid, sarafloxacin, erythromycin and streptomycin. MICs for oxytetracycline against V. anguillarum and V. ordalii showed a 2 -fold increase as incubation temperature increased. This pattern was not seen for A. salmonicida, although {{the frequency of}} resistant strains was greater. Vibrio isolates were more sensitive to sarafloxacin, oxolinic acid and Romet- 30 (MIC 50 0. 0156 - 0. 25 micro g/ml) than A. salmonicida (MIC 50 0. 03 - 4 micro g/ml), but were more resistant to streptomycin (32 micro g/ml) and erythromycin (16 micro g/ml) than A. salmonicida (8 micro g/ml). ...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{effect of}} a 3 : 1 {{combination}} of sulfamonomethoxine and <b>ormetoprim</b> (SMM-OMP) against edwardsiellosis was studied in two experiments with artificially infected Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. Flounder, average weight of 25. 8 ± 4. 8 g in experiment 1 and 38. 4 ± 7. 2 g in experiment 2, were challenged by immersing for 15 min in sea water containing about 108 colony forming unit (CFU) /ml of Edwardsiella tarda NUF 251. Slurry made up of ground commercial pellet feed and water containing SMM-OMP was administrated orally into the stomach of experimental fish with a plastic cathetel for 7 days in experiment 1 or 5 days in experiment 2 from the following day of challenge. Dosages of the drug containing 30 mg of SMM and 10 mg of OMP per 100 mg were 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day in experiment 1 and 0, 12. 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg/day in experiment 2. Therapeutic effect of oxytetracycline (OTC) was also studied at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day in experiment 2. As a result high therapeutic effects of SMM-OMP were achieved even at the lowest dosage (12. 5 mg/kg). In experiment 1, however, the fish at higher dosages were died more than those at lower dosages. Such fish did not show the disease signs of edwardsiellosis, and also E. tarda was not reisolated from the fish. From the results such deaths {{may be due to}} a harmful effect of the drug. OTC was proved to be ineffective though E. tarda NUF 251 was sensitive to OTC in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Six healthy adult mares {{were each}} given an oral loading dose of ormetoprim(OMP) -sulfadimethoxine (SDM) at a dosage of 9. 2 mg of OMP/kg and 45. 8 mg of SDM/kg, {{followed}} by four maintenance doses of 4. 6 mg of OMP/kg and 22. 9 mg of SDM/kg, at 24 h intervals. <b>Ormetoprim</b> and SDM concentrations were measured in serum, synovial fluid, peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and endometrium. The highest mean serum OMP concentration was 0. 92 micrograms/mL 0. 5 h {{after the first}} dose; the highest mean SDM concentration was 80. 9 micrograms/mL 8 h after the first dose. The highest mean synovial fluid concentrations were 0. 14 microgram of OMP/mL and 28. 5 micrograms of SDM/mL 12 h after the first dose. The highest mean peritoneal fluid concentrations were 0. 19 micrograms of OMP/mL 6 h after the first dose and 25. 5 micrograms of SDM/mL 8 h after the fifth dose. The highest mean endometrial concentrations were 0. 56 micrograms of OMP/g and 28. 5 micrograms of SDM/g 4 h after the fifth dose. The mean cerebrospinal fluid concentrations were 0. 08 micrograms of OMP/mL and 2. 1 micrograms of SDM/mL 5 h after the fifth dose. Mean trough urine drug concentrations were {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 4 micrograms of OMP/mL and {{greater than or equal to}} 172 micrograms of SDM/mL. Two of the mares were each given a single intravenous (IV) injection of OMP and SDM at a dosage of 9. 2 mg of OMP/kg and 45. 8 mg of SDM/kg. Excitation and muscle fasciculations were observed in both mares after IV administration and all scheduled blood samples could be collected from only one of the two mares.

40|$|Select antibacterials were {{evaluated}} for their potential as shrimp aquaculture drugs. Difloxacin and sarafloxacin {{were evaluated}} for palatability, toxocity, and residues {{with respect to}} shrimp, after 15 days of feeding medicated diets. The pharmacokinetics and bioavailabilities of sulphadimethoxine (SDM) and <b>ormetoprim</b> (OMP) were also established for shrimp. Reductions (p < 0. 05) in difloxacin feed palatability were noted {{as a function of}} dose. Total survival and mean survival time (p < 0. 05) decreased as a function of dose. Signs of animal stress, i. e., lethargic behavior, was also noted in the highest dose group. Shrimp tissue levels of difloxacin were inconclusive and not readily determined with the current analytical methods for the drug in shrimp. However, indications were that elimination may be rapid, i. e., tissue t 1 / 2 of 11. 4 h with peak tissue levels following a standard dose response. Feed palatability was reduced (p < 0. 05) as a function of sarafloxacin dose. Lower weight gains in the higher dose groups were also noted. Neither the total survival nor the mean survival time (p < 0. 05) were affected by sarafloxacin dose. Feed Conversion Ratio's increased with dose, indicating possible subchronic toxicity. Sarafloxacin elimination was rapid, with a tissue t 1 / 2 of 13. 4 h and tissue levels decreased to below detectable limits by day 14 of withdrawal in all treatments. Peak tissue levels followed a standard dose response. The hemolymph concentrations versus time data for both SDM and OMP were fitted well by two compartment models. The SDM:OMP parameter estimates of CLs, Vss, and terminal phase t 1 / 2 were 194 : 2045 ml/kg*h, 1735 : 25, 442 ml/kg, and 6. 9 : 11. 5 h, respectively. Plasma protein binding of SDM and OMP was 5. 2 % and 12. 1 %, respectively. The bioavailabilities of SDM:OMP were 30 : 38 %. Peak hemolymph concentration (Cmax) and time (Tmax) of SDM post of single oral dose (210 mg/kg) was 14 ug/ml at 4 h, while OMP (42 mg/kg) Cmax and Tmax was 0. 45 ug/ml at 0. 67 h. The amount of the available oral dose 2 h post administration of SDM:OMP in the hemolymph, muscle, and hepatopancreas were 6. 0 : 0. 5 %, 9. 3 : 2. 8 %, and 2. 9 : 20. 2 %, respectively. Hemolymph and muscle tissue levels were below detectable limits post 48 h for SDM and 24 h for OMP...|$|E
