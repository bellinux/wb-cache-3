25|$|Centered in Samarkand, Russia is roundly {{feared and}} despised for its Satan worshiping, and the ritualistic {{cannibalism}} used to terrorize the empire's Uzbek and Tajik subjects. Russia's Serpent Throne is kept afloat by the Sisterhood of True Dreamers, {{the descendants of}} the nun, and others like her. The males go mad from the dreams at puberty, so the females are the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> used.

25|$|Dr. Satyajit Chavan is {{the head}} doctor at a civil {{hospital}} in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, {{most of whom are}} young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that his job is to treat patients and that beds must be allocated to the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> most likely to survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received among television critics. Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic called Yang being on pediatrics [...] "an epic fail", but praised the humor given by Oh. He also called Lexie's storyline [...] "endearing and sad to watch", writing that overall, the episode was [...] "classic Grey's Anatomy". PopSugar gave a positive {{review of the}} episode, writing: [...] "Derek and Mark {{seem to be the}} only <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> keeping their cool." [...] However, they also felt that Meredith was [...] "out of chararacter", commenting: [...] "Though Meredith also kept it together, her optimism is so out of character that it can only be chalked up to the crisis, and even she recognizes it." [...] While Yang was on pediatric service, she impersonated a bear, and PopSugar called her voice [...] "priceless". They were also positive about Stevens' storyline, saying: [...] "At first it seemed super annoying but was pretty sweet {{by the end of the}} episode." [...] PopSugar also enjoyed Lexie's storyline, commenting that [...] "she proves her worth in the end".|$|E
500|$|Next we see {{black and}} white clips of Keys, who is wearing large hoop-earrings with high heels, a black shirt and pants, playing a Yamaha piano that has {{an image of the}} Statue of Liberty on it. She is singing her verse of the song in a street at night while cars drive by.

Some people, such as <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> walking around New York or wearing Yankee emblems, have their faces shown or blurred out. Keys and Jay-Z, both wearing sunglasses at night, are then shown performing the song together as the video continues to be intercut with clips of them performing [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] individually, as well as images of New York. The video ends with color vision of the duo performing at night on the red glass steps forming the roof of the TKTS pavilion in Times Square.

500|$|The 2004–05 NHL {{season was}} locked out and {{eventually}} cancelled {{because of a}} labour dispute between the league and its players. In January 2005, Bettman commented that he was hesitant to allow league participation in the Olympics {{because he did not}} like the idea of stopping play mid-season after the cancellation of the previous season. The lockout was resolved in July 2005 and the newly negotiated NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement allowed league participation in the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics. Some NHL team owners were against their players participating in the tournament because of concerns about injury or exhaustion. Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider commented that [...] "I'm a believer in the Olympics and I think it's good for the NHL to participate, having said that, the people who participate should be the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> absolutely healthy." [...] Some NHL players used the break as an opportunity to rest and did not participate in the tournament, and several players were injured during the Olympics and were forced to miss NHL games. Bettman said that several format changes were being discussed so that the tournament would be [...] "a little easier for everybody".|$|E
500|$|Since 1983, Shearer {{has been}} {{the host of the}} public radio comedy/music program Le Show. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the [...] "mega morons of the mighty media". It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio {{stations}} throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on {{the news of the day}} after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is just running around talking. They are the <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> actually doing something, changing people's lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls 'satirists' don't work that way." ...|$|E
