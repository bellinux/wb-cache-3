5|$|As {{a result}} of the mutiny, the {{division}} was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training. During the training phase, the German officers, pleased with its progress, coined the term Mujo for the Bosnian Muslims. The members of the division swore an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to both Hitler and Pavelić.|$|E

He was elected county judge of Bourbon County, a post he held until his death in 1877.|$|E

5|$|Not all Texans favored secession initially, {{although}} many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state Governor, Sam Houston. Not wanting to aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office.

Apart from Fadl, Abu'l-Aswar had four more sons—Ashot, Iskandar, Manuchihr, and Marzuban—as well as an unnamed daughter, wife of the Shirvanshah Sallar.|$|E

5|$|Around 1210, Theodore {{was invited}} by his {{half-brother}} Michael I Komnenos Doukas to Epirus, where Michael had founded an independent Greek principality. Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as his only son, the future Michael II Komnenos Doukas, was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers {{were considered to}} lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to himself and his heirs. Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married Maria Petraliphaina, {{with whom he had}} four children.|$|E
5|$|George Calvert {{went up to}} Trinity College at Oxford University, matriculating in 1593/94, {{where he}} studied foreign {{languages}} and received a bachelor's degree in 1597. As the <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> was compulsory {{after the age of}} sixteen, he would almost certainly have pledged conformity while at Oxford. The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert's early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at Lincoln's Inn for three years.|$|E
5|$|Hawes {{remained}} at Nelly's Ford until May 1865. Finally satisfied {{that it was}} safe to return to Kentucky, Hawes arrived in Paris to find his home had been burned by Union troops. Four of Hawes's sons served in the Confederate Army, including brigadier general James Morrison Hawes; only three sons returned home from the war. On September 18, 1865, Hawes took an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the United States, and was allowed to return to his previous career as a lawyer.|$|E

The Second Reading speech for the Bill explained: The object of the bill is to amend the Constitution Act 1902 to give a member of the Legislative Council, the Legislative Assembly or the Executive Council the option of taking or making an <b>oath</b> or affirmation <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors {{as an alternative to the}} pledge of loyalty to Australia and the people of New South Wales. Taking the pledge of loyalty is currently required before a member of Parliament can sit or vote and before a member of the Executive Council can assume office...|$|R

5|$|In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs {{founded the}} Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. Trade unions were legal {{but because the}} members swore an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance,</b> they were arrested and tried in the Shire Hall. Beneath the {{courtroom}} are cells where the prisoners were held while awaiting trial. Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013. Plans have since been made to erect 189 dwellings and a museum on the site.|$|E
5|$|In January 1861, Missouri {{called a}} {{convention}} {{to determine whether}} it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and secede from the Union. Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists. The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority. Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> required by the federal government. As a result of his refusal, he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of this confrontation, Henry {{unexpectedly}} fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt. It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry said about the succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested that Henry had reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued that Henry had renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons to swear an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to her.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{obtained}} IRO {{membership in}} secrecy: the initiation ritual involved a formal <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> over the Gospel or a Christian cross, {{a gun and}} a knife; treason was punishable by death, and secret police monitored each member's activities. Through clandestine channels of reliable people, relations were maintained with the revolutionary diasporic community. The internal correspondence employed encryption, conventional signs, and fake personal and committee names. Although Levski himself headed the organisation, he shared administrative responsibilities with assistants such as monk-turned-revolutionary Matey Preobrazhenski, the adventurous Dimitar Obshti, and the young Angel Kanchev.|$|E
5|$|Morehead {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Louisville, but feared his refusal to take an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the Constitution would lead to another arrest. In June 1862, he fled to Canada, then to Europe, and finally to Mexico. Following the war, Morehead {{returned to}} the United States and lived on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi. He died there on December 21, 1868 and was buried on the grounds. On May 31, 1879, he was reburied in the Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of the arrest of former governor Charles S. Morehead by federal authorities, Helm fled to Bowling Green, fearing his own arrest. Through the intervention of Warner Underwood {{he was able to}} return home on the condition that he swear an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the Constitution. Nevertheless, federal soldiers repeatedly entered his home, encouraging his slaves to abandon him, and consuming or destroying his crops. Because the state's courts were closed on account of the war, he was unable to earn a living by practicing law. In short order his once-substantial fortune was expended, and he resorted to borrowing money to support his family.|$|E

6000|$|William {{was more}} {{troubled by the}} General Assembly, which refused to take <b>oaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> {{to him and his}} wife, and {{actually}} appointed a date for an Assembly without his consent. When he gave it, it was on condition that the members should take the <b>oaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance.</b> They refused: it was the old deadlock, but William at the last moment withdrew from the imposition <b>of</b> <b>oaths</b> <b>of</b> allegiance--moved, it is said, by Mr Carstares, [...] "Cardinal Carstares," [...] who had been privy to the Rye House Plot. Under Queen Anne, however, the conscientious preachers were compelled to take the oaths like mere laymen.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{having the}} stronger, more {{powerful}} army, Carinus held the weaker position. His rule was unpopular, {{and it was}} later alleged that he had mistreated the Senate and seduced his officers' wives. It is possible that Flavius Constantius, the governor of Dalmatia and Diocletian's associate in the household guard, had already defected to Diocletian in the early spring. When the Battle of the Margus began, Carinus' prefect Aristobulus also defected. In {{the course of the}} battle, Carinus was killed by his own men. Following Diocletian's victory, both the western and the eastern armies acclaimed him augustus. Diocletian exacted an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> from the defeated army and departed for Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from {{the leadership and}} highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party. In that year's general election, Lionel de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. As a practising Jew he could not take the <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was {{concluded}} between the British Government {{and representatives of}} the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an <b>oath</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> to the King was to be taken. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Oaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Allegiance</b> and Supremacy Act 1688 (1 Will. & Mar., c. 8) was an Act of the Parliament of England {{passed in}} the {{aftermath}} of the Glorious Revolution. The Act required all office-holders, Members of Parliament and clergy to take the <b>oaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> and supremacy for the new monarchs, William III and Mary II. The Archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft, five bishops and approximately four hundred lower clergy refused to take the oaths because they believed their oaths to James II were still valid. The Act thus triggered the nonjuring schism in the Church of England. The non-jurors were deprived of their offices.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> are {{commonly}} required of newly naturalised citizens (see <b>Oath</b> <b>of</b> Citizenship), {{members of the}} armed forces, and those assuming public (particularly parliamentary and judicial) office.
