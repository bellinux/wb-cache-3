Analogue community television is watched by over 3 million Australians in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Lismore and Mt Gambier. These stations (generally located on Channel 31) have not been allowed to broadcast digitally. To do so, they would need to be allocated extra spectrum (another channel) and funds to meet the transmission costs. As more households purchase digital television receivers, the community television audience will continue to diminish. At some point, program-makers will pack away their video cameras and sponsors will close their cheque books. Without digital simulcast, community television will not last long...|$|E

40|$|While you {{probably}} associate {{the title of}} this paper with credit card commercials, we suggest it is actually an invitation to some pretty interesting mathematics. Every day, when customers spend cash for purchases, they exchange coins. There are a variety of ways a spender may determine which coins from their wallet to give a cashier in a transaction, and of course a given spender may not use the same algorithm every time. In this paper, however, we make some simplifying assumptions so that we can provide an answer to the question ‘What is the expected number of coins in your wallet?’. Of course, the answer depends <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>live!</b> A currency is a set of de-nominations. We’ll focus on the currency consisting of the common coins in the United States, which are the quarter (25 cents), dime (10 cents), nickel (5 cents), and penny (1 cent). However, we invite you to grab your passport and carry out the computations for other currencies. Since we are interested in distributions of coins, we will consider prices modulo 100 cents, in the range 0 to 99. The contents of your wallet largely depend on how you choose which coins to us...|$|E

Depending <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>live,</b> your race, your gender, your class position, and the composition of your family, the support you seek is likely to arrive, if it arrives at all, in radically different packages.

40|$|Travelling from Bergen to {{a village}} in Uganda I {{wondered}} how my journey was going to be. The last mile in Bergen is well served with infrastructure. One can choose to call a taxi, use the bus or use the tram. The means of transport is a choice between convenience and cost. At the airport, there are large aircrafts that carry passengers to their destination. So the journey from Bergen to Entebbe, Uganda is on a high-speed international airway route and takes about 12 hours to reach Entebbe Airport. On arrival at Entebbe, the available means of transport are private cars or taxis. A taxi takes me to the bus terminal where I board for the upcountry district of Busia – the kind of rural environment where 80 % of Ugandans live. As I move through the country side, I begin to contrast Norway and Uganda.

40|$|How {{much water}} is {{there on the}} planet? If our planet were {{perfectly}} flat and its water covered all the surface, it would create a layer 2. 7 kilometers deep. While this seems like a lot, less than 3 % of that is freshwater. Of that, nearly 70 % is in ice caps, glaciers, and permanent snow, and 30 % sits in ground water. Rivers, lakes, and clouds carry less than 1 % of the world's freshwater. Is there enough water to go around? It depends <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>live.</b> Every individual requires an estimated minimum of 1, 000 cubic metres of water per year, to grow food and meet drinking and hygiene needs (See Water facts). Global water sources vary widely; some areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa, regularly suffer from water scarcity and are unable to meet this requirement. Why is it an issue? More than 1 billion people lack access to potable water and 2. 6 billion {{do not have access}} to adequate sanitation, according to the World Health Organization. A lack of clean water forces people to use unsafe water, which affects health and increases the incidence of diseases like cholera and dysentery.

40|$|The waste {{fractions}} {{offered to}} households in Sweden differ depending <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>live.</b> The {{responsibility for the}} waste are grounded by the Swedish law where the municipality {{are responsible for the}} collection of household waste and FTI are responsible for collecting all packages and papers that the households sorts out. A new waste regulation is under consideration where the responsibility for the household waste may change. The bulky waste from households is collected at recycling centers where the households leave it in different containers for different fractions. These recycling centers are formed different and the fractions offered in them also differ depending on in what municipality they are located. The reason for the difference seems to depend on the opportunity to recycle the fraction and cross-border cooperation does not seem to exist in any larger scale. The waste fraction offered as FNI also differ depending on municipality where some are offering different fractions while other only offers compostable and combustible waste fractions. The municipality has reached different levels on their work towards better waste management according to the waste stair where reuse and recycling are preferred before another disposal. This often lead to energy recycling of the waste where over half of the Swedish treated waste end up. Materials that are often transported to energy recycling are textiles and thermosetting plastic where the plastic can be and are recycled in about 20 municipalities. The authorities and some companies are investigating the possibility to recycle textiles and they {{have found a way to}} recycle cotton fibres but in order to build a factory for that there need to collect larger volumes than are collected today. I will investigate if there is a need for more fractions than those offered to the households today...|$|E
40|$|In {{the society}} there is {{different}} kind of people that belongs to different groups. The different groups that people belong to are depending <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>live,</b> grow up, ethnic group, level of education and which economic standard you have. The subject of our composition is about children and teenager growth environment and about what society they belong to and how it affects their possibility to exercise. Our composition is built from the question: Are there any differences connected to exercise in an association compared to spontaneous exercise based on economic standard and what district of the city you live? To {{be able to find}} an answer to our question we have chosen to concentrate on three districts in the city of Helsingborg. These districts are different when it comes to ethnic groups, level of education and level of income. We have chosen to use a quantitative method when we were distributing questionnaire to three schools in the chosen districts. The questionnaire we distributed to one of each class in grade 4 - 6 in these districts. We also made an observation in these districts which gave us an insight in which possibilities of sports and possibilities to do spontaneous exercises and activities, can be offered {{in each of the three}} districts. In the questionnaire we asked for example about membership in a sport-association, how often they were exercising and if they exercised spontaneous. Our examination is grounded on Pierre Bourdieus concept habitus. Children’s sportshabitus is grounded in their early childhood and is strongly affected by the environment were the children grow up. The result from the questionnaire showed that children in the strongly socioeconomic district Laröd, often were member to more than one sport-association, which differs a lot from the weaker socioeconomic Drottninghög, were especially the girls were underrepresented. The district of Berga which more is in the middle has almost as many girls as boys that were members in a sport-association and there were also children performing unusually sports like archery and bowling. Fotball, was a sport that most children were practicing. Drottninghög offered great possibility for spontaneous exercises and it was also the district that had the highest share of performers. Berga had the lowest share of spontaneous exercise, properly because of the districts limited offer. The result shows that children from different socioeconomically districts differ when it comes to membership in a sport-association and the amount of spontaneous exercise...|$|E
40|$|Sweden {{has several}} villages where, {{in case of}} emergency, {{the time for the}} fire {{department}} to arrive is more than 15 minutes. The Swedish law says that the fire department should be available for the entire Swedish population but the resources are limited. Therefore it is not possible for the fire department {{to reach out to the}} whole community in the same time. The aim should still be equal right to be helped in the shortest time as possible for every person, independent <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>live.</b> To achieve this, the rescue services must aim for constant efficiency of the rescue effort. This report is focusing to examine if the method CIP, civilian rescue-operations persons, can affect the response time positively in the countryside of Luleå älvdal. Ekerö fire department constructed the concept CIP three years ago. The method was invented to reduce the response time in case of emergency and make use of qualified civilian persons in the area. The main purpose with the method is to have someone as soon as possible at the accident scene, and help the person in need. The concept CIP has been successful, the result shows that CIP arrives within a fifth of the time, compared to the fire department. Studies show that the economic benefit is high when the response time is decreased e. g. 10 minutes is equal to 500 000 SEK in severe cases. The literature search showed that there is not much documentation on the subject on how the Swedish rescue teams work to shorten the response time in rural areas. A computer simulation in ArcGIS was made to see if CIP can be applied in Luleå älvdal. As a complement to the literature search and the simulation a qualitative interview study was conducted. This report contains 3. 55. 5 years statistics of three types of accidents that are considered the most time critical: fire in building, traffic accidents and drowning. These types of accidents require a fast response time to save lives and mitigate damage to properties and to the environment. The simulation in the study shows that there is a lot of time to save if CIP were applied in the area of Luleå älvdal. In some cases, CIP arrived at the accident site 27 minutes before the fire department. A validation was also executed that compared the actual cases in Ekerö where CIP acted with the simulated time. It showed that the simulation data in the report is an accurate method to measure driving times. The study indicates that CIP can be applied in Luleå älvdal. The report also shows that it is necessary, in a sparsely populated area like Luleå älvdal, not to only use Public Safety qualified persons but also civilians with other professions with the possible introduction of CIP. CIP needs to be prepared for the tasks with a certified education, regarding their safety and possible emergencies, a conclusion that all interviewee reasoned about. It is important to be aware of the risk that comes with being first at the scene of an accident. Validerat; 20160124 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
