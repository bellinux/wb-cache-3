5|$|Until 1860, {{the only}} known dodo remains were the four {{incomplete}} 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp,</b> feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp,</b> where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|E

They aim at selling their catch to the markets in Copperbelt cities. In this paper, fishing methods used by them are described, and the catch by each method are analyzed. <b>The</b> <b>swamp</b> fishermen carry their fishing {{not only in the}} daytime, but also engage in night fishing, by which they can get nocturnal fishes effectively. They form the production units called nsanga mainly through their affinity for fishing and selling their catch. The fishing methods selected by them differ from nsanga to nsanga in a fishing camp, accordingly, the fishing period, time and caught species also vary. Such utilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> can be regarded as a segregation among <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> fishermen...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp.</b> Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
5|$|The {{final section}} of Highway416 travels {{parallel}} to Cedarview Road, which was relocated for the freeway. The Stony Swamp lies {{west of the}} route while farmland lies to the east. At the northern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp</b> is an interchange with West Hunt Club Road. The freeway continues through a section of greenspace before descending gently into a trench. It passes beneath Bruin Road and the Ottawa Central Railway while traveling alongside Lynwood Village in Bells Corners. The highway is crossed by Baseline Road and Richmond Road; the former provides an onramp to southbound Highway416. The freeway ends at a large interchange with the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway417 (Exit131), {{just south of the}} Lakeview and Bayshore communities on the Ottawa River; downtown Ottawa is to the east and Kanata is to the west.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, after {{a hundred}} years of neglect, {{a part of the}} Mare aux Songes swamp was {{excavated}} by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct Cylindraspis genus, and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamp,</b> few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.|$|E

25|$|The first {{settlers}} to {{the area}} were farmers. Life was not easy for the farmers. The land was very swampy and very difficult to reclaim.

The swamps were infested with mosquitoes that brought yellow fever to the settlers.|$|E

During its first 50 years the city's population only grew (on average) with eight people per year. The city did become the capital of the newly founded county consisting of the provinces Jämtland and Härjedalen in 1810, meaning that a county residence was built and a county administrative board was located to the city. Though Östersund remained as a de facto farmer village with less than 400 inhabitants in 1820. An upswing occurred in the 1850s, as trade was liberalized and the logging process developed.|$|E

Sensitivity experiments reveal that, relative to bare soil conditions, <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> act to locally modify the surface energy budget primarily through an increase of surface latent heat flux. Existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>swamps</b> leads to lower ground temperature (up to 2 °C), a larger north–south temperature gradient, and increased local rainfall (up to 40 %).

25|$|In 1953, the Screen Actors Guild {{agreed to}} a {{residuals}} payment plan that greatly facilitated the distribution of B movies to television. A number of local television stations around the United States soon began showing inexpensive genre films in late-night slots; these late-night slots were after the safe-harbor time, meaning they were largely exempt from Federal Communications Commission regulations on indecent content. In the spring of 1954, Los Angeles TV station KABC expanded on the concept by having an appropriately offbeat host introduce the films: for a year on Saturday nights, The Vampira Show, with Maila Nurmi in her newly adopted persona of a sexy bloodsucker ("Your pin-down girl"), presented low-budget movies with black humor and a low-cut black dress. The show—which ran at midnight for four weeks before shifting to 11 p.m. and, later, 10:30—aired horror pictures like Devil Bat's Daughter and Strangler <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Swamp</b> and suspense films such as Murder by Invitation, The Charge Is Murder, and Apology for Murder. The format was echoed by stations across the country, who began showing their late-night B movies with in-character hosts such as Zacherley and Morgus the Magnificent offering ironic interjections.|$|E
