He beat off three counter-attacks and worked his gun single-handed after all his men, except two belt-fillers, had become casualties. For three hours he held the gap under very heavy fire and when his gun was knocked out, he and his two belt-fillers held their ground with rifles until ordered to withdraw. With help he then brought back his gun, ammunition and one severely wounded man, and finally all remaining arms and equipment.|$|E

25|$|With the {{knowledge}} he had gained from his studies in Paris, Copland came into demand as a lecturer and writer on contemporary European classical music. From 1927 to 1930 and 1935 to 1938, he taught classes at The New School of Social Research in New York City. Eventually, his New School lectures {{would appear in}} the form of two books—What to Listen for in Music (1937, revised 1957) and <b>Our</b> <b>New</b> Music (1940, revised 1968 and retitled The New Music: 1900–1960). During this period, Copland also wrote regularly for The New York Times, The Musical Quarterly {{and a number of other}} journals. These articles would appear in 1969 as the book Copland on Music.|$|E

500|$|Originating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s {{rock and}} roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre, and their {{repertoire}} ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music.
