5000|$|Over 15 {{species of}} moths are {{referred}} to with the common name <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller,</b> approximately three-fifths from the Tortricidae family, but also from four other families. According to the United States Forest Service, Archips semiferanus is the [...] "most important oak leafroller" [...] of these species; other common <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> species such as Archips argyrosplilus and Choristoneura fractivittana are commonly found on oak trees, but do not cause the damage that A. semiferanus does.|$|E
50|$|Argyrotaenia quercifoliana, the yellow-winged <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> moth, is {{a species}} of moth of the Tortricidae family. It is found in eastern North America.|$|E
50|$|The spring <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> (Chionodes formosella) is a moth of the Gelechiidae family. It {{is found}} in North America from Nova Scotia to {{south-western}} Manitoba, south to Florida.|$|E
50|$|Archips semiferanus {{is found}} in the eastern United States and {{adjoining}} portions of southeastern Canada. It has been found in US states including Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. They may have been introduced to the United Kingdom. The <b>oak</b> <b>leafrollers</b> feed on all types of oak trees, but are especially prone to infestations in northern red oak, scarlet oak, and species found on mountain and ridge tops such as chestnut oak and white oak. In addition to oaks, Archips semiferanus have been known to feed on witchhazel and apple trees occasionally. In addition to the <b>oak</b> <b>leafrollers,</b> other pest species will often feed on the same oak trees, including Croesia semipurpurana and other oak leaftiers.|$|R
50|$|In Texas, {{the timing}} of the various stages of the life cycle starts earlier, and other {{differences}} in behavior are seen. Since spring comes earlier in Texas, the eggs are laid in May and hatch in mid-March of the next year. The larvae can be dislodged from trees and dangle beneath them from silk threads. Although the larvae can not harm humans, most people in Texas will avoid walking under oak trees to avoid them. The pupae of <b>oak</b> <b>leafrollers</b> in Texas are also found on branch tips and weeds near the tree.|$|R
5000|$|Acleris semipurpurana {{is found}} in the eastern United States and {{adjoining}} portions of southeastern Canada. It has been found in US states ranging from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Pennsylvania in the northeast to Minnesota and Texas in the west, as well as the Canadian province of Ontario. The oak leaftiers feed mainly trees in the Lobatae or red oak section of Quercus or oak trees: Specifically on eastern black oak, northern red oak, pin oak, scarlet oak, and scrub oak. Several species of moths are referred to with the common name oak leaftier, most from the Tortricidae family, but also from [...] "three other minor families". Of these species Acleris semipurpurana is the most common {{and one of the most}} important for defoliation. In addition to the oak leaftiers, other pest species will often feed on the same trees, including Archips semiferanus and other <b>oak</b> <b>leafrollers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as spring <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller,</b> although the larvae do not feed on oak species. Furthermore, this common name is also applied to Chionodes formosella.|$|E
5000|$|Tortrix sinapina, the Japanese <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller,</b> is {{a species}} of moth of the Tortricidae family. It {{is found in the}} Russian Far East (Ussuri), China (Zhejiang) and Japan (Honshu, Hokkaido).|$|E
50|$|The green oak tortrix, Tortrix viridana, {{also known}} as the European <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> and the green oak moth is a {{distinctive}} green moth whose larvae feed on tree leaves, especially oak.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, nest {{boxes were}} erected, {{in the hope}} that pied flycatchers would control <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> moths, which were defoliating trees. These boxes have been {{continually}} monitored since 1948, making it the world's longest running bird breeding programme.|$|E

50|$|Archips semiferanus (also {{known as}} Archips semiferana) is {{a species of}} moth in the family Tortricidae, and one of several species of moth {{commonly}} known as <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> or oak leaf roller. The larvae feed on the leaves of oak trees in the Eastern United States and southeastern Canada and are a major defoliator of oak trees, {{which can lead to}} tree mortality. In Pennsylvania in the late 1960s and early 1970s, oak leafrollers defoliated over 1045000 acre.|$|E
50|$|Until it {{was banned}} in the United States in 1972, the {{pesticide}} DDT was used to control outbreaks. In 1974 the United States Forest Service tested four insecticides on <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> larvae as replacements for DDT and found that less than 1 microgram of each (bioethanomethrin, mexacarbate, phoxim, and pyrethrins) caused 90 percent mortality. Natural predators that feed on the larvae include parasitic wasps and bird species such as mockingbirds. The sex pheremones of the species have been studied as well.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> moths {{lay their}} eggs in July each year, in groups of 40 to 50. The female covers the eggs with hairs from her body; they are {{deposited}} on [...] "the base of large branches and rough bark patches on both tree trunks and limbs". The flat egg masses are white-gray in color and oval shaped, and are about 4.8 mm across. The eggs overwinter and hatch in spring of the next year. The larvae (or caterpillars) emerge in April and initially eat the buds of oak trees and young leaves inside them.|$|E
5000|$|Tiadaghton State Forest {{in north}} central Pennsylvania was {{especially}} hard hit. [...] In Pennsylvania {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, oak leafrollers defoliated over 1045000 acre and in 1975 the Bureau of Forestry reported [...] "The value of oak timber lost from the outbreak has now exceeded $100,000,000." [...] Hikers in the Quehanna Wild Area in northern Pennsylvania were warned {{to be careful with}} campfires as the large numbers of dead oak trees on the Allegheny Plateau from <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> were a fire hazard. In 2001 recent outbreaks had occurred in Cambria, Cameron, Clearfield, Clinton, and Warren counties in Pennsylvania.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{addressed}} to {{the investigation of the}} influence of individual properties of a fodder plant Quercus pubescens Willd. on the variability of fitness-important features in genotype classes of <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> moths Tortrіx vіrіdana L. and on the moths’ interaction with parasites. The interaction of the factors describing the pubescent oak individuality and the leafroller genetics contributes up to 22  % in males’ and 42  % in females’ total variability of the fitness-important features. Parasite Itoplectis maculator F. chooses the leafroller pupae in dependence on their sizes. Specific features of particular fodder plant determine this selective choice in relation to alternative genotypes of the <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> moth...|$|E
30|$|The {{forests in}} {{southern}} Hessen {{in the vicinity}} of the Rhine-Main urban agglomeration are among the most problematic forest areas for forest management in Central Europe. Here extraordinary demands are made on forests and forest enterprises in view of the high population density, highly concentrated industrialization and dense road and traffic infrastructure. Urban agglomeration has led to the acquisition of considerable land area for development, which, in turn, has led to an unusually high fragmentation of the forest area. Furthermore environmental impacts, including an increase in emissions of air pollutants and the serious lowering of the groundwater table arising from high water usage, are evident. Forestry management options are severely restricted in this region due to the exceptional importance of forests, particularly old oak forests, for recreation and nature conservation (NW-FVA, Nordwestdeutsche Forstliche Versuchsanstalt Hrsg. [2013]): p. 32  ff.). The abiotic pressures and especially the wide-spread drop in groundwater levels have already degraded many forests. Additionally, the massive outbreaks of biotic pests like the forest cockchafer (Melolontha hippocastani), the European <b>oak</b> <b>leafroller</b> (Tortrix viridana) and the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) have in part led to a total destruction of forests in some areas. It is anticipated that site conditions will degrade further in the future if the groundwater depletion intensifies and if climate change leads to higher temperatures and lower precipitation as projected (NW-FVA, Nordwestdeutsche Forstliche Versuchsanstalt Hrsg. [2013]): p. 40  ff.). Already the Rhine-Main region is one of driest and warmest regions in Hessen.|$|E
