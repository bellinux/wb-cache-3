5|$|Before Báthory's {{election}} to the throne of the Commonwealth, Ivan the Terrible of Russia had begun encroaching on its sphere <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast, eventually invading the Commonwealth borderlands in Livonia; the conflict would grow to involve a number of nearby powers (outside Russia and Poland-Lithuania, also Sweden, the Kingdom of Livonia and Denmark-Norway). Each of them was vying for control of Livonia, and the resulting conflict, lasting for several years, {{became known as the}} Livonian War. By 1577 Ivan was in control of most of the disputed territory, but his conquest was short-lived. In 1578 Commonwealth forces scored a number of victories in Liviona and begun pushing Ivan's forces back; this marked the turning point in the war. Báthory, together with his chancellor Zamoyski, led the army of the Commonwealth in a series of decisive campaigns taking Polotsk in 1579 and Velikiye Luki in 1580.|$|E

As balloting continued over the next four days (Sunday excepted) with no candidate receiving a majority, Brown continued to receive a few votes on each ballot. Finally, the convention delegates decided to drop the candidate with the lowest vote total until one candidate received a majority; this resulted in the nomination of Goebel a few ballots later.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, women's {{football}} was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. When the DFB appointed Gero Bisanz to coach the newly founded women's national team, he was initially very reluctant about his assignment and feared it would harm his reputation. Winning the 1989 European Championship was the team's first international success, but it had little lasting effect on their popularity. As a gift for the first European trophy, every player received a tea set, which is often cited {{as an example of}} male chauvinism and general lack <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> women's national team at that time. This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last two decades, in particular during the term of Theo Zwanziger as DFB president, an outspoken supporter of women's football.|$|E

His business manufactured and sold a variety of chemicals and laboratory equipment. Accum, himself, gave fee-based public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science.|$|E

In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty {{in the same building}} in which federal judges were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E

5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E
