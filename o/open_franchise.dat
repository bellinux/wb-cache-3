50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, many of the smaller {{commercial}} banks within New England were easily chartered as laws allowed to do so (primarily due to <b>open</b> <b>franchise</b> laws). The rise of commercial banking saw an increase in opportunities for entrepreneurs to borrow capital used to grow an enterprise. The small private banking sector saw a great deal of insider lending. Many of these banks actually spurred early investment and helped spur many later projects. Despite what some may consider discriminatory practices with insider lending, these banks actually were very sound and failures remained uncommon, further encouraging the financial evolution in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Kenneth Sokoloff and Stanley Engerman {{argue in}} their article [...] "History Lessons: Institutions, Factor Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World" [...] that the {{difference}} between North America {{and the rest of the}} New World was not just in institutions but in the nature of their respective factor endowments. Countries like Brazil and Cuba had an extremely large yet concentrated factor endowment that tended toward exploitation, a hierarchical social system and exhibited economies of scale. Cuba and Brazil primarily grew lucrative products such as cotton, coffee, and sugar, which required hand picking and most efficiently picked when picked by hands in unison, whereas the United States was generally a wheat producer. The true advantage of the United States and Canada lay in a more equitable distribution of factors that could not be exploited on an extremely large scale. This distribution led to a more open and opportunistic economy, and eventually to long-term prosperity. For example, because wealth and power were distributed relatively equally in the United States and in Canada, these two countries led the rest of the Americas in providing education on a broader scale. Education is an important factor to improve technology in order to boost productivity, which is the reason that US and Canada surpassed the others. Greater access to education allowed for greater investment in human capital, which increases productivity and contributed to the United States and Canada's economic growth. According to Sokoloff and Engerman's article [...] "History Lessons: Institutions, Factors Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World," [...] not only the United States had relatively equal distribution of wealth, it had relatively homogeneous population, political power and human capital. United States and Canada's relatively equal distribution of wealth, amount of human capital and political power ultimately affected development of institution, extent of franchise, and public education that persist and influence growth of the country. The <b>open</b> <b>franchise</b> in the United States and Canada was possible due to the large voting body of middle class and small elites. The <b>open</b> <b>franchise</b> brought elimination of wealth and literary requirement by 1940 in Canada and the United States (literacy requirement was still enforced in US southern regions only). Again, the <b>open</b> <b>franchise</b> was possible because the United States endowed a land suitable for wheat growing thus had a large body of middle class unlike Brazil and Cuba where they exhibited small elites, some overseers and large slave population. United States, then, outgrows other New World countries and eventually diverged from Cuba and Brazil in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, many of the smaller {{commercial}} banks within New England were easily chartered as laws allowed to do so (primarily due to <b>open</b> <b>franchise</b> laws). The rise of commercial banking saw an increase in opportunities for wealthy individuals to become involved in entrepreneurial projects in which they would not involve themselves without a guaranteed return on their investment. These early banks acted as intermediaries for entrepreneurs who did not have enough wealth to fund their own investment projects and for those who did have wealth but did not want to bear the risk of investing in projects. Thus, this private banking sector witnessed an array of insider lending, due primarily to low bank leverage and an information quality correlation, but many of these banks actually spurred early investment and helped spur many later projects. Despite what some may consider discriminatory practices with insider lending, these banks actually were very sound and failures remained uncommon, further encouraging the financial evolution in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Engerman co-authored {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "History Lessons: Institutions, Factor Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World" [...] with Kenneth Sokoloff, {{which can be}} found in The Journal of Economic Perspectives. Sokoloff and Engerman go in-depth and argue that the economic trajectory of former New World colonies over the past 300 years was largely determined by various facets of their natural environments. Sokoloff and Engerman focus mainly on the effects of the colonies' soil qualities. Sokoloff and Engerman claim that in areas such as Cuba which possessed land suitable for sugar and coffee, the soil quality led to economies of scale and plantation agriculture and slave labor. This in turn led to a guarded franchise, high tax rates, and limits on education. In areas such as the United States which possessed land suitable for wheat, the soil quality led to small scale farming and relatively equal distributions of wealth. This in turn led to an <b>open</b> <b>franchise</b> and broad public education. Sokoloff and Engerman conclude that areas such as the United States, which emphasized equality and access to public education, were able to progress faster economically than areas such as Cuba which did not allow such opportunities to its residents.|$|E
