2500|$|This discredited theory {{regarding}} the rarity of pregnancy from rape originated with Fred Mecklenburg in 1972. While serving as assistant clinical professor <b>of</b> <b>Obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gynecology</b> <b>at</b> the University of Minnesota Medical School, Mecklenburg {{published an article}} entitled [...] "The Indications for Induced Abortion: A Physician's Perspective". He wrote that pregnancy resulting from rape is [...] "extremely rare", that during rape sexual intercourse is not always successfully completed, that the probability of rape coinciding with a woman's ovulation period is low, and that rape-induced trauma impedes ovulation. At times the theory has been reversed and it has instead been non-falsifiably claimed that cases of pregnancy distinguish [...] "real" [...] rape from other acts. This suggestion is also widely seen as being discredited.|$|E

2500|$|From the 1960s to the 1980s, {{alcohol was}} {{commonly}} {{used as a}} tocolytic, a method to stop preterm labor. The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, {{the chairman of the}} department <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> <b>at</b> Cornell University Medical College. Doctors recommended a small amount of alcohol to calm the uterus during contractions in early pregnancy or Braxton Hicks contractions. In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. [...] "Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued." [...] Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was [...] "a brutal procedure for all involved." [...] Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible. Such heavy intoxication is highly likely to contribute to FASD.|$|E
2500|$|With Acu-Gen {{choosing}} not {{to publish}} proof of its claims and evidence of several women receiving inaccurate predictions, doctors {{are concerned about the}} test. [...] Among the scientific evidence cited by Acu-Gen's web site is a paper co-authored by Diana Bianchi, an expert on fetal DNA at Tufts University. The NPR story quoted Bianchi as saying, [...] "I think at the present time we need to be concerned whether the test is accurate or not", and [...] "I think it's caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware." [...] Another criticism has come from Sandra Carson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology and involved in research in sex selection. Carson says, [...] "Until Acu-Gen releases its data, there's no way to know the test's reliability. [...] Until that's out, I think it shouldn't be on the market." [...] Carson at that time was at the Baylor College of Medicine. [...] Dr. Charles Lockwood, chairman <b>of</b> <b>obstetrics</b> <b>and</b> <b>gynecology</b> <b>at</b> Yale School of Medicine, said that it is possible for fetal DNA to be found in maternal blood as soon as the placenta has developed, and that detection after five weeks [...] "is not impossible" [...] and the president of Acu-Gen said the suit was [...] "totally bogus".|$|E
