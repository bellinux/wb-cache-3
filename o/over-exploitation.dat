5|$|P. l. europaea, {{known as}} the European lion, was {{probably}} identical with Panthera leo persica or Panthera leo spelea. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and <b>over-exploitation.</b> It inhabited the Balkans, the Italian Peninsula, southern France, and the Iberian Peninsula. It was a very popular object of hunting among ancient Romans and Greeks.|$|E
5|$|The Dalmatian pelican is {{the rarest}} species with a {{population}} estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with overhead power lines and the <b>over-exploitation</b> of fish stocks. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia where it is nearly extinct. However, several colonies are increasing in size and the colony at the Small Prespa Lake in Greece has nearly 1000 breeding pairs.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the epaulette shark as of Least Concern. This species {{is common in}} Australian waters, where it is not captured by either commercial or recreational fisheries, and is minimally affected by collection for the aquarium trade and fishery bycatch. Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks. Off New Guinea, the epaulette shark has been assessed as Near Threatened, as there it faces habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices, and <b>over-exploitation</b> by artisan fishers.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, <b>over-exploitation,</b> pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent <b>over-exploitation.</b> They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese dogfish is {{too small}} and occurs too deep to pose a danger to humans. This species has long been commercially fished, using hook-and-line, gillnets, and trawls. It is mainly valued for its liver, which {{contains}} 2249% squalene by weight and is processed for vitamins. The meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, or converted into fishmeal. An important fishery for the Portuguese dogfish exists in Suruga Bay for liver oil; catches peaked during World War II, but declined soon after from <b>over-exploitation.</b> In the past few years, catches by the South East Trawl Fishery off Australia have been increasing, as fishers have been seeking out species not covered by commercial quotas following the relaxation of seafood mercury regulations. Shark landings in this fishery are affected by a prohibition on landing livers without {{the rest of the}} carcass.|$|E
25|$|Hubbert's {{original}} analysis did {{not apply}} to renewable resources. However, <b>over-exploitation</b> often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless. A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.|$|E
25|$|An {{empirical}} {{study done}} by Ann M. Carlos and Frank D. Lewis shows that {{apart from the}} settling to {{a lower level of}} stable population, further declines were caused by over-harvesting in two of the three English trading posts (Albany and York). The data from the third trading post are also very interesting in that the post did not come under French pressure and was therefore shielded from the kind of <b>over-exploitation</b> of stocks which resulted at the other trading posts. At Fort Churchill, the stocks of beaver adjusted to the maximum sustained yield level. The data from Churchill further reinforce the case of <b>over-exploitation</b> of stocks caused by the French-English competition.|$|E
25|$|The {{resilience}} of many ecosystems {{is likely to}} be exceeded this century by an unprecedented combination of climate change, associated disturbances (e.g. flooding, drought, wildfire, insects, ocean acidification) and other global change drivers (e.g. land-use change, pollution, fragmentation of natural systems, <b>over-exploitation</b> of resources).|$|E
25|$|Article 61 {{requires}} all coastal {{states to}} ensure that the maintenance of living resources in their exclusive economic zones is not endangered by <b>over-exploitation.</b> The same article addresses the maintenance or restoration of populations of species above levels at which their reproduction may become seriously threatened.|$|E
25|$|The League of Nations raised {{concerns}} about the <b>over-exploitation</b> of whale stocks and called for conservation measures in 1925. This {{eventually led to the}} Geneva Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which was presented in 1931 but did not enter into force until 1934 and was completely ignored by Japan and Germany.|$|E
25|$|Threats to {{the grove}} include urbanization, <b>over-exploitation</b> of {{resources}} (like overgrazing and excessive firewood collection), and environmental destruction due to religious practices. While {{many of the}} groves are looked upon as abodes of Hindu gods, {{in the recent past}} a number of them have been partially cleared for construction of shrines and temples. Other threats to the sacred groves include invasion by invasive species, like the invasive weeds Chromolaena odorata, Lantana camara and Prosopis juliflora.|$|E
25|$|Military {{groups in}} the Spratlys have engaged in {{environmentally}} damaging activities such as shooting turtles and seabirds, raiding nests and fishing with explosives. The collection of rare medicinal plants, collecting of wood, and hunting for the wildlife trade are common threats to the biodiversity of the entire region, including these islands. Coral habitats are threatened by pollution, <b>over-exploitation</b> of fish and invertebrates, {{and the use of}} explosives and poisons as fishing techniques.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 IUCN Red List {{warns that}} {{long-term}} droughts and extreme weather put additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction, which is one-in-eight of all bird species. The Red List Index also identifies 44 tree species in Central Asia as {{under threat of}} extinction due to <b>over-exploitation</b> and human development and threatening the region's forests which are {{home to more than}} 300 wild ancestors of modern domesticated fruit and nut cultivars.|$|E
25|$|Two {{third of}} the country's {{population}} live in the lowlands, where the rich sediment deposited during the Mekong's annual flooding makes the agricultural lands highly fertile. As deforestation and <b>over-exploitation</b> affected Cambodia only in recent decades, forests, low mountain ranges and local eco-regions still retain much of their natural potential and although still home to the largest areas of contiguous and intact forests in mainland Southeast Asia, multiple serious environmental issues persist and accumulate, which {{are closely related to}} rapid population growth, uncontrolled globalization and inconsequent administration.|$|E
25|$|Political instability, {{tourism and}} the {{increasing}} industrialisation of neighbouring countries has led to serious disruption of native flora and fauna, <b>over-exploitation</b> of natural resources, and environmental pollution. Disruption of nesting areas by human activity and/or by introduced animals, such as dogs, has {{reduced the number of}} turtles nesting on the islands. Sea turtles are also slaughtered for food on a significant scale. The sea turtle is a symbol of longevity in Chinese culture and at times the military personnel are given orders to protect the turtles.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{proliferation}} of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied {{to the idea of}} human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not damaged. The <b>over-exploitation</b> of fishing stocks, for example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the future will derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on.|$|E
25|$|A broad {{consensus}} amongst fans is {{that the}} Star Trek franchise became formulaic and mediocre in the 1990s due to <b>over-exploitation</b> of the franchise by Paramount and production of multiple spin-offs and movies, though fans do not necessarily agree as to when this began (some adult viewers of TOS felt it also could be formulaic and repetitive). The release in May 2009 of Star Trek, a reboot involving characters from the original series and set in an alternate timeline, was developed with the partial hope to resurrect the franchise.|$|E
25|$|Although hunting, trapping, {{and killing}} of these iguanas is illegal {{throughout}} Mexico; the Balsas depression along {{the borders of}} the states Michoacán and Guerrero {{is one of the largest}} illegal hunting and trading areas. The remoteness of the areas and lack of enforcement of the laws is seen as the main reason. A study is being conducted by the Instituto de Biologia, UNAM, to solve the <b>over-exploitation</b> problem and to determine if the iguanas can be successfully farmed as a food source similar to the Green Iguana and the closely related Ctenosaura similis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Over-exploitation</b> of Lepironia articulata, or Grey Sedge, in the Thale Noi {{region has}} led to {{shortages}} in supply for local communities’ dependent on the plant as a primary source of income. This species is intensely harvested by over 1,000 local families (over 70% of working women), who use the stems for weaving into mats, baskets, bags and other handicraft items for sale. The cultivation of Lepironia articulata in the Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area does not require legal land tenure and little financial outlay, making it an attractive method of earning income for poor families.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the problem}} of the commons is also glaringly visible in this matter. Open access to {{resources}} leads to no incentive to conserve stocks, and actors which try to conserve lose out compared to the others when it comes to maximizing economic output. Therefore, there appeared to be a lack of concern by tribes of the First Nations about the sustainability of the fur trade. The problem of <b>over-exploitation</b> is not helped {{by the fact that the}} efforts by the French to remove the middlemen such as the Huron who increasingly resented their influence meant that stocks were put under more pressure. All these factors contributed to an unsustainable trade pattern in furs which depleted beaver stocks very fast.|$|E
25|$|If a small, {{discrete}} stock had {{existed in the}} Bay of Biscay, then localized hunting by the Basques {{may have led to}} its <b>over-exploitation</b> and subsequent (near) disappearance there. A third possibility, perhaps the most plausible, would be that there are (or were) two populations, one in the western North Atlantic and the other in the eastern North Atlantic. Such a view would conform well with the mainly coastal distribution of right whales in the western North Atlantic today. Still, this possibility would result in the harvest of right whales not only in the Bay of Biscay, but in Iceland, Northern Norway, and the rest of Europe, which may have been enough to severely deplete this supposed stock.|$|E
25|$|Indonesia's high {{population}} and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues, {{which are often}} given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance. Issues include destruction of peatlands, large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; <b>over-exploitation</b> of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and economic development, including air pollution, traffic congestion, garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services. Indonesia has a below average but slightly improving performance in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 107 out of 180 countries in 2016. This is also below average in the Asia-Pacific region, behind Thailand but slightly ahead of China.|$|E
25|$|The {{recreational}} catch {{often is}} greater than the commercial catch in some areas, with a survey carried out in Blackwood River indicating 120 700 fish were taken in a year by anglers. A similar survey conducted in the South Australian Gulfs found recreational fishermen accounted for 28% of the entire yellowfin whiting taken during the 2000/2001 period, representing over 50 tonnes of fish. Recreational bag limits have been put in place to prevent <b>over-exploitation</b> by anglers in both states, with South Australia imposing a minimum size limit of 24cm and a bag limit of 20 fish on anglers. In Western Australia, there is no minimum size limit, but a bag limit of 40 fish in combination with school whitings (Sillago bassensis and Sillago vittata).|$|E
25|$|The metaphor {{illustrates}} {{the argument that}} free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through <b>over-exploitation,</b> temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while {{the costs of the}} exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.|$|E
25|$|As {{competition}} increased {{between the}} English and French in the 1700s, the fur was still predominantly caught by Aboriginal tribes which acted as the middleman. The response to increased competition {{led to a}} severe over-harvesting of beavers. Data from three of the trading posts of the Hudson's Bay Company show this trend. The simulation of beaver populations around trading posts are done by {{taking into account the}} beaver returns from each trading post, biological evidence on beaver population dynamics and contemporary estimates of beaver densities. While the view that increased competition between the English and the French led to <b>over-exploitation</b> of beaver stocks by the Aboriginals does not receive uncritical support, most believe that Aboriginals were the primary actors in depleting animal stocks. However, there has been a lack of critical discussion on other factors such as beaver population dynamics, the number of animals harvested, nature of property rights, prices, role of the English and the French in the matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect on}} beaver stocks of {{competition}} between the English and the French was disastrous. The status of beavers changed dramatically as it {{went from being a}} source of food and clothing for the Aboriginals to a vital good for exchange with the Europeans. The French were constantly in search of cheaper fur and trying to cut off the Aboriginal middleman which led them to explore the interior all the way to Lake Winnipeg and the Central Plains. While some historians dispute the claims that the competition was predominantly responsible for <b>over-exploitation</b> of stocks, others have used empirical analysis to emphasize the changing economic incentives for Aboriginals and role of the Europeans in the matter. Innis holds that the population of beavers decreased dramatically even before the rivalry in the 1700s and stocks in far-flung western areas were increasingly being tapped before there was any serious {{competition between the}} English and the French. However, there is widespread agreement on the matter in ethnohistory literature that Aboriginals depleted the resource. Calvin Martin holds that there was a breakdown of the relationship between man and animal in the values of the Aboriginals which made them drastically accelerate the exploitation of reserves.|$|E
500|$|Aside from {{promoting}} {{the rights of}} fellow cartoonists, Lat developed an interest in encouraging conservation of the natural environment. [...] Several of his works caricature the consequences of pollution and <b>over-exploitation</b> of resources. [...] Invited {{to give a speech}} at the 9th Osaka International Symposium on Civilisation in 1988, Lat talked about the environmental problems associated with overpopulation and heavy industrialisation. [...] He further reminisced about the simple cleaner life he had enjoyed as a child in the kampung. [...] In 1977, when a protest was organised against logging activities in the Endau-Rompin Reserves, Lat helped gain support for the movement by drawing cartoons in the newspapers that highlighted the issue. [...] Lat is also particularly concerned over what he sees as the negative side of urban development. [...] He believes that such developments have contributed to the loss of the traditional way of life; people forget the old culture and values as they ingratiate themselves with the rapid pace and sophistication of urban lifestyles. [...] His defence and fondness of the old ways are manifested in his The Kampung Boy, Town Boy, Mat Som, and Kampung Boy: Yesterday and Today, which champion the old lifestyles [...] as spiritually superior.|$|E
500|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the British (Australian) and Americans, started to focus efforts in the South Pacific; in the mid 1900s, over 50,000 humpback whale were taken from the South Pacific. At its height in the 1880s, U.S. profits turned to USD10,000,000, equivalent to USD225,000,000 today. Commonly exploited species included arctic whales such as the gray whale, right whale, and bowhead whale because they were close to the main whaling ports, like New Bedford. After those stocks were depleted, rorquals in the South Pacific were targeted by nearly all whaling organizations; however, they often out-swam whaling vessels. Whaling rorquals was not effective until the harpoon cannon was invented in the late 1860s. Whaling basically stopped when stocks of all species were depleted to a point that they could not be harvested on a commercial scale. Whaling was controlled in 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium setting catch limits to protect species from dying out from <b>over-exploitation,</b> and eventually banned it: ...|$|E
