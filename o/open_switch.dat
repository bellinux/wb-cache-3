25|$|By the 1930s {{the volume}} of {{agricultural}} traffic on the Cane Belt had steeply declined. In 1939, the railroad applied to the ICC {{to shut down the}} Bonus Loop from Bonus to Eldridge, the site of Eldridge's one-time plantation.

By this time shipments of rice, livestock, oyster shell for road surfacing and other freight began to fall. Sulphur was the backbone of the railroad. In 1945, in addition to 3,824 bales of cotton, the Cane Belt shipped 17,789 carloads of sulphur, 1,613 of oyster shell, 1,122 of petroleum products, 354 of rice and 82 of fruits and vegetables.

50|$|<b>Open</b> knife <b>{{switches}}</b> were {{supplanted by}} safety switches with current carrying contacts inside a metal enclosure {{which can only}} be <b>opened</b> by <b>switching</b> off the power. In modern applications, automatic switches (such as contactors or relays), and manual switches such as circuit breakers are used. These devices use a snap action mechanism which <b>opens</b> the <b>switch</b> contacts rapidly, and feature an arc chute where the arc caused by opening the switch is quenched. These devices also prevent injury due to accidental contact, as all of the current carrying metal parts of the switch are hidden within or surrounded by insulating guards.|$|R
5000|$|Contact form, {{or simply}} form, {{is the term}} relay {{manufacturers}} use to describe a relay's contact configuration. [...] "Form A” refers to a single-pole, normally <b>open</b> <b>switch.</b> [...] "Form B" [...] indicates a single-throw, normally closed switch, and [...] "Form C" [...] indicates a single-pole, double-throw switch. Virtually any contact configuration can be described using this format.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 12 kV switchgear used <b>open</b> <b>switches</b> {{operated by}} 3 ft wooden sticks.

In 1902 the switchgear was replaced by oil-enclosed lever-operated switches, and in 1920 the system was again renovated with remotely controlled oil-filled circuit breakers. The 1920 switchboard has been retained to the present day.|$|R

50|$|Pole {{refers to}} the number of common {{terminals}} within a given switch. Throw {{refers to the}} number of positions in which the switch may be placed to create a signal path or connection. Figure lA illustrates a single-pole, single-throw normally <b>open</b> <b>switch</b> (SPST NO). Figure 1B shows a single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) switch. One terminal is normally-open (NO) and the other is normally-closed (NC). Depending {{on the state of the}} switch, one or the other position is connected to the common terminal (COM). One signal path is broken before the other is connected, so this is referred to as a break-before-make configuration.|$|E

50|$|Reed {{switches}} may {{be selected}} {{for a particular}} application when a solid-state Hall device is not suitable. Reed switches {{can be used to}} greatly reduce leakage current when compared with solid state devices; this may be useful, for example, in medical devices requiring protection of a patient from tiny leakage currents. The reed is hermetically sealed and can therefore operate in almost any environment, such as where flammable gas is present or where corrosion would affect <b>open</b> <b>switch</b> contacts. A reed switch has very low resistance when closed, typically as low as 50 milliohms, whereas the Hall Effect can be in the hundreds of ohms.|$|E

30|$|Feeder {{reconfiguration}} is {{the process}} of changing the distribution network topology by changing the status of its switches.
