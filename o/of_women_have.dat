5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1975, {{numerous}} other empirical {{studies have found}} evidence of gender symmetry. For example, in the United States, the National Comorbidity Study of 1990-1992 found 18.4% of men and 17.4% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced minor IPV, and 5.5% of men and 6.5% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced severe IPV. In England and Wales, the 1995 [...] "Home Office Research Study 191" [...] found that in the twelve {{months prior to the}} survey, 4.2% of both men and woman between the ages of 16 and 59 had been assaulted by an intimate. The Canadian General Social Survey of 2000 found that from 1994 to 1999, 4% of men and 4% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 22% of men and 28% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 7% of men and 8% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present. The 2005 Canadian General Social Survey, looking at the years 1999-2004 found similar data; 4% of men and 3% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 16% of men and 21% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 6% of men and 7% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present.|$|R
50|$|Campus {{sexual assault}} has {{received}} less attention from researchers outside the United States. Studies that have examined sexual assault experiences {{among college students}} in western countries other than the U.S. have found results {{similar to those found}} by American researchers. A 1993 study of a nationally representative sample of Canadian College students found that 28% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced some form of sexual assault in the preceding year, and 45% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced some form of sexual assault since entering college. A 1991 study of 347 undergraduates in New Zealand found that 25.3% had experienced rape or attempted rape, and 51.6% had experienced some form of sexual victimization. A 2014 study of students in Great Britain found that 25% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced some type of sexual assault while attending university and 7% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced rape or attempted rape as college students.|$|R

5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{inequality}} within Birmingham {{is greater}} {{than in any other}} major English city, and is exceeded only by Glasgow in the United Kingdom. Levels of unemployment are {{among the highest in the}} country, with 10.0% of the economically active population unemployed (Jun 2016). In the inner-city wards of Aston and Washwood Heath, the figure is higher than 30%. Two-fifths of Birmingham's population live in areas classified as in the 10% most deprived parts of England, and overall Birmingham is the most deprived local authority in England in terms of income and employment deprivation. The city's infant mortality rate is high, around 60% worse than the national average. Meanwhile, just 49% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> jobs, compared to 65% nationally, and only 28% of the working-age population in Birmingham have degree level qualifications in contrast to the average of 34% across other Core Cities.|$|E
5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E

25|$|The {{percentage}} of infertile, married couples rose to 13% {{in the first}} decade of the 21st century, partially due to poorly performed abortions. According to expert Murray Feshbach 10–20% of women who have abortions in Russia are made infertile, though according to the 2002 census, only about 6–7% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> not had children by the end of their reproductive years.|$|E

25|$|The {{title of}} Grandmaster, {{along with the}} lesser FIDE titles of International Master (IM) and FIDE Master (FM), is open to both men and women.

25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} earning wages or a salary {{are part of a}} modern phenomenon, one that developed {{at the same time as}} the growth of paid employment for men, but women have been challenged by inequality in {{the workforce}}. Until modern times, legal and cultural practices, combined with the inertia of longstanding religious and educational conventions, restricted women's entry and participation {{in the workforce}}. Economic dependency upon men, and consequently the poor socio-economic status <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> <b>have</b> had the same impact, particularly as occupations have become professionalized over the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
25|$|The shape, size, position, symmetry, spacing, firmness, {{and amount}} of sagging of {{individual}} women's breasts vary considerably.

Even within a single country, one study found that the bra label size was consistently different from the measured size. As a result, about 25% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a difficult time finding a properly fitted bra. Some women choose to buy custom-made bras due to the unusual size or shape of their breasts.|$|E

25|$|Nicaragua {{has one of}} {{the highest}} {{cervical}} cancer incidence rates in the world and the second highest morbidity rate in Latin America, second only to Haiti. Although screenings are provided through their national public health system, only 35% <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> had a Papanicolaou (PAP) smear test by the age of 35 years. A study showed that even when screenings services are adequate, patient follow-up and treatment after abnormal results is of poor quality. A low-cost early detection alternative to PAP smears used in Nicaragua involves visual inspection of cancerous cervical legions with acetic acid.|$|E
