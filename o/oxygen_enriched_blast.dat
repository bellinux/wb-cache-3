40|$|A {{research}} {{aimed to}} explore new method of aeration using <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> air performance on BOD reduction of palm oil wastewater was conducted. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> air was obtained from an <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Enriched</b> System (OES) developed using asymmetric polysulfone hollow fiber membrane with composition consisting of PSF: 22 %, DMAc: 31. 8 %, THF: 31. 8 %, EtOH: 14. 4 %. Palm oil wastewater samples were taken from facultative pond effluent. These samples were tested for its initial biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids (SS), and total dissolved solids (TDS) before being subjected to two modes of aeration system, that is diffused air and <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> air. These water quality concentrations were tested for every 20 minutes for two-hour period during the aeration process. Results of BOD, TSS, pH, conductivity, DO, SS and TDS concentrations against time of samples from the two modes of aeration were then compared. It was found that DO concentration achieved in <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> air aeration was better than aeration using diffused air system. Aeration using OES improve the DO concentration in the wastewater and thus improve the BOD reduction and also influence other physical characteristics of wastewater.

40|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} in evaluating NOx emission control by selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) combined with biomass co-firing to meet impending enforcement of NOx emission limits for power generation plant. Oxygen enrichment for the concentration of CO 2 in the flue gas has been observed in this work to have benefits for NOx emission control. This paper presents new information {{on the effect of}} combining biomass co-firing with SNCR under various <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> and air-staging conditions performed in the 20 kW combustion facility. Biomass has a higher tendency to generate CO and produced better reductions in NO x emission with and without using SNCR. NO reduction of around 80 % were attained using SNCR for 15 % and 50 % blending ratios of biomasses at 21 % overall O 2 concentration for unstaged combustion. Whereas, a range of 40 - 80 % NO reductions were attained for coal (Russian Coal) and 15 % co-fired biomasses with 3. 1 - 5. 5 % overall O 2 concentration at 22 - 31 % levels of flame staging. Moreover, it was found that better NOx removal efficiency was attained for higher NOx emission baselines under both <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> and normal firing conditions. However, SNCR NOx control for both coal or coal-biomass blends was observed to produce higher NOx reductions during O 2 enrichment, believed to be due to the self-sustained NOx reduction reactions. Hence, NOx control by SNCR, <b>oxygen</b> <b>enriched</b> co-firing in power station boilers would result in lower NOx emissions and higher CO 2 concentration for efficient scrubbing with better carbon burnouts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
