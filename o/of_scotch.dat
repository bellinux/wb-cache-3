5|$|The Sunbury Hazleton, and Wilkes-Barre Railroad (the later {{name of the}} Danville, Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre Railroad), {{followed}} the bank <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run throughout its length. The stream was historically well known as a trout stream.|$|E
5|$|In {{its upper}} reaches, most <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run is closed to public access. For this reason, a 1997 report stated that {{this section of}} the stream offered poor {{recreational}} opportunities. However, the report stated that the stream provided good recreational opportunities in its lower reaches. According to the report, both sections of the stream are poor sites for angling.|$|E

5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|An ephemeral natural pool {{system is}} located in the {{vicinity}} <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run. In the past, a reservoir was created on the stream by damming it. In the 21st century, a small residential area and a number of roads are present near it. The forests and vernal pools on Scotch Run are fragmented by dirt roads. The habitat quality of the area may also be impaired by All Terrain Vehicles. Additionally, the vernal pools may be used as breeding grounds for mosquitos.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run, the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on the stream in Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville. In 1820, it started {{to be used as a}} school, which was run by Jacob Gensel.|$|E

5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death. Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, {{but there is no}} reason to think that they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle <b>of</b> <b>scotch</b> unopened. At the next PHAT meeting, Veronica is asked to take action for animal rights in any way she sees fit. Keith presents the bottle <b>of</b> <b>scotch</b> as evidence of a murder of Dean O’Dell. Back at the lab, Veronica notices a coworker being mean to the monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress the leader of the group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{drainage}} basin <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run is {{designated by the}} Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has stocked it with adult trout. The Black Creek Sportsmens Club and the Beaver Township Rod and Gun Club also stock the stream with trout. A 1997 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission discovered a small population of wild brook trout and hatchery brook trout in the stream.|$|E
5|$|The lower reaches <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run were {{inhabited}} by eight {{species of fish}} in 1997: bluegills, brook trout, brown trout, blacknose dace, creek chubs, longnose dace, pumpkinseeds, white suckers. Bluegills and longnose dace were not present {{in this part of}} the stream two decades earlier, but rainbow trout and golden shiners were present at that time. The rainbow trout disappeared from the stream because the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission stopped stocking them and the golden shiners were only present in the 1970s due to bait bucket introductions.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E
5|$|At river mile 5.1, the pH of {{the waters}} <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run is 6.6 and at river mile 1.3, the pH is 7.0. At the stream's mouth, the pH is 6.8.

At river mile 5.1, the level of water hardness in the stream is 23 milligrams per liter, while at river mile 1.3, the water hardness is 15 milligrams per liter. It is 18 milligrams per liter at the stream's mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the {{watershed}} <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> Run, upstream of Mifflin Cross Roads, are predominantly forested land. However, there are some residential areas near the headwaters of the stream. Downstream of Mifflin Cross Roads, the watershed contains both forested land and agricultural land. The forested land occurs primarily on the valley slopes, while the bottom of the valley contains a number of small farms. A road known as Scotch Valley Drive follows the stream's general direction up valley of the stream. A road known as LR 19015 also runs alongside to the stream for some distance.|$|E

5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle <b>of</b> <b>Scotch</b> that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E
