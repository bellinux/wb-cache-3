5|$|Though the Maya Sita motif {{was found}} {{earlier in the}} Kurma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) where Sita's purity is safeguarded, it is the Adhyatma Ramayana (a part of the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century), where Maya Sita plays a much greater role in the plot. The concept of maya (illusion) is an {{integral}} part of the narrative; the best examples being Maya Sita and Maya mriga (illusory deer). Though Adhyatma Ramayana originated in Varanasi in North India, it influenced Malayam (South India) and <b>Oriya</b> (East India) renditions of the Ramayana, but most importantly influenced the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (c.1532–1623).|$|E
5|$|In North Indian manuscripts of the Ramayana, some interpolations {{elaborate}} Tara's lament. Tara {{mentions the}} hardships of widowhood and prefers death to it. She blames Rama for unjustly killing Vali and tells him {{that if they had}} forged an alliance, Vali could have helped him recover Sita. Tara invokes the power of her chastity and curses Rama so that he will soon lose Sita after he regains her. She declares that Sita will return to the earth. The curse also appears in the North-western Indian manuscripts. In several vernacular adaptations of the Ramayana like the <b>Oriya</b> Vilanka Ramayana by Sarala Dasa, Tara's curse is reiterated. Apart from the usual curse to Rama of his separation from Sita, in the Bengali Krittivasi Ramayana, Tara additionally curses Rama that in his next birth, he will be killed by Vali. The Mahanataka and the Ananda Ramayana narrate that Vali is reborn as the hunter who kills Krishna, Rama's next birth.|$|E

Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer in rural areas. <b>Oriyas</b> are very fond of sweets, so dessert follows most meals.|$|R
50|$|The {{irony of}} the {{situation}} is that the film's title itself suggests that it is a patriotic movie and it portrays three honest police officers fighting corruption.
