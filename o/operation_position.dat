40|$|The Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} ?Ensuring patient safety {{in setting the}} <b>operation</b> <b>position</b> at an {{operating}} theatre from nurse?s point of view?. The text deals among others with the present situation {{of the issue of}} perioperation care for patient?s safety. This applies to operation theatres, where a patient comes premedicated, in stress and fear, we never know what the patient will intend doing; just a small movement on a narrow operation table may result in patient?s fall. The setting into the <b>operation</b> <b>position</b> itself is often performed in anaesthesia, with an inert body, the patient feels nothing, no pain and we do not know whether the patient feels insufferable pressure of the bed, burning, etching etc. This is why a perioperative nurse has to be emphatic, forecast and prevent possible problems to avoid patient?s injury. The aim of the work is to identify the possibilities and obligations of a perioperative nurse in setting <b>operation</b> <b>position</b> during the whole operation, to find if the nurses? knowledge related to patient safety in setting the <b>operation</b> <b>position</b> corresponds to the present recommended procedures, to find how patient safety in <b>operation</b> <b>position</b> on an operation table is ensured. To gain the necessary data qualitative research was applied in the form of semi-structured interview with perioperative nurses with completed specialization at PSS Brno in the field of operation instrumentation working in the České Budějovice Hospital. A semi-structured interview with patients hospitalized after operation in the České Budějovice Hospital is also used in the Thesis. This work outlines the problem of poor knowledge among perioperative nurses, whose main nursing care priority is to ensure patient?s safety and comfort when setting the <b>operation</b> <b>position.</b> Even though they try to adhere to all these aspects an unfavourable fact results from the research, namely pain of a shoulder of the arm anaesthesia is applied to. The Bachelor Thesis will be provided to the Hospital management, may serve as a supplementary resource of information for studying the issues, may be used for better information of perioperative nurses and familiarization of students with the problems. The research results will be published on instrumentarky. cz website if possible...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{coupling}} between vibration and centrifugal {{field is}} quite strong in multi-parameter combined environment test system. The motion part of vibration table deviates {{from its original}} <b>operation</b> <b>position</b> {{by the action of}} centrifugal force, which ends in the stuck of armature and causes damage to vibration table. In order to solve such problem, an air-push-type armature redress system with displacement feedback was proposed, which provided a recovering force to counteract the centrifugal force and pushed the motion component to its designed <b>operation</b> <b>position.</b> Some improvements were also made to enhance its reliability. The result of simulation and test about the armature redress system demonstrates that the system has an excellent performance and meets the requirement of counteracting the centrifugal force, which guarantees that the vibration table could work in centrifugal field and multi-parameter combined environment...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{explore the}} context of {{incidence}} of and associated risk factors for pressure ulcers amongst the population of surgical patients. Methods. The initial study cohort was conducted {{with a total of}} 297 patients admitted to a teaching hospital for a surgical operation from November 14 th to 27 th 2006 in Taipei, Taiwan. The Braden scale, pressure ulcers record sheet, and perioperative patient outcomes free from signs and symptoms of injury related to positioning and related nursing interventions and activities were collected. Results. The incidence of immediate and thirty-minute-later pressure ulcers is 9. 8 % (29 / 297) and 5. 1 % (15 / 297), respectively. Using logistic regression model, the statistically significantly associated risk factors related to immediate and thirty-minute-later pressure ulcers include operation age, type of anesthesia, type of <b>operation</b> <b>position,</b> type of surgery, admission Braden score, and number of nursing intervention after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusion. Admission Braden score and number of nursing intervention are well-established protected factors for the development of pressure ulcers.

40|$|Background Laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LC) are {{generally}} {{performed in a}} 12 mmHg-pressured pneumoperitoneum in a slight sitting position. Considerable thromboembolism risk arises in this operation due to pneumoperitoneum, <b>operation</b> <b>position</b> and risk factors of patients. We aim to investigate the effect of pneumoperitoneum pressure on coagulation and fibrinolysis under general anesthesia. Material and Methods Fifty American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) I–III patients who underwent elective LC without thromboprophlaxis were enrolled in this prospective study. The patients were randomly {{divided into two groups}} according to the pneumoperitoneum pressure during LC: the 10 mmHg group (n = 25) and the 14 mmHg group. Prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT), International Normalized Ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and blood levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen were measured preoperatively (pre), one hour (post 1) and 24 h (post 24) after the surgery. Moreover, alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase and lactate dehydrogenase were measured before and after the surgery. These parameters were compared between and within the groups. Results PT, TT, aPTT, INR, and D-dimer and fibrinogen levels significantly increased after the surgery in both of the groups. D-dimer level was significantly higher in 14 -mmHg group at post 24. Conclusion Both the 10 -mmHg and 14 -mmHg pressure of pneumoperitoneum may lead to affect coagulation tests and fibrinogen and D-dimer levels without any occurrence of deep vein thrombosis, but 14 -mmHg pressure of pneumoperitoneum has a greater effect on D-dimer. However, lower pneumoperitoneum pressure may be useful for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this degree-project was to {{investigate}} the possibilities for primary air preheating into the two smallest waste incineration boilers of Halmstad Energy and Environment. The investigation is a pre-study which has the primary goal to evaluate technical and financial offers from companies that manufacture primary air preheater, and investigate if it is technically and financially profitable to do a purchase on primary air preheaters in the future. In the pre-study it is proposed that it is most efficient to have individual primary air preheater, one for each incineration boiler and the primary air are also proposed to be preheated by hot water in the pre-study. Further in the pre-study it is proposed that the heat-exchanger should have plain tubes instead of finned tubes, to avoid getting dirty fast. The space in the boiler-room is limited, and therefore the major problem was to fit in the primary air preheaters into the boiler-room. By comparing the different offers from the companies, the result in the pre-study shows that the offer from the company C. A. – MÖRCK has the most optimal primary air preheater. The results in the pre-study shows that it is technically possible to install primary air preheaters into the building, but the limited space in the boiler-room forced the distance between the tube-bundles in the primary air preheaters to be very small. Pressure-measurements on the primary air fans show {{that it is possible to}} use the existing fans with the purposed primary air preheaters. This assumes that the air-damper is always in the normal <b>operation</b> <b>position.</b> If it is financially profitable to install primary air preheaters is difficult to answer because it is difficult to predict the lifetime on the boilers and what economical profits the primary air preheaters may cause...|$|E
40|$|Space {{robotics}} has {{a substantial}} interest in achieving on-orbit service (OOS) operations autonomously, i. e rendezvous and docking/berthing (RVDB) with failed, stranded or malfunction satellites. Visual navigation system {{has a wide}} area of applications. In {{the context of this}} thesis we investigate a visual navigation system for on-orbit service (OOS). The space servicing area has a very important appeal in space flight dynamics mainly in these days when the scientific community is deeply concerned with space debris and the risk those objects impose on other space missions and even on the ecosystem not to say risk on human life on ground. Moreover current database indicates regular opportunities for satellite servicing including on-orbit upgrades, repair and rescue of stranded satellites. Those satellites are classified as non-cooperative targets when under the goal of space cleaning or space maintenance by space tugs. A chaser spacecraft would have to have the capability to rendezvous and grasp a dead satellite or other space debris, taking it out of its orbit for the sake of fixing problems, refueling, or just for cleaning purposes, without any cooperation from the target vehicle. In this sense failed or dead satellites become non-cooperative targets that are not able to provide any information on their position and attitude and eventually are not capable of maneuvering to cooperate with the docking <b>operation.</b> <b>Position</b> and attitude here shall be understood as relative orbital position and relative attitude between the chaser and target space vehicles or chaser vehicles and other space objects. This thesis presents an algorithm developed for estimating the pose (position and attitude) and the motion (velocities) of a generic target satellite based on visual navigation. The algorithm gathers the strength of classical attitude estimation methods to obtain real-time applicability conditions when adopting a Kalman filter for sequential state estimation. The visual system is monocular and satellite model-based. Therefore, it does not rely on any marker attached to the target satellite. The navigation solution can be used for a vast category of applications such as space debris removal, servicing for stranded satellites, and interception of hostile objects. The approach is first tested with synthetic image data from a spacecraft object generated in virtual reality. A test-bed is used to simulate the on-orbit optical environment. A scaled satellite model and a CCD camera is employed in the test bed in order to evaluate the algorithm for real-time application. A combination of three dimensional (3 D) model-based attitude estimation and filtering time series of images produce similar real time solution for the estimation problem and increases the reliability of the relative attitude and position results...|$|E
