5|$|A superstition that is {{prevalent}} among many of today's NHL players {{is that no}} player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus {{it should be the}} only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway.|$|E

5|$|His next fight {{took place}} on January 7, 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City against Carlos Baldomir. For Judah, the fight {{was viewed as a}} tuneup bout that would lead to a lucrative bout between Judah and WBC Light Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., which was {{tentatively}} scheduled for April. Judah entered the fight as a 10-to-1 favorite over Baldomir. The stage was set when Judah unsportingly punched Baldomir on the thigh during the prefight introductions instead <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> gloves to show sportsmanship. The early rounds of the fight were close, but as the rounds passed, Judah was doing less than necessary to win, while Baldomir kept applying pressure on Judah. In round seven, Judah was hurt by a right hand and Baldomir landed a series of right hands to Judah's head along the ropes during the tenth round. Baldomir defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 115–113, 114–113 and 115–112 from the three judges.|$|E

40|$|In {{western culture}} the use <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> in {{interpersonal}} relations has, {{as far as}} possible, been avoided. Partly this was because the <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> infants and children was believed to en· courage dependency and weakness, and partly because touch between adults was seen as almost exclusively a sexual mat-ter. This view <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> has now been re-evaluated and the fun-damental nature <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> as a nurturant response is now more fully understood. It is suggested that there are nine types <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> in interpersonal relations: information pick-up, movement facilitation, prompting, aggressive, nurturant, celebratory, sexual, cathartic and ludic. In the context <b>of</b> psychotherapy <b>touch</b> was avoided {{in the development of}} classical psychoanalysis but is used in many contemporary forms of therapy. It is argued that there are appropriate ap-plications of most of the types <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> referred to above...|$|R
40|$|Touch {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in mother-infant interchange, however investigations have focused primarily on the role of distal modalities of communication, such as affect and gaze. The present study was designed to investigate the functions <b>of</b> maternal <b>touching</b> during a Still-Face procedure between mothers and their fullterm 5 歔-month-old infants. The objectives were to (1) document how the overall duration, the types, and the functions <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> employed by mothers varied across both Normal periods, (2) clarify the impact of infants' and mothers' distress on the function and duration <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> provided to infants, (3) investigate the reciprocal relationship between functions <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> and infants' affect, and (4) examine how maternal regulatory behaviours provided in the transition period were predicted by infants' affect, and how they influenced the amount <b>of</b> nurturing <b>touch</b> during the Reunion Normal period. Maternal touch was systematically coded using the Caregiver Infant Touch Scale and the Functions <b>of</b> <b>Touch</b> Scale. Results indicated that mothers adapted the functions <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> they used across period, and according to infants' affect and distress level. Mothers used more nurturing function <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> when their infants were fretting or distressed, whereas they used more playful function <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> in order to get their infants smiling. Moreover, findings revealed that the transition periods played a critical regulatory role and influenced subsequent maternal behaviour. Together, these results highlight mothers' ability to sensitively adjust the function <b>of</b> their <b>touch</b> according to their infants' affect, {{while at the same time}} underscoring the importance <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> as a channel of communication...|$|R
5|$|At around 11:55am {{the last}} {{remaining}} soldiers of the ARVN 1st Battalion were discharged near the original landing zone in Thuận Lợi, and they too were put out of action within three minutes <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> down on the field.

Second Lieutenant Williams then ordered 14 Americans inside the building, along with {{an equal number of}} Vietnamese women and children, to retreat to the artillery position located east of the town where they continued their resistance. Late in the afternoon on June 10, the U.S. 118th Aviation Company was joined by other elements of the 145th Combat Aviation Battalion in their final sorties for the day; airlifting the ARVN 52nd Ranger Battalion from Phước Vinh into Đồng Xoài, with the objective of recapturing the road junction and the Special Forces Camp. Following their last mission, the 118th Aviation Company immediately returned to Biên Hòa. During the first day of heavy fighting, every helicopter in the unit had sustained damage, including the loss of one helicopter and its entire crew.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and written by Masato Kato. Ishii had previously produced or directed all of the previous Mana games, while Kato also wrote the stories for Children of Mana (2006) and Dawn of Mana (2006). The game was developed by Brownie Brown, who previously helped develop Sword of Mana (2003). Ishii created the overall design, and Brownie Brown worked directly with him to implement it. As the series creator, Ishii {{felt it was important}} to be directly involved in all stages of development. Heroes of Mana was created as an RTS game to complement the other titles in the World of Mana project, which all offer a spin on the original Seiken Densetsu formula. Ishii stated that it was also to help expose Japanese gamers to real-time strategy games, a genre that is relatively obscure in Japan, while simultaneously satisfying players abroad with an RTS for an unconventional console, as most real-time strategy games are released for personal computers. To match this mission, the game was designed for more casual players than the typical fan of the traditionally role-playing game series. The Nintendo DS was chosen as the platform partially due to the system's multiplayer potential as well as giving the sensation <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> the game. The team found developing an RTS for the Nintendo DS to be difficult, and had to start development over at one point. Although prior to the World of Mana project Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, Heroes is explicitly set as a prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 (1995), depicting battles between the nations present in that game. It is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3, with some characters noted as the parents of characters in the other game.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes becomes {{jealous of}} Malachy {{and his new}} girlfriend, Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan). Mercedes lies to Lynsey and tells her that she is HIV-positive. Mercedes tells Malachy and they {{secretly}} plan to reconcile. Lynsey learns of this and discovers Mercedes has lied. Lynsey tells Malachy, who punches Mercedes. Mercedes and Malachy reconcile. However, Malachy is badly injured in an explosion and Mercedes is forced to turn off his life support, and he subsequently dies. Malachy's family are forced by Myra to invite Mercedes to his funeral despite discovering her infidelity. Mercedes gets into an argument with Billy Alexander (Richard Graham) at her aunt Kathleen McQueen's (Alison Burrows) fundraising event, after she accuses him <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> her. Carmel apologises for Mercedes' behaviour and agrees {{to have lunch with}} Billy. When Billy visits Carmel, Myra slaps him and reveals that he is the father of Mercedes and Jacqui. He tells Mercedes and Jacqui that he needs a kidney transplant and that they are the only likely donors. When Mercedes and Jacqui refuse to be donors, Kathleen tells Billy that he is the father of her daughter Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), confirming that Theresa is actually Mercedes and Jacqui's half-sister. Billy is later revealed to not be needing a kidney, and that it is actually Mercedes, Jacqui and Theresa's secret half-sister, Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). However, Mercedes is not interested in Billy nor Emily and declines to be a donor, although Jacqui later agrees to be a donor but is revealed not to be a match, so Billy and Emily disown her and leave.|$|E

40|$|Recent feminist {{scholarship}} has challenged the traditional Western notion <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> as an innocent form of engagement between individuals, with {{scholars such as}} Manning (2006), Marks (2002) and Sobchack (2004) focusing on the social, political, and historical context <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> and how touch {{has the potential to}} challenge Western dualisms such as the distinction between self and other. However, despite focus on the transcorporeality <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> that is, the ability <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> to traverse bodily boundaries and entangle bodies with the world, the theoretical engagement with challenges to the notion of human corporeal integrity through bioscientific developments such as organ transplants, and the interaction of biology and technology through the plasticity of the body in incorporating organic and inorganic matter, has remained limited. This thesis, situated in a new materialist framework, explores a posthuman phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> by diffractively reading Merleau-Ponty’s ontology of the flesh and Karen Barad’s quantum-philosophy <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> through one another. Within Wilsons (2015) framework for a feminist reading of the biological body, and efforts from disability studies scholars to crip feminist science and technology studies, this thesis engages with recent developments in neuroprosthetics – prosthetics connected directly with the nervous system, restoring sensimotoric function in amputees or tetraplegic patients. Specifically, this thesis will look at research by the Bensmaia Lab at the University of Chicago on the neural coding <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> and explore the material entanglements <b>of</b> neuroscientific <b>touch</b> through exploring the military connections as well as practices of animal testing of the Bensmaia Lab.
