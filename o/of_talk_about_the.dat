2500|$|Before {{the opening}} tip, Bryant and O'Neal did not talk, but did greet {{each other by}} bumping forearms. During the game, Bryant was fouled by O'Neal several times but the {{contacts}} were not excessive. O'Neal fouled out late {{in the fourth quarter}} but the Heat still won the game in overtime, led by up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. Bryant missed a potentially game-winning shot as time expired. When asked about the brick wall comment, Bryant said, [...] "I knew there was a lot <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> brick wall and all that. But I think that was kind of just to hype the game. Hopefully, this is all behind us now." [...] O'Neal shared a similar tone, saying [...] "I'm over it. It's old news to me." [...] Bryant and O'Neal met on the court twice more during the season, once during the NBA All-Star Game and once more when the Lakers played the Heat on March 17, 2005.|$|E

I'll state the fact of it to you. It's the pleasantest work there is, and it's the lightest work there is, and it's the best- paid work there is.

60|$|It {{was during}} this time that Prince Firouz Schah, {{wandering}} sadly and hopelessly from place to place, arrived in a large city of India, where he heard a great deal <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Princess of Bengal who {{had gone out of}} her senses, on the very day that she was to have been married to the Sultan of Cashmere. This was quite enough to induce him to take the road to Cashmere, and to inquire at the first inn at which he lodged in the capital the full particulars of the story. When he knew that he had at last found the princess whom he had so long lost, he set about devising a plan for her rescue.|$|E

40|$|The thesis puts {{forward a}} new {{interpretation}} of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s On Certainty and contrasts {{it with the}} standard reading of the book, also known in literature as the Framework Reading. The Framework Reading sees hinge propositions, that is our most basic and indubitable beliefs, as framing our practice <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world, and, therefore, external to this practice. As such, they are seen as not truth-apt, purely regulative in character and our relation to them as non-epistemic. According to the interpretation put forward in this thesis, we should instead see hinges as uncontroversially correct moves in our practice <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world, and, therefore, we should see them as obviously true and playing both a regulative and a descriptive role...|$|R

6000|$|What, then, is the {{relevancy}} <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> [...] "glacial epoch" [...] to {{the question}} of the historical veracity of the narrator of the story of the Noachian deluge? So far as my knowledge goes, there is not a particle of evidence that destructive inundations were more common over the general surface of the earth in the glacial epoch than they have been before or since. No doubt the fringe of an ice-covered region must be always liable to them; but, if we examine the records of such catastrophes in historical times, those produced in the deltas of great rivers, or in lowlands like Holland, by sudden floods, combined with gales of wind or with unusual tides, far excel all others.|$|E
6000|$|Among playgoing folk, in the {{following}} April {{there was a great}} deal <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> marriage of that very favourite actress, Mrs. Morton. She appeared in the playbills as Mrs. George Hotspur, late Mrs. Morton. Very many spoke of her familiarly, who knew her only on the stage,--as is the custom of men in speaking of actresses,--and perhaps some few of these who spoke of her did know her personally. [...] "Poor Lucy!" [...] said one middle-aged gentleman over fifty, who spent four nights of every week at one theatre or another. [...] "When she was little more than a child they married her to that reprobate Morton. Since that she has managed to keep her head above water by hard work; and now she has gone and married another worse than the first!" ...|$|E

60|$|Fortunately the Pasteur {{was so full}} <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{house and}} his {{business}} with the notary, {{that there was no}} need for Godfrey to speak in the coach, or indeed at dinner. Then after the meal was finished he produced his presents, and with blushes and stammers offered them to the various members of the family. What rapture there was! Madame was delighted with her necklace, which she said and truly, was in the best of taste. Juliette kissed the watch, and looked as though she would like to kiss the donor, as indeed was her case. The Pasteur examined the fine pipe through his blue spectacles, saying that never had he expected to own one so beautiful, then at once filled it and began to smoke. After this they all scolded him for his extravagance.|$|E
60|$|I {{had barely}} time to untie {{the young man}} and {{take him to the}} back of the house before the {{officers}} and their followers had entered the front door. There was now a great deal of questioning, a great deal of explanation, a great deal of discussion as to whether my way of catching burglars was advisable or not, and a good deal <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> best method of taking the men to town. Some of the officers were in favour of releasing the two men, and then deciding in what manner they should be taken to town; and if this plan had been adopted, I believe that these two alert and practical rascals would have taken themselves out of my house without the assistance of the officers, or at least would have caused a great deal of trouble and perhaps injury in endeavouring to do so.|$|E

50|$|Poetic naturalism is a {{philosophical}} approach to naturalism which encourages a variety <b>of</b> ways to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world, using language {{dependent upon the}} aspect of reality being discussed. The term was coined by Sean M.

It acknowledges that the methods and terms used within one domain may not be coherent with those of another domain, yet both can be considered valid representations of reality.|$|R
60|$|I {{had heard}} a great deal <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{deafening}} uproar of the engine. I counted a headache among my chances. There again reason reinforced conjecture. When {{in the early morning}} Mr. Travers came from Brighton in this Farman in which I flew I could hear the hum of the great insect when it still seemed abreast of Beachy Head, and a good two miles away. If one can hear a thing at two miles, how much the more will one not hear it at a distance of two yards? But at the risk of seeming too contented for anything I will assert I heard that noise no more than one hears the drone of an electric ventilator upon one's table. It was only when I came to speak to Mr. Grahame-White, or he to me, that I discovered that our voices had become almost infinitesimally small.|$|E
60|$|When the Hollywell party met at breakfast, Charles showed {{himself by}} no means the worse for his yesterday's experiment.

After all the care Guy had taken of him, Mrs. Edmonstone could not find it in her heart to scold, and her husband, having spent his vexation upon her, had none left to bestow on the real culprit. So when Guy, with his bright morning face, and his hair hanging shining and wet round it, opened the dining-room door, on his return from bathing in the river, Mr. Edmonstone's salutation only conveyed that humorous anger that no one cares for.|$|E

He wrote a story where the failure of a business man turned on a point just like that you have instanced. The man could have retrieved himself if he had let some people believe that what was so was not so, but his conscience stepped in and obliged him to own the truth. There was a good deal <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case, I suppose, because it was not in real life, and my friend heard divers criticisms. He heard of a group of ministers who blamed him for exalting a case of common honesty, as if it were something extraordinary; and he heard of some business men who talked it over and said he had worked the case up splendidly, but he was all wrong in the outcome--the fellow would never have told the other fellows.
