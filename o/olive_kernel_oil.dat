Cottonseed oil, soybean oil, <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> and palmolein were used as frying media. The chips were packaged in metallized cellophane bags and incubated at 63 degrees C. At definite time intervals the absorbed oil was extracted and analyzed for peroxide value, Totox number and conjugated diene content. <b>Olive</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> and palmolein absorbed into the chips showed better stability, whereas soybean oil presented the higher oxidation rate. Frying temperature (170, 180 or 190 degrees C) {{did not affect the}} oxidation rate during storage, with the exception of conjugated diene formation which was greater for chips fried at 190 degrees C. Ground oregano or oregano extract, obtained by petroleum ether extraction, were added to the chips as antioxidants. Both retarded significantly the oxidation rate of the oil absorbed into the chips, with results comparable to tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) during storage at 63 degrees C for 7 days; however TBHQ proved significantly more effective after that time.

More specifically, a high variety of vegetable oils or bio-diesels of various origins are tested as supplements, i. e. cottonseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil and their corresponding methyl esters, as well as rapeseed oil methyl ester, palm oil methyl ester, corn oil and <b>olive</b> <b>kernel</b> <b>oil.</b> The series of tests are conducted using each of the above fuel blends, with the engine working at a speed of 2000 rpm and at a medium and high load. In each test, volumetric fuel consumption, exhaust smokiness and exhaust regulated gas emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NO,), carbon monoxide (CO) and total unburned hydrocarbons (HQ are measured. From the first measurement, specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency are computed. The differences in the measured performance and exhaust emission parameters from the baseline operation of the engine, i. e. when working with neat Diesel fuel, are determined and compared. This comparison is extended {{between the use of}} the vegetable oil blends and the bio-diesel blends. Theoretical aspects of Diesel engine combustion, combined with the widely differing physical and chemical properties of these Diesel fuel supplements against the normal Diesel fuel, are used to aid the correct interpretation of the observed engine behavior.

Phenotypic variation in <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content can be dissected into its component traits such as oil metabolism and physical characteristics of the kernel, including embryo size and embryo-to-endosperm weight ratio (EEWR). To characterize quantitative trait loci (QTL) for <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content, a recombinant inbred population derived from a cross between normal line B 73 and high-oil line By 804 was genotyped using 228 molecular markers and phenotyped for <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content and its component traits [embryo oil content, embryo oil concentration, EEWR, embryo volume, embryo width, embryo length, and embryo width-to-length ratio (EWLR) ]. A total of 58 QTL were identified for <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content and its compo-nent traits in 26 genomic regions across all chromosomes. Eight main-effect QTL were identified for <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> con-tent, embryo oil content, embryo oil concentration, EEWR, embryo weight, and EWLR, each accounting for over 10 % of the phenotypic variation in six genomic regions. Over 90 % of QTL identified for <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content co-localized with QTL for component traits, validating their molecular contribution to <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content. On chromosome 1, the QTL that had the largest effect on <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content (qKO 1 - 1) was associated with embryo width; on chromo-some 9, the QTL for <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content (qKO 9) was related to EEWR (qEEWR 9).

Methods: Nonionic surfactant blends of Tween&reg; and Tween&reg;/Span&reg; series were screened based on their solubilization capacity with water for palm <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> esters. Tween&reg; 80 and five blends of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80 and Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 85 in the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value range of 10. 7 &ndash; 14. 0 were selected to study the phase diagram behavior of palm <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> esters using the water titration method at room temperature. Results: High solubilization capacity was obtained by Tween&reg; 80 compared with other surfactants of Tween&reg; series. High HLB blends of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 85 and Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80 at HLB 13. 7 and 13. 9, respectively, have better solubilization capacity compared with the lower HLB values of Tween&reg; 80 /Span&reg; 80. All the selected blends of surfactants were formed as water-in-oil microemulsions, and other dispersion systems varied in size and geometrical layout in the triangles. The high solubilization capacity and larger areas of the water-in-oil microemulsion systems were due to the structural similarity between the lipophilic tail of Tween&reg; 80 and the oleyl group of the palm <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> esters.

40|$|An {{infrequent}} {{high oil}} maize mutant CE 03005 (white seed color and high oil content) from ethyl methane sulphonate pollen mutagenesis {{was investigated in}} this research. A F 2 population derived from CE 03005 × B 73 was used to analysis the genetic effects influencing <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content and to map <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content QTL. Ears from three generations were harvested and the individual <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content of each generation was measured with nuclear magnetic resonance. Genetic analysis showed that the average oil content of white kernels {{was significantly higher than}} that of yellow kernels. Genotypic and phenotypic analyses were compared using composite interval mapping. A QTL (oilc 6 -m 1 ）associated with high <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content was detected in the three generations at bin 6. 01 of chromosome 6 near the phenotypic marker SC (seed color). The mapping results were congruent with the genetic analysis. The results explained the reason why the oil content of the white colored kernels was higher than that of the yellow ones because the oil content QTL linked tightly with the seed color gene in chromosome 6 in the mutant. The way of QTL mapping was credible. Molecular and phenotypic markers identified could be used for breeding purpose and would lend convenience in cloning QTL. Key words: high <b>oil</b> maize mutant, <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> content, phenotypic marker, quantitative trait loci (QTL), SSR markers...|$|R

The results show that The cream which is produced from PKO is smooth,Glossy and Shine,which has more shelf life than dairy whip topping. This study also shows that, the foam which is produced is more stable in whipping cream. this study also point out advantags of palm <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> based whipping cream,particularly when stability of cream is more important...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{in order}} to {{introduce}} natural antioxidative vegetable oil in food industry, the kolkhoung hull <b>oil</b> and <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> were extracted. To evaluate their antioxidant efficiency, gas chromatography analysis of the composition of kolkhoung hull and <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> fatty acids and high–performance liquid chromatography analysis of tocopherols were done. Also, the oxidative stability of the oil was considered based on the peroxide value and anisidine value during heating at 100, 110 and 120 °C. Gas chromatography analysis showed that oleic acid was the major fatty acid of both types of <b>oil</b> (hull and <b>kernel)</b> and based on a low content of saturated fatty acids, high content of monounsaturated fatty acids, and the ratio of ω- 6 and ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, they were nutritionally well-balanced. Moreover, both hull and <b>kernel</b> <b>oil</b> showed high oxidative stability during heating, which {{can be attributed to}} high content of tocotrienols. Based on the results, kolkhoung hull oil acted slightly better than its <b>kernel</b> <b>oil.</b> However, both of them can be added to oxidation–sensitive oils to improve their shelf life...|$|R
