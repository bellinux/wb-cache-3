5000|$|<b>Osemozotan</b> {{was found}} to {{decrease}} the number of fighting incidences in mice similar to buspirone, diazepam, and tandospirone but required a lower pharmacologic dose to produce beneficial effects. [...] <b>Osemozotan</b> showed dose-dependent anti-aggressive effects and was not shown to decrease motor coordination within the mice.|$|E
5000|$|Obsessive-Compulsive {{patients}} {{have been found}} to have increased 5-HT levels within the brain. [...] With the use of <b>Osemozotan</b> as a 5-HT [...] 1A [...] agonist, there will be a decrease in serotonergic activity within the brain, leading to possible anti-obsessional pharmacological action. One animal mouse model used to test for OCD is known as the marble burying test in which the amount of marbles buried within a certain time frame is recorded. [...] Mice performed the marble burying test both with and without <b>Osemozotan.</b> With <b>Osemozotan</b> administration, the number of marbles buried was decreased with apparently little to no loss in motor coordination; these test results support the theory that <b>Osemozotan</b> may be useful in the treatment of OCD.|$|E
50|$|The {{target of}} <b>Osemozotan</b> is 5-HT1A receptors. This {{molecules}} bind with almost 1000 times greater affinity to 5-HT1A receptors {{than most other}} 5-HT, dopamine, or adrenergic receptors. With repeated exposure of <b>Osemozotan</b> at the 5-HT1A receptors, {{there seems to be}} no change in the number of receptors, which is not typically seen with pharmaceutical agonists.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{data was}} collected from animal studies performed in mice and rats. The CMax was obtained 15 minutes after oral ingestion of <b>Osemozotan,</b> the area under the curve was 2,943 ng x hr/mL and the half-life was 1.3 hours. [...] The pharmacokinetic testing {{has been able to}} help explain the longer acting pharmacologic effects of <b>Osemozotan,</b> and the increased potency. <b>Osemozotan</b> was shown to have increased duration of pharmacologic effects compared to azapirones and requires a substantially lower dose to produce its pharmacologic effects. [...] This may be attractive to populations that will have to take this medication in that they may not have to take the medication as often throughout the day. It must be noted that in these studies there was a difference in dosage amount necessary for the indication it is used. [...] <b>Osemozotan</b> has not been found to be metabolized to 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine, a common metabolite found with the azapirone class of medications. 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine has affinity for receptors other than 5-HT1A, decreasing its specificity and increasing the risk of unwanted effects. [...] Since <b>Osemozotan</b> does not express this metabolite, it has greater specificity to 5-HT1A compared to other anxiolytic medications.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>Osemozotan</b> {{is being}} investigated in its usage to treat pain, aggressive behavior, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and drug dependence with methamphetamine and cocaine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Osemozotan</b> (MKC-242) is a {{selective}} 5-HT1A receptor agonist with some functional selectivity, {{acting as a}} full agonist at presynaptic and a partial agonist at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. 5-HT1A receptor stimulation influences the release of various neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. 5-HT1A receptors are inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor. [...] <b>Osemozotan</b> has antidepressant, anxiolytic, antiobsessional, serenic, and analgesic effects in animal studies, and is used to investigate the role of 5-HT1A receptors in modulating the release of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, and their involvement in addiction to abused stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that <b>Osemozotan</b> {{be used as an}} analgesic agent because of its activation of 5-HT [...] 1A [...] receptors that lead to inhibitory serotonin signaling pathway within the spinal cord to cause hypoalgesia and decrease mechanical allodynia.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} noted that {{sensitization}} of cocaine may stem from action of the 5-HT [...] 1A [...] receptor. [...] While the role of 5-HT receptors with methamphetamine is still not certain, the use of <b>osemozotan</b> was found to decrease 5-HT levels in patients with repeated methamphetamine exposure; {{this may be a}} possibility for treatment of drug dependence with cocaine and methamphetamine.|$|E
