50|$|The {{electrical}} fault described above also affected unit 2 by causing breakers in the 230kv switchyard to trip cutting off power to RAT 2-B and vital bus B on unit 2. EDG 2-B subsequently started and restored {{power to the}} vital bus. At the same time, the electrical disturbance from the falling line striking the ground was detected by protective safeties on unit 2's main step-up transformer and a protective relay actuated and opened the transformer's <b>output</b> <b>breaker</b> causing a full load rejection to unit 2 {{which led to a}} turbine trip and reactor scram. After the unit tripped, the B non-vital electrical train lost power as it attempted to transfer from UAT 2-B (which is powered by the turbine generator) to the failed RAT 2-B causing two of the reactor coolant pumps and one of the main feedwater pumps to trip, though the plant cool down proceeded safely. At 9:03 p.m., the RAT 2-B breakers in the switchyard were reset and offsite power was restored to the vital and non-vital B electrical trains allowing reactor coolant pumps 2 and 4 to be restarted. EDG 2-B was shutdown. It was later determined that the fault disturbance caused by the line falling was not of significant magnitude to trip the protective relay per design and should not have caused unit 2 to shut down. Further investigation found that current transformers on the main transformer were improperly set. The controls were adjusted to the proper setting. Had the CTs been properly set initially, the unit would have remained online.|$|E
40|$|Plant, Unit 2, {{operating}} at approximately 99 % power, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) B {{was removed from}} service for scheduled maintenance. Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation 3. 8. 1 Condition B, was entered due one EDG inoperable. During the post-maintenance testing, EDG B <b>Output</b> <b>Breaker</b> 52 / 27 B failed to close. The investigation for the inoperability of Breaker 52 / 27 B determined that the shunt trip attachment (STA) had internal binding that prevented the STA from releasing the trip bar, resulting in the trip bar remaining in the "trip condition " and preventing the breaker from closing. EDG B was inoperable from January 28, 2010 to February 24, 2010, approximately 27 days. In addition, EDG A was declared inoperable on February 8, 2010 for approximately 6 hours and 53 minutes for scheduled maintenance. Additional details are provided in References 1 and 2. Key Event Details. The following event details are significant to the modeling of this event analysis: • There were approximately 27 days that the EDG B was unavailable due to the breaker failure. During this period, EDG A was unavailable due to surveillance testing for 7 hours. Therefore, the total duration of EDG B was unavailable by itself is 27 days minu...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Hybrid Power System (HPS) s are {{considered}} as a reliable and viable option for the electrification of rural villages which are {{beyond the reach of}} grid electricity. This project proposes a Novel method for an efficient power management, power quality enhancement and regulation in Off-Grid Hybrid Power System(OG-HPS) s. The proposed method uses an Intelligent Module Distribution Generation (IMDG) units, which internally uses the Phasor Measurement Units(PMUs) and Power Quality Regulation Unit(PQRU) as its processing core,with an aid of which they will detect the line faults and fluctuations in the power quality of the OG-HPS and corrects them to their rated level. As the core internal components of the IMDG units, the PMU detects the spurious fluctuations in the quality of power flowing through the associated bus line branch and measures the fluctuations with respect to its rated counter-parts. It issues an alert including the power fluctuations calculated so far to the PQRU which consists of variable winding transformers to step-up or to step-down the line voltage based on the calculated fluctuations. The PQRU not only intended to maintain the rated power quality on the Power Distribution Bus(PDB) of the Off-Grid system, but also protects it from the frequent physical faults due to natural disasters, birds and animals. The IMDG unit internally comprises a dedicated circuitry with bi-directional breakers to detect, locate and isolate the line faults of the OG-HPS. The fault detection circuit of IMDG compares the instantaneous parameter values of input and <b>output</b> <b>breaker</b> lines to detect the fault and isolate the faulted line. The IMDG regulates the power quality with protected fault free operation of OG-HPS. The proposed algorithm is designed,implemented and simulated in MATLAB environmen...|$|E
50|$|Faults in {{one part}} of the line also affect the entire {{distribution}} system since it is impossible for the 138 kV transmission system to protect or reconfigure itself during a fault condition. High voltage faults generally are cleared by opening converter <b>output</b> <b>breakers,</b> which causes a concurrent loss of the converter. The system does not degrade gracefully under high voltage faults. Rather than isolating, for example, the south 138 kV feeder between Washington and Perryville, the system would require opening converter <b>output</b> <b>breakers</b> at Jericho Park and Safe Harbor. This results in loss of much more of the network than is required to simply isolate the fault.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} EMC {{issue was}} lightning strike (lightning electromagnetic pulse, or LEMP) on buildings. Lightning rods or lightning conductors {{began to appear}} in the mid-18th century. With the advent of widespread electricity generation and power supply lines from the late 19th century on, problems also arose with equipment short-circuit failure affecting the power supply, and with local fire and shock hazard when the power line was struck by lightning. Power stations were provided with <b>output</b> circuit <b>breakers.</b> Buildings and appliances would soon be provided with input fuses, and later in the 20th century miniature circuit breakers (MCB) would come into use.|$|R
50|$|Each station {{contains}} two 115 kV (single phase) to 50 kV (single phase with center tap) transformers {{to convert the}} utility supplied transmission voltage to 50kV traction voltage. <b>Output</b> circuit <b>breakers,</b> and a capacitor based filter network are installed. The filter banks suppress the high frequency (that is anything above 60 Hz) harmonics on the catenary lines generated by locomotives' solid-state traction motor inverters. The filters also provide reactive power support and correct for power factor. Amtrak's 60 Hz electrification distributes power using ±25 kV from ground via a center tap of the 115/50 kV transformers. This system {{is also known as}} 2 x 25 kV.|$|R
50|$|Principal {{advantages}} of motor generators include very high fault current ratings and clean output current. Solid state electronics can be damaged very quickly, so the microprocessor control systems react {{very quickly to}} over-correct conditions to place the converter in a safe, idle mode; or to trip the <b>output</b> circuit <b>breaker.</b> Motor generators, being of 1930s design, are heavily overbuilt. These rugged machines can absorb large load transients and demanding fault conditions, while continuing to remain online. Their output waveform is also perfectly sinusoidal without noise or higher harmonic output. They can actually absorb harmonic noise produced by solid-state devices, effectively serving as a filter. These attributes, combined with their high fault-current capability, make them desirable in a stabilizing role within the power system. Amtrak has retained two of the original converter plants and plans to overhaul them and continue their operation indefinitely.|$|R

The knowledge of the present methods of connecting the synchronous alternators to the common network, of the historical evolution of this set of problems, of the phase conditions, their permitted deviations, {{as well as of the}} actual use of the modern phase automatic equipment, thereafter we to concentrate exclusively on the function of the synchro-check feeder terminal REF 543 produced by the ABB company. A part of this work is the analysis of the transient phenomena, that of accurate phasing, as well as that of phasing during a voltage, frequency and phase shift.

The backpropagation neural network does not have limitations cause of the impedance range setting. If the output gives the wrong result, so the correct of the weights can be minimized and also the response of galat, the backpropagation neural network is expected to be closer to the correct value.
