40|$|The term "offshore banking" {{has many}} meanings. The most common {{definition}} involves {{an institution that}} is situated in a country which deals with foreign currencies and with non-residents. The following characteristics may have a substantial bearing {{on the success of}} an OBC : ocation/time zone, political situation, economic stability, advanced telecommunication facilities, skilled personnel, the legal system, the secrecy of the banking system, foreign exchange relations and above all favourable taxation legislation and absence of certain government regulations. Absence of any of the above characteristics may inhibit the conduct of business by an <b>Offshore</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Centre.</b> This thesis makes an assessment of these reconditions. Despite the vital importance of such an assessment, little {{attention has been paid to}} it in the recent past...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. With {{the steady}} {{integration}} of a deregulated world of hypermobile capital, <b>offshore</b> <b>banking</b> {{has become an}} increasingly {{significant part of the}} geography of international finance. Many interpretations tend to treat <b>offshore</b> <b>banking</b> <b>centres</b> as identical sites of investment that can be easily substituted for one another by completely mobile, fungible capital. This paper explores the nature of <b>offshore</b> <b>banking</b> in one largely overlooked centre, Panama. It charts the historic context that {{led to the creation of}} Latin America’s most important <b>centre</b> of international <b>banking,</b> emphasizing the unique qualities that stand in contrast to hyperglobalist interpretations, including the Canal and the role of the US dollar. Second, it summarizes the regulatory changes initiated in the face of global neoliberalism, including the absence of a central bank and recent reforms designed to attract foreign capital. Using primary and secondary data, the paper maps Panama’s growing role as a net capital exporter, charting domestic and foreign loan markets. Finally, it also addresses the trade-offs between confidentiality, and transparency in the context of illicit activities frequently alleged to occur in <b>offshore</b> <b>banking</b> <b>centres,</b> which in Panama revolve around drug trafficking and money laundering. It concludes by noting that even in an ostensibly seamless world, <b>offshore</b> <b>banking</b> exhibits the place-based embeddedness of financial capital within local institutional relations.

5000|$|To {{obtain a}} {{view on the}} most popular {{destinations}} for people willing to open their <b>offshore</b> <b>bank</b> accounts, a stable political and economical jurisdiction is a criterion for opening bank accounts in well-established <b>offshore</b> <b>banks.</b> In terms of <b>offshore</b> <b>banking</b> <b>centres</b> {{and in terms of}} total deposits, the global market is dominated by two key jurisdictions: Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. A letter by the District Attorney of New York, Robert M. Morgenthau, published by The New York Times, states that the Cayman Islands has 1.9 trillion United States dollars on deposit in 281 banks, including 40 of the world’s top 50 banks, although official statistics published by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority suggest the amounts held on deposit are actually around 1.5 trillion U.S. [...] Numerous other offshore jurisdictions also provide <b>offshore</b> <b>banking</b> {{to a greater or lesser}} degree. In particular, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man are known for their well regulated <b>banking</b> infrastructure. Some <b>offshore</b> jurisdictions have steered their financial sectors away from <b>offshore</b> <b>banking,</b> as difficult to properly regulate and liable to give rise to financial scandal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>bank</b> {{accounts}} are sometimes less financially secure. In a banking crisis which swept {{the world in}} 2008, some savers lost funds that were not insured by {{the country in which}} they were deposited. Those who had deposited with the same banks onshore received all of their money back. In 2009, The Isle of Man authorities were keen to point out that 90% of the claimants were paid, although this only referred to {{the number of people who}} had received money from their depositor compensation scheme and not the amount of money refunded. In reality, only 40% of depositor funds had been repaid: 24.8% in September 2009 and 15.2% in December 2009. Both <b>offshore</b> and onshore <b>banking</b> <b>centres</b> often have depositor compensation schemes. For example: The Isle of Man compensation scheme guarantees £50,000 of net deposits per individual depositor, or £20,000 for most other categories of depositor. Potential depositors should be aware that any deposits over the guaranteed amount are at risk. However, only offshore centres such as the Isle of Man have refused to compensate depositors 100% of their funds following Bank collapses. Onshore depositors have been refunded in full, regardless of what the compensation limit of that country has stated. Thus, <b>banking</b> <b>offshore</b> is historically riskier than banking onshore.|$|R
50|$|Some $3 {{trillion}} is in {{deposits in}} tax haven {{banks and the}} rest is in securities held by international business companies (IBCs) and trusts. Among <b>offshore</b> <b>banks,</b> Swiss banks hold an estimated 35% of the world's private and institutional funds (or 3 trillion Swiss francs), and the Cayman Islands (1.9 trillion US dollars in deposits) are the fifth largest <b>banking</b> <b>centre</b> globally in terms of deposits. However, recent data by the Swiss National Bank show that the assets held by foreign persons in Swiss bank accounts declined by 28.1% between January 2008 and November 2009.|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally, {{a number}} of <b>offshore</b> jurisdictions offered <b>banking</b> {{licences}} to institutions with relatively little scrutiny.
