5|$|At all levels, Scouts {{are governed}} by an {{executive}} of trustees, known as executive committees – these could be volunteers from the local community who have had ties with the association, either themselves or through their children. An executive normally consists of a chairman, secretary, treasurer, {{and a number of}} other officers. In Group Executive Committees, Group Scout Leaders and Section Leaders also form part of the committee. Their role is to ensure that the best interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and the community are served by the group, district, county, or national levels of the association.|$|E

Students from Year 11 (Form 5) and Year 12 (Form 6) are the exception, as they study from the New Zealand Curriculum Framework at NCEA Levels 1, 2 and 3.|$|E

25|$|The Marriage Law of 1950 {{guaranteed}} {{everyone the}} freedom to choose his or her marriage partner. Nevertheless, especially in the countryside, there were few opportunities to meet potential mates. Rural China offered little privacy for courtship, and in villages there was little public tolerance for flirting or even extended conversation between unmarried men and women. Introductions and go-betweens continued {{to play a major role}} in the arrangement of marriages. In most cases each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> and their parents, had an effective veto over any proposed match.|$|E
25|$|Each WAGGGS Member Organization chooses how it {{believes}} it can best promote these goals, {{taking into account}} its culture {{and the needs of}} its young people. Some choose to work with girls alone in a single sex environment in order to break down stereotypes and to give girls and young women the confidence to take their place in society. Other Member Organizations prefer to work with mixed groups to enable young women and young men equal partnership within their units.

25|$|In September 2006, the British Council {{conducted}} a survey in various Romanian cities which, among other things, sought to ascertain the beliefs of Romanian young people (aged between 15 and 25) regarding LGBT rights. Of those surveyed, 39.1% believed that LGBT rights should be extended, 35.9% believed that the LGBT rights situation is satisfactory in Romania, while 15.6% of people stated that LGBT people have too many rights. 9.4% were undecided. Additionally, 71.9% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> surveyed stated that LGBT rights should be protected, indicating relatively high levels of acceptance among this demographic. A more recent research conducted by ACCEPT shows that 61% of students who have a different sexual orientation and recognize this have been physically or verbally bullied by their peers.|$|E
25|$|The Black Parents Movement later {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with the Black Youth Movement and the Race Today Collective, which had, with the Race Today journal, by then separated from the IRR. Together they established a formidable cultural and political movement, successfully fighting many cases against police oppression and arbitrariness and for better state education. It was the Alliance that formed the New Cross Massacre Action Committee {{in response to the}} alleged arson attack which resulted in the death of 14 young blacks, and mobilised 20,000 black people and their supporters in March 1981 to protest the death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and the failure of the police to conduct a proper investigation.

25|$|Turning his {{attention}} to the matter of education in the country, President Quezon by virtue of Executive Order No. 19, dated February 19, 1936, created the National Council of Education, with Rafael Palma, former President of the University of the Philippines, as its first chairman. Funds retained from the early approved Residence Certificate Law were devoted to the maintenance of the public schools all over the nation and the opening of many more to meet the needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Indeed, by this time there were already 6,511 primary schools; 1,039 intermediate schools; 133 secondary and special schools; and five junior colleges. The total number of pupils enrolled was 1,262,353, who were placed under the charge of 28,485 schools teachers. That year's appropriation for public education amounted to 14,566,850 pesos. The private institutions of learning, for their part, accommodated more than ninety seven thousand students, thus considerably aiding the government in solving the annual school crisis. To implement the pertinent constitutional provision, the Office of Adult Education was also created.|$|E
500|$|The Huaorani {{around the}} time of Operation Auca were a small tribe occupying the jungle of Eastern Ecuador between the Napo and Curaray Rivers, an area of {{approximately}} 20,000 square kilometers (7,700mi²). They numbered approximately 600 people, and were split into three groups, all mutually hostilethe Geketaidi, the Baïidi, and the Wepeidi. They lived on the gathering and cultivation of plant foods like manioc and plantains, as well as fishing and hunting with spear and blowgun. Family units consisted of a man and his wife or wives, their unmarried sons, their married daughters and sons-in-law, and their grandchildren. [...] All of them would reside in a longhouse, which was separated by several kilometers from another longhouse in which close relatives lived.

By 1874, the church was drawing larger crowds under then-pastor Joseph Stitt, who was described as an [...] "excellent leader of singing". An afternoon Sunday school session was particularly popular, [...] "principally devoted to learning new hymns, which attracted many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> of the town, especially the young men", noted one account. When the ME church held its twenty-fifth anniversary celebration in 1896, it opened with prayer and a piano concert, [...] "favored with a beautiful selection sung by Mrs. Randolph Murphy", said a contemporary report.|$|E

500|$|As {{the metal}} mining {{industry}} {{on which it}} depended declined, and prices for staple goods rose sharply resulting from fluctuations in food prices and of the American Civil War, the economy of Cornwall collapsed. Large numbers of Cornish families emigrated to mining districts in other countries {{and other parts of}} the United Kingdom; in some former mining districts as much as [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> moved out in the 20 years following the closure of the local mines. Between 1861 and 1900 at least 35% of Cornish women aged 15–24 moved to other parts of the UK, and over 26% left the country altogether. Although the male emigrants generally found work in mines in their new places of settlement, or put their mining skills to use digging tunnels for the rapidly growing railway networks, the jobs traditionally done by bal maidens, where they still existed, [...] were usually done by locally recruited men or boys, and the tradition of female Cornish mine labour died out in emigrant families.|$|E

Upon their arrival, they are greeted by Rivan (Brenda Bakke) and Liator (Jay Louden) in a very comfortable way, triggering Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) [...] to determine it a [...] "nice planet", while Wesley leaves the adults to socialize with native teenagers. On the Enterprise, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) reports something unusual orbiting the planet, but nothing appears on the viewscreen. He sends out a communications signal which reveals another vessel in orbit. A small ball of light enters the bridge and communicates with Picard through Data in a booming voice warning him not to interfere with the Edo, calling them his [...] "children". The intruder then incapacitates Data.|$|E
500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E
