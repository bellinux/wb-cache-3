25|$|Currently, {{there is}} no cure for muscular dystrophy. In terms of management, {{physical}} therapy, occupational therapy, <b>orthotic</b> intervention (e.g., ankle-foot orthosis), speech therapy, and respiratory therapy may be helpful. Low intensity corticosteroids such as prednisone, and deflazacort may help to maintain muscle tone. Orthoses (orthopedic appliances used for support) and corrective orthopedic surgery may be needed {{to improve the quality of}} life in some cases. The cardiac problems that occur with EDMD and myotonic muscular dystrophy may require a pacemaker. The myotonia (delayed relaxation of a muscle after a strong contraction) occurring in myotonic muscular dystrophy may be treated with medications such as quinine.|$|E
25|$|As well as medication, {{rehabilitation}} programmes {{and surgical}} interventions, {{the application of}} biomechanical loading on tremor movement {{has been shown to}} be a technique that is able to suppress the effects of tremor on the human body. It has been established in the literature that most of the different types of tremor respond to biomechanical loading. In particular, it has been clinically tested that the increase of damping and/or inertia in the upper limb leads to a reduction of the tremorous motion. Biomechanical loading relies on an external device that either passively or actively acts mechanically in parallel to the upper limb to counteract tremor movement. This phenomenon gives rise to the possibility of an <b>orthotic</b> management of tremor.|$|E

Many of the therapies used to treat CP have no good evidence base.

40|$|Background: Education of Prosthetics and <b>Orthotics</b> is a {{relatively}} recent professional program. While {{there has been some}} work on various teaching methods and strategies in international medical education, limited publication exists within prosthetics and <b>orthotics.</b> Objectives: To identify the teaching and learning methods that are used in Bachelor-level prosthetics and <b>orthotics</b> programs that are given highest priority by expert prosthetics and <b>orthotics</b> instructors from regions enjoying a range of economic development. Study design: Mixed method. Methods: The study partly documented by this article utilized a mixed method approach (qualitative and quantitative methods) within which each phase provided data for other phases. It began with analysis of prosthetics and <b>orthotics</b> curricula documents, which was followed by a broad survey of instructors in this field and then a modified Delphi process. Results: The expert instructors who participated in this study gave high priority to student-centered, small group methods that encourage critical thinking and may lead to lifelong learning. Instructors from more developed nations placed higher priority on student's independent acquisition of prosthetics and <b>orthotics</b> knowledge, particularly in clinical training. Conclusions: Application of student-centered approaches to prosthetics and <b>orthotics</b> programs may be preferred by many experts, but there appeared to be regional differences in the priority given to different teaching methods. Clinical relevance The results of this study identify the methods of teaching that are preferred by expert prosthetics and <b>orthotics</b> instructors from a variety of regions.

50|$|Aside from surgery, {{there are}} a few options for {{handling}} an accessory navicular bone that has become symptomatic. This includes immobilization, icing, medicating, physical therapy, and <b>orthotic</b> devices. Immobilizing involves placing the foot and ankle in a cast or removable walking boot. This alleviates stressors on the foot and can decrease inflammation. Icing will help reduce swelling and inflammation. Medication involves usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or steroids (taken orally or injected) to decrease inflammation. Physical therapy can be prescribed in order to strengthen the muscles and help decrease inflammation. Physical therapy can also help prevent the symptoms from returning. <b>Orthotic</b> devices (arch support devices that fit in a shoe) can help prevent future symptoms. Occasionally, the <b>orthotic</b> device will dig into the edge of the accessory navicular and cause discomfort.
