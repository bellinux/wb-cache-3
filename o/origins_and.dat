5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French <b>origins,</b> <b>and</b> always saw himself as a Pole.|$|E

The goal is to provide effective defenses against both invalid <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> incorrect path injection attacks, while remaining scalable, incrementally deployable, and operationally simple. The approach centers around con-structing a Reachability Validation Graph (RVG), against which <b>origin</b> <b>and</b> path information in route advertisements can be checked for validity.
