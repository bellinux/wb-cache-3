The present study investigated the serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) system using <b>organoids.</b> <b>Organoids</b> from murine small intestinal and colonic crypts were successfully cultured. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that small intestinal and colonic <b>organoids</b> express mRNAs encoding tryptophan hydroxylase- 1 (TPH 1) (the rate-limiting enzyme of 5 -HT synthesis), serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), 5 -HT receptor (HTR) 2 A, HTR 2 B, and HTR 4. SERT mRNA levels were significantly higher in the small intestine than in the colon in both the mucosal tissues and <b>organoids,</b> as estimated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Although the 5 -HT concentration and levels of chromogranin A (CgA) (an enteroendocrine cell marker), TPH 1, and HTR 4 mRNAs were significantly higher in the colonic mucosa than the small intestinal mucosa, {{they were the same}} in small intestinal and colonic <b>organoids.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} HTR 2 A and HTR 2 B mRNA levels between the small intestine and colon in either the mucosal tissues or <b>organoids.</b> Immunofluorescence staining showed that the number of CgA-positive cells in the colonic <b>organoids</b> appeared to increase upon culturing with acetate.

50|$|<b>Organoid</b> {{formation}} generally requires culturing {{the stem}} cells or progenitor cells in a 3D media. The 3D media can be made using an extracellular matrix hydrogel Matrigel, which is a laminin-rich extracellular matrix that is secreted by the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor line. <b>Organoid</b> bodies can then be made through embedding stem cells in the 3D media. When pluripotent stem cells are used {{for the creation of}} the <b>organoid,</b> the cells are usually, but not all the time, allowed to form embryoid bodies. Those embryoid bodies are then pharmacologically treated with patterning factors to drive the formation of the desired <b>organoid</b> identity. Organoids have also been created using adult stem cells extracted from the target organ, and cultured in 3D media.|$|E
50|$|To make an <b>organoid,</b> an embryoid (tissue {{that has}} some {{embryonic}} features) grown from natural stem cells is used. Embryos have three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. Each turns into various body parts. The nervous system grows from the ectoderm (which also contributes dental enamel and the epidermis). Ectodermal cells were placed into gel droplets and floated in a nutrient broth in a rotating bioreactor, which supported cell growth without forming by the container. After ten days the <b>organoid</b> developed neurons. After 30 days it displayed regions similar to parts of brains. Lacking a blood supply, cerebral organoids reach about 4 mm across and can last a year or more. The general procedure {{can be broken down}} into 5 steps. First human pluripotent stem cells are cultured. They are then allowed to cultivate into an embryoid body. Next the cell culture is induced to form a neuroectoderm. The neuroectoderm is then grown in a matrigel droplet. The matrigel provides nutrients and the neuroectoderm starts to proliferate and grow. However, the lack of vasculature limits the size the <b>organoid</b> can grow. This has been the major limitation in <b>organoid</b> development, however new methods using a spinning bioreactor have allowed an increase in the availability of nutrients to cells inside the <b>organoid.</b> This last step has been the key breakthrough in <b>organoid</b> development. Spinning bioreactors have been used increasingly in cell culture and tissue growth applications. The reactor is able to deliver faster cell doubling times, increased cell expansion and increased extra-cellular matrix components when compared to statically cultured cells.|$|E

5000|$|Intestinal <b>organoids</b> {{have thus}} far been among the gut <b>organoids</b> to be {{generated}} directly from pluripotent stem cells. One way human pluripotent stem cells can be driven to form intestinal <b>organoids</b> is through first the application of activin A to drive the cells into a mesoendodermal identity, followed by the pharmacological upregulation of Wnt3a and Fgf4 signaling pathways {{as they have been}} demonstrated to promote posterior gut fate. Intestinal <b>organoids</b> have also been generated from intestinal stem cells, extracted from adult tissue and cultured in 3D media. Intestinal <b>organoids</b> recapitulate the crypt-Villus structure of the intestine, by recapitulating its function, physiology and organization, and maintaining all the cell types found normally in the structure including intestinal stem cells. Intestinal <b>organoids</b> recapitulate the crypt-Villus structure to high degree of fidelity that they have been successfully transplanted to mouse intestines, and are hence highly regarded as a valuable model for research. One of the fields of research that intestinal <b>organoids</b> have been utilized is that of stem cell niche. Intestinal <b>organoids</b> were used to study the nature of the intestinal stem cell niche, and research done with them demonstrated the positive role IL-22 has in maintaining in intestinal stem cells, along with demonstrating the roles of other cell types like neurons and fibroblasts in maintenance of intestinal tem cells.

50|$|It is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how individual localized tissues formed by stem cells are able to coordinate with surrounding tissues to develop into a whole organ. It has been shown however that most tissue differentiation requires interactions with surrounding tissues and depends on diffusible induction factors to either inhibit or encourage various differentiation and physical localization. Cerebral <b>organoid</b> differentiation is somewhat localized. The previously mentioned markers for forebrain and hindbrain are physically localized, appearing in clusters. This suggests that local stimuli are released once one or more cells differentiates into a specific type {{as opposed to a}} random pathway throughout the tissue. The markers for subspecification of cortical lobes, prefrontal cortex and occipital lobe, are also physically localized. However, the hippocampus and ventral forebrain cells are not physically localized and are randomly located through the cerebral <b>organoid.</b> Cerebral organoids lack blood vessels and are limited in size by nutrient uptake in the innermost cells.

50|$|Organoids {{can be used}} {{to study}} the crucial early stages of brain development, test drugs and, because they can be made from living cells, study {{individual}} patients., In one case, a cerebral <b>organoid</b> grown from a patient with microcephaly demonstrated related symptoms and revealed that apparently the cause is overly rapid development, followed by slower brain growth. Microencephaly is a developmental condition in which the brain remains undersized, producing an undersized head and debilitation. Microcephaly is not suitable for mouse models, which do not replicate the condition. The primary form of the disease is thought to be caused by a homozygous mutation in the microcephalin gene. The disease is difficult to reproduce in mouse models because mice lack the developmental stages for an enlarged cerebral cortex that humans have. Naturally, a disease which affects this development would be impossible to show in a model which does not have it to begin with. To use cerebral organoids to model a human's microcephaly, one group of researchers has taken patient skin fibroblasts and reprogrammed them using four well known reprogramming factors. These include OCT4, SOX2, MYC and KLF4. The reprogrammed sample was able to be cloned into induced pluripotent stem cells. The cells were cultured into a cerebral <b>organoid</b> following a process described in the cerebral <b>organoid</b> creation section below. The <b>organoid</b> that resulted had decreased numbers of neural progenitor cells and smaller tissues. Additionally, the patient derived tissues displayed fewer and less frequent neuroepithelial tissues made of progenitors, decreased radial glial stem cells, and increased neurons.
