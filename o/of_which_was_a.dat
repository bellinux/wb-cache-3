5|$|After {{beginning}} the 1998–99 {{season on the}} Canucks' top line, Bertuzzi was limited to 32 games due to injuries, the first <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fractured tibia. He suffered the injury on November 1, 1998, after a shot by teammate Mattias Öhlund {{hit him in the}} leg. His season was later ended with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, suffered during a game on March 5, 1999. He recorded 8 goals and 16 points in 1998–99. In the off-season, Bertuzzi became a restricted free agent and was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year contract in September 1999. The deal was reported by The Vancouver Sun to be worth a little over $2 million.|$|E

5|$|After {{getting married}} in the offseason, Gromek entered the 1946 Cleveland Indians season {{as one of the}} four primary {{starting}} pitchers alongside Allie Reynolds, as well as Bob Feller and Red Embree who had returned from the war. Gromek started the season by pitching in the home opener against Detroit. In a 7–0 loss, the Tigers allowed two hits, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> single by Gromek, who allowed five runs in six innings. After losing his first three games of the season, he won his next three in May, which included two complete game shutouts against the Athletics and Browns. He followed that up with a four-game losing streak, which went through the end of June. After his June 28th win, however, Gromek fell in a slump, and Indians management reduced his role to that of a part-time starter who would only see action in a few innings at a time. Gromek lost seven straight games between June 28 and September 10 before breaking the streak in his second-to-last appearance of the season, a 4–2 victory against the Yankees. Gromek finished the season with a 5–15 record and a 4.33 ERA in 29 games.|$|E
5|$|Against the Panthers, the Bears' defense forced three {{turnovers}} in {{the first}} half, which included a 51-yard interception return for touchdown by Jon Bostic, followed by Zack Bowman intercepting Derek Anderson and Sherrick McManis forcing Kenjon Barner to fumble; the Bears recorded {{a total of four}} takeaways in the game. However, the offense allowed seven sacks and had three turnovers, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fumble by Armando Allen. Panthers cornerback Josh Norman had two interceptions, one of which set up the first score of the game via Cam Newton's three-yard touchdown pass to Brandon LaFell early in the game. Bostic's pick-six tied up the game, followed by Robbie Gould's 35-yard field goal in the second quarter. With 18 seconds left {{in the first}} half, Carolina scored again on Kenjon Barner's 5-yard touchdown run; the Panthers scored the lone points of the third quarter after Norman intercepted Matt Blanchard, scoring on the 60-yard return. Though the Bears retaliated after Blanchard threw a 58-yard pass to Marquess Wilson to Carolina's 4-yard line, followed by Michael Ford's touchdown run, Graham Gano's 50-yard field goal was the final score of the game, as the Panthers triumphed 24–17.|$|E
5|$|Big Brother 11 was the {{eleventh}} {{season of the}} American reality television series Big Brother. It {{is based upon the}} Netherlands series of the same name, which gained notoriety in 1999 and 2000. The series premiered on CBS on July 9, 2009 and lasted ten weeks until the live finale on September 15, 2009. The eleventh season saw a slight increase in ratings when compared to the past season of the series, which had some of the lowest ratings to date. The season premiered to a total of 6.59 million viewers, a slight increase from the previous season's launch. Despite this, it is the second lowest premiere for a season behind Big Brother 10. The season finale had a total of 7.78 million viewers, continuing to average slightly above the past season. In total, the series averaged 7.19 million viewers, higher than that of the previous two seasons. Big Brother 11 featured a total of 13 HouseGuests, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> returning player from a previous season. The series ended after 73 days, in which HouseGuest Jordan Lloyd was crowned the winner and Natalie Martinez the runner-up.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by {{the recent}} grant of an Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} {{the building of the}} Glamorganshire Canal, it was resolved at a meeting at the Ship & Castle public house in Neath on 12 July 1790 to build a canal from Pontneddfechan to Neath, and another from Neath to Giant's Grave. Among those attending was Lord Vernon, who had already built a short canal near Giant's Grave to connect the River Neath to furnaces at Penrhiwtyn. Thomas Dadford was asked to survey a course, and he was assisted by his father and brother. He proposed a route which required 22 locks, part <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> conventional canal, while other parts used the River Neath. Dadford costed the project at £25,716, but in early 1791 Lord Vernon's agent, Lewis Thomas, proposed two new cuts, and the idea of using the river was dropped soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1946 St. Louis Browns season, manager Luke Sewell was {{reluctant}} to turn Zoldak into a starter, but eventually gave him the nod. His first two starts were both victories, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> complete game shutout against the Chicago White Sox, which gave him credit for three of the Browns' first eight wins of the season. He pitched in 35 games over the season, 21 of them starts, and ended the year with a 3.43 ERA, a 911 record, and a career-high 51 strikeouts. Unlike the previous season, Zoldak was slow to start in 1947, not winning his first game until June 22 against the Washington Senators. He finished the season similar statistically to 1946: he played in 35 games and started 19, and had a record of 9-10 and a 3.47 ERA. During the offseason, Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck offered $100,000 for Zoldak, but were turned down, and he remained on the Browns to begin the 1948 season. Zoldak was projected to be the team's opening day starting pitcher against the Cleveland Indians, who had planned for him; instead he was used in relief and Fred Sanford was named the starter {{the day of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|From 1921 to 1927, Murray led archaeological {{excavations}} on Malta, {{assisted by}} Edith Guest and Gertrude Caton Thompson. She excavated the Bronze Age megalithic monuments of Santa Sofia, Santa Maria tal-Bakkari, Għar Dalam, and Borġ in-Nadur, {{all of which}} were threatened by {{the construction of a new}} aerodrome. In this she was funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund. Her resulting three-volume excavation report came to be seen as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology. During the excavations, she had taken an interest in the island's folklore, resulting in the 1932 publication of her book Maltese Folktales, much <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> translation of earlier stories collected by Father Magri and her friend Liza Galea. In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in Malta Museum, resulting in another publication, Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta.|$|E

5|$|Hull City Association Football Club {{was founded}} in June 1904; {{previous}} attempts to found a football club had proved difficult because of the dominance {{in the city of}} rugby league teams such as Hull F.C. and Hull Kingston Rovers. The club was unable to apply for membership of the Football League for the 1904–05 season and instead played only in friendlies, the first <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 2–2 draw with Notts County on 1 September 1904 with 6,000 in attendance. These early matches were played at the Boulevard, the home of Hull F.C. The club's first competitive football match was in the FA Cup preliminary round, drawing 3–3 with Stockton on 17 September, but they were eliminated after losing the replay 4–1 on 22 September. After disputes with landlords at the Boulevard, Hull City moved to Anlaby Road Cricket Ground. After having played 44friendly fixtures the previous season, Hull City were finally admitted into the Football League Second Division for the 1905–06 season. Other teams competing in the league that season included the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea, as well as Yorkshire rivals Barnsley, Bradford City and Leeds City. Hull defeated Barnsley 4–1 at home in their first game and finished the season in fifth place.|$|E
5|$|In 1907 {{the family}} split up; {{there was no}} divorce or formal separation, but the two elder boys, Christopher and Ambrose, {{remained}} with their father and Lydia left them, taking Ralph with her. The ostensible cause of the couple's separation was a row over Lydia's choice of wallpaper for her husband's study. According to John Miller's biography, whatever underlying causes {{there may have been}} are unknown. An earlier biographer, Garry O'Connor, speculates that Arthur Richardson might have been having an extramarital affair. There {{does not seem to have}} been a religious element, although Arthur was a dedicated Quaker, whose first two sons were brought up in that faith, whereas Lydia was a devout convert to Roman Catholicism, in which she raised Ralph.
