A number also have Talavera tile as a decorative feature, which is common in Puebla. A few have intricate stucco work done by indigenous hands. These churches together contain more than 300 works of art from the 16th to 19th centuries, which have a total value of millions of dollars. Increases in the theft of religious art {{have led to a}} number of measures being taken to protect them. <b>Over</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> churches were routinely open during the week, but now many are not. When they are open, many have at least one guard on duty, {{or in the case of}} the Nuestra Señora de los Remedios church, video surveillance. Some churches put replicas of the works on display, such as in the monastery of San Gabriel. Some do not permit photographs or video of the church interiors.|$|E
25|$|Although Venezuelan {{extra-heavy}} oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of {{the difference}} is due to temperature. Once the oil {{comes out of the}} ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of , which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems – {{as a result of the}} country's economic crisis -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.|$|E

30|$|These {{issues raised}} <b>over</b> half <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago</b> are still {{apparent}} today. Link (Interview 2016) expressed how problematic additional data integration can be amid a crisis for responders {{who are already}} overstretched in their day-to-day tasks. Emergency responders also held expectations surrounding the data {{they were willing to}} accept, principally based on past experiences or data presented by reliable humanitarian ‘brands’ (Verity, Interview 2016). Furthermore, the data required varies dramatically across crises, and often, during sudden onset emergencies, responders are unsure of their immediate information needs. This makes it difficult to predict whether crowdsourced data is immediately useful and usable (Link, Interview 2016). It is perhaps understandable then that crowdsourced crisis mapping, despite providing a wealth of additional information, cannot automatically and effortlessly be utilised within demanding, unstable contexts. In contrast, there are contexts where there is such minimal data available to emergency responders, that any data, regardless of the stressful context, becomes highly valuable (Link, Interview 2016).|$|R
40|$|The sudden {{onset of}} catastrophic ozone losses <b>over</b> Antarctica <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago</b> evokes the {{response}} of a feedback system under a steady perturbation. In this paper an explicit feedback mechanism is proposed and incorporated into a kinetic model that mimics observable trends for major variables. The essence of the proposal is that the extent and time profile of seasonal ozone depletion actually imply the coupling of [O_ 3], radiative heating, cloud persistence and heterogeneous regeneration of photochemically active chlorine species. The model seeks insight into the phenomenon as a paradigm of unanticipated amplification of human activity, strives for clarity and relevance and complies with fundamental principles and with global constraints such as ozone levels and decay rates, chlorine monoxide and nitrogen dioxide concentrations and cloud sightings. Two main conclusions emerge: 1) the local regeneration of active chlorine mediated by nitrogen dioxide on ice clouds after sunrise is a key factor, and 2) local ozone losses become highly sensitive to initial conditions, and to slight perturbations of the catalytic activity of clouds, above critical levels of active chlorine...|$|R

The introduction of anti-TNF therapies, however, {{has changed the}} way patients with CD are treated. Over 10 years of clinical data and experience have demonstrated these therapies to be highly effective in CD. Aim: To provide clinicians guidance on optimising treatment with anti-TNF therapies in CD by introducing an evidence- and personal opinion based treatment algorithm using infliximab initial anti-TNF therapy. Methods: Scientific literature was reviewed using MEDLINE to evaluate data on clinical trials with infliximab in luminal and fistulising CD. Results: The data from several landmark infliximab trials have changed clinical practice {{and led to a}} readjustment of treatment goals in CD, allowing patients to achieve more than just symptomatic relief including sustained steroid-free remission. Infliximab induces complete mucosal healing and reduces the rates of hospitalisation and surgery. Based on disease-related risk factors, a treatment algorithm for infliximab is delineated in favour of a rapid step-up approach in patients at high risk for a disabling course of disease. Conclusions: Adopting the suggested treatment algorithm for infliximab into clinical routine is aimed to optimise outcomes for patients with CD...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Wall, a new era of East German {{literature}} has emerged. This genre of literature exists even though East Germany’s borders dissolved <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> and half <b>ago</b> and is challenging {{the way we think about}} the former German Democratic Republic. East German author Thomas Brussig is pivotal in this new genre of literature. His novels Helden wie wir (1995), Am kürzeren Ende der Sonnenallee (1999) and Leander Haußmann’s cinematic adaptation, Sonnenallee (1999), confront the negative associations and stereotypes connected with East Germany to deconstruct how formal history has portrayed its past and its citizens. Brussig’s texts take a completely different approach to remembering the GDR, which simultaneously challenges history’s dominant perspective as well as the Ostalgie phenomenon. Through his texts’ recollection, Brussig subverts the East German state in hindsight and begins the construction of a new mythology with which to associate former East Germany...|$|R

In Slovenia, systematic regulation of this area is still awaited. The paper presents a brief overview of personal assistance arrangements in some European countries in which it has been introduced and regulated already <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> or more <b>ago.</b> Personal assistance in Slovenia is non-systematically regulated. It is implemented by various organizations that are financed from several sources. It has become apparent that the amount of funding for personal assistance in recent years has been increasing; the same goes for the number of organizations providing personal assistance. However, whether the needs of the users with the highest intensity of needs are better met than in the past is debatable, or the case is that the personal assistance to these persons has remained concentrated within a few organizations. Certain partial changes and improvements in funding and the implementation of personal assistance are thus detected, but unfortunately a stable system is not yet in sight...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to a problem of school-related bullying. Bullying is a global problem that affect big number of students, and has serious short- and long-term consequences. Bullying can be manifested in various forms: it can be physical, emotional, and lately also cyber-bullying. Being a complex phenomenon, bullying {{can be difficult to}} identify, to intervene or prevent. It originates from power imbalance in a social group, and can target anyone who qualifies as “different” in any way. In order to provide analysis of bullying, in the present paper are presented definitions and analysis of the phenomenon of bullying as well global statistics of bullying across the countries {{in order to understand the}} scale of the problem and get deeper knowledge of the phenomenon of bullying to be able to prevent it more effectively. Since power is complex metaphysical concept that can not be easily defined, analysis of phenomenon is presented in the thesis. The last part of the present thesis {{is dedicated to}} analysis of two stories from former bullying victims. Both respondents who shared their experience are adults and has been conscious decision: since traumatizing experience has taken place <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> or two <b>ago,</b> both respondents have had opportunity to reflect on the experience, and also can share what long-term effects they have experienced due to bullying. From the perspective of Educational Leadership, the subject of prevention of bullying is important since it affects the whole school environment. As school leaders, it is in principals’ competence and power to encourage prevention of bullying, to create positive learning environment to educate generations of emotionally and academically intelligent young people...|$|R

40|$|Technology, {{especially}} multimedia technology, {{is changing}} the way we tell stories. We are all familiar with letters, articles, and books, but new Internet technology has led to two novel forms of storytelling that we call micro stories and mega stories. Micro stories are the short bits of text and images that we use to tell our friends about our daily life, what we had for lunch, and the funny bits of our day. They are uploaded {{in the form of}} text, images, and soon even short videos. All these micro stories represent data thatwecanthenassembleintomegastories about our lives. In addition to the direct data presented, the metadata related to the time, location, user, and the social graph of the creator are all important bits of information that {{play a key role in}} these stories. Where are the most popular bars? What are the trending words in our discourse? Where can I find a taxi? Our use of technology has changed <b>over</b> time. <b>A</b> few <b>decades</b> <b>ago</b> technologists predicted that we would all create our own webpages. When we discovered that HTML was too cumbersome for the average user, the answer became blogs—just start writing. Yet, even short blog postings require significant storytelling ability. Then there were question-answering sites such as Yahoo Answers. Anybody can writeaquestion,andtheWebwillprovide the answer. Now we have services such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram that require even less creative effort. Here we discuss both micro- and mega-story types to see how people are using multimedia to drive these two extreme forms of storytelling. Micro Stories People have always—and yes, we mean always—told stories, from pictures on cave walls to oral stories, written text, photo albums, movies, and now multimedia. Often these stories span many events and include many people. This requires collecting data related to those events and then editing it for presentation based on the intended audience. Because creating stories takes time, people have usually only done this for important topics. Recently, however, that idea is being challenged. Current Internet technology makes it easier for people to share small bits of information with others in their (social) network. Three things facilitated this change...|$|R
