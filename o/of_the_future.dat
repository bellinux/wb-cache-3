30|$|From <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map frame, <b>the</b> {{criteria}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preferred <b>futures</b> {{suggested by}} Amara [2] are useful when <b>the</b> customers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map use <b>the</b> map. But like the geographic map, <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map approach separates <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map and its use. <b>The</b> <b>Futures</b> Map {{does not make}} any recommendations to its customers. It just shows what kinds of situations of choice they would meet if they would follow any scenario path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map. It takes <b>the</b> preferences <b>of</b> its customers into account just in <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> those scenario paths that it includes to <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map. Surely, <b>the</b> preferences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mapper and <b>the</b> customers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map define these choices. <b>The</b> preferences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> customers are especially important if <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map is on the external validity criteria 2, 4 or 6. If it has no specified customers (criterion 5) or if the target is to describe various possible (criterion 1) or weak signals based scenarios (criterion 3), the values and preferences of any particular user are not so important.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{migration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hang Seng Index futures from open-outcry trading {{to electronic}} trading. Using trade data over {{a window of}} six months we find evidence that, after the migration, <b>the</b> bid-ask spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> contract decreases and <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> price in information transmission increases. Furthermore, the asymmetry in volatility spillover reduces and <b>the</b> open interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market become smaller. These {{results suggest that the}} anonymity in trading and <b>the</b> higher speed <b>of</b> order execution in the electronic trading system attract informed traders to <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market and increase the information flow...|$|R
