5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened {{the collapse of the}} Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation in dealing with the numerous demands by the <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> saw the disappearance of vast amounts of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|In July 1780 Adams {{replaced}} Laurens as {{the ambassador}} to the Dutch Republic, {{then one of the}} few <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> in the world. With the aid of the Dutch Patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states was the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition in 1778. He also negotiated a loan of five million guilders financed by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink. By 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce, the first such treaty between the United States and a foreign power following the 1778 treaty with France. The house that Adams bought during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American-owned embassy on foreign soil.|$|E

25|$|The {{expansion}} of Kosovo's powers caused considerable discontent among Serbs, and Serbian politicians campaigned for a reversion of status changes. It became {{a rallying cry}} {{for a new generation}} of Serbian politicians. During the 1980s the moderate Serbian communist politician Ivan Stambolić, who became President of Serbia, urged the <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> to agree to a reduction in provincial autonomy.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, after <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> {{abandoned}} the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and adopted democratic multiparty systems, Milošević's government quickly followed suit and the 1990 Serbian Constitution was created.

Some successor states had their national currencies before the change, some chose to continue using the pre-1993 Soviet/Russian ruble, and some chose to use both the pre-1993 and the new Russian ruble.

25|$|During {{his tenure}} as cabinet {{minister}} for law he started lok adalat sittings in Madhya Pradesh & thereafter received personal appreciations from Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati for the same. He was widely travelled, having visited Soviet Union, England, Japan, United States of America, Kenya, several <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> of Africa, Italy, Germany, Isle of Man etc. to participate in Commonwealth & other similar events. He remained a name for his region because of his political ideologies and principles not only during the Indian independence movement but even after that {{for more than half}} of a century until 2003.|$|E
25|$|Milošević {{refused to}} agree to the plan, as he claimed that the European Community had no right to {{dissolve}} Yugoslavia and that the plan was not in the interests of Serbs as it would divide the Serb people into four republics (Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and Croatia). Carington responded by putting the issue to a vote in which all the <b>other</b> <b>republics,</b> including Montenegro under Momir Bulatović, initially agreed to the plan that would dissolve Yugoslavia. However, after intense pressure from Serbia on Montenegro's President, Montenegro changed its position to oppose the dissolution of Yugoslavia.|$|E
25|$|The Transcaucasian SFSR was {{dissolved}} in 1936 {{and as a}} result Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union as the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. The transition to communism was difficult for Armenia, and for most of the <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities placed Armenians under strict surveillance. There was almost no freedom of speech, even less so under Joseph Stalin. Any individual who was suspected of using or introducing nationalist rhetoric or elements in their works were labelled traitors or propangandists, and were sent to Siberia during Stalinist rule. Even Zabel Yessayan, a writer who was fortunate enough to escape from ethnic cleansing during the Armenian Genocide, was quickly exiled to Siberia after returning to Armenia from France.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Yugoslav {{president}} Josip Broz Tito in 1980, underlying political, ethnic, religious, and economic tensions within Yugoslavia surfaced. In 1989 Slobodan Milošević, Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia since 1986, became president of Serbia, {{the largest and most}} populous of the six Yugoslav republics. As Milošević moved to consolidate power by centralizing the state, the governments of the <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> sought to loosen the central grip on power by devolving as much constitutional power as possible to each of the republics and autonomous provinces. A series of disagreements among delegates persisted until four of the six republics each made the decision to secede from Yugoslavia. Supported by Germany and the Vatican, Slovenia was among those republics aiming for independence.|$|E
25|$|In January 1990, the Communist Party {{fragmented}} along national lines, {{with the}} Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. At the 14th Extraordinary Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, on 20 January 1990, the delegations {{of the republics}} could not agree on the main issues in the Yugoslav federation. The Croatian and Slovenian delegations demanded a looser federation, while the Serbian delegation, headed by Milošević, opposed this. As a result, the Slovenian and Croatian delegates left the Congress. Having completed the anti-bureaucratic revolution in Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Montenegro, Serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes in 1991, and {{it was able to}} heavily influence decision-making at the federal level, because unfavorable decisions could be blocked; this rendered the governing body ineffective. This situation led to objections from <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> and calls for reform of the Yugoslav Federation.|$|E
25|$|After the war Socialist Yugoslavia {{was formed}} and <b>other</b> <b>republics</b> took primacy in yugoslav ice hockey. SR Slovenia {{was at first}} {{represented}} in yugoslav league only by a team from Ljubljana, later named HK Olimpija, that lost pre-war strength and won its first title only in 1972. Game spread and Ljubljana was soon joined with new teams from Jesenice, Celje, Vevče and Brežice. Specially HK Jesenice became a force in yugoslav ice hockey, they won first league title in 1957 {{and went on to}} win 23 titles until 1991. Slovenian players of Jesenice and Olimpija had main role in yugoslav national team, that never managed any major results at international competitions. The biggest success of Yugoslavia was winning Group B at the 1968 Winter Olympics. Zvone Šuvak (Jesenice) is national team all-time top scorer, while Edo Hafner (Jesenice) earned most caps.|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, from 1966, Taiwan was {{represented}} by the 'Chung Hwa Travel Service', a name chosen to avoid upsetting Beijing. On 20 July 2011, {{as a result of}} warming relations between Taiwan and Beijing, the name was formally changed to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, bringing it into line with <b>other</b> <b>Republic</b> of China representative offices around the world.|$|R
50|$|Some of the “erased” {{were born}} in Slovenia but, {{on the basis of}} the republican {{citizenship}} and birthplace of their parents, had remained SFRY citizens of <b>other</b> Yugoslav <b>republics.</b> <b>Others</b> had moved to Slovenia from other parts of Yugoslavia before the country’s dissolution, and remained there after 1991.|$|R
