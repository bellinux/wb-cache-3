5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} to the chair <b>of</b> <b>mathematics</b> in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies <b>of</b> <b>mathematics</b> and astronomy.|$|E

Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, {{as there is a}} principle that anyone with a basic understanding <b>of</b> <b>mathematics</b> should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E
