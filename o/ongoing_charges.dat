40|$|Today {{there are}} two popular {{positioning}} technologies: GPS and cellular network-based positioning. GPS does not work indoors and in densely built-up areas, whereas GSM-based positioning is usually network provider-dependent and is sold as a for-charge value-added service. To overcome the limitations of both of these technologies we have developed our own GSM-based position estimation method. It works both indoors and outdoors, is network provider-independent, and does not require any <b>ongoing</b> <b>charges.</b> For our method we collect GSM base station signals and correlate these with concurrently collected GPS position readings. The collected data is processed to prepare a database of logical base station locations which is deployed on the mobile device and is used for calculating the user's current location {{based solely on the}} IDs and signal strengths of received base stations. We have devised four position estimation algorithms with varying performance requirements and accuracy. In most cases accuracy is within 100 metres, which is satisfactory for many general applications. Moreover, we have developed several value-added location-based service applications that make use of our positioning system, including a remote position request application, a location trigger application, and a position trail application. 1...|$|E
40|$|Nepal {{faces the}} {{challenge}} of high levels of poverty, difficult access to health facilities and poor, though improving, health indicators. In response, in the past 5 years it has been experimenting {{with a range of}} approaches to removing user fees. Access to health care is now enshrined as a constitutional right for all. This article examines the latest policy, which was introduced in January 2009 : free delivery care across the country. The study objective was to understand the effects of the policy on health facilities. Study methods included structured forms to retrieve financial and activity data from national, district and facility records (comparing 10 months before implementation with 10 months after). These were supplemented by semi-structured interviews with key informants at different levels of the health system. Findings include that utilization of services (at the facilities visited) continues to rise, with caesareans proportionate to the general growth in deliveries. Funds for the free delivery policy (‘Aama’) are found to be adequate to cover the main costs of services, with some surplus which can be invested in staff and in improving services. The system for reimbursing facilities is operating without undue delay and there is satisfaction with the flexibility of use of resources which it allows and the additional incentives for staff. The main concerns relate to wider systemic issues—in particular, understaffing in some key posts and areas, and dwindling general revenues for the facilities, especially through loss of wider user fee revenues. This may explain the <b>ongoing</b> <b>charges</b> for patients, which both facilities and patients report. It will be challenging to build on the gains {{of the past few years}} and sustain them, at the same time as merging the separate free care funding streams...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Customer {{owned and}} managed optical {{networks}} bring new cost-saving benefits. Two types of such networks are becoming widely used: metro dark fiber networks and long-haul leased wavelength networks. Customers may invoke a special QoS mechanism where end-to-end lightpaths are dynamically established across multiple independently managed customer domains. The cost of bandwidth is substantially reduced since it largely becomes a capital cost {{rather than an}} <b>ongoing</b> service <b>charge.</b> Customers can optimize the overall resource consumption by utilizing resources from different suppliers. Remote peering and transit reduce the Internet connectivity cost. The bandwidth and quality of service are guaranteed because the customers directly peer with each other using transport networks. The technical challenges include distributed resource management, collaboration among independent customers without co-ordination through centralized management and dynamic partitioning of a provider’s resource to customers. An architecture for a customer-managed end-to-end lightpath provisioning system is presented. The distributed network resource management in a multi-domain environment is realized as service directories. Jini and JavaSpaces are used to develop the management system for customers to establish end-to-end lightpaths. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{an ongoing}} debate on whether {{consumers}} of child pornography pose a risk for hands-on sex offenses. Up until now, there have been very few studies which have analyzed the association between the consumption of child pornography and the subsequent perpetration of hands-on sex offenses. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the recidivism rates for hands-on and hands-off sex offenses in a sample of child pornography users using a 6 year follow-up design. Methods The current study population consisted of 231 men, who were subsequently charged with consumption of illegal pornographic material after being detected by a special operation against Internet child pornography, conducted by the Swiss police in 2002. Criminal history, as well as recidivism, was assessed using the criminal records from 2008. Results 4. 8 % (n = 11) of the study sample had a prior conviction for a sexual and/or violent offense, 1 % (n = 2) for a hands-on sex offense, involving child sexual abuse, 3. 3 % (n = 8) for a hands-off sex offense and one for a nonsexual violent offense. When applying a broad definition of recidivism, which included <b>ongoing</b> investigations, <b>charges</b> and convictions, 3 % (n = 7) of the study sample recidivated with a violent and/or sex offense, 3. 9 % (n = 9) with a hands-off sex offense and 0. 8 % (n = 2) with a hands-on sex offense. Conclusion Consuming child pornography alone is not a risk factor for committing hands-on sex offenses – at least not for those subjects who had never committed a hands-on sex offense. The majority of the investigated consumers had no previous convictions for hands-on sex offenses. For those offenders, the prognosis for hands-on sex offenses, as well as for recidivism with child pornography, is favorable. </p...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{interactions}} between the F 2 region ionospheric plasma and the 160 V photovoltaic (PV) electrical power system on the International Space Station (ISS) can produce floating potentials (FP) on the ISS conducting structure of greater magnitude than are usually observed on spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. Flight through the geomagnetic field also causes magnetic induction charging of ISS conducting structure. Charging processes resulting from interaction of ISS with auroral electrons may also contribute to charging albeit rarely. The magnitude and frequency of occurrence of possibly hazardous charging events depends on the ISS assembly stage (six more 160 V PV arrays {{will be added to}} ISS), ISS flight configuration, ISS position (latitude and longitude), and the natural variability in the ionospheric flight environment. At present, ISS is equipped with two plasma contactors designed to control ISS FP to within 40 volts of the ambient F 2 plasma. The negative-polarity grounding scheme utilized in the ISS 160 V power system leads, naturally, to negative values of ISS FP. A negative ISS structural FP leads to application of electrostatic fields across the dielectrics that separate conducting structure from the ambient F 2 plasma, thereby enabling dielectric breakdown and arcing. Degradation of some thermal control coatings and noise in electrical systems can result. Continued review and evaluation of the putative charging hazards, as required by the ISS Program Office, revealed that ISS charging could produce a risk of electric shock to the ISS crew during extra vehicular activity. ISS charging risks are being evaluated in <b>ongoing</b> ISS <b>charging</b> measurements and analysis campaigns. The results of ISS charging measurements are combined with a recently developed detailed model of the ISS charging process and an extensive analysis of historical ionospheric variability data, to assess ISS charging risks using Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methods.

The Libraries Division started the Tales project in the Fall of 1999, when one pilot academic department committed to requiring digital theses and to incorporate them into the repository. Documents received on a floppy disk or a CD in one of the allowed formats (MS-Word, HTML and LaTeX) were converted into HTML, which was used for displaying contents. Documents were parsed and stored according to the ETD-ML definition. his allowed us to reconstruct the thesis on demand to support various navigation and searching mechanisms. Today, Tales implements an institutional policy which requires that all university departments participate in some way {{in the construction of the}} repository.
