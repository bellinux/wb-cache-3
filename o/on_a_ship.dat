5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's never been <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The {{dialogue}} they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.|$|E
5|$|Flagella are {{semi-rigid}} cylindrical {{structures that}} are rotated and function {{much like the}} propeller <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship.</b> Objects as small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the flat, paddle-like, forms appropriate at human-size scale.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Delagoa Bay <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> with J.A. Smellekamp as supercarga – {{he later}} became a {{well-known}} figure in South Africa – and his two travel companions and fellow migrants, Hendrik van der Linden and W.P.J. Poen, he travelled across the Lebombo Mountains in an ox-cart into the Transvaal. In March 1852 Spruyt was appointed schoolteacher {{in the town of}} Rustenburg. Because of disputes among the Dutchmen in the Transvaal, more specifically between Rev. Dirk van der Hoff and J.A. Smellekamp, who had now also settled there, Spruyt moved to the Orange Free State, where he established himself in Bloemfontein.|$|E

5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was moving along the coastline {{of the southeastern}} United States, a new hurricane was observed in the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Bristol was a {{starting}} place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, {{became the first}} European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At {{the height of the}} Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa to slavery in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E
5|$|By 1827, Protestant Christianity, and in {{particular}} Bingham's teachings, had become the de facto state religion of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Queen Kaʻahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832, by, for example, forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize. In December1831, Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to leave <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship,</b> the Waverly, bound for North America. Though Queen Kaʻahumanu steadfastly opposed his work, Bachelot viewed her as a good person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries.|$|E

5|$|Documentation {{indicated}} that the missing uranium {{had been sent to}} Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Boris Pash's command reached Toulouse on October 1 and inspected a French Army arsenal with a Geiger counter. When the needle jumped near some barrels, they were inspected and found to be the 31 tons of uranium from Belgium. The 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company was released from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseilles, where Furman supervised their loading <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> bound for the United States.|$|E
5|$|He {{would have}} tried to reconquer the {{province}} if he had the resources, but now he had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously, and accepted the fact, that the defeat was God's decision and a result of the sins {{of the people of the}} land, including him.

5|$|In 1947, an {{explosion}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> at the Port of Texas City caused fires and destruction throughout the city's industrial complex and other ships creating one of nation's worst industrial accidents.

Though the city's growth and prosperity were interrupted, {{the city and the}} business leaders were able to rebuild.|$|E

2500|$|Railroad {{historian}} David L. Joslyn (a retired Southern Pacific Railroad draftsman) has {{traced the}} possible root of [...] "caboose" [...] to the obsolete Low German word Kabhuse, a small cabin erected <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sailing <b>ship's</b> main deck. [...] This was absorbed into Middle Dutch {{and entered the}} Dutch language circa 1747 as kabhuis, the compartment <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship's</b> main deck in which meals were prepared.|$|R
5|$|In late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to {{help restore}} his health. He was {{accompanied}} by James Pemberton, his only slave at that time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century unknown to {{everyone}} including his family, socialist patriot Manwel Dimech was imprisoned by the British at the Castellania until a well planned forced {{exit from the}} country on 5 September 1914, which took him in exile and never to come to Malta again. A plaque in the whereabouts of the Victoria Gate, where Dimech had to pass before boarding <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship,</b> commemorates the episode. The imprisonment of Dimech at the Castellania, and his exile abroad, is considered as a landmark injustice during the British period.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> to the United States. By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.|$|E

Though they try to tell of the evidence they have found, they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{burial of}} entire or cremated bodies at sea has been practised by {{countries}} around the world since ancient times, with instances recorded from the ancient civilisations in Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Practices vary by country and by religion; for example, the United States allows human remains to be buried at sea at least 3 nautical miles from land, and if the remains are uncremated the water must be at least 600 feet deep, while in Islam burial by lowering a weighted clay vessel into the sea is permitted when a person dies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{argument}} {{is based in}} part on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of United States v. Bevans. In Bevans, the parties argued over whether a federal court in Massachusetts had jurisdiction over the case of a U.S. Marine charged with a murder that occurred <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> in Boston Harbor. No issues regarding federal income taxation or the Internal Revenue Code were presented to or decided by the Court in the Bevans case. The Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service did not yet exist in 1818, when the Bevans murder case was decided.|$|E
25|$|Biofouling occurs {{everywhere}} but is {{most significant}} economically to the shipping industries, since fouling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>ship's</b> hull significantly increases drag, reducing the overall hydrodynamic {{performance of the}} vessel, and increases the fuel consumption.|$|R
