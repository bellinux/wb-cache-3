Hunter's visits abroad produced a large number of paintings and his style changed noticeably in this period of European travel as he began using dabs of colour placed instinctively to portray underlying form.|$|E
40|$|TRIP 6 (thyroid {{receptor}}-interacting protein 6), {{also known}} as ZRP- 1 (zyxin-related protein 1), {{is a member of}} the zyxin family that has been implicated in cell motility. Previously we have shown that TRIP 6 binds to the LPA 2 receptor and associates with several components of focal complexes in an agonist-dependent manner and, thus, enhances lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) -induced cell migration. Here we further report that the function <b>of</b> <b>TRIP</b> 6 in LPA signaling is regulated by c-Src-mediated phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>TRIP</b> 6 at the Tyr- 55 residue. LPA stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation <b>of</b> endogenous <b>TRIP</b> 6 in NIH 3 T 3 cells and c-Src-expressing fibroblasts, which is virtually eliminated in Src-null fibroblasts. Strikingly, both phosphotyrosine- 55 and proline- 58 residues <b>of</b> <b>TRIP</b> 6 are required for Crk binding in vitro and in cells. Mutation of Tyr- 55 to Phe does not alter the ability <b>of</b> <b>TRIP</b> 6 to localize at focal adhesions or associate with actin. However, it abolishes the association <b>of</b> <b>TRIP</b> 6 with Crk and p 130 cas in cells and significantly reduces the function <b>of</b> <b>TRIP</b> 6 to promote LPA-induced ERK activation. Ultimately, these signaling events control TRIP 6 function in promoting LPA-induced morphological changes and cell migration...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{the value}} of {{reliability}} in the scheduling of an activity of random duration, such as travel under congested conditions. Using a simple formulation of scheduling utility, we show that the maximal expected utility is linear in the {{mean and standard deviation}} <b>of</b> <b>trip</b> duration, regardless <b>of</b> the form of the standardised distribution <b>of</b> <b>trip</b> durations. This insight provides a unification of the scheduling model and models that include the standard deviation <b>of</b> <b>trip</b> duration directly as an argument in the cost or utility function. The results generalise approximately to the case where the mean and standard deviation <b>of</b> <b>trip</b> duration depend on the starting time. An empirical illustration is provided. ...|$|R

5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% <b>of</b> <b>trips</b> should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E

5|$|Sonically, Impossible Princess is a {{departure}} from Minogue's previous music, having taken influence by the techno and Britpop revolution in the mid-to-late 1990s. Conceived as an experimental record, the material encompasses a variety of darker styles from the dance genre, including trip hop, electronica, rock, drum and bass and house. Additionally, selected recordings experiments with cultural elements like Middle Eastern music and Celtic origins. Lyrically, the album's central focus is about Minogue's self-discovery, which she found during a series <b>of</b> <b>trips</b> in Asia, America and Australasia, and further delves into the freedom of expression, relationships and emotions.|$|E
5|$|After the war, H.D. and Bryher {{no longer}} lived together, but {{remained}} in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, {{in the spring}} of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, which resulted in her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number <b>of</b> <b>trips</b> to the States, H.D. spent {{the rest of her life}} in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt. At Heydt's prompting, she wrote End to Torment, a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of Hilda's Book to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the American Academy of Arts and Letters medal.|$|E
5|$|Julius Delius {{assumed that}} his son would {{play a part in}} the family wool business, and {{for the next three years}} he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's {{representative}} in Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to Chemnitz, he neglected his duties in favour <b>of</b> <b>trips</b> to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with Hans Sitt. His father sent him to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists Henrik Ibsen and Gunnar Heiberg. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the French Riviera. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect {{that his son}} would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead sent him to America to manage an orange plantation.|$|E

5|$|Katsuragi {{survived the}} war without {{sustaining}} any further damage, and was {{designated as a}} Special Transfer Ship on 2 October and then assigned to repatriation duty on 13 October after the necessary repairs were made. Her crew at this time consisted only of 12 officers, one warrant officer, and 40 petty officers and crewmen, with Captain Miyazaki still in command. The damage from the July attack was only repaired enough to allow the hangar deck to house some 5,000 returning soldiers and civilians and the ship began her first voyage outside Japanese waters on 19 December. On this first voyage, she called upon Minamidaitojima, Rabaul and Australia. Upon her return, further repairs were necessary to make her rain-tight. These were completed by 15 January 1946 and she made a number <b>of</b> <b>trips</b> in early 1946 to bring back Japanese nationals. before being placed on standby in April. Katsuragi was stricken from the Navy List on 15 November and transferred to the Home Ministry for disposal five days later. Scrapping of the ship began on 22 December 1946 at the Hitachi Zosen facility in Osaka-Sakurajima and was completed on 30 November 1947.|$|E
5|$|Limited sources {{indicate}} for {{the early}} Middle Ages indicate {{that there was some}} trade of luxury goods with continental Europe. For most of the period there are not the detailed custom accounts that exist for England, that can provide an understanding of foreign trade, with the first records for Scotland dating to the 1320s. In the early Middle Ages, the rise of Christianity meant that wine and precious metals were imported for use in religious rites, and there are occasional references <b>of</b> <b>trips</b> to and from foreign countries, such as the incident recorded by Adomnán in which St Columba went to a port to await ships bearing news, and presumably other items, from Italy. Imported goods found in archaeological sites of the period include ceramics and glass, while many sites indicate iron and precious metal working.|$|E
5|$|Louisiana {{primarily}} operated {{along the}} east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean during her career. In 190809, she took part in the world cruise of the Great White Fleet. A pair <b>of</b> <b>trips</b> to European waters took place in 1910 and 1911. From 1913, she began to become involved in the Mexican Revolution, as the US Navy began to send ships to protect American interests in the country. This activity culminated in the US occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. During World War I, Louisiana was employed as a training ship before serving as a convoy escort in late 1918. After the war ended that year, she was used to ferry American soldiers back from France. With this work completed, she was decommissioned in October 1920 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1923.|$|E
