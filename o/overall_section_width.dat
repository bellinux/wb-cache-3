40|$|Abstract: Tire {{deflection}} {{is a key}} parameter {{and many}} equations have been developed based on it to evaluate the tractive performance of bias-ply and radial-ply tires. As deflections for a given tire size, inflation pressure and vertical load are significantly different between bias-ply and radial-ply tires, {{this study was conducted}} to predict deflection () of radial-ply tire based on <b>section</b> <b>width</b> (b), <b>overall</b> unloaded diameter (d), inflation pressure (P) and vertical load (W). For this purpose, deflection of four radial-ply tires with different <b>section</b> <b>width</b> and/or <b>overall</b> unloaded diameter were measured at five levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load. Results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tires No. 1, 2 and 3 were utilized to determine multiple variables regression model and results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tire No. 4 were used to verify selected model. The paired samples t-test results showed that the difference between the deflection values predicted by model and measured by test apparatus were not statistically significant and to predict deflection of radial-ply tire based on <b>section</b> <b>width,</b> <b>overall</b> unloaded diameter, inflation pressure and vertical 2 load the multiple variables regression model = 75. 67 + 0. 104 b- 0. 107 d- 0. 758 P + 3. 519 W with R = 0. 986 can be strongly recommended.

40|$|The {{results of}} a virtual reality {{experimental}} survey, aimed at evaluating how cross-section width affects driver’s behaviour, are reported. Two two-lane rural roads were implemented in an interactive driving simulator. Each one is characterised by a different cross <b>section</b> <b>width</b> but same alignment. The configurations of the surveyed cross sections were those recommended by the Italian technical regulation for rural roads (type C 1) and for local roads (type F 2). The alignment was designed with tangents, clothoids and curves. 64 drivings were performed. Four parameters were determined on each geometrical element of the alignment with different cross section width: average speed, range of speed, average trajectory and range of lateral position on cross section. The narrowing of the cross <b>section</b> <b>width</b> causes the decrease of speed but does not alter the way the driver adjusts his speed driving from a design elements to another along the alignment. The adjustment of the speed is therefore affected exclusively by the geometry of the axis of the alignment. The values of speed obtained indicate that the assumption of the same maximum design speed (Vdmax) {{for the design of}} alignments with different cross <b>section</b> <b>width</b> determines a degree of safety, with respect to the stopping manoeuvre, that is inferior in alignments with a wider section. With respect to the values collected on cross section C 1, on the cross section F 2 a greater dispersion of speed and a greater number of cases of occupation of the shoulder and of the opposite lane (an event which was never recorded in section C 1), were recorded. The importance of the shoulder in the driver’s choice of lateral position and his propensity to drive near the axis of the space he perceives as utilizable, consisting of the lane and shoulder, was confirmed...|$|R

The lower hefffound in magnetron films with a lower surface/bulk coercivity ratio is also consistent with spike domain theory.

40|$|High value {{crops such as}} peas for {{the frozen}} {{vegetable}} market have to be harvested at the optimum point for quality, regardless of field conditions. Six wheeled pea harvesters with a gross weight of 27 t, giving a wheel load of 4. 5 t are required to move from field to field with optimum timeliness. In order to achieve road speeds of 25 km/h an inflation pressure of 2. 2 bar {{is required for the}} specific tyre load speed rating. Typically, in field conditions, this inflation pressure is not reduced and therefore the likelihood of soil damage is increased. This study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} tyre <b>section</b> <b>width</b> and inflation pressure on rolling resistance, rut depth and sub-surface soil deformation. Under controlled laboratory conditions three tyres, at three inflation pressures, with a load of 4. 5 t were passed over a soil at three different initial bulk densities. Measurements of dry bulk density, rut depth, rolling resistance, cone penetrometer resistance and soil deformation through the profile were taken before and after the passage of the tyres. The results show that by increasing the tyre size and reducing the inflation pressure the depth at which compaction occurs and rut depth decrease by 44 %. The 800 mm section tyre causes less compaction than any of the other tyres tested especially when inflated to 1. 6 bar. Rolling resistance is reduced when the tyre is inflated to the optimum for each tyre. The change in bulk density when plotted against either initial bulk density or penetration resistance results in a set of curves which can be used by the manufacturer, farmer or operator to select the correct tyre <b>section</b> <b>width</b> and inflation pressure for field conditions. As a result of this study the harvester manufacturers are investigating the engineering requirements of increasing tyre <b>section</b> <b>width</b> to 800 mm and are now equipping pea harvesters with central tyre inflation systems.
