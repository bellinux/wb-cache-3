However, the temporary partnership and low trustiness between collaborating organisations put challenges to effectively manage collaborative business processes, and correspondingly an organisation centered design method and a visibility mechanism are discussed in this chapter to provide a finer granularity of authority control at contacting and collaborations design phases. Furthermore, the authors hope that understanding the establishment of a virtual organisation alliance through the use of relative workflows will not only inform researchers a better business process design methodology, but also assist in the understanding of the dynamic behaviors inside a virtual organsiation alliance and the supporting approaches...|$|R
40|$|During the Eighteenth Century – from Bonnet to Robinet, from Maupertuis to Diderot, {{and up to}} Buffon – {{several new}} topics of {{discussion}} were developed concerning materialism, the critique to finalism, the idea of nature as continuous metamorphosis (as apposed to the static, fixist and discontinuist theories of nature), the advocacy of providentialism, or, to the contrary, {{of the role of}} chaos. As a result, scales, prototypes and types have been employed as interpretative hypotheses influencing the main choices and lines of research. In this regard, however, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's work deeply modified the morphological metaphors.

The co-operation {{can be seen as a}} virtual organisation and this research project investigates how virtual organisations operate and how partners establish and maintain such an organisation. For this reason the R&D virtual organisation ISES, formed by the utility related joint venture EnerSearch AB, is taken as a case study.

Since learning can be viewed as a major objective of a virtual organisation, the five boundaries ar e discussed in more detail and are related to empirical results in the project ISES.

However, little attention {{has so far been}} given for supplier assessment in foreign-aid funded procurement in the context of developing countries. Using a sample of Executing Agencies (EAs), Donor Agency Executives (DAE) and Supplying Organisation Executives (SOE) this study identified the supplier assessment criteria and their relative importance in foreign-aid funded procurement in Bangladesh. It also assessed the extent of match between buyers&# 039; requirements and suppliers&# 039; performance. Design/approach/methodology - An instrument with 32 seven-point (1 - rarely, 7 mostly) Likert scaled items was employed to gather data on the level of importance assigned by both buyers and suppliers on each item. In this study EAs and DAEs represent buyers, whereas SOEs represent suppliers. The importance-performance matrix (IPM) analysis was conducted to assess the gap between what is required by the buyers and what is provided by the suppliers, and to categorise the assessment items into four categories such as &# 039;low priority&# 039;, &# 039;possible killer&# 039;, &# 039;concentrate here&# 039;, and &# 039;keep up the good work&# 039;. Findings - The results indicate that to provide better service suppliers must assign tasks to the knowledgeable sales personnel, provide better warranties with well-known branded products, and at a reliable quality level. The supplier <b>organistions</b> should organize a high caliber management system so that they are capable of providing services without constant follow-up by the buyers and response to buyers&# 039; enquiries promptly. Originality/value - The results of the study could be adopted to design supplier assessment procedure in other developing countries...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 İnsanoğlu, tarihten beri çeşitli sebeplerle yaşadıkları yeri, şehri ya da ülkeyi değiştirmiştir. Bu hareketliliğin bir parçası olan zorunlu olarak göç etmek olgusu, özellikle son yıllarda artan mülteci sayısı ile beraber psikoloji, sosyoloji, antropoploji gibi çeşitli disiplinlerde artışma konusu olmuştur. Ancak dikkate alınması gereken diğer bir önemli nokta ise zorunlu göç sorununa şehir planlama ve mimari açıdan bakmak olmalıdır. Bugüne kadar konuyla ilgili çalışmaların az sayıda oluşu ve geliştirilmesi gerektiği nedeniyle bu çalışmanın vurguladığı konular son derece önemlidir. Ülkesinde çıkan savaş ya da çatışma nedeniyle yaşadığı yeri terk edip başka bir ülkeye göç eden mülteci grubu, göç eden birey grupları arasında en çok irdelenmesi gereken gruptur. Bugün UNHRC’nin raporlarına göre dünyada 50 milyondan fazla insan güvenlik ve insan haklarının ihlali gibi sebeplerle vatanlarından ayrı yaşamaktadır.   Mültecilerin yeniden yerleştirilmelerinde (resettlement) dikkat edilmesi gereken sosyal, psikolojik, ekonomik ve fiziksel çevre ile ilgili faktörler, iyi bir yeniden yerleştirme projesinin olmazsa olmaz adımlarıdır. Yersiz kalan bireyleri geçici bir süre için barındırma yardımını yapan ülkeler, öncelikle bu faktörleri göz önünde bulundurarak stratejik planlamalarını yapmalı, kamp ya da diğer barınma sistemlerini geliştirmelidir. Bu bağlamda kullanıcı profilinin demografik özellikleri, kültürel bağları, alışkanlıkları ve sosyal yapıları tasarım girdilerine dahil olmalıdır. Dahası, misafirlik sürecinin hem mülteciler hem de ev sahibi ülke için faydalı sonuçlar doğurması öngörülmelidir. Zorunlu olarak göç eden bireylerin yaşadıkları ruhsal sorunlar düşünülerek, bu bireylerin yeniden sağlıklarını kazanmalarında ve üretken bireyler haline gelmelerinde kuşkusuz ki yaratılacak olan fiziksel çevre elemanları etkili olacaktır.   Bu çalışmada öncelikle zorunlu göç olgusunun ne olduğu, hangi koşullarda meydana geldiği irdelenmiştir. Sebepleriyle ilintili doğurduğu ekonomik, psikolojik ve barınma ile ilgili doğurduğu sonuçlardan bahsedilmiştir. Ayrıca, mültecilerin karşılaştığı en önemli sorunlardan biri olan adaptasyon boyutu araştırılmıştır. Bununla birlikte uluslar arası yardım kuruluşlarının yeniden yerleştirme konusunda nasıl çalışmalar yaptığı, barınma ve sosyal donatılar bağlamında nasıl çevreler oluşturduğu aktarılmıştır. Tüm bu kavramsal çerçeve doğrultusunda, seçilen örneklem kitle olan İzmir’de yaşayan Suriyeli mülteciler için tasarlanması öngörülen yerleşke ile ilgili mimarlara ve şehir plancılarına örnek teşkil edebilecek öneriler geliştirilmiştir. Human {{beings have}} change their living places, cities or {{countries}} due to various reasons through the history.  Forced immigration as {{the part of}} this mobility, has been a multidisciplinary argument like psychology, sociology and antropology {{with the increase in}} refugee number. However, another important to consider is to see the matter in urban planning and architecture view. There are not so many studies on this issue and it should be improved, so that the things this thesis emphesizes are exceedingly important. Refuee groups that leave their country and immigrate because of the war or conflict in their country should be mostly explicated in whole migration groups. Today, according to UNHRC (United Nations of Human Rights Council) reports, more than 50 million people live away their home country due to reasons like security or human rights violation.   In {{the second part of the}} thesis, notions of forced emigration, refugees and asylum seekers are explicated. The reasons of forced emigration are inconvenient climate conditions, natural events, economical reasons, terrorism and war. Forced emigration due to terrorism and war is a fact that should be explicated because of its desperate results. Its effects are closely related to economic, physicological and physical environment. In fact, all these effects are directly related to each other and they also have both negative and positive impacts on each other. The mental diseases and loss of dignity and economy that are experienced after the war generates some kinds of damages on the refugees. The planning and desinging the living areas are of great importance in reducing the amount of damage they get. In this points the problems of adaptation and place attachment come to order. As these people are expected to return back to their countries, the studies should be handled according to this expectation. The dissolving of the physicological dieseaes that these individuals are exposed to and turning these people into productive individuals will only be possible with the maximum level of palce attachment. Place attachment is a largely explicated subject in literature. The most important factors thats influence palce attachment in terms of refugees are; demographic factors, enviromental expreiences, ecocnomic adaptation, culture and culturalisation, satisfaction of physical environment and the relation of place and activity. These datas should be seriously considered and implicated into the projects of replacement for the refugees. For example, it will be a reason to emphasize the education centers in the campus if the number of children going to school is high in the household of the refugees. Or if the group is conservative, it becomes quite important in designing and the configuration of the dwelling units and the decision of the social installations. In the third part of the thesis, the studies and the examples about the accomodation of the refugees as emphasized. International charity organizations have always worked much about accamodating of the refugees and asylum seekers temporarily in a country. UNHRC is one of the most important <b>organistions</b> of all; It has a big role in solving the problem of accomodation during the settlement of 400. 000 Somalian in Kenya and 144. 000 Syrian people in Jordan. Every year various reports have been published about forced emigration and these reports reveals the evryday experiences of the people in the camps. NRC (Norwegian Refugee Council) and Sphere Project,   are some other charities which work in ccoperation with UNHRC.  The reports which are published by these agents contains the standarts in terms of desinging of the camp areas. In Sphere Project, there are five standarts mentioned so as to help the architects and the urban planners. These are explained as strategic planning, settlement planning, closed living area and enviromental factors. In the publications of NRC, there are examples of planning and designing in paralel with the standarts mentioned in Sphere Project. However, there are also some kinds of suggestions that supports the adaptation and place attachment issues as it is consistent with point of view in the thesis, for instance the approach of planning according to the demographic features or the settlement of the families in the garden of the camping areas so as to increase rehabilitation. The smallest units in the campus of the refugees are the living areas called houses or shelters. Through out the history, there has been various types of shelters. The common point of these types are the using of local materials and local actors, being economical and easy and fast to be done. The construction process has sometimes had a professional planning, yet it sometimes has been arbitarily constructed due to the emergency situations and the only aim was protection from bad weather conditions. The architects taking part in the helping projects have a great role in designing and construction of these useful shelters. For example, the Japanese architect Shigaru Ban, has designed the emergency dwelling unit which he named as ‘Paper Log House’. This unit can meet the demands in many of the camps especially in Kobe refugee camp. In this thesis, there are some examples from the refugee camps. The models have been chosen from the camp settlements which have been reasearcehed in terms of architecture. Nahr-El Bared camp which is located in Lebanon, is an invincible Project as it is designed professionally, considering the features of the people that are to live in this camp and its social installations in the project. The camp Dadaab in Kenya and Kakuma camp located on the border line between Kenya and Sudan have more difficult living and accomodation conditions. In the fourth part of the study, solutions have been made for accomodation problem with some kinds of analysis for the example mass of Syrian refugees in İzmir. Supporting the literarture study, first of all, Syrian culuture and living style has been researched and profile of the group has been learnt. The profile of the household and their daily life experiences have been explicated. The study has been done with a questionnaire in participation with 100 Syrian refugee living in Ballıkuyu, Kadifekale, Agora and Basmane vicinity which are belonging to Konak country in İzmir. The questions in the questionnaire have been prepared to find out how similar is the physical environment in İzmir is to the environment in Syria, what the physical problems (heating, warming, humidity, immensity of the places) are there in their dwellings in izmir and whether they would like to go or not if the government offers them a camp area. When the questionnaire seemed inefficient, face to face conversations, observations and drawing methods have also been used. As a result of the analysis, It’s been fond out that the refugees can not sustain their living style in İzmir, there is a problem of unemployment and poverty and they try to live in physically inconvenient dwellings. So it’s suggested that the government should deal with this urgently. Some kinds of settlement and conceptual suggestions have been made if it is planned to build a camp area. In the upper scale context, refugee problem should be considered as the combination of economic productivity, psychological healing, optimum place attachment and the role of the psyhical environment parameters. In terms of settlement; regarding the demographic datas, territory selection, configuration of the housing units, assessing the utility units and the entegration of the restorative environment elements should be respected.  It is recommended that the dwelling unit typologies should be similar to the Syrian culture as they should obtain the usage of the roof or the terrace parts.   The dwellings of these types can be constructed with prefabricated materials as mostly seen in present camps. It is suggested that the Syrians living in İzmir should pass from consumption society to manufacturing society. In this point, with ‘permaculture’ which is really popular in recent years, it will be possible for the individuals to produce a particular amount of their daily food on the fertile soil thay they will be given to, thus it will help these people get mental rehabilitation. Also problems of unemployment and economic inefficiency will be removed with the installation of a textile factory in the settlement area. The reason why Textile is suggested as the employment area is that most of the refugees participating in the questionnaire have come from Halab(Aleppo) and they used to work there as taılor, textile workers or clothes press workers. In this thesis, primarily the meaning of forced migration phenomenon and how it is occured is explicated. The economic, psychological and accomodation related results relevant to the several reasons are mentioned. Additionally, adaptation extention as one of the major difficulties that refugees face with is researched. Beside, how studies international charity agencies assume and how living and social environments they create is discussed. In accordance with all these conceptual frame, Syrian refugees living in İzmir is picked as a sample study group and resettlement proposals are enhanced with the point of view to be useful for the urban planners and architects.

It appreciates both notions as closely intertwined and hence, act asconceptual and analytical tools for explaining and understanding, particularly the nature of businessgroup organisation, in the 1990 s or after. To date, although acknowledging the presence of networks,some analysts hardly focuses, conceptually and empirically, on corporate elite organisation based onsocial networks and social capital, particularly their structure and characteristics. Instead, they tend toexplain and analyse effects of the networks and also view them in the form of interpersonal dyadicties. This also implies that the nature of economic action, especially the organisation of businessgroups, appears to be carried out in a relatively atomised manner independent of social capital orsocial networks. Thus, the action is not fully understood. Based on some empirical findings mainlyfrom a sociological study conducted by the author on interlocking directorships and social networksof some multi-ethnic Malaysian corporate elite members of the 1990 s, a conceptual framework isdeveloped.

In particular we outline how we have been investigating the use of data mining techniques on datasets from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive[NIHE]. NIHE are responsible for the management of the public sector housing stock within Northern Ireland. They are the largest such body within the European Union, and are acknowledged as leaders within their field in the use of information technology. Within NIHE there are numerous databases in use. These fall into two main categories. There are the day to day, operational databases such as the Prawl rent accounting system and the Repairs maintainance management system. Such databases are used both for transaction processing and management information purposes. The other main category of database in use are the various datasets used by the Research Department. These are used for analysis that feeds into the formulation of policy. An example of such a dataset is the five-yearly House Condition Survey. This is generated by a detailed survey, (approx. 4000 attributes), of a sample of around 10000 properties across Northern Ireland. With such a large and growing amount of data within their <b>organistion,</b> NIHE are interested in techniques that will help them make better use of it. To this end, they have agreed to collaborate with the DMRG in testing the use of data mining techniques on their data.

40|$|Die Internationale Rechnungslegung befindet sich seit Gründung des International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) im Jahr 1973 im stetigen Wandel. Nicht nur die Organisation selbst, sondern auch die von ihr geschaffenen Standards der Internationalen Rechnungslegung, die IFRS, verändern sich im Zeitablauf. Das wirft zum einen die Frage nach den Ursachen für diese Änderungen auf. Zum anderen sind die Mechanismen zu thematisieren, die den Wandel der Internationalen Rechnungslegung bewirken. Letztere sind in der klassischen Rechnungslegungsforschung bisher kaum beachtet worden. Die vorliegende Arbeit greift diese Forschungslücke auf und beantwortet die Frage nach dem im Wandel der Internationalen Rechnungslegung wirksamen Mechanismen anhand der Systemtheorie nach Niklas Luhmann. Dazu wird die Historie des IASC bis zur heutigen IFRS Foundation nachgezeichnet und die Rolle der <b>Organistion</b> im Wandel der Internationalen Rechnungslegung dargestellt. Mechanismen, die eine Veränderung der sozialen Realität bewirken, stehen dabei im Vordergrund. Die vorliegende Arbeit trägt somit sowohl zur Fortentwicklung der Erkenntnisse über den Wandel der Internationalen Rechnungslegung als auch der Systemtheorie bei. Since the {{foundation}} of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) in 1973, international financial reporting is subject to continuous change. Not only the organization itself, but also its published standards on international financial reporting, the IFRS, have been changing over time.

Relations {{between the two countries}} were strained from the very start with a dispute over the princely states, particularly Kashmir. Fighting started within a few months of independence and the dispute was referred to the United Nations. Pakistan was a country divided by over a thousand miles into East and West wings, forming the largest Muslim state in the world, both in terms of population and size. It was this position which first attracted the attention of the United States. The Cold War had descended on Europe with a vengeance and threatened to break into a 'hot war' over Korea in 1950. The fall of China to the communists had led the American strategic planners to pin their hopes on India to show a non-communist example to the world. The Pakistan government indicated some willingness to help the west if it was given a security guarantee against India.

The team of Eisenhower and Dulles were 'Cold War Warriors' to the core, and so a closer understanding was inevitable. Military aid to Pakistan was initiated in 1954 after the Pakistan government had signed a pact with Turkey and a Mutual Assistance agreement with the United States. The role that Pakistan could play in any 'mutual assistance' was to provide the men to fight in any conflict in her region. After some reluctance Pakistan also adhered to two further pacts, the South East Asia Treaty <b>Organistion</b> and the Baghdad Pact. How and why Pakistan joined these pacts will be looked at, with the hectic and complicted diplomatic shuttles between London, Washington and Karachi using British and American archives. The effect this had on Pakistan's foreign policy will be examined, with Suez as the case study...|$|R
