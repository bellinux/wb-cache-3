By 1960, the Bloomingdale neighborhood had the highest juvenile delinquency rate in Manhattan and the second highest number of welfare cases per 1,000 residents.

40|$|Abstract — <b>The</b> photoaligning {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popular photoaligning material polyvinyl- 4 (fluoro-cinnamate) (PVCN-F) are presented. The aligning {{quality and}} azimuthal and zenithal anchoring energy were measured and <b>the</b> drift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> orientation axis (gliding effect) on the PVCN-F surface, depending on UV exposure, was studied. Special {{attention is paid}} to unraveling <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adsorption liquid-crystal molecules onto the aligning surface to <b>the</b> anchoring properties <b>of</b> PVCN-F and measuring <b>the</b> drift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> orientation axis over the PVCN-F surface. It is shown that a relatively weak azimuthal anchoring energy (Waz ≈ 10 – 7 – 10 – 5 J/m 2) leads to strong drift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easy</b> axis in <b>the</b> azimuthal plane that was observed in a moderate (~ 0. 1 – 0. 3 T) magnetic field.

25|$|A {{recent report}} by the Australian CSIRO found that {{forestry}} and forest-related options are the most significant and most easily achieved carbon sink making up 105 Mt per year CO2-e or about 75 per cent of the total figure attainable for the Australian state of Queensland from 2010-2050. Among the forestry options, the CSIRO report announced, forestry with the primary aim of carbon storage (called carbon forestry) clearly has the highest attainable carbon storage capacity (77 Mt CO2-e/yr) and is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> options to implement compared with biodiversity plantings, pre-1990 eucalypts, post 1990 plantations and managed regrowth. Legal strategies to encourage this form of biosequestration include permanent protection of forests in National Parks or on the World Heritage List, properly funded management and bans on use of rainforest timbers and inefficient uses such as woodchipping old growth forest.|$|E

25|$|The {{developers}} came to {{the conclusion}} that complex battles would only serve to confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a way to survive. He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this made no sense, commenting that it was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes. This made it easier on the writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure that everyone was able to see the game to the very end.|$|E

In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Robert Florence {{praised the}} app for calculating {{variables}} like movement range and tracking statistics like health and ability cooldowns, but {{spoke of a}} disconnect caused by constantly shifting focus between the screen and the board. While ultimately questioning {{the need for the}} physical components at all, Florence also saw the game as having potential in the future. Chris Hutton of Tom's Guide took a much more negative view. Hutton found it cumbersome that the starter kit came with only one stylus and that only one device running the app could be synced to a given game at a time, necessitating that the screen and stylus be passed back and forth between players. He also found the stylus itself to be unresponsive, slowing the game down to the point that he lost interest. VentureBeats Jay Henningsen, on the other hand, had nothing but praise for the app and stylus. After fifteen minutes he found using the stylus to be [...] "almost natural", and found that the app handling all of the rules and stat-keeping made for [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> experiences I’ve ever had getting into a new game".

500|$|Over the years, Burton {{regularly}} {{thought about}} the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights. He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film with the latter as director. Disney {{was looking forward to}} Nightmare [...] "to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit." [...] Nightmare marked Burton's third film in a row to have a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns and {{he did not want to}} be involved with [...] "the painstakingly slow process of stop motion". To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs. Elfman found writing Nightmares eleven songs as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> jobs I've ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington." [...] Caroline Thompson still had yet to be hired to write the screenplay. With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, [...] "there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually." ...|$|E

The game's title, meant to be indicative of the games' theme of justice, was derived from [...] "Vesper", a name referring to the planet Venus. Its general meaning was to depict the protagonists and their ship as a newly-born star shining on the land, similar to Venus in the evening sky. The logo was also design to convey this, and the term [...] "Vesperia" [...] was used in-game for the party's airship. The game's main protagonist, Yuri Lowell, was created {{to be a more}} mature, evolved protagonist than Kyle Dunamis in Tales of Destiny 2 or Luke fon Fabre in Abyss. His role was to facilitate the growth of the other characters, and {{to have a sense of}} justice that did not take account of the law. Veteran Tales character designer, Kōsuke Fujishima, was brought in to design the main characters. Fujishima found designing Yuri difficult, while Flynn proved one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> designs.
