This paper presents {{two techniques}} that {{can reduce the}} time needed to haptically render a complex scene: a technique based on a spatial grid and a technique based on a modification of an <b>octtree.</b> These techniques are both theoretically and experimentally compared with each other and the default algorithm used in e-Touch. These results are discussed in order to draw conclusions on the best technique for a given scene. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{concerns}} {{digital image}} compression using adaptive thinning algorithms. Adaptive thinning is a recursive point removal scheme which works with decremental Delaunay triangulations. When applied to digital images, adaptive thinning returns a scattered set of most significant pixels. This requires efficient and customized methods for coding these pixels (but not their connectivities). To this end, we propose a hierarchical coding scheme, which works with recursive subdivisions of <b>octtree</b> cells, and which {{takes advantage of}} the statistical data correlation. The good performance of the resulting compression scheme is shown in comparison with the well-established wavelet-based method SPIHT. Digital image compression has recently gained enormous popularity in a variety of applications. This is especially due to the rapid development of multimedia technologies. Digital image compression is concerned with th...|$|E
40|$|The External Balanced Regular (x-BR) Trees {{constitute}} {{a family of}} new secondary memory structures which are suitable for storing and indexing multi-dimensional points and line segments. In 2 dimensions, the resulting structure is an External Balanced Quadtree, in 3 dimensions an External Balances <b>Octtree,</b> and in higher dimensions an External Balanced Hyper-quadtree. The main characteristic of all these structures is that they subdivide space (in an hierarchical and regular fashion) into disjoint regions. These spatial access methods are fully dynamic, while insertions are not complicated to program and affect only one path in the tree. Moreover, x-BR trees are variable resolution structures. That is, the number of space subdivisions is not predefined, making these structures suitable for very large amounts of data. Due to the balanced nature of these structures and the disjointness of the resulting regions, searches and other queries in these trees are processed very efficient [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper shows, {{that the}} {{framework}} {{developed at the}} Fraunhofer-Institute allows the implementation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) on a higher level. For some areas of GIS development, base functionality is available and therefore the time of implementation is reduced. Using object-oriented concepts guarantees the design of GIS in a more efficient way. Therefore, the framework has been developed as a class-library. This will ensure the reusability, maintenance and most importantly the expandability of the software. There are several functionalities extracted for the framework which are generally usable in GIS. The following areas are especially supported: * {{the construction of a}} graphic user interface (GUI) * The task of modeling and analyzing spatial objects in a 3 D data model * the object management in the form of lists, trees, hash-tables, <b>octtrees,</b> etc. In the field of urban and environmental planning, this framework has considerable advantages...|$|R
40|$|The {{items in}} a spatial {{database}} have location, extent, and shape {{with respect to}} a spatial coordinate system. Simple approximations to these attributes, say by bounding rectangles, are storage efficient and easy to manipulate. But effective spatial retrieval (on either location, extent, or shape) require a more precise representation of these attributes. In this report, we describe a highly compressed quadtree representation, called a Q 0 -tree, which supports spatial queries without false drops or unnecessary storage accesses. This access structure is dynamic. Moreover, because it is an exact representation of the spatial configuration, the spatial operators union, intersection, and difference can be coded with respect to the Q 0 -tree itself without needing a separate representation of the configuration, and, in worst case, exhibit linear performance. We discuss quadtrees, <b>octtrees,</b> grid files, R-trees, cell trees, and zkd B-trees; and provide a more detailed qualitative comparis [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is concemed with sorne aspects of 3 D {{geometrical}} modeling of a " geological scenary": 1) We con si der the geometries of the most commonplace geological bodies {{as well as that}} of the whole "scenary". Such geometries most often depend from the geological processes that generated the objects (surface alteration, erosion, sedimentation, magma intrusion or extrusion [...] .) or that transformed them (folding, faulting, metamorphism [...] .). Besides, deducing a geometry from local data (field mapping, drilling data [...] .) is generally not a straightforward process: it relies on a geological interpretation which takes place before any other mode ling. Thus computer aided mode ling most frequent! y provides a "model of model". 2) The review of sorne of the modelings that have been undertaken prior to the present study put sorne light on the various possible approaches. We show that it may be profitable in many cases to take into account the geological specificities of the modeled objects and thus to approximate by mean of a "dynamic" or "generative" approach the geometrical consequences of the processes that affected these objects. We also consider the relationships that a computer aided model may bear with the original data: it may be desirable either to geta "truly exact model" or on the contrary an "analogue" that may be used as a mere interpolation tool. We insist on the interset of a "forward-backward" method in order to obtain faithfull generative models. 3) We then focus on a particular problem: the modeling of irregularly shaped objects which may be either deformed or combined with each others by mean of boolean operations, as it is the case for granitic intrusions and for the surrounding terrains that are intruded and partly digested. We show that such a modeling depends on the choice of an adequate data structure: this must allow an easy definition of the objetct and, above ail, must not be too sensitive to manipulations through boolean operators and through similar type transformations (STT) which allow to simulate folding and faulting. 4) We review sorne classical data structures. Boundary representations (B. rep) are of very common use in solid modeling and have several advantages, but their pratical implementation for representing geological bodies may be rather complicated. CSG and space partitionings that are independent from the represented objects (horizontal slices, classical or mixt <b>octtrees)</b> appear inadequate, since they are destroyed, when the objects are deformed. In contrast, binary space partitionings (BSP) are very appealing, since they are only dependent from the objects themselves and are thus unaffected by displacements and more generally by affine transformations. We consequently define an hybrid structure, the BSP mixt tree, which allows in addition manipulations of the object by STI operators. Objects that are deformed or composed by boolean operators can thus be represented by trees that are easily deduced from those representing the original objects. 5) The GRANITE software which bas been built, allows to represent as a BSP tree any polyedric object, even if it is composed of disconnected volumes or if it comprises holes, to add or to substract if from similar objects and to deform it using STI operators. We present results which allow to produce objects showing very irregular shapes and comprising thousands of faces, in rather limited computation times. Ce travail prend place au sein d'une recherche sur la modélisation 3 d des scènes géologiques. Son apport spécifique est le suivant: 1) une réflexion générale est menée sur la géométrie des principaux types de corps géologiques; 2) une réflexion est également menée, au vu notamment des travaux réalisés antérieurement; 3) à la suite de cette réflexion d'ensemble, nous centrons la réflexion sur un problème particulier: celui de la modélisation d'objets de forme quelconque susceptibles d'être déformés ou d'être composés entre eux. Nous montrons que la question essentielle sous-jacente a une modélisation est celle du choix d'une structure de données; 4) définition d'une structure hybride, l'arbre BSP mixte; 5) au terme de la réflexion, nous avons construit le logiciel granite...|$|R
40|$|We have {{implemented}} a parallel {{version of the}} Barnes-Hut 3 -D N-body tree algorithm under PVM 3. 2. 5, adopting an SPMD paradigm. We parallelize the problem by decomposing the physical domain {{by means of the}} Orthogonal Recursive Bisection <b>octtree</b> scheme suggested by Salmon (1991), but we modify the original hypercube communication pattern into an incomplete hypercube, which is more suitable for a generic inhomogenous cluster architecture. We address dynamical load balancing by assigning different ”weights ” to the spawned tasks according to the dynamically changing workloads of each task. The weights are determined by monitoring the local platforms where the tasks are running and estimating the performance of each task. The monitoring scheme is flexible and allows us to address at the same time cluster and intrinsic sources of load imbalance. We then show measurements of the performance of our code on a test case of astrophysical interest in order to test the performance of our load-balancing scheme. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of Delaunay refinement {{has been recognized}} as a versatile tool to generate Delaunay meshes {{of a variety of}} geometries. Despite its usefulness, it suffers from one lacuna that limits its application. It does not scale well with the mesh size. As the sample point set grows, the Delaunay triangulation starts stressing the available memory space which ultimately stalls any effective progress. A natural solution to the problem is to maintain the point set in clusters and run the refinement on each individual cluster. However, this needs a careful point insertion strategy and a balanced coordination among the neighboring clusters to ensure consistency across individual meshes. We design an <b>octtree</b> based localized Delaunay refinement method for meshing surfaces in three dimensions which meets these goals. We prove that the algorithm terminates and provide guarantees about structural properties of the output mesh. Experimental results show that the method can avoid memory thrashing while computing large meshes and thus scales much better than the standard Delaunay refinement method...|$|E
40|$|The kd-tree is a {{fundamental}} tool in computer science. Among others, an application of the kd-tree search (<b>octtree</b> method) to fast evaluation of particle interactions and neighbor search is highly important since computational complexity of these problems are reduced from O(N 2) with a brute force method to O(NlogN) with the tree method where N is a number of particles. In this paper, we present a parallel implementation of the tree method running on a graphic processor unit (GPU). We successfully run a simulation of structure formation in the universe very efficiently. On our system, which costs roughly $ 900, the run with N ∼ 2. 87 × 10 6 particles took 5. 79 hours and executed 1. 2 × 10 13 force evaluations in total. We obtained the sustained computing speed of 21. 8 Gflops and the cost per Gflops of $ 41. 6 /Gflops that is two and half times better than the previous record in 2006. I...|$|E
40|$|Key words: {{ray tracing}} optimization, {{non-uniform}} spatial subdivision, octree, <b>octtree,</b> octree subdivision methods. The non-uniform spatial subdivision technique refined by Andrew Glassner [Glassner 1984] minimizes facet intersection tests (i) by automatically generating a density dependent spatial hierarchy of facet regions (called an octree) and(ii) by only testing facets in regions {{along the path}} of the ray. Past research has addressed optimization of the octree ray tracing process by separately improving both the octree traversal method and facet intersection algorithms. This author attempted to further improve the overall approach by attempting to identify new octree construction methods that would decrease the number of traversals required to render the scene. This research focused on the subdivision technique used in constructing the octree. The conventional Glassner algorithm utilizes cubic octants that can result in a large population of empty octants when rendering scenes containing localized regions with high facet density. Sparse octrees (containing significant numbers of empty octants) were believed to hinder performance of the facet traversal algorithm. As an alternative to the conventional cubic algorithm, the performance benefits of non-cubic octants wer...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an <b>OctTree</b> algorithm for the MPI-parallel, adaptive mesh-refinement code FLASH, {{which can be}} used to calculate the gas self-gravity, and also the angle-averaged local optical depth, for treating ambient diffuse radiation. The algorithm communicates to the different processors only those parts of the tree that are needed to perform the tree walk locally. The advantage of this approach is a relatively low memory requirement, important in particular for the optical depth calculation, which needs to process information from many different directions. This feature also enables a general tree-based radiation transport algorithm that will be described in a subsequent paper, and delivers excellent scaling up to at least 1500 cores. Boundary conditions for gravity can be either isolated or periodic, and they can be specified in each direction independently, using a newly developed generalisation of the Ewald method. The gravity calculation can be accelerated with the adaptive block update technique by partially re-using the solution from the previous time-step. Comparison with the Flash internal multi-grid gravity solver shows that tree based methods provide a competitive alternative, particularly for problems with isolated or mixed boundary conditions. We evaluate several multipole acceptance criteria (MACs) and identify a relatively simple APE MAC which provides high accuracy at low computational cost. The optical depth estimates are found to agree very well with those of the RADMC- 3 D radiation transport code, with the tree solver being much faster. Our algorithm is available in the standard release of the FLASH code in version 4. 0 and later. Comment: 26 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables. Accepted by MNRA...|$|E
