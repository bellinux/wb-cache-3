The basic terminology followed by <b>the</b> characterisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> receivables is defined in the theoretical part. It also includes <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> receivables emergence and dissolution as well as <b>the</b> collection method. <b>Account</b> receivables valuation is described with regard to two steps: account receivables valuation at <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case and at the balance sheet day, which is directly linked to <b>the</b> <b>account</b> receivables inventory including allowances for bad debts and the write-offs. In <b>the</b> final part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory, <b>the</b> various means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> receivables securitization are presented.
