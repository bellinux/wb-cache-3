40|$|An {{emerging}} theory, {{real option}} pricing, suggests {{that an important}} component of urban fringe farmland values may be the option value arising from nearby urban development. This new option pricing theory, as opposed to its standard conventional counterpart in finance, incorporates both the uncertainty about the future net benefits of a land conversion decision and the irreversibility of this action taken. We demonstrate that parsimonious empirical hedonic models of the errors-in-variables type, when corrected for heteroskedasticity, can provide adequate representations of farmland <b>option</b> <b>premiums.</b> Data for a random sample of cash rented Ohio farmland parcels are used, and the impacts of urban development on farmland <b>option</b> <b>premiums</b> are estimated. Results provide evidence that (a) both land-use conversion probability and urban influences have been important factors affecting the option value of the state's farmland, and (b) these <b>option</b> <b>premiums</b> associated with irreversible and uncertain land development are capitalized into farmland values.

40|$|The main {{upgrading}} programme (MUP) is a {{major policy}} implemented by the Singapore Housing Development Board (HDB) since the 1990 s. This heavily subsidised policy is highly targeted {{in order to enhance}} the social and economic value of public housing in Singapore. It benefits HDB households residing in the older HDB housing estates in terms of both an enhanced asset value of the household's flat and a quality living environment. An HDB flat owner whose precinct is selected for upgrading under the MUP policy is envisaged to be holding a call option to upgrade his flat, as this option to upgrade is valuable and it has an opportunity to command a higher price in the HDB resale market. This paper estimates the <b>option</b> <b>premiums</b> for upgrading by utilising the intuitive and explicit numerical method solution of the binomial real option pricing model and the Samuelson-McKean closed-form solution. The embedded real <b>option</b> <b>premiums</b> under the MUP policy are estimated at S$ 10 300 and S$ 2 000 for the popular three-room HDB flat and four-room HDB flat respectively.

Unlike put <b>option</b> <b>premiums</b> that change based on the current day’s futures trade, LRP premiums were determined using the previous days futures and options prices. Since LRP could be purchased until 8 : 00 p. m. based on the previous day’s prices, it created an opportunity for adverse selection by enabling producers to purchase price insurance after knowing how the current day’s price changed. In cases where market prices decreased (increased) today, the same LRP insurance would be more (less) expensive tomorrow...|$|R
30|$|This study applies Real Options Theory to banking in the {{environment}} of actively traded Philippine Universal Banks. These banks exist {{in an environment of}} imperfect information with regard to lending, and a country where credit scarcity impedes the growth and performance of entrepreneurial activity. We investigate the <b>option</b> <b>premiums</b> of loan portfolios that depict managerial flexibility with investment strategy. A Real Options Model that considers both the strategies to lend and to idle shows that smaller lending institutions will value loans higher than their larger competitors. From the model, the need to maintain smaller variances in loan portfolio returns constrains manager flexibility. <b>Option</b> <b>premiums</b> in the Philippines exhibit sensitivity to information asymmetries. In these findings, this discussion forwards three propositions and their implications. Furthermore, this paper discusses the value of a hedging portfolio to counter risks from information asymmetry. Hence, this paper differs from many models in the existing literature that focus just on the value of the call option, the value of expansion or growth.|$|R
40|$|The <b>options</b> <b>premiums</b> are {{frequently}} {{used to obtain}} probability density functions (pdfs) for the prices of the underlying assets. When these assets are bank deposits or notional Government bonds {{it is possible to}} compute probability measures of future interest rates. Recently, in the literature there have been many papers presenting methods of how to estimate pdfs from <b>options</b> <b>premiums.</b> Nevertheless, as far as we know, the estimation of probabilities of forward interest rate functions is an issue that has not been analysed before. In this paper, we propose such a method, {{that can be used to}} study the evolution of the expectations about interest rate convergence. We look at the cases of Spain and Italy against Germany, before the adoption of a single currency, and conclude that the expectations on the short-term interest rates convergence of Spain and Italy vis-a-vis Germany had a somewhat different trajectory, with higher expectations of convergence for Spain. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to price options on equity index futures with an {{application}} to standard options on S&P 500 futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Our methodology is based on stochastic dynamic programming, which can accommodate European as well as American options. The model accommodates dividends from the underlying asset. It also captures the optimal exercise strategy and the fair value of the option. This approach is an alternative to available numerical pricing methods such as binomial trees, finite differences, and ad-hoc numerical approximation techniques. Our numerical and empirical investigations demonstrate convergence, robustness, and efficiency. We use this methodology to value exchange-listed options. The European <b>option</b> <b>premiums</b> thus obtained are compared to Black's closed-form formula. They are accurate to four digits. The American <b>option</b> <b>premiums</b> also have a similar level of accuracy compared to premiums obtained using finite differences and binomial trees {{with a large number}} of time steps. The proposed model accounts for deterministic, seasonally varying dividend yield. In pricing futures options, we discover that what matters is the sum of the dividend yields {{over the life of the}} futures contract and not their distribution...|$|R
