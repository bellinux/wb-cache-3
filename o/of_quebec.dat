5|$|This {{is a list}} of the premiers of the {{province}} <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> Canada, since Confederation in 1867.

The premier, sometimes called the prime minister, is Quebec's head of government, while the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor <b>of</b> <b>Quebec.</b> The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> and presides over that body.|$|E

5|$|The New Englanders {{saw that}} the only {{possible}} place to crack the defences was on the city's northeastern side, where the walls were weakest.

When the landing force was on the heights west <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> the fleet would attack the city and land a second force there. Frontenac had expected the land attack to come from Beauport, and {{the banks of the}} river had already been built up with field fortifications on the southwestern side.
