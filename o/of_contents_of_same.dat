50|$|The {{film was}} the {{inspiration}} for a half-hour television series <b>of</b> the <b>same</b> name, which used the film's famous concluding line. The characters of Muldoon and Halloran initially returned in the series, but they were now played by John McIntire and James Franciscus. The series ran for a single season in 1958 to 1959, earning an Emmy Award nomination as Best Drama. It was resurrected {{in the fall of}} 1960 as an hour-long drama, which ran from October 1960 to September 1963.The film is replicated almost entirely in a piece <b>of</b> downloadable <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>same</b> name for the videogame L.A. Noire, although several character names are changed, and Dr. Stoneman succeeds in committing suicide by jumping out of an open window, whereas he is restrained in the original work.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the general {{functions of the}} New Zealand news media system and the structure, organisation and control of both the daily press and broadcasting and television services in New Zealand. In order to analyse the performance of daily newspapers in detail, a methodology is laid down for the quantitative description <b>of</b> the subject <b>content</b> <b>of</b> newspapers. A sample of the wire copy transmitted to daily newspapers in New Zealand by the New Zealand Press Association is analysed and a study is made of the news selection and display practices observed by 16 daily newspapers in their handling of this material. Further samples <b>of</b> the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>same</b> 16 daily papers are then analysed {{in order to obtain}} characteristic subject content descriptions and to provide material for a generalised discussion {{of the way in which}} the newspapers appear to be exercising their functions. This leads to a treatment of the problems facing the New Zealand daily press and a brief outline of the role of the New Zealand Press Association in the New Zealand news media system, as well as a discussion of the possibilities that exist for the improved education and training of journalists. The work then concludes with a set of appendices in which the full texts of various documents are reproduced, as well as a bibliography of literature relevant to the general field of research on the New Zealand mass media...|$|R
