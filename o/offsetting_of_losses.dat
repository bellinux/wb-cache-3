As the Commission’s Communication on the Tax Treatment of Losses in Cross-Border Situations demonstrates, there is yet a lot of ground to be covered in harmonizing this aspect of corporate income taxes (CITs). While the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) proposal seems to be stalled, a series of relatively recent European Court of Justice (ECJ) cases (among others, X Holding BV) may be tilting the balance in the interest of Member States, for the first time allowing the safeguard of revenues, or the ‘balanced allocation of taxing powers’ to be the deciding argument in allowing restrictions on the <b>offsetting</b> <b>of</b> <b>losses.</b> Losses cannot be analysed in isolation of the rules to determine the taxable base, as they are one more piece in the tax base puzzle. In this article, I focus on two issues: multinational groups and permanent establishments (PEs), as they comprise the main problems arising in cross-border loss relief. The different methods employed to grant loss relief are assessed, as well as the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) proposals on the taxation of PEs. My main argument is that restrictions of loss relief have an effect that go beyond discriminating or restricting – that is, beyond making it ‘less attractive’ to move around the EU. Such restrictions touch the core of taxation of income. If no loss relief is provided, the tax is not reflecting the real ability to pay, thus not only is it not being neutral and inefficient, it is also creating a fictional tax debt. It has been completed in the framework of a Publicly Funded Research Project on Direct Tax Harmonization in the European Union (titled La fiscalidad directa en la Unión Europea: entre competencia y convergencia), financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Ref. DER 2010 - 20000, Dir. Juan Zornoza). This work has also benefited from a Senior Professors Research Grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education (Beca de Movilidad de Profesores, Programa Senior, Ministerio de Educación), as well as from a post-maternity research help.

However, since the realized income may differ from the expected income, it is possible that migration may indeed lead to an increase in child labor effort.

However, restrictions on tax loss carry-forwards (TLCF) are the rule rather than the exception. The EBIT model of Goldstein et al. (2001) is extended to measure how optimal leverage is affected by restrictions on TLCF. The restricted TLCF case reconciles the static trade-off model with the evidence that (i) optimal leverage is decreasing with firm growth and (ii) firms benefiting from TLCF may issue debt less aggressively. ...|$|R

Starting from the experimental evidence of eddy current confinement inside the individual particles, the classical loss component is calculated for given particle size distribution. Taking then into account the contribution of the experimentally determined quasi-static (hysteresis) loss, the excess loss component is obtained and quantitatively assessed. Its behavior shows that the dynamic homogenization of the magnetization process with frequency, a landmark feature of magnetic laminations, is restrained in these materials. This results into a partial <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> advantage offered by the eddy current confinement...|$|R
