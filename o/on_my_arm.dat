500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as she stands up, he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had finger marks <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> when I left {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen standing in the middle of a cemetery, walking around and staring at the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the house to see her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to wake him up but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks through the window and notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E
2500|$|One {{afternoon}} of November, 1868, in the Park at Hawarden, I {{was standing by}} Mr. Gladstone holding his coat <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> while he, in his shirt sleeves, was wielding an axe to cut down a tree. Up came a telegraph messenger. He took the telegram, opened it and read it, then handed it to me, speaking only two words, namely, 'Very significant', and at once resumed his work. The message merely stated that General Grey would arrive that evening from Windsor. [...] This, of course, implied that a mandate {{was coming from the}} Queen charging Mr. Gladstone with the formation of his first Government. [...] I said nothing, but waited while the well-directed blows resounded in regular cadence. [...] After a few minutes the blows ceased and Mr. Gladstone, resting on the handle of his axe, looked up, and with deep earnestness in his voice, and great intensity in his face, exclaimed: My mission is to pacify Ireland. He then resumed his task, and never said another word till the tree was down.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{her last}} radio {{appearances}} {{was in an}} episode of the BBC's Desert Island Discs with Roy Plomley. Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview show, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she [...] "couldn’t put a key in the door, dahling. I can't do a thing for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> as I supported her to the lift. Her eyes were still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Needing a band, {{he called}} {{childhood}} friend and songwriter/guitarist Ron Elliott, who recruited drummer John Petersen, rhythm guitarist/singer Declan Mulligan, and bassist Ron Meagher. Victor Savant, later to achieve fame in Europe as musical director for schlager singer Roberto Blanco, {{was in the}} band {{for a brief period}} as a pianist, but never recorded with the band. The gig led to a more lucrative deal at the Morocco Room, a club in nearby San Mateo, California. Meanwhile, San Francisco disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell were looking for new acts to bring to their fledgling Autumn Records label. Donahue and Mitchell wanted to capitalize on the Beatlemania craze that originated the previous year in the UK and was spreading across the U.S. by this time. Rich Romanello, owner of the Morocco Room and the Brummels' first manager, asked Donahue and Mitchell to see the band perform at the club. Romanello recalled, [...] "There were maybe four people in the place, and they set up and started playing, and that old hair <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> goes up. And when the hair on your arm goes up, you got something. It was a big change, to go from saxophones and black singers to a white guitar sound, but I hired 'em." ...|$|E

5000|$|From his home, Obaidullah was {{transported to}} Chapman Airfield, a forward {{operating}} base. Obaidullah described his treatment at Chapman airbase {{in a statement}} made during his habeas corpus proceedings:“After I got to the military base, there were several soldiers who told me to put my hands up and then to hold them straight out {{to the front of}} me. I did what they told me to do. They then put two sandbags <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and made me walk around back and forth with them like that all night. They were extremely heavy, and if I dropped the bags, the soldiers put them back <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> They got so heavy that I had to kind of place them <b>on</b> <b>my</b> stomach as I moved. They did not let me sleep at all for the rest of that night but forced me to keep moving with bags <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> When they moved me from one location to another, the soldiers were extremely rough and shoved me around with their knees and elbows in a very painful and frightening way. In the morning before sunrise, I was taken into a room and interrogated by three or four soldiers. They told me that they would kill me if I didn’t talk. After I told them I didn’t know the answers to their questions, one of them knocked me to the floor. He took out a long knife and started sharpening it in front of me. I could hear the sounds of the knife being sharpened. He then lifted my hood and showed me the knife. He put it {{on the back of my}} head and said now start talking… I was terrified and fully believed that they might kill me." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> Your Hearse was {{the first}} Opeth album with drummer Martin Lopez, who {{answered}} a newspaper ad that Opeth put up searching for this spot to be taken after Anders Nordin left. Shortly thereafter the band also brought in Martín Méndez, a friend and previous band-mate of Lopez. However, Mendez {{did not have enough}} time to learn the bass parts for the album, so frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt played bass for the entire recording session. All of the songs <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Arms,</b> Your Hearse are shorter than ten minutes, whereas on Opeth's previous album, Morningrise, every song exceeds this length. The album is dedicated to Lee Barrett (of Candlelight Records).|$|R
