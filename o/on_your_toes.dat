25|$|As the Great Depression set {{in during}} the post-Broadway {{national}} tour of Show Boat, the public turned back to mostly light, escapist song-and-dance entertainment. Audiences {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic had little money to spend on entertainment, and only a few stage shows anywhere exceeded a run of 500 performances during the decade. The revue The Band Wagon (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, while Porter's Anything Goes (1934) confirmed Ethel Merman's position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. Coward and Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as The Dancing Years, while Rodgers and Hart returned from Hollywood to create a series of successful Broadway shows, including <b>On</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Toes</b> (1936, with Ray Bolger, the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), Babes In Arms (1937) and The Boys From Syracuse (1938). Porter added DuBarry Was a Lady (1939). The longest-running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was Hellzapoppin (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record.|$|E

He {{appeared}} in All's Well That Ends Well and As You Like It (1999–2000), and played Mercutio in a 1994 TV adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Other theatre credits include Waiting for Godot (1994) and 900 Oneonta (1994), which earned him a nomination for Best Actor at the Evening Standard Awards. He also acted in Martin Yesterday (1998), for which he was nominated as Best Actor in the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards, Naked (1998), Tales From Hollywood (2001), Three Sisters (2003), Iphigenia at Aulis (2004), The God of Hell (2005), and The Wild Duck (2005–2006). In 2006, Daniels appeared in Thérèse Raquin as Laurent, for which a reviewer labelled his performance [...] "riveting".|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became {{well known}} for {{creating}} Broadway hits with other partners. [...] Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as Babes in Arms (1937), The Boys from Syracuse (1938) and Pal Joey (1940). [...] Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre: [...] <b>On</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Toes</b> was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the [...] "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" [...] scene), while Pal Joey flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero. [...] Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as Rose-Marie (1924), The Desert Song (1926), The New Moon (1927) and Show Boat (1927). [...] Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern, [...] "The Last Time I Saw Paris", which {{was included in the}} 1941 film Lady Be Good.|$|E

Co-creator Greg Daniels had wanted Jim to get a haircut for a while, as {{he thought it would}} [...] "change [...] up a little bit." [...] Krasinski thought it was [...] "really smart" [...] to make it seem like Karen's idea. Kwapis was careful with Jim's reaction shots in the episode, as {{he did not want to}} [...] "tip anything" [...] to the audience about Jim's choice of Karen or Pam. Kwapis explained, [...] "That to me was actually one of the big challenges of the episode is how to keep you <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>toes</b> in terms of not knowing where the story was going." [...] Jim's flashback scene with Pam on the beach was initially intended to be the cold open of the episode before Michael Schur suggested it be moved. Kwapis shot multiple endings, and the cast was unaware how the season would end.|$|E

40|$|When someone steps <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>toe</b> <b>on</b> purpose, {{it seems}} to hurt more than when the person {{does the same thing}} unintentionally. The {{physical}} parameters of the harm may not differ—your toe is flattened in both cases—but the psychological experience of pain is changed nonetheless. Intentional harms are premeditated by another person and have the specific purpose of causing pain. In a sense, intended harms are events initiated by one mind to communicate meaning (malice) to another, and this could shape the recipient’s experience. This study examined whether self-reported pain is indeed higher when the events producing the pain are understood as intentionally (as opposed to unintentionally) caused by another person. Although pain was traditionally conceived to be solely physical in nature (Aydede, 2005), its experience varies substantially with psychological context. The placebo analgesi...|$|R

60|$|Every form {{of memory}} will be, from our present point of view, {{in one sense}} a delayed response. But this phrase does not quite clearly express what is meant. If you light a fuse and connect it with a heap of dynamite, the {{explosion}} of the dynamite may be spoken of, in a sense, as a delayed response to your lighting of the fuse. But that only means that it is a somewhat late portion of a continuous process of which the earlier parts have less emotional interest. This is not the case with habit. A display of habit has two sorts of causes: (a) the past occurrences which generated the habit, (b) the present occurrence which brings it into play. When you drop a weight <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>toe,</b> and say what you do say, the habit has been caused by imitation of your undesirable associates, whereas it is brought into play by the dropping of the weight. The great bulk of our knowledge is a habit in this sense: whenever I am asked when I was born, I reply correctly by mere habit. It would hardly be correct to say that getting born was the stimulus, and that my reply is a delayed response But in cases of memory this way of speaking would have an element of truth. In an habitual memory, the event remembered was clearly {{an essential part of the}} stimulus to the formation of the habit. The present stimulus which brings the habit into play produces a different response from that which it would produce if the habit did not exist. Therefore the habit enters into the causation of the response, and so do, at one remove, the causes of the habit. It follows that an event remembered is an essential part of the causes of our remembering.|$|R

2500|$|When {{asked why}} The Run is from San Fran – New York rather than LA – New York, game’s {{producer}} Brian Lindley replied: [...] "That’s a good question. I {{think we were}} maybe looking for more of a direct route. It’s more of a straight line route rather than being sort of corner to corner. But also, San Fran has some iconic landmarks and things like the bridge and the downtown. Also, {{what we can do}} with the environment with things like fog, it makes it of a bit cooler place to drive than LA. And my experiences driving in LA are largely being stuck in traffic! So that’s the primary reason, it’s just a cooler looking start for the game." [...] Black Box PR Manager Dana Sissons stated that The Run was going to be more exciting, more varied, and bigger than ever.

I was lying there trying some India-rubber rings of various patterns, and endeavoring to make a selection, for I was tired of trying to cut my teeth on people's fingers, and wanted to get hold of something that would enable me to hurry the thing through and get something else.

2500|$|Although {{directors}} and choreographers {{have had a}} major influence on musical theatre style since at least the 19th century, [...] George Abbott and his collaborators and successors took a central role in integrating movement and dance fully into musical theatre productions in the Golden Age. [...] Abbott introduced ballet as a story-telling device in <b>On</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Toes</b> in 1936, which was followed by Agnes DeMille's ballet and choreography in Oklahoma!. [...] After Abbott collaborated with Jerome Robbins in On the Town and other shows, Robbins combined the roles of director and choreographer, emphasizing the story-telling power of dance in West Side Story, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962) and Fiddler on the Roof (1964). Bob Fosse choreographed for Abbott in The Pajama Game (1956) and Damn Yankees (1957), injecting playful sexuality into those hits. [...] He was later the director-choreographer for Sweet Charity (1968), Pippin (1972) and Chicago (1975). [...] Other notable director-choreographers have included Gower Champion, Tommy Tune, Michael Bennett, Gillian Lynne and Susan Stroman. [...] Prominent directors have included Hal Prince, who also got his start with Abbott, and Trevor Nunn.|$|E
2500|$|Theater {{historian}} Ethan Mordden {{points out}} that, although Oklahoma! {{has been called}} [...] "the first integrated musical, the first American folk musical", Show Boat [...] "got there first on both counts." [...] Even earlier, the Princess Theatre musicals, following Gilbert and Sullivan and French opéra bouffe, began the reintegration of song and story after decades of thinly plotted British and American musicals, {{paving the way for}} Show Boat and Oklahoma! by showing that a musical could combine popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs. [...] These Princess Theatre shows, which featured modern American settings, [...] "built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern's exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization." [...] Mordden also notes that Oklahoma! was called the first great dance musical, but other musicals had earlier focused on dance, among them Gay Divorce and <b>On</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Toes.</b> [...] He concludes: [...] "But Oklahoma! was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom." ...|$|E
