50|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} considerations within the Directive are the containment of spills and firewater. Spills could be anything from milk through, cooking oil through to oils from your parking lot's <b>oil</b> <b>interceptor</b> or a bio-hazard.|$|E
50|$|Ever {{since the}} hydro {{electric}} stations first opened in 1920, {{they have been}} working with environmental groups {{to make sure that they}} only produce clean, green energy. They work closely with the Scottish Wildlife Trust, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, and the local communities.The Lanark Hydro Electric Scheme launched its first biodiversity action plan in 2005. The plan aimed to protect the wildlife and plant life at the Hydro Electric scheme. In 2009, they started a schedule to plan out their next environmental enhancement objectives for the next five years. Right now, over 1,900 species call the Falls of Clyde home, and many of these 1,900 are being protected by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. This ranges from plants, to reptiles, to birds, and much more. In 1997, they helped protect the peregrine falcon from becoming endangered. The Lanark Hydros have many visitors each year, usually over 60,000 people. The SWT (Scottish Wildlife Trust) has activities and even summer programmes to help promote the use of green energy and preserve the wildlife there. In addition to wildlife preservation and green energy production, Lanark Hydro Electric Scheme produces clean energy without emitting greenhouse gasses or Carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The associated facilities only emit Carbon that is produced by the electricity that is created and ran through the machinery used. Also, both facilities have been fitted for <b>oil</b> <b>interceptor</b> systems in case oil spills occur. The interceptors are designed to catch the spilled oil and keep the water from being contaminated in the event that an oil spill is to occur.|$|E
40|$|A problem {{associated}} with pervious surfaces {{of all types}} is the reluctance by some developers {{to make use of}} them. Another important issue, in a retrofit situation, is the need to improve the sustainable aspect of existing drainage may well not be sufficient to justify ripping up and re-laying large areas of pavement (Stovin and Swan, 2003). Indeed pervious pavements are among the least economic options for SUDS retrofit (Stovin, 2004). These factors defined the need to create a system which could be used in conjunction with new or existing impermeable surfaces and with the flexibility to allow either infiltration or attenuation/further treatment under a new paved surface or to facilitate off-line infiltration for retrofit purposes. It is necessary that the system retains much of the hydrocarbon and suspended solid removal capabilities of a pervious pavement. The system proposed is a potentially attractive pre-cleaning device prior to a sand filter or filter trench or swale. Where space allows, such systems could be constructed either as a continuous trench or at intervals along the boundary of a paved area such as a car park, allowing water to be infiltrated directly into the ground. This can be achieved with minimal disruption to an existing paved surface; allowing conversion to be carried out relatively cheaply. Alternatively, in new build applications, the water can be directed back under the surface into a water-storing sub-base or synthetic sub-base replacement system for either infiltration or attenuation. Utilising this technology in combination with the Permaceptor close-coupled <b>oil</b> <b>interceptor,</b> equipped with the floating mat oil sorbing/biodegradation system, can produce a surface water treatment train with three phases of treatment. The device, which was developed, was based on a kerb drain where, instead of the water being conveyed linearly along the drain, the water would be transmitted perpendicular to the drain into a downstream infiltration or attenuation device via a proprietary oil/water separation system. All installations to date have been achieved using either the close-coupled <b>oil</b> <b>interceptor,</b> formed using membranes within shallow structural modules, or by incorporating standard kerb drains and channel drains modified for the process. However, this device has gone through a series of development stages and the testing reported upon is from an earlier form of the system before the development of the current system, which is much more amenable to mass production. Several practical applications of this device will be reported, as will the latest results on the mass produced model. Further important developments relate to the protection of sites from hydrocarbon pollution during the construction phase. This issue is also addressed...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} for this thesis {{led to the development}} of two environmental detectors, whose function was to identify predetermined threshold levels of the analyte. The research centred onto two types of analyte; immiscible and dissolved, both occurring in water based locations. The first detector was developed to detect the accumulation of oil within an oil/water <b>interceptor.</b> Pollution from <b>oil</b> spillages is a major contaminate of water systems and the control of this potentially hazardous material has legal obligations. This liquid, which naturally separates from water, accumulates within the interceptor enclosure and can be removed once the quantity of oil reaches the desired level. However, the often unpredictable nature of oil leaks and spillages means that the accumulation of <b>oil</b> within an <b>interceptor</b> is an irregular occurrence. Interceptor detectors based upon electrical techniques already exist. This research specifically developed a detection system that operated without any electrical devices within the interceptor. The research explored several possible avenues, eventually pursuing a technique based upon pressure change, based on the density differential between water and oil. The final system was capable of identifying when the oil had reached a depth of 200 to 250 mm within the interceptor. The second detection system, a portable microfluidic fluorimeter, was intended for placement in locations for the direct analysis of water. Glutathione was chosen as a model analyte, associated with a sex pheromone and prior to the onset of spawning may be found in high concentrations. The system that has been developed is capable of selectively sensing glutathione to below 10 μM. However, the threshold concentration in the proximity of its release as a pheromone is greater than 100 μM and within this range the fluorimeter produced a linear response. The fluorimeter used an LED light source with a PMT detector. An analysis could be made every seven minutes, using 150 μL each of analyte and reagent for every cycle. Through assessment of a pre-made standard, the viability of the microfluidic system could be assured with regards to blockages or other malfunctions of the system.

40|$|Water {{is the one}} of the {{resource}} that very important in our daily lives. However, if our water resources uses every day are polluted by contaminants, it can impacts for ecologies system life cycle and human life. The major pollutants are identified at Sungai Klang which the river are polluted by domestic activities around that area. However, local government was able expense a million Ringgit Malaysia (RM) to built water treatment system but it must be treated at the beginning point to make sure the water will exceed the water quality index specification. Therefore, early treatment or first stage of filter is very important before the domestic waste enter to the rivers. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to identified oil and grease on treated water after filtration process and propose of reuse water. Scope of this study was started at cafeteria student which <b>oil</b> <b>interceptor</b> was built. This study also improving the filter system for existing domestic waste pretreatment system(oil interceptor) that have be adaptation from mineral water port system that have being change their system. In design of filter, the material use on this design is defined in various size of aggregate and sand, which is tested to defined their infiltration rate (in/hr). Hopefully with this study, all parties will take part and involved in control pollution on our rivers...|$|E
