5|$|Williams set out {{the case}} against utilitarianism – a consequentialist {{position}} the simplest version {{of which is that}} actions are right <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number– in Utilitarianism: For and Against (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E
5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
25|$|The Naval General Staff proved {{reluctant}} {{to go along}} and Yamamoto was eventually driven to capitalize on his popularity in the fleet by threatening to resign to get his way. Admiral Osami Nagano and the Naval General Staff eventually caved in to this pressure, but <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> approving the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E

5000|$|Validation - A {{pharmacophore}} {{model is}} a hypothesis accounting for the observed biological activities {{of a set of}} molecules that bind to a common biological target.

50|$|Samantabhadra {{is also a}} {{key figure}} in the Āvataṃsaka-sūtra, {{particularly}} the last chapter, the Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra. In the climax of the Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra, the student Sudhana meets Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, who teaches him that wisdom only exists for the sake of putting it into practice; that it is <b>only</b> good <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it benefits all living beings.|$|R
25|$|Firstly, (conservative) Religious Zionists {{differ with}} Modern Orthodoxy in its {{approach}} to secular knowledge. Here, engagement with the secular is permissible, and encouraged, but <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> this benefits the State of Israel; secular knowledge (or, at the least, an extensive secular education) is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not in and of itself. See further under Torah Umadda.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata {{that are necessary}} to constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how {{that will allow them to}} constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.|$|E
25|$|The role {{of secular}} life and culture: In the Hirschian view, {{interaction}} with the secular and the requisite acquisition of culture and knowledge is encouraged, <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it facilitates the application of Torah to worldly matters. For Modern Orthodoxy, on the other hand, secular culture and knowledge {{are seen as a}} complement to Torah, and, to some extent, encouraged for their own sake. Some would suggest that in Modern Orthodoxy, Judaism is enriched by interaction with modernity, whereas in Neo-Orthodoxy human experience (and modernity) are enriched by the application of Torah outlook and practice.|$|E
500|$|Josiah Royce (1855–1916) {{built on}} the {{transcendental}} idealism view of conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical decisions. But, he thought, this was <b>only</b> true <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> our conscience also required loyalty to [...] "a mysterious higher or deeper self." ...|$|R
50|$|The final master that Sudhana visits is the bodhisattva Samantabhadra, {{who teaches}} him that wisdom only exists {{for the sake}} of putting it into practice; that it is <b>only</b> good <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it {{benefits}} all living beings. Samantabhadra concludes with a prayer of aspiration to buddhahood, which is recited by those who practice according to Atiśa's Bodhipathapradīpa, the foundation of the lamrim textual traditions of Tibetan Buddhism.|$|R
25|$|That {{is proof}} {{positive}} that disarmament was <b>only</b> useful <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it contained through {{the maintenance of}} sanctions and facilitated regime change. It was never about disarmament, it was never about getting rid {{of weapons of mass}} destruction. It started with George Herbert Walker Bush, and it was a policy continued through eight years of the Clinton presidency, and then brought us to this current disastrous course of action under the current Bush Administration.|$|R
25|$|Any {{notion that}} courts could declare {{statutes}} void {{was defeated in}} England with the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when King James II was removed and the elected Parliament declared itself supreme. However, it continued to be known in the American colonies and at the bars of young states, where Coke's books were very influential. The doctrine was specifically enshrined in some state constitutions, and by 1803 it had been employed in both State and Federal courts in actions dealing with state statutes, but <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> the statutes conflicted with the language of state constitutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophies of}} Torah Umadda and Religious Zionism {{are not in}} any direct conflict, and {{generally}} coexist sharing both values and adherents. However, more conservative Religious Zionists differ with Torah Umadda in its approach to secular knowledge. In this view, engagement with secular ideas and situations is permissible and encouraged, but <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> this benefits the State of Israel. Here, then, secular knowledge is viewed as valuable for practical ends, though not in and of itself. Thus, for example, in contrast to Torah Umadda, the study of literature and the humanities is discouraged here, whereas the study of engineering or medicine (and with subsequent practice in Israel) is deemed to be valuable.|$|E
25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are {{reciprocally}} limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E
5000|$|An enactive {{perspective}} of cognition {{is fundamental to}} a cognitive ecological view. Rather than a passive interpretation of internally represented information, cognition {{is considered to be}} an active process involving the transformation of information into meaningful relationships between the organism and its environment. For humans then, a perceived environment is <b>only</b> constructed <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> cognitive constraints will allow. In other words, they [...] "enact a world" [...] by building perspectives out of ecological information, using their evolved cognitive equipment.|$|R
50|$|Grenade-jumping (GJ) is a {{technique}} which demands more exacting timing, because the grenade-launcher's projectile ricochets after it is launched, and its detonation is delayed. Combining more than one grenade {{in order to make}} GJ is also possible but may require more players due to detonation delay. BFG-jumping is {{a technique}} kin to rocket-jumping, and <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> different <b>as</b> the BFG has a higher rate of fire and makes more splash damage. Plasma-jumping, also called plasma-hopping, {{is a technique}} in which plasma gives slight boost to the jump.|$|R
50|$|As IT {{architectural}} layers, {{business support}} processes, and organizational structures become {{more sophisticated and}} prone to constant change, EAM will only result in haphazard business and IT alignment if the primary focus is on delivering sets of technically based models. This approach is <b>only</b> helpful <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it depicts the enterprise architecture as a snapshot in time, but it offers no reiterative process support to develop architecture solutions and test against different scenarios, benchmarks, and standards as dictated by the ever converging business and IT strategy.|$|R
25|$|Activities and {{functions}} of R are highly confidential and declassification of past operations are uncommon unlike agencies like CIA, MI6 and Mossad who have many of their activities declassified. The Secretary (R) reported to the Vohra Committee that R offices abroad have limited strength and are largely geared to the collection of military, economic, scientific and political intelligence. R monitors the activities of certain organisations abroad <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> they relate to their involvement with narco terrorist elements and smuggling arms, ammunition, explosives, etc. into India. It does not monitor the activities of criminal elements abroad, which are mainly confined to normal smuggling without any links to terrorist elements. However, if {{there is evidence to}} suggest that certain organisations have links with Intelligence agencies of other countries, and that they are being used or are likely to be used by such countries for destabilising India's economy, it would become R's responsibility to monitor their activities.|$|E
25|$|In the {{derivation}} {{of things}} {{according to the}} series of the numbers {{he seems to have}} gone further than any of his predecessors. He approximated to the Pythagoreans in this, that (as is clear from his explanation of the soul) he regarded number as the conditioning principle of consciousness, and consequently of knowledge also; he thought it necessary, however, to supply what was wanting in the Pythagorean assumption by the more accurate definition, borrowed from Plato, that it is <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> number reconciles the opposition between the same and the different, and has raised itself to self-motion, that it is soul. We find a similar attempt at the supplementation of the Platonic doctrine in Xenocrates's assumption of indivisible lines. In them he thought he had discovered what, according to Plato, God alone knows, and he among men who is loved by him, namely, the elements or principia of the Platonic triangles. He seems to have described them as first, original lines, and in a similar sense to have spoken of original plain figures and bodies, convinced that the principia of the existent should be sought not in the material, not in the divisible which attains to the condition of a phenomenon, but merely in the ideal definitude of form. He may very well, in accordance with this, have regarded the point as a merely subjectively admissible presupposition, and a passage of Aristotle respecting this assumption should perhaps be referred to him.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} with the earlier article shows that {{the reconstruction of the}} vicariate is not an organic continuation of the former condition but that an entirely new organization has been created. There is in this change an evident effort to organize the official bodies as servants of the public and to do this {{on the basis of the}} modern method of carrying on business, as it is found everywhere in countries that lead in civilization and in well-organized central boards of authorities. Formerly the administration was a cumbrous one, impeded by traditional obstacles; it may perhaps be said to have regarded itself as the primary object and the public which it should serve as of subordinate consideration. This state of things is now past, thanks to the energy of the reigning pope, which overcame all obstacles. Now, anyone who has business with the vicariate knows exactly to which department, which official, he must go in order to have the matter in question speedily settled. It is to be expected that in the course of time the third department owing to the test of practical working may undergo slight changes, as it is not probable that all ordinances will prove capable of permanent execution. The characteristics of the new organization are division of work and rigid separation of the judiciary from the executive administration, together with an ample supply of officials for the different departments. In the reorganization customs that had become historical were taken into consideration <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> they could be combined without difficulty with modern methods of business.|$|E
50|$|The book {{develops}} themes Wolfe introduces in {{the title}} essay from his book Hooking Up. The novel centers on Charlotte, a naive new student at Dupont University, a school boasting a top-ranked basketball program and an Ivy League academic reputation. Despite Dupont's elite status, {{in the minds of}} its students, sex, alcohol, and social status rule the day. The student culture is focused upon gaining material wealth, physical pleasure, and a well-placed social status; academics are <b>only</b> important <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> they help achieve these goals.|$|R
2500|$|Though Parade de cirque was {{eclipsed by}} Les Poseuses at the 1888 Salon des Indépendants, several critics did mention the arduous and {{innovative}} lighting effects employed by Seurat.

30|$|The {{traditional}} {{approaches of}} understanding competitive advantage have initially {{been criticized for}} lacking a theory of value creation (Pitelis 2009, pp. 1117; see also Makadok and Coff 2002). Originally, industry structure view, RBV, and the dynamic capabilities approach have {{been focused on the}} capture of value (although often denoted as value creation), since their purpose is to provide an understanding of firm profitability. Use value, and therefore value creation, has played only a subordinate role and become <b>only</b> relevant <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it affects firms’ capabilities to capture value (Makadok and Coff 2002, p. 10).|$|R
500|$|Isabeau {{was accused}} of indulging in extravagant and {{expensive}} fashions, jewel-laden dresses and elaborate braided hairstyles coiled into tall shells, covered with wide double hennins that, reportedly, required widened doorways to pass through. In 1406 a pro-Burgundian satirical pamphlet in verse allegory listed Isabeau's supposed lovers. She {{was accused of}} leading France into a civil war because of her inability to support a single faction; she was described as an [...] "empty headed" [...] German; of her children {{it was said that}} she [...] "took pleasure in a new pregnancy <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it offered her new gifts"; and her political mistakes were attributed to her being fat.|$|E
500|$|The early {{focus of}} the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) was on criticising anti-racist white liberals and {{liberalism}} itself, accusing it of paternalism and being a [...] "negative influence" [...] on black Africans. In {{one of his first}} published articles, Biko stated that although he was [...] "not sneering at the [...] liberals and their involvement" [...] in the anti-apartheid movement, [...] "one has to come to the painful conclusion that the [...] liberal is in fact appeasing his own conscience, or at best is eager to demonstrate his identification with the black people <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it does not sever all ties with his relatives on his side of the colour line." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} get back to the United States, the Simpsons have to enter a humiliating game show called The Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show. According to Cantor, this is where the family find a {{difference}} between Japanese and American culture, as Wink, the game-show host, explains to them: [...] "Our game shows are a little different from yours. Your shows reward knowledge. We punish ignorance." [...] The game show is partly based on the Japanese show Za Gaman, as well as the British show Family Fortunes. As with many other episodes in the series, [...] "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] suggests that, in the end, the Simpsons are more attached to the local than to the global, and, as Cantor writes: [...] "indeed the global is ultimately important in the series <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it can be made local, that is, part of Springfield. For all its cosmopolitanism, the show keeps returning to the American theme of 'there's no place like home'".|$|E

5000|$|Like many Platonists, Taurus {{held the}} {{conviction}} that the world was eternal and un-created. From this he concluded that the account of creation in Plato's Timaeus was to be read as a metaphor, intended only as a didactic device. He considered various metaphoric readings of Plato's text and listed four non-temporal meanings of the word genētós ("created", [...] "become"). He favored an interpretation in which the created nature of the world exists in its character as a process: the cosmos was <b>only</b> created <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it is ever changing, never ceasing to become.|$|R
2500|$|Within the {{framework}} of the neoclassical theory of the factors of production, there does also exist a law of diminishing returns.

500|$|Literary scholar Karl Kroeber (1926–2009) {{argues that}} Lucy [...] "possesses a double existence; her actual, {{historical}} existence and her idealised {{existence in the}} poet's mind. In the poem, Lucy is both actual and idealised, but her actuality is relevant <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> it makes manifest the significance implicit in the actual girl." [...] Hartman holds the same view; to him Lucy is seen [...] "entirely from within the poet, so that this modality may be the poet's own", but then he argues, [...] "she belongs to the category of spirits who must still become human... the poet describes her as dying at {{a point at which}} she would have been humanized." [...] The literary historian Kenneth Johnston concludes that Lucy was created as the personification of Wordsworth's muse, and the group as a whole [...] "is a series of invocations to a Muse feared dead. As epitaphs, they are not sad, a very inadequate word to describe them, but breathlessly, almost aware of what such a loss would mean to the speaker: 'oh, the difference to me!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Chapter three {{considers}} utilitarianism, {{according to}} which the rightness or wrongness of an action {{is determined by the}} extent to which it promotes utility—a concept equated, by classical utilitarians, with pleasure. As a political theory, then, classical utilitarianism entails that [...] "it is the obligation of political communities to formulate policies and institutions which promote pleasure". Utilitarianism as a whole, Cochrane argues, posed a challenge to the medieval and early modern assumption that animals are owed nothing. Its focus on welfare and sentience, and its egalitarian nature, allow the extension of justice to animals. The ideas of Peter Singer are outlined. Cochrane then defends Singer's account both against those presenting arguments in defence of speciesism, and against critics (such as R. G. Frey) who maintain that animals do not have interests. He then considers utilitarian critics of Singer, who argue that meat-eating maximises utility, even when animal interests are taken into account. This leads to the criticism that judging the best consequences is an extremely difficult task for political communities, but Cochrane concludes that a utilitarian consensus does at least support the abolition of factory farming. Finally, he addresses critics who argue that Singer's position offers insufficient protection for animals. Martha Nussbaum's argument that animals can suffer unfelt harms is considered, as is Tom Regan's criticism that, under Singer's account, animals are protected <b>only</b> <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> their protection maximises welfare, rather than in their own right.|$|E
