Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all {{men and women are}} created equal. For <b>our</b> <b>daughters</b> and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For <b>our</b> <b>daughters</b> and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Pythia Peay first {{argued for}} the {{existence}} of a fourth wave of feminism, combining justice with religious spirituality. According to Jennifer Baumgardner in 2011, a fourth wave, incorporating online resources such as social media, may have begun in 2008, inspired partly by Take <b>Our</b> <b>Daughters</b> to Work Days. This fourth wave in turn has inspired or been associated with: the Doula Project for children's services; post-abortion talk lines; pursuit of reproductive justice; plus-size fashion support; transgenderism support; male feminism; sex work acceptance; and developing media including Feministing, Racialicious, blogs, and Twitter campaigns.|$|E

500|$|Both Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters {{inspired}} them {{to conceive}} Kim as [...] "a character that <b>our</b> <b>daughters</b> and other girls {{can look up}} to", all-the-while aware of the [...] "ancient truism" [...] that while girls seldom hesitate to watch a show about a male lead, boys are usually less {{willing to do the}} opposite. Thus, the writers decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's competent action hero and Ron her [...] "fumbling" [...] sidekick, longing to provide young girls with [...] "a character that they can pretend to be" [...] similar to their own childhood heroes, fictional spy James Bond and Captain Kirk from Star Trek. According to McCorkle, Kim has much more in common with James Bond than comic book superheroes. The recurring character Monique was created because Schooley and McCorkle felt that it would be more realistic if Kim had a female best friend in addition to Ron.|$|E

Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic reviewed [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] as [...] "peerless in creating an atmosphere of burdening expectations, and just by listening to it you know that Mulan {{is on the verge}} of single-handedly chopping down ten generations' worth of family tree honor." [...] Soundtrack.Net's Dan Goldwasser described [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] as a [...] "nice" [...] song but felt that it was more appropriate for a Broadway musical than an animated film. Jamie Meun of Medium appreciated the song for [...] "expos sexism instead of promoting it" [...] and [...] "expos the ridiculous expectations of women in China during the Han Dynasty." [...] Packaging Girlhood: Rescuing <b>Our</b> <b>Daughters</b> from Marketers' Schemes Sharon Lamb was concerned that younger listeners would not understand the irony intended by the song's lyrics about women and take them seriously. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin disagreed with Lamb, writing, [...] "Even the tiniest viewers should see how wrongly and repressively she is being treated." ...|$|E

500|$|Yuna's {{design change}} in Final Fantasy X-2 {{received}} a mixed reception. Rob Wright of Tom's Hardware included her among the 50 greatest female characters in video game history. Jeremy Dunham of IGN praised the clothing designs, combining [...] "proven and recognizable Final Fantasy styles" [...] with a [...] "revealing neo-modern fashion sense", referencing her warrior costume as a stand-out, and {{also said that}} English voice actress Hedy Burress' portrayal seemed more comfortable {{as opposed to the}} previous game. Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot praised Burress' voice acting, saying that it brought her fully to life in accordance with the other changes in the character. The book Packaging Girlhood: Rescuing <b>Our</b> <b>Daughters</b> from Marketers' Schemes described Yuna's appearance as being a [...] "sexy MTV video star", adding that it is a [...] "lesson to girls that being brave, strong, and ready to fight can only last so long - the next adventure is fashion, boyfriends, and sex." [...] GameSpy's Raymond [...] "Psylancer" [...] Padilla called her [...] "the video-game vixen of my dreams." [...] Christian Nutt, also of GameSpy, described Burress' portrayal of Yuna in X-2 as superb. Various publications compared Yuna to other fictional characters, including the Charlie's Angelss Natalie Cook as portrayed by Cameron Diaz; and Tomb Raider star Lara Croft, due to her attire and gun-wielding skills. In 2008, GameDaily listed the Final Fantasy X-2 incarnation of Yuna {{as one of the top}} 50 hottest video game women, praising her revealing outfit as well as her alternate costumes. That same year, she was ranked as the tenth on top Final Fantasy character by IGN, commenting that while her original appearance made her [...] "fine eye-candy" [...] and her sending scene was one of the best works by the CG studio Square Visual Works, it was the sequel that gave her more confidence and attitude, as well as [...] "a gratuitously exploitative costume that ranks among the series' finest bits of fanboy-baiting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mad Men has {{encouraged}} much discussion about gender. The show presents a subculture in which men, {{many of whom}} are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages. Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that [...] "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt {{with each other and with}} power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far back in our past as we would like to think. <b>Our</b> <b>daughters</b> continually get the messages that power still comes through powerful men. And unfortunately being pretty is still a quality that can get you on the ladder—though it still won't take you to the top." ...|$|E

2500|$|Then {{the elders}} of the {{congregation}} said, [...] "What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?" [...] And they said, [...] "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. However, we cannot give them wives from <b>our</b> <b>daughters,</b> {{for the children of}} Israel have sworn an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.'" [...] Then they said, [...] "In fact, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, {{on the east side of}} the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah." [...] Therefore, they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, [...] "Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, 'Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.'" [...] And the children of Benjamin did so (on Tu B'Av); they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.|$|E
2500|$|Bella has {{received}} a generally negative reception from critics. Publishers Weekly states that, after her transformation into a vampire, [...] "it's almost impossible to identify with her" [...] in Breaking Dawn. Lilah Lohr of the Chicago Tribune compares Bella's character {{to the story of}} the Quileute wolves and describes it as [...] "less satisfying." [...] During Twilight, Kirkus Reviews stated that [...] "Bella's appeal is based on magic rather than character", but that her and Edward's [...] "portrayal of dangerous lovers hits the spot". In the review of New Moon, Kirkus Reviews said that Bella's personality was [...] "flat and obsessive". Laura Miller of salon.com said, in regards to Edward and Bella, [...] "neither of them has much personality to speak of." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Reese, in her review of Breaking Dawn noted, in regard to Bella, [...] "You may wish she had loftier goals and a mind of her own, but these are fairy tales, and as a steadfast lover in the Disney Princess mold, Bella has a certain saccharine appeal", and that during Bella's pregnancy [...] "she is not only hard to identify with but positively horrifying, especially while guzzling human blood to nourish the infant." [...] Washington Post journalist Elizabeth Hand noted how Bella was often described as breakable and that [...] "Edward's habit of constantly pulling her onto his lap or having her ride on his back further emphasize her childlike qualities", continuing to write that [...] "the overall effect is a weird infantilization that has repellent overtones to an adult reader and hardly seems like an admirable model to foist upon <b>our</b> <b>daughters</b> (or sons)." [...] Gina Dalfonzo, in an article posted on the National Review website, calls Bella [...] "self-deprecating" [...] before her transformation into a vampire, and afterwards she is [...] "insufferably vain". Dalfonzo also states that Bella gets what she wants and discovers her worth [...] "by giving up her identity and throwing away nearly everything in life that matters." [...] Bella Swan was often compared to Katniss Everdeen on the publication of The Hunger Games.|$|E
2500|$|So it was, on {{the next}} morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The {{children}} of Israel said, [...] "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did {{not come up with}} the assembly to the Lord?" [...] For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, [...] "He shall surely be put to death." [...] And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, [...] "One tribe is cut off from Israel today. What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them <b>our</b> <b>daughters</b> as wives?" [...] And they said, [...] "What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?" [...] And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there. So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, [...] "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children. And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately." [...] So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them. And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel.|$|E
60|$|For {{the most}} part this was true.

2500|$|In 1950 chief rabbis Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog and Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel {{issued a}} ruling forbidding women {{to join the}} IDF. In the 1980s Rabbi Meir Kahane ardently opposed women serving in the IDF, advocating {{national}} service instead. [...] As of 2014 David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef of the Chief Rabbinate were opposed to religious women serving in the IDF, as was Safed Chief Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu. However, Finance Minister Yair Lapid opposes this position and wants Lau and Yosef {{to be removed from}} the Chief Rabbinate because of it. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett stated [...] "I believe that all girls should do either IDF service or national service. With that, the attack on the rabbis for their traditional position is an unacceptable attack on the respect due them." [...] Education Minister Shai Piron said he backs the chief rabbis' injunction against observant women enlisting in the IDF. In 2003 Piron had said, “I don’t know of any rabbis that would allow [...] to serve in the army. The halachic authorities saw the reality from a joint education and spiritual perspective, this view led them to their halachic conclusion… The problem with IDF service is the general atmosphere that does not allow for a life without [...] pitfalls.” MK Elazar Stern said, [...] "A week ago the Chief Rabbis announced that a female serving in the IDF results in an aveira similar to Chilul Shabbos. This is tantamount to issuing a call to women, at least those who view themselves as religious, not to serve in the IDF...I served in the IDF for a few years and I state the military cannot function without women unless we lengthen the service of males to 4.5 years. The price that we will pay by the call of the Chief Rabbinate Council that females do not enlist is not that of <b>our</b> <b>daughters,</b> but the daughters of these very same rabbis who don't serve." [...] Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the Rabbi of the city of Efrat, supports women's enlistment in the IDF. Also, in 2014 the Beit Hillel association of national-religious rabbis issued a ruling in Jewish law stating that women are allowed to serve in the IDF; however, Rabbi Shlomo Aviner claimed that Beit Hillel did not have the authority to make such a ruling.|$|E
