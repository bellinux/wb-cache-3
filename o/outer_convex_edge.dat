40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{study of the}} properties of the stellar velocity distribution in stellar discs which have developed a saturated, two-armed spiral structure. We follow the growth of the spiral structure deeply into the non-linear regime by solving the Boltzmann moment equations up to second order. By adopting the thin-disc approximation, we restrict our study of the stellar velocity distribution to the plane of the stellar disc. We find that the <b>outer</b> (<b>convex)</b> <b>edges</b> of stellar spiral arms are characterized by peculiar properties of the stellar velocity ellipsoids, which make them distinct from most other galactic regions. In particular, the ratio σ 1 : σ 2 of the smallest versus largest principal axes of the stellar velocity ellipsoid can become abnormally small (as compared {{to the rest of the}} disc) near the outer edges of spiral arms. Moreover, the epicycle approximation fails to reproduce the ratio σφφ: σrr of the tangential versus radial velocity dispersions in these regions. These peculiar properties of the stellar velocity distribution are caused by large-scale non-circular motions of stars, which in turn are triggered by the non-axisymmetric gravitational field of stellar spiral arms...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} low doses of cytochalasin B (2 micrograms/ml) and cytochalasin D (0. 2 microgram/ml) on the {{spreading}} of normal mouse fibroblasts in culture were investigated {{to find out}} which components of cell-substrate interactions are most sensitive to alterations of the state of actin cytoskeleton. Cytochalasin B disorganized the cortical layer of actin microfilaments and caused partial or complete disappearance of microfilament bundles; focal contacts with the substrate seen by interference-reflection microscopy also disappeared. Diffuse close contacts were apparently insensitive to cytochalasin B. Low doses of cytochalasin B did not inhibit the outgrowth and maintenance of lamellas at the cell periphery. However, in contrast to controls, these lamellas had no distal zones with <b>convex</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edges</b> and ruffles at the upper surfaces. The disappearance of these ruffling active edges was accompanied by loss of the ability to clear the surface of the lamellas from the concanavalin A receptors crosslinked by the corresponding ligand. The effects of cytochalasin D were similar to those of cytochalasin B. Thus, ruffling active edges and focal contacts can be regarded as specialized parts of lamellas with increased sensitivity to cytochalasins; the presence of ruffling active edges is essential for the initiation of centripetal movement of the patches of crosslinked surface receptors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} optimization {{of quality}} measures over first order Delaunay triangulations. Unlike most previous work, our measures relate to edge-adjacent or vertex-adjacent triangles instead of only to single triangles. We give efficient algorithms to optimize certain measures, including measures {{related to the}} area ratio of adjacent triangles, angle between outward normals of adjacent triangles (for polyhedral terrains), and number of convex vertices. Some other measures are shown to be NP-hard. These include maximum vertex degree, number of <b>convex</b> <b>edges,</b> and number of mixed vertices. For the latter two measures we provide, for any constant ε> 0, factor (1 −ε) approximation algorithms that run in 2 O(1 /ε) ⋅n and 2 O(1 /ε 2) ⋅n time (when the Delaunay triangulation is given). For minimizing the maximum vertex degree, the NP-hardness proof provides an inapproximability result. Our results are presented for the class of first order Delaunay triangulations, but also apply to triangulations where for every triangle at least two edges are fixed. The approximation result on maximizing the number of <b>convex</b> <b>edges</b> is also extended to k-th order Delaunay triangulations...|$|R

The character of a box girder is to resist torsional twisting, so a composite face built up of them is also good at resisting crumpling.|$|R

30|$|One more {{interesting}} question which arises {{here is that}} why there is no undercutting observed at the concave corner, even though these corners are also formed by the intersection of two { 111 } planes. If we closely observe the concave and convex corners (Figure  3), we can easily notice {{the difference in the}} bond structure at the intersecting edge. The silicon atoms belonging to a <b>convex</b> <b>edge</b> consist of dangling bonds (Figure  3 (d)), while the atoms belonging to the concave corner (Figure  3 (c)) do not contain any dangling bond (i.e. all the bonds are engaged). The reason behind this is that the crystallographic structure of silicon arranges the atoms at the two types of corners (i.e. convex and concave) {{in such a way that}} the <b>convex</b> <b>edged</b> silicon atoms have one dangling bond, while the concave cornered silicon atoms have all their bonds engaged and thus there is no dangling bond. The absence of the dangling bond at the concave corner restricts undercutting, however the etching occurs parallel to the { 111 } planes. This is a very simple way of explaining why a convex corner is more vulnerable to undercutting whereas there is no-undercutting at the concave corner.|$|R
