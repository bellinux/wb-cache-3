In addition, the secretion of two kinds of cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), from <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> was observed. Trophozoites of pathogenic A. culbertsoni made contact with <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> and produced digipodia. TEM revealed that <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> cocultured with amoebic trophozoites underwent a necrotic process, accompanied by lysis of the cell membrane. TEM of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> cocultured with amoebic lysate showed that the membranes of the small cytoplasmic vacuoles {{as well as the}} cell membrane were lysed. The amounts of TNF-α secreted from <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> cocultured with A. culbertsoni trophozoites or lysate increased at 6 h of incubation.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{regulation}} of microglial activation after excitotoxic injury in organotypic hippocampal brain tissue (OHSCs). During neuroinflammation, activated <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> migrate towards sites of neuronal injury, phagocytose damaged cells and produce large amounts of oxygen free radicals and toxic cytokines, which might contribute to severe secondary neuronal damage and cell death and account {{for most of the}} loss of brain function. In response to cellular damage by oxygen free radicals or excitotoxicity, a rapid and strong activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which catalyses the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) (PARP) attached to protein acceptors, occurs in damaged cells. To test the function of PARP in activated <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> we first cloned an antisense PARP- 1 pcDNA 3. 1 vector (asPARP) and transfected BV- 2 <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> with it. Stably transfected cells were used in studies with NMDA-damaged OHSCs, enabling observation of the effects of neuronal <b>cell</b> death and <b>microglial</b> invasion. Whereas control-vector-transfected <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> contributed to severe secondary damage, this secondary damage was completely abolished when <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> lacked PARP- 1. Moreover, the invasion of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> into sites of neuronal damage demonstrated that control-vector-transfected <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> were capable of strongly migrating to sites of neurodegeneration, whereas no site-specific migration was detected in hippocampal brain tissue incubated with asPARP- 1 <b>microglial</b> <b>cells.</b> Thereafter, studies were focused on revealing the pathway which links PARP- 1 to the functional feature of site-specific migration towards regions of neuronal injury. FACS analysis showed a greatly decreased expression pattern of the ß 2 -Integrin CD 11 a in asPARP- 1 <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> in comparison to control-vector-transfected cells, whereas the expression of other adhesion molecules such as CD 11 b, CD 18 and ICAM- 1 remained unchanged. The next step was the cloning of an anti-sense CD 11 a pcDNA 3. 1 (+) vector (asCD 11 a) and establishment of a stably transfected <b>microglial</b> <b>cell</b> line. These <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> were transferred to the surface of NMDA-damaged OHSCs in which microglial invasion was being investigated. <b>Microglial</b> <b>cells</b> transfected with the asCD 11 a vector were not capable of migrating specifically, whereas controlvector- transfected <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> migrated strongly into regions of neuronal injury. Immunoblot analysis of isolated nuclei and inhibition of PARP by 3 -ABA showed expressed but inhibited PARP- 1 and a decreased CD 11 a expression, as determined by FACS analysis. The results of the Northern blot analysis indicate that Cd 11 a mRNA expression is partly regulated transcriptionally by a cooperative action of PARP and NF-&# 954;B. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments involving the HMG- 1 (Y) protein, a major interaction protein of poly(ADP-ribosyl) ated PARP- 1, showed a direct proteinprotein interaction of HMG- 1 (Y) with the PARP- 1 -NF-&# 954;B-complex through poly(ADP-ribosyl) ated PARP in LPS-activated cells but not in resting <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> or <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> with inhibited PARP- 1. Further independent experiments were performed with primary <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> transiently transfected with the antisense pcDNA 3. 1 (+) vector using a modified polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer method. Transfer of control-vector-transfected primary <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> onto NMDAdamaged OHSCs contributed to secondary damage. After transfer of asPARP- 1 -transfected <b>microglial</b> <b>cells,</b> this secondary damage was completely abolished. Investigations into the capacity of asPARP- 1 cells to migrate towards regions of neuronal injury demonstrated that control-vector-transfected primary micoglial cells migrated specifically into sites of neuronal injury in contrast to asPARP- 1 - transfected primary <b>microglial</b> <b>cells,</b> which were not capable of a site-specific migration, confirming the tendency of the experiments with the asPARP- 1 -transfected BV- 2 cell line. In conclusion, specific downregulation of PARP in <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> was capable of completely protecting neurons in living organotypic brain tissue from secondary damage via an intracellular PARP- 1 dependent pathway involved in microglial activation and the expression of the migrationrelevant adhesion molecule CD 11 a. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of PARP in microglial activation and migration, and render PARP a potential therapeutic target for protecting neurons from secondary damage...|$|R

The cellular mechanism of tangential migration of microglia has been described in the quail retina but the mechanism of their radial migration has not been studied. In this work, we clarify some aspects of this mechanism by analyzing morphological features of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> at different steps of their radial migration in the quail retina. <b>Microglial</b> <b>cells</b> migrate in the vitreal half of the retina by successive jumps from the vitreal border to progressively more scleral levels located at the vitreal border, intermediate regions, and scleral border of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The cellular mechanism used for each jump consists of the emission of a leading thin radial process that ramifies at a more scleral level before retraction of {{the rear of the}} cell. Hence, radial migration and ramification of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> are simultaneous events. Once at the scleral border of the IPL, <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> migrate through the inner nuclear layer to the outer plexiform layer by another mechanism: they retract cell processes, become round, and squeeze through neuronal bodies. <b>Microglial</b> <b>cells</b> use radial processes of s-lamininexpressing Müller cells as substratum for radial migration. Levels where <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> stop and ramify at each jump are always interfaces between retinal strata with strong tenascin immunostaining and strata showing weak or no tenascin immunoreactivity. When <b>microglial</b> <b>cell</b> radial migration ends, tenascin immunostaining is no longer present in the retina. These findings suggest that tenascin plays a role in the stopping and ramification of radially migrating <b>microglial</b> <b>cells.</b> © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

With the silver stain, amoeboid <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> in the supraventricular corpus callosum appeared at around E 17 and their number increased dramatically to more than 20 times just before birth. Most of the cells were round with projecting fine cytoplasmic processes. The silver-stained preparations also showed that the supraventricular region was vascularised around E 13. With the same method, {{it has been shown}} that islands, with an admixture of erythroblasts and amoeboid <b>microglial</b> <b>cells,</b> were a common feature in the embryonic brains. Electron microscopic study confirmed the existence of amoeboid <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> in E 15 -E 18 rats.

In the present study, we established primary astrocyte-microglial cell co-cultures to investigate interactions of S. suis with glial cells.

In this study, we show that microglia stressed by exposure to sodium arsenite or Aβ(1 – 42) peptides or fibrils form extensive stress granules (SGs) to which the tyrosine kinase, SYK, is recruited. SYK enhances the formation of SGs, is active within the resulting SGs and stimulates the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are toxic to neuronal cells.

In addition to inhibiting <b>microglial</b> <b>cell</b> migration, activation of receptors by afobazole decreased intracellular calcium eleva-tion produced by focal application of ATP and UTP in isolated <b>microglial</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, afobazole blocked membrane currents elicited by rapid application of ATP in <b>microglial</b> <b>cells.</b> Taken together, our data indicate that afobazole inhibits micro-glial response to P 2 Y and P 2 X purinergic receptor activation by functioning as a pan-selective -receptor agonist. In addition to modulating response to purinergic receptor activation, the ef-fects of afobazole on microglial survival during in vitro ischemia were assessed. Application of afobazole during in vitro isch-emia decreased <b>microglial</b> <b>cell</b> death during the ischemic epi-sode and after a 24 -h recovery period. Moreover, when afoba-zole was only applied after the ischemic episode, a significant enhancement in cell survival was still observed. Thus, afoba-zole acts via receptors to decrease microglial response to ATP and provides cytoprotection during and after ischemia...|$|R
40|$|Closed accessCommon {{symptoms}} of different neurodegenerative diseases start {{to develop in}} the second half of the human life. Several of these diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are accompanied by severe disturbances of protein metabolism and homeostasis in the brain. Because <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> are, to some extent, responsible for the maintenance of this homeostasis, age-related functional changes of the microglia are important. We established, therefore, the preparation of cultures of primary <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from adult animals in comparison to the widely used standard model, primary <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from newborn animals. In addition, we investigated changes in the activation and in the protein homeostasis within these cells. The protein turn-over seems to be significantly impaired in <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from adult animals and this seems to be accompanied by a decline in proteasomal function, but not in the protease content. We were also able to demonstrate higher cell surface molecule expression and a higher basal NO release of microglia isolated from adult animals in comparison to the microglia isolated from newborn rats; however, the PMA stimulated oxidative burst was abolished completely in cells from adult animals. Microglia from adult animals were also not able to upregulate their protein metabolism after activation. From these investigations it was concluded that <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> from adult animals have significantly different metabolic properties in comparison to the widely used <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> from newborn animals...|$|R

Recently, we isolated a transmissible cytotoxic activity (TCA) from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with brain ischemia. Such a TCA, associated {{with one or more}} protein(s) that supposedly had undergone in vivo misfolding, causes apoptosis in vitro in different <b>cell</b> lines, including <b>microglial</b> <b>cells.</b> The TCA producing cells and the potential in vivo role of such cytotoxic activity remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the in vitro effects of TCA on <b>microglial</b> <b>cell</b> immune functions. 2. The murine <b>microglial</b> <b>cell</b> line RR 4 was exposed to TCA, and then its response was evaluated as: (a) phagocytosis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans; (b) secretory pattern; and (c) levels of p 38 phosphorylation. 3. Unlike mock-treated controls, <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to TCA showed an increase in phagocytic activity. Unexpectedly, their capability to kill the ingested fungi significantly diminished. Moreover, TCA-treated cells produced amounts of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 -alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and nitric oxide significantly higher than mock-treated cells. Finally, phosphorylation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was detected in TCA-treated but not in mock-treated controls as early as 30 min after treatment. 4. Overall, these results indicate that TCA causes a rapid molecular response in <b>microglial</b> <b>cells,</b> by the time, leading to an intriguing effector and secretory dysfunction...|$|R

Virus release by ramified <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from subclinically infected animals was detectable in cell-free tissue culture supernatant only by reverse transcription and nested PCR of gag-specific RNA sequences and not by virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity. In contrast, cocultivation of in vivo-infected <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> with mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) regularly allows detection of high virus yields in cell-free tissue culture fluid. Besides uptake and multiplication of microglia-derived virus in PBMC, release of virus from microglia is stimulated by cell contact with PBMC.

In ageing, proteolytic effectiveness is diminished, while <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> are chronically activated and lose the oxidative burst ability, possibly supporting a 'vicious circle' of macrophage-induced neurodegeneration. © W.

40|$|Using {{immunocytochemistry}} with monoclonal antibodies against surface immunomolecules and Griffonia simplicifolia lectin histochemistry, the <b>microglial</b> <b>cell</b> {{reaction in}} rat brain was studied after intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> throughout the brain became apparent within hours and peaked at 8 - 24 h following administration of 1, 2. 5 and 5 mg/kg LPS. High doses of LPS (2. 5 and 5 mg/kg) induced a morphological transition of resting ramified microglia to round, macrophage-like {{cells in the}} anterior hypothalamus, thalamus and the brainstem. After injection of 1 mg/kg LPS, this morphological transition was only detected in the brainstem. <b>Microglial</b> <b>cell</b> reactivity gradually returned to control levels within 7 days after LPS administration. Furthermore, LPS induced enhanced expression of MHC class II by <b>microglial</b> <b>cells.</b> Maximal up-regulation of MHC class II Ia-antigen was found 3 days following injection of LPS, {{and only a few}} highly Ia immunoreactive cells were detectable 7 days following injection of LPS. Despite the presence of highly activated <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> in the rat brain, no signs of tissue damage were observed at any time point after injection of LPS examined. In addition to the activation of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells,</b> intravenous injection of LPS induced accumulations of macrophages in blood vessels of the choroid plexus and the brain, but no disruption of vessels with subsequent invasion of parenchyma by blood macrophages was detected.

40|$|<b>Microglial</b> <b>cells</b> in {{the brains}} of Alzheimer’s {{patients}} are recruited to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and exhibit an activated phenotype, but are defective for plaque removal by phagocytosis. To explore the molecular basis for these phenomena, I hypothesized that defects in {{the functions of the}} protein-tyrosine kinase SYK, which is important both for macrophage activation and phagocytosis, might underlie much of this pathology. Recent evidence from our lab indicates that SYK can associate with stress granules, ribonucleoprotein particles that form in stressed cells and contain inactive translation initiation complexes. I found that <b>microglial</b> <b>cell</b> lines and primary mouse brain microglia, when stressed by exposure to sodium arsenite or Aβ(1 - 42) peptides or fibrils, form extensive stress granules to which the tyrosine kinase, SYK, is recruited. SYK enhances the formation of stress granules as evidenced by the inhibition of stress granule formation by small molecule inhibitors, knockdown of SYK expression by shRNA and SYK haploinsufficiency in mouse <b>microglial</b> <b>cells.</b> SYK is active within the resulting stress granules where it catalyzes the phosphorylation of stress granule-associated proteins on tyrosine. SYK-dependent stress granule formation stimulates the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. These are toxic to neuronal cells as demonstrated by a co-culture assay using stressed <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> and HT 22 neuronal cells. The ability of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> to phagocytose E. coli is blocked by SYK inhibitors. The sequestration of SYK into stress granules inhibits the ability of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> to phagocytose either E. coli or Aβ fibrils. <b>Microglial</b> <b>cells</b> from aged mice are more susceptible to the formation of stress granules than are cells from young animals. Stress granules containing SYK and phosphotyrosine are prevalent in {{the brains of}} patients with severe Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that the sequestration of SYK into stress granules is part of the pathology of the disease. Phagocytic activity can be restored to stressed <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> by treatment with IgG independent of the epitope specificity, suggesting a mechanism to explain the therapeutic efficacy of intravenous IgG. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicroglial {{cells in}} the brains of Alzheimer's {{patients}} {{are known to be}} recruited to amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques where they exhibit an activated phenotype, but are defective for plaque removal by phagocytosis. In this study, we show that microglia stressed by exposure to sodium arsenite or Aβ(1 – 42) peptides or fibrils form extensive stress granules (SGs) to which the tyrosine kinase, SYK, is recruited. SYK enhances the formation of SGs, is active within the resulting SGs and stimulates the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are toxic to neuronal cells. This sequestration of SYK inhibits the ability of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> to phagocytose Escherichia coli or Aβ fibrils.

40|$|AbstractÐSome authors {{claim that}} {{microglia}} originate from the neuroepithelium, although most {{now believe that}} <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> are of mesodermal origin, and probably belong to the monocyte/macrophage cell line. These cells must enter the developing central nervous system (CNS) from the blood stream, the ventricular space or the meninges. Afterward <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> are distributed more or less homogeneously through the entire nervous parenchyma. Stereotyped patterns of migration have been recognized during development, in which long-distance tangential migration precedes radial migration of individual <b>cells.</b> <b>Microglial</b> <b>cells</b> moving through the nervous parenchyma are ameboid microglia, which apparently di€erentiate into rami®ed microglia after reaching their de®nitive location. This {{is supported by the}} presence of cells showing intermediate features between those of ameboid and rami®ed microglia. The factors that control the invasion of the nervous parenchyma, migration within the developing CNS and di€erentiation of <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> are not well known. These phenomena apparently depend on environmental factors such as soluble or cell-surface bound molecules and components of the extracellular matrix. <b>Microglial</b> <b>cells</b> within the developing CNS are involved in clearing cell debris and withdrawing misdirected or transitory axons, and presumably support cell survival and neurite growth. # 199...|$|R

Here, we studied {{the contribution of}} <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> to vascular regression during the hyperoxic phase and to retinal neovascularization during the hypoxic phase. Methods Mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the Cx 3 cr 1 promoter labeling <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> were kept in 75 % oxygen from postnatal day 7 (P 7) to P 12. <b>Microglial</b> <b>cell</b> density was quantified at different time points and at different retinal positions in retinal flat mounts. Microglial activation {{was determined by the}} switch from ramified to amoeboid cell morphology which correlated with the switch from lectin negative to lectin positive staining of GFP positive <b>cells.</b> Results <b>Microglial</b> <b>cell</b> density was constant in the peripheral region of the retina. In the deep vascular layer of the central region, however, it declined 14 fold from P 12 to P 14 and recovered afterwards. Activated <b>microglial</b> <b>cells</b> were found in the superficial layer of the central avascular zone from P 8 to P 12 and from P 16 to P 18.
