5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season. Teams have become {{increasingly}} conservative in scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country was unusual this early in the season. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game as the site of its weekly broadcast. The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed it on the field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> of the {{scientific}} accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was {{the driving force behind}} these scientific achievements.|$|E

5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} change in the fort's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act in 1972. Up to then there had been growing awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> of the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as Fort Glanville Conservation Park. The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns first firing, one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} been {{compromised}} by the first lap pileup and were {{at the back of}} the field, Dillmann and Coletti chose to make their mandatory pit stops when the window opened at the end of the seventh lap for rear soft compound tyres. Haryanto and Abt made their stops on the next lap and Calado and Lancaster did the same on lap nine. Coletti's early pit stop resulted in him lapping faster than any other driver by two seconds. Other drivers became aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> and Nasr went into the pit lane to keep his position from Calado and Ceccon and Richelmi did the same on the eleventh lap. This placed pressure on race leader Evans who was at this point three seconds a lap slower than Ceccon. Evans made his own pit stop on lap 12 for four soft compound tyres but did not retain first place as Ceccon made up enough time to move in front of him. Evans could not keep close to Ceccon and was three seconds behind the driver after one lap and his diminishing pace hurt the delayed Bird who became the leader when Evans made his pit stop. On lap 15, De Jong made a problematic pit stop: his rear jack failed which delayed him and then crossed the yellow line at the pit lane exit twice, earning him a drive-through penalty.|$|E

5|$|Between {{these two}} systems, {{that of the}} {{political}} order predominates in the layout of Ambohimanga, and the sacredness {{of the city was}} historically more explicitly associated with its role as a political rather than an astrological center. The forbidding of foreigners from the site in the 19th century, for instance, was enacted to preserve the sanctity of the social and political order, rather than the religious order. By respecting these systems of symbolism, successive rulers sought to ensure the benediction of the ancestors, strengthen the legitimacy of their rule and ensure the protection and stability of their kingdom. However, adherence to cardinal division and symbolism of space is weaker at Ambohimanga than its embodiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> of vertical space and elevation as an indicator of rank. The site of each new compound within the royal city was selected less for its cardinal direction than for {{the extent to which it}} was located on higher ground than the compound that predated it.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E
