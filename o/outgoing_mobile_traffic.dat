40|$|A new, robust {{integrated}} priority-based cell attenuation {{model for}} dynamic cell sizing is proposed and simulated using real <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> data. The proposed model is an integration of two main components; the modified virtual community – parallel genetic algorithm (VC-PGA) cell priority selection module and the evolving {{fuzzy neural network}} (EFuNN) <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> prediction module. The VC-PGA module controls the number of cell attenuations by ordering the priority for the attenuation of all cells based {{on the level of}} mobile level of <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> within each cell. The EFuNN module predicts the traffic volume of a particular cell by extracting and inserting meaningful rules through incremental, supervised real-time learning. The EFuNN module is placed in each cell and the output, the predicted <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> volume of the particular cell, is sent to local and virtual community servers in the VC-PGA module. The VC-PGA module then assigns priorities for the size attenuation of all cells within the network, based on the predicted <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> levels from the EFuNN module at each cell. The performance of the proposed module was evaluated on five adjacent cells in Selangor, Malaysia. Real-time predicted <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> from the EFuNN structure was used to control the size of all the cells.

The proposed model is an integration of two main components; the modified VC-PGA cell priority selection model and the EFuNN <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> prediction model. The VC-PGA module aims to control the number of cell attenuations in a diverse cell interaction environment by ordering the priority for size attenuation of all cells within a network based on the level of <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> within each cell, using two priority numbers. The EFuNN module allows for a favorable cell attenuation order by predicting the <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> in advance, before congestion takes place. The EFuNN module predicts the <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> volume of a particular cell by extracting and inserting meaningful rules through incremental, supervised real-time learning.

However, existing traffic forecasting models have high complexity, making the forecasting process slow and costly. In this paper, we analyze some characteristics of <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> such as periodicity, spatial similarity and short term relativity. Based on these characteristics, we propose a Block Regression (BR) model for <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> forecasting. This model employs seasonal differentiation so as {{to take into account}} of the temporally repetitive nature of <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic.</b> One of the key features of our BR model lies in its low complexity since it constructs a single model for all base stations.

New algorithms based on intercell traffic prediction and traffic-based cell grouping {{are used to}} select the optimal set of cells for location areas (LAs). The expected intercell movement patterns of mobiles are determined by using the new intercell traffic prediction algorithm. Further, the cells are partitioned into LAs by applying the new traffic-based cell grouping algorithm where the cell pairs with higher intercell <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> are grouped into the same LA. Hence, the inter-LA <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> is decreased by increasing the intra-LA <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic.</b> Experimental results show that this cell grouping algorithm reduces the number of location updates by 27 percent to 36 percent on average compared to proximity-based cell grouping schemes.

This has {{great impact on}} privacy design in mobile ad hoc networks because mobility introduces new privacy tar-gets for the traffic sensors. In a mobile network, a node’s mo-tion pattern, traffic pattern, standing venue and route-driven packet flows, and even the dynamic network topology, all be-come new interests of the <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> sensors, bringing in new privacy challenges in addition to conventional identity privacy and message privacy. In particular, in wireless ad hoc networks mobile nodes must rely on ad hoc routing in com-munication. As the wireless medium is open to anyone within the transmission range, the baseline of the <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> sen-sors is to exploit this routing opportunity to conduct various attacks threatening the network security and privacy. Recently, the on-demand routing approach {{has been used by}} several anonymous routing schemes to prevent mobile nodes from being traced by <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> sensors[29]. In this paper we seek to compare the overhead incurred by security and anonymity operations of two recently pro-posed on-demand anonymous routing schemes, namely ANODR [28][27] (with an enhanced variant ASR [50]) and SDAR [8]. We use the standard on-demand scheme AODV [37] in the comparison to show how much overhead is paid by each anonymous on-demand scheme. Our simulation study shows that various design choices in anonymous routing trade performance with security protection. We conclude that extensive performance study is needed to evaluate the practicality of the existing and new anonymous routing schemes and their enhancements.

Monitoring city-wide <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> is however {{a complex and}} costly process that relies on dedicated probes. Some of these probes have limited precision or coverage, others gather tens of gigabytes of logs daily, which independently offer limited insights. Extracting fine-grained patterns involves expensive spatial aggregation of measurements, storage, and post-processing. In this paper, we propose a <b>mobile</b> <b>traffic</b> super-resolution technique that overcomes these problems by inferring narrowly localised traffic consumption from coarse measurements. We draw inspiration from image processing and design a deep-learning architecture tailored to mobile networking, which combines Zipper Network (ZipNet) and Generative Adversarial neural Network (GAN) models. This enables to uniquely capture spatio-temporal relations between traffic volume snapshots routinely monitored over broad coverage areas (`low-resolution') and the corresponding consumption at 0. 05 km ^ 2 level (`high-resolution') usually obtained after intensive computation. Experiments we conduct with a real-world data set demonstrate that the proposed ZipNet(-GAN) infers traffic consumption with remarkable accuracy and up to 100 × higher granularity as compared to standard probing, while outperforming existing data interpolation techniques.
