5|$|A Ghost Story for Christmas is {{a strand}} of annual British short {{television}} films originally broadcast on BBC One between 1971 and 1978, and revived in 2005 on BBC Four. With one exception, the original instalments were directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and the films were all shot on 16mm colour film. The remit behind the series {{was to provide a}} television adaptation of a classic ghost story, in line with the oral tradition <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> supernatural tales at Christmas.|$|E

5|$|In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the {{opportunity}} to play in New York. Although ecstatic, Chrisye was afraid <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> his father, who he thought would disapprove of the idea. He eventually fell ill for several months, during which time the rest of the band left for New York. After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother, his father agreed that he could drop out of college to join Gipsy. After his health improved, in mid-1973, he left with Pontjo to meet Gipsy in New York. That same year he dropped out of Trisakti.|$|E

Ike now accused Earp <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> Holliday about these conversations. Earp testified that he told Ike he had not told Holliday anything. Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> the truth in court.|$|E

5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Donna {{returns home}} to warn her mother, Sylvia (Jacqueline King), and {{grandfather}} Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) about the Doctor, having been advised {{to do so}} by Martha. Concerned about the implications <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> the truth, Donna decides against warning her mother. The Doctor investigates the ATMOS device attached to Donna's car and discovers a secondary function: the device can emit a poisonous gas. Wilfred attempts to take the car off the road, but is trapped when Staal activates all 400 million ATMOS devices installed in cars worldwide. The episode's cliffhanger depicts Donna shouting for help while the Doctor stares helplessly at a street full of cars emitting the gas, while on their ship orbiting the planet, the Sontarans prepare themselves for battle.|$|E
5|$|The wildebeests, {{also called}} gnus, are a genus of antelopes, {{scientific}} name Connochaetes. They {{belong to the}} family Bovidae, which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep and other even-toed horned ungulates. Connochaetes includes two species, both native to Africa: the black wildebeest, or white-tailed gnu (C. gnou); and the blue wildebeest, or brindled gnu (C. taurinus). Fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago, resulting in a northern and a southern species. The blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species, while the black wildebeest changed more in order to adapt to its open grassland habitat in the south. The most obvious way <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> the two species apart are the differences in their colouring {{and in the way}} their horns are oriented.|$|E
50|$|On 15 June, YPG and rebels {{captured}} {{the village of}} Shunaynah to the south <b>of</b> <b>Tell</b> Abyad, reducing ISIL control {{in the region to}} a besieged pocket just west <b>of</b> <b>Tell</b> Abyad, and a stretch of land between Ayn Issa and Al-Qartari, to the south <b>of</b> <b>Tell</b> Abyad.

5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that Starr {{has been involved}} in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor's murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant Téa, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with Téa during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that Téa's baby has died, he comes across Sam's son. An elated Téa sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows Téa to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out <b>of</b> <b>telling</b> Téa the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny's former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tomás. Todd's role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd's role in switching the babies. He is then released.|$|E
