2500|$|... "There {{were some}} strong personalities in that band, Graham especially, and very {{strongly}} self-motivated.

2500|$|Four tracks by Skunkhour {{were listed}} on the annual Triple J's Hottest 100 during the band's 10-year career: in 1995, [...] "Up to <b>Our</b> <b>Necks</b> in It" [...] reached No.55, [...] "Weightlessness" [...] reached No.93 in 1997, [...] "Home" [...] reached No.82 in 1999, and [...] "Kick in the Door" [...] reached No.83 in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Skunkhour are an Australian funk {{rock band}} that were formed in Sydney in 1991. They {{released}} four studio albums, Skunkhour (July 1993), Feed (April 1995), Chin Chin (July 1997) and The Go (May 2001) before disbanding in November 2001. Feed peaked at No.21 on the ARIA Albums Chart while Chin Chin reached No.34. Four {{of the groups}} songs, [...] "Up to <b>Our</b> <b>Necks</b> in It" [...] (1995), [...] "Weightlessness" [...] (1997), [...] "Home" [...] (1999), and [...] "Kick in the Door" [...] (2000) were listed in the annual Triple J Hottest 100. The group has reformed periodically since 2009 for occasional concerts and festival appearances.|$|E
2500|$|B– {{would have}} been more in keeping if he had abided by the faith of his forefathers. There is a fine scorn in his face, which nature meant to be of - Christians. The Hebrew spirit is strong in him, in spite of his proselytism. He cannot conquer the Shibboleth. How it breaks out, when he sings, [...] "The Children of Israel passed through the Red Sea!" [...] The auditors, for the moment, are as Egyptians to him, and he rides over <b>our</b> <b>necks</b> in triumph. There is no mistaking him. – B– has a strong {{expression}} of sense in his countenance, and it is confirmed by his singing. The foundation of his vocal excellence is use. He sings with understanding, as Kemble delivered dialogue. He would sing the Commandments, and give an appropriate character to each prohibition.|$|E

If Scragga were king his yoke upon <b>our</b> <b>neck</b> would be heavier than the yoke of Twala. If Imotu had never been slain, or if Ignosi his son had lived, {{it might have been}} otherwise; but they are both dead." ...|$|R

40|$|Is it our constitution, {{grounded}} {{as it was}} on {{fear and}} Empire dependency {{and the interests of}} the home country, that is a millstone around <b>our</b> <b>neck,</b> or is it simply that we lack the confidence and the courage {{to live up to the}} opportunities offered by this magnificent land? John Sanderson, former chief of the Australian Army and now Governor of Western Australia, considers this question in his address to the Public Law Weekend dinner last November...|$|R
2500|$|Skunkhour {{signed with}} Id/Mercury in 1994 and {{released}} two more EPs, State (May) and McSkunk (October). Del told The Canberra Times {{that as a}} rapper [...] "I soon discovered that if I wanted {{to be taken seriously}} I had to be Australian and rap using Australian words and images". A recording deal with Sony/Epic led to the band's second album, Feed, in April 1995. It was co-produced by the group with David Hemming (The Exponents). According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, it [...] "featured a more adventurous and varied sound". Feed spent 14weeks in the top50 of the ARIA Albums Chart, peaking at No.21. Two further EPs, Up to <b>Our</b> <b>Necks</b> in It (April 1995) and Sunstone (July), widened their exposure. They signed an international deal with UK label, Acid Jazz Records, which released Feed in Europe to a [...] "positive response".|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{fighting}} was {{in the north of}} Mexico, near the border with the United States. Fearful of U.S. intervention, Madero ordered his officers to call off the siege of the strategic border city of Ciudad Juárez. Villa and Pascual Orozco attacked instead, capturing the city after two days of fighting, thus winning the first Battle of Ciudad Juárez in 1911. [...] Facing a series of defeats in many places, Díaz resigned May 25, 1911, afterward going into exile. However, Madero signed the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez with the Díaz regime, which kept the same power structure, including the just defeated Federal Army. The rebel forces, including Villa, were demobilized and Madero called on the men of action to return to civilian life. Orozco and Villa demanded that hacienda land seized during the violence bringing Madero to power be distributed to revolutionary soldiers. Madero refused, saying that the government would buy the properties from their owners and then distribute them to the revolutionaries at some future date. According to a story recounted by Villa, he told Madero at a banquet in Ciudad Juárez after the victory in 1911, [...] "You, sir , have destroyed the revolution... It's simple: this bunch of dandies have made a fool of you, and this will eventually cost us <b>our</b> <b>necks,</b> yours included." [...] This proved to be the case for Madero, who was murdered during a military coup in February 1913 in a period known as the Ten Tragic Days (Decena Trágica).|$|E
2500|$|Food & Liquor {{contains}} elements of midwest hip hop and alternative hip hop. Fiasco covers {{a wide variety}} of subjects on the album. The opening track begins with Fiasco chanting the opening lines of the Qur'an in Arabic. The following track, [...] "Real", is a reflection of [...] "making music of which he doesn't have to be ashamed". [...] "Kick, Push", the album's lead single, is about a young male and his love for skateboarding. The lyrics follow the skateboarder through many stages of his life such as his childhood, finding love, marriage, and adulthood. Although the literal meaning of this song is skateboarding, the actual meaning of the song is rejection, and being criticized for doing what one loves. On [...] "The Instrumental", Fiasco addresses addiction to television. [...] "He Say She Say" [...] deals with the story of a single mother and a child lacking a father figure. [...] "The Cool" [...] follows the story of a dead gangster who rises from the grave and returns to the hood where he lived and died. With its [...] "haunting keys and strings", [...] "Hurt Me Soul" [...] deals with displacement and alienation from his neighborhood. On [...] "American Terrorist", Fiasco discusses the misconceptions of Islam in America. He also addresses the issues of racism and gun culture. The song had originally sampled a song by Chick Corea, but due to sampling issues, it was never cleared. For example, the song opens with,"We came through the storm, nooses on <b>our</b> <b>necks,</b> and a smallpox blanket to keep us warm." [...] The album concludes with Lupe reading off an extensive appreciation list of people who helped with the album.|$|E
5000|$|Much {{has been}} written {{concerning}} the meaning of [...] "head" [...] in the New Testament. The word used for [...] "head", transliterated from Greek, is kephalē—which means the anatomical head of a body. Today's English word [...] "cephalic" [...] (sə-făl'ĭk) means [...] "Of or relating to the head; or located on, in, or near the head." [...] In the New Testament, a thorough concordance search shows that the second most frequent use of [...] "head" [...] (kephalē), after [...] "the structure that connects to <b>our</b> <b>neck</b> and sits atop our bodies", is the metaphorical sense of [...] "source".|$|R
5000|$|The {{northern}} {{spotted owl}} controversy and the nationwide recession {{of the early}} 1990s brought displaced timber workers to the College, after the dire 1992 forecast of a crippling recession in which President George Bush predicted, [...] "we'll be up to <b>our</b> <b>neck</b> in owls, and every millworker {{will be out of}} a job." [...] The New York Times reported, [...] "At Lane Community College, the nation's largest center for retraining displaced woodworkers, nearly 9 of every 10 people going through the program have found new jobs, at an average wage of $9.02 an hour, about $1 an hour less than the average timber industry wage." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{had simply}} come to this, {{that we were}} to make another prisoner, perhaps, thus adding to the danger that already {{surrounded}} us, and after {{that had been done}} the chances for saving <b>our</b> own <b>necks</b> were no better.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{suppose we}} must," [...] {{returned}} the chaouse gloomily; [...] "but {{it is hard}} enough to be compelled to spend our days in strangling, thrashing, burning, beheading, flaying, and tormenting other men, without the addition of having <b>our</b> own <b>necks</b> put in jeopardy." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{declared}} goal of {{this paper}} is to fill this gap: “ [...] . cognitive systems research needs questions or challenges that define progress. The challenges are not (yet more) predictions of the future, but a guideline to what are the aims and what would constitute progress. ” – the quotation being from the project description of EUCogII, the project for the European Network for Cognitive Systems within which this formulation of the ‘challenges’ was originally developed ([URL] So, we stick out <b>our</b> <b>neck</b> and formulate the challenges for artificial cognitive systems. These challenges are articulated in terms of a definition of what a cognitive system is: a system that learns from experience and uses its acquired knowledge (both declarative and practical) in a flexible manner to achieve its own goals...|$|R

5000|$|After 1993 {{there was}} a {{revamping}} of the newspaper in line with its news broadsheet image. While the sections continued as they are, Q/A interviews with leading politicians and activists become regular, and new columns were introduced such as [...] "People and Politics", [...] "Middle East Beat", [...] "Scrapbook" [...] and later [...] "From <b>Our</b> <b>Neck</b> of the Woods" [...] (written for about one year). Two new columns [...] "Jordan Diary" [...] and [...] "Reflections" [...] were also started early 2003, written by the newly appointed assistant managing editor, Walid Kalaji Existing columns like [...] "Jordan Week" [...] and [...] "Business Chronicle" [...] were revamped. New features become regular, {{and there was more}} variety, tackling issues that are not usually found in mainstream newspapers. [...] "Press Cocktail" [...] was another column that began in 1994, dealing with issues from the Arabic weekly press. Like all columns in The Star it had a satirical feel that increased popularity.|$|R

5000|$|This {{chapter is}} {{dedicated}} to air transport. Wańkowicz writes that National Meteorological Institute (Państwowy Instytut Meteorologiczny) has 160 co-workers, scattered across Poland. They make weather reports, updated every few hours, reporting them by telegraph or telephone to the central office in Warsaw: [...] "Our Baltic Sea shore makes only 2.5% of our borderline. But nobody will smother us by <b>our</b> <b>neck,</b> when there are wings in our arms". (pages 359 - 368) First Polish long-distance international flight took place in 1926, when Captain Bolesław Orliński, together with his mechanic, Leon Kubiak, flew from Warsaw to Tokyo, and back. In February 1927, Tadeusz Karpiński asked for permission to fly over the Atlantic, but did not receive it. The 1932 Challenge International de Tourisme was won by Franciszek Żwirko and Stanisław Wigura, both of whom {{died in a plane}} crash in the same year. Three weeks after their death, Tadeusz Karpiński flies 14,000 kilometers in a Lublin R-X plane from Warsaw to Palestine, through Syria, Persia, Afghanistan and Iraq. In 1934, Joe and Ben Adamowicz flew over the Atlantic.|$|R
