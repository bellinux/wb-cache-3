5|$|NASA {{reported}} that the Mars Reconnaissance <b>Orbiter,</b> {{as well as the}} Mars Odyssey <b>Orbiter</b> and MAVEN <b>orbiter</b> had a chance to study the Comet Siding Spring flyby on October 19, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Europa <b>Orbiter</b> — Its {{objective}} {{would be}} to characterize {{the extent of the}} ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, magnetometer, Langmuir probe, and a mapping camera. The Europa <b>Orbiter</b> received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This <b>orbiter</b> featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surface.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{proposed}} for a launch in 2020, the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA proposal for exploration of Jupiter's moons. In February 2009 {{it was announced}} that ESA/NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. ESA's contribution still faced funding competition from other ESA projects. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa <b>Orbiter,</b> the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede <b>Orbiter,</b> and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric <b>Orbiter.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{all of the}} <b>orbiters</b> were {{externally}} practically identical, {{they had}} minor differences in their interiors. New equipment for the <b>Orbiters</b> was installed {{in the same order}} that they underwent maintenance work, and the newer <b>orbiters</b> were constructed by Rockwell International, under NASA supervision, with some more advanced, lighter in weight, structural elements. Thus, the newer <b>orbiters</b> (Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour) had slightly more cargo capacity than Columbia or Challenger.|$|R
50|$|The Viking <b>Orbiters</b> {{discovered}} {{much about}} water on Mars. Branched streams, studied by the <b>Orbiters</b> {{in the southern}} hemisphere, suggested that rain once fell.|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{measure the}} orientation error of the ARID end-frame {{as well as}} linear displacements in the <b>Orbiter's</b> y- and z-axes. In each experiment {{the position of the}} ARID on the trolley is fixed and the manipulator extends and retracts along the <b>Orbiter's</b> y-axis. A sensor platform consisting of four sonars arranged in a '+' pattern measures the platform pitch about the <b>Orbiter's</b> y-axis (angle b) and yaw about the <b>Orbiter's</b> x-axis (angle alpha). Corroborating measurements of the yaw error were performed using a carpenter's level to keep the platform perpendicular to the gravity vector at each ARID pose being measured...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Jupiter Europa <b>Orbiter</b> led by NASA and the Jupiter Ganymede <b>Orbiter</b> {{led by the}} ESA were {{proposed}} together as an Outer Planet Flagship Mission to Jupiter's icy moons called Europa Jupiter System Mission, with a planned launch in 2020. In 2009 it was given priority over Titan Saturn System Mission. At that time, there was competition from other proposals. Japan proposed Jupiter Magnetospheric <b>Orbiter.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of two {{missions}} {{considered for}} the 2003 Mars launch window, the MRO proposal lost against {{what became known as}} the Mars Exploration Rovers. The <b>orbiter</b> mission was rescheduled for launch in 2005, and NASA announced its final name, Mars Reconnaissance <b>Orbiter,</b> on October 26, 2000.|$|E
5|$|The European Space Agency, in {{collaboration}} with Roscosmos, launched the ExoMars Trace Gas <b>Orbiter</b> and Schiaparelli lander on March 14, 2016. While the Trace Gas <b>Orbiter</b> successfully entered Mars orbit on October 19, 2016, Schiaparelli crashed during its landing attempt.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{refinements}} to the <b>orbiter's</b> {{thermal protection}} system and other enhancements, Columbia would never weigh as little unloaded {{as the other}} <b>orbiters</b> in the fleet. The next-oldest shuttle, Challenger, was also relatively heavy, although [...] lighter than Columbia.|$|R

50|$|To {{extend the}} {{duration}} that <b>orbiters</b> could stay docked at the ISS, the Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS) was installed. The SSPTS allowed these <b>orbiters</b> to use power {{provided by the}} ISS to preserve their consumables. The SSPTS was first used successfully on STS-118.|$|R
5|$|The Mars <b>Orbiter</b> Mission by India {{is searching}} for methane in the atmosphere, while the ExoMars Trace Gas <b>Orbiter,</b> {{launched}} in 2016, would further study the methane {{as well as its}} decomposition products, such as formaldehyde and methanol.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea {{was photographed}} in 1979 by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, and later, in more detail, by the Galileo <b>orbiter</b> in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa <b>Orbiter</b> was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining {{the presence or absence of}} a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons <b>Orbiter),</b> which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa <b>Orbiter</b> mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E
50|$|DragonScions can evolve to Slayers, <b>Orbiters</b> and Summoners.|$|R
50|$|The first {{artificial}} satellites in areocentric {{orbit and}} the first <b>orbiters</b> of another celestial body (other than the Moon) were the U.S. Mariner 9 probe and Soviet Mars 2 and Mars 3 <b>orbiters</b> in 1971, 14 November and 27 November respectively. Later they were followed by many probes.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>orbiters</b> were {{protected}} by Thermal Protection System (TPS) materials (developed by Rockwell Space Systems) inside and out, from the <b>Orbiter's</b> outer surface to the payload bay. [...] The TPS protected {{it from the}} cold soak of −121 C in space to the 1649 C heat of re-entry.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter Icy Moons <b>Orbiter</b> (JIMO) was a {{partially}} developed fission-powered spacecraft with ion thrusters that was cancelled in 2006. It {{was part of}} Project Prometheus. The Europa Lander Mission proposed a small nuclear-powered Europa lander for JIMO. It would travel with the <b>orbiter,</b> which would also function as a communication relay to Earth.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 2014, Mars <b>Orbiter</b> Mission (MOM), {{launched}} by the Indian Space Research Organisation, reached Mars orbit. ISRO launched MOM on November 5, 2013, {{with the aim of}} analyzing the Martian atmosphere and topography. The Mars <b>Orbiter</b> Mission used a Hohmann transfer orbit to escape Earth's gravitational influence and catapult into a nine-month-long voyage to Mars. The mission is the first successful Asian interplanetary mission.|$|E
5|$|The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) had a {{proposed}} launch date in 2020, {{and was a}} joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter's moons including Ganymede. In February 2009 {{it was announced that}} ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa <b>Orbiter,</b> the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede <b>Orbiter,</b> and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric <b>Orbiter.</b> ESA's contribution faced funding competition from other ESA projects, but on 2 May 2012 the European part of the mission, renamed Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), obtained a L1 launch slot in 2022 with an Ariane 5 in the ESA's Cosmic Vision science programme. The spacecraft will orbit Ganymede and conduct multiple flyby investigations of Callisto and Europa.|$|E

5|$|The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA {{proposal}} for exploration of Jupiter and its moons. In February 2009 {{it was announced}} that both space agencies had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. The proposal included a launch date of around 2020 and consists of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa <b>Orbiter,</b> and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede <b>Orbiter.</b> ESA's contribution had encountered funding competition from other ESA projects. However, the Jupiter Europa <b>Orbiter</b> (JEO), NASA's contribution, was considered by the Planetary Decadal Survey to be too expensive. The survey supported a cheaper alternative to JEO.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>orbiter,</b> Enterprise, {{was built}} solely for {{atmospheric}} flight tests {{and had no}} orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Challenger and Columbia were destroyed in mission accidents in 1986 and 2003 respectively, killing a total of fourteen astronauts. A fifth operational <b>orbiter,</b> Endeavour, was built in 1991 to replace Challenger. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of STS-135 by Atlantis on 21 July 2011.|$|E
