5|$|In 1946, {{the last}} {{resident}} of Ashton Court Dame Esme Smyth, died. After the house became derelict, {{it was taken}} over by the City in 1959. Restoration has been an <b>ongoing</b> <b>process</b> since then, but even after extensive investment by both the council and from Heritage Lottery Fund grants, presently only {{about a quarter of the}} building is occupied or usable. The available facilities of the house are rented out for business conferences, parties and weddings. In 2013 a fire damaged the northern wing. It was contained by Avon Fire and Rescue Service, otherwise the rest of the building would have been at risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the <b>ongoing</b> <b>process</b> of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E

5|$|Identified world zinc {{resources}} total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, {{with the}} largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) {{at the time of}} determination. Since exploration and mine development is an <b>ongoing</b> <b>process,</b> the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.|$|E

This is done through interviews and observations of three inter-religious groups meetings during 2010 and 2011. The collaboration between the inter-religious groups and the local authorities were initiated as a result of perceived problems of integration in the society and aims to include religious communities in society which may change the <b>ongoing</b> <b>processes</b> of secularization. One of the major problems with the collaborations was related to which religious community could be included by reasons of economic resources, access to personnel and premises and the acceptance and establishment in society...|$|R
