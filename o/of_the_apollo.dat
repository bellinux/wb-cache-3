5|$|Glynn Stephen Lunney (born November 27, 1936) is {{a retired}} NASA engineer. An {{employee}} of NASA since its creation in 1958, Lunney was a flight director during the Gemini and Apollo programs, and was on duty during historic {{events such as the}} Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> 13 crisis. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> program, he became manager of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United States and the Soviet Union. Later, he served as manager of the Space Shuttle program before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming {{a vice president of the}} United Space Alliance.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Kraft {{published}} his autobiography, Flight: My Life in Mission Control. It dealt {{with his life}} up until the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> program, only briefly mentioning his time as center director in the epilogue.|$|E
5|$|Later from October 29–31, 1969 he and {{the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> 11 astronauts visited the city of Tehran, capital of Iran, where he met Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi {{and the rest of}} the nation's royal family.|$|E
25|$|As of February 2016, seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve <b>Apollo</b> astronauts who {{landed on}} the Moon between 1969 and 1972 still survive, {{including}} Buzz Aldrin. Also, nine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve <b>Apollo</b> astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing between 1968 and 1972 still survive, including Michael Collins.|$|R

5|$|A director's cut {{version of}} the film was {{released}} in 2002. It included all the original footage, including the interviews, along with some additional filming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> space program. It also includes the original one-hour cut as a bonus feature.|$|E
5|$|AS-204 {{was to be}} {{the first}} manned test flight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> Command/Service Module (CSM) to Earth orbit, {{launched}} on a Saturn IB rocket. AS-204 was to test launch operations, ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the spacecraft performed.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Robbins medallions {{were also}} struck, in very small numbers, in 14k gold. These medallions were {{generally}} {{ordered by the}} mission crew as a personal memento of their flight and were often taken to the lunar surface in the Landing Module. For the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) were flown into space.|$|E
50|$|Buzz Aldrin, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>Apollo</b> 11 astronauts, {{contributed to}} this movie as {{technical}} advisor.|$|R

5|$|As part of Apollo 11's 40th {{anniversary in}} 2009, NASA spearheaded {{an effort to}} {{digitally}} restore the existing videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk. After an exhaustive three-year search for missing tapes of the original video <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> 11 moonwalk, NASA concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at the OMSF, Shea helped to resolve {{many of the other}} {{inevitable}} engineering debates and conflicts that cropped up during the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> spacecraft. In May 1963, he formed a Panel Review Board, bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between NASA centers. Under Shea's leadership, this coordination became far more efficient.|$|E

5|$|In August 1971, {{just after}} {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> 15 mission, President Richard Nixon proposed canceling {{the two remaining}} lunar landing missions, Apollo 16 and 17. Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director Caspar Weinberger was opposed to this, and persuaded Nixon to keep the remaining missions.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, the X PRIZE Foundation and Google {{announced}} the Google Lunar X Prize, {{to be awarded}} for a robotic lunar landing mission which transmits close-up images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> Lunar Modules and other artificial objects on the surface.|$|E
5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E

5|$|An Apollo 1 mission patch {{was left}} on the Moon's surface after the first manned lunar landing by Apollo 11 crew members Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. The Apollo 15 mission {{left on the}} surface of the Moon a tiny {{memorial}} statue, Fallen Astronaut, along with a plaque containing the names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> 1 astronauts, among others including Soviet cosmonauts, who perished in the pursuit of human space flight.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both of two major surface units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 17 was {{the last}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> program, landing in the Taurus-Littrow region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan {{commanded}} Ronald E. Evans and NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt. Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.|$|E

25|$|Bondarenko's {{death was}} caused by fire in a sealed, high-oxygen environment, which also befell <b>the</b> crew <b>of</b> <b>Apollo</b> 1. There was some later unfounded {{speculation}} that, had the Soviets been open about <b>the</b> circumstances <b>of</b> Bondarenko's death, NASA might have been alerted to <b>the</b> hazardous design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early <b>Apollo</b> command module and would have made changes which could have prevented <b>the</b> 1967 deaths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>Apollo</b> 1 crew members. However, by 1966 <b>the</b> lethal hazards <b>of</b> a high-pressure 100-percent-oxygen environment such as Apollo 1's had been thoroughly described in American scientific publications and were well known to NASA.|$|R
25|$|HMS <b>Apollo,</b> <b>the</b> fourth ship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy to {{be named}} for <b>the</b> Greek god <b>Apollo,</b> was a fifth-rate frigate of a nominal 36 guns.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> program, Kraft {{retired as a}} flight director to concentrate on management and mission planning. In 1972, he became director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (later Johnson Space Center), {{following in the footsteps}} of his mentor Robert R. Gilruth. He held the position until his 1982 retirement from NASA. During his retirement, Kraft has consulted for numerous companies including IBM and Rockwell International, and he published an autobiography entitled Flight: My Life in Mission Control.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|Following the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, NASA {{conducted}} a safety review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Apollo</b> program. In {{response to this}} review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule {{to make room for}} the three astronauts who were being rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew at almost any point whilst they were at the Moon, should an anomaly occur. Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon. The proposal was considered, but rejected due to lack of funds.|$|E
50|$|Crew members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>Apollo</b> {{missions}} {{shared an}} equally high regard for Wendt, and {{he stayed on}} with the Pad Leader title through the Skylab and ASTP missions.|$|R
