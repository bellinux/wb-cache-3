50|$|The Terrex's layout is conventional: {{the driver}} sits front {{left and the}} power pack is to the right. This leaves {{the rest of the}} vehicle clear for the troop compartment, which is {{provided}} with a <b>power-operated</b> <b>ramp</b> and roof hatches.|$|R
50|$|A valve {{actuator}} is the mechanism for {{opening and closing}} a valve. Manually operated valves require someone in attendance to adjust them using a direct or geared mechanism attached to the valve stem. Power-operated actuators, using gas pressure, hydraulic pressure or electricity, allow a valve to be adjusted remotely, or allow rapid <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> large valves. <b>Power-operated</b> {{valve actuator}}s may be the final elements of an automatic control loop which automatically regulates some flow, level or other process. Actuators may be only to open and close the valve, or may allow intermediate positioning; some valve actuators include switches or other ways to remotely indicate {{the position of the}} valve.|$|R
50|$|VBCI2 has {{a common}} layout, the driver {{location}} {{in front and}} the engine on his right, the turret in the central part while a troop compartment located in the rear part. Troops enter and leave the vehicle via a rear, <b>power-operated</b> <b>ramp</b> with integral door besides roof hatches.This armored vehicle has crew of three, including commander, driver, and gunner in addition to 6 passengers.|$|R
50|$|The {{layout of}} the Bionix is {{conventional}} with the driver at the front left, the power pack situated at the front right and the turret in the center with the troop compartment at the rear. Access to the troop compartment {{at the rear of}} the vehicle is by a <b>power-operated</b> <b>ramp,</b> which can operate as an emergency access and exit door. A single hatch is installed over the troop compartment.|$|R
50|$|Since central <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> {{the points}} and signals {{from a single}} signal box is convenient, and since there are {{practical}} limits for the distance to these points and signals, crossing loops can have a system-wide effect on train sizes. In New South Wales, mechanical <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> points and signals limited train lengths in the steam era to about 400 m, which was only eased with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>power-operated</b> points and centralized traffic control. Train lengths are now as much as 1&thinsp;500 m or 1&thinsp;800 m.|$|R
50|$|Seafang Mark 31 VG474 {{was used}} as a {{development}} aircraft for the Supermarine Attacker including the fitment <b>of</b> <b>power-operated</b> ailerons and contra-rotating propellers. The Attacker was a jet-powered development of the Spiteful/Seafang design which used the Spiteful laminar-flow wing and landing gear.|$|R
50|$|Trim {{levels were}} carried {{over from the}} {{previous}} generation. 1991 Voyagers were available in base, mid-grade SE, high-end LE, and high-end sporty LX. The LX which was available only on short-wheelbase Voyagers, was marketed as a sport-luxury minivan and came with the most standard equipment including alloy wheels, fog lamps, and wide array <b>of</b> <b>power-operated</b> features.|$|R
50|$|Landing craft are {{designed}} to carry troops, vehicles, or cargo from ship to shore under combat conditions, to unload, {{to withdraw from the}} beach, and to return to the ship. They are rugged, with powerful engines, and usually armed. There are many types in today's navies including hovercraft. They will typically have a <b>power-operated</b> bow <b>ramp,</b> a cargo well and after structures that house engine rooms, pilot houses, and stowage compartments. These boats are sometimes carried by larger ships.|$|R
50|$|The armored hull of {{the vehicle}} {{is based on a}} tracked chassis. The layout houses an engine {{compartment}} in the front, crew cab in the center and troop compartment at the rear. The power pack is placed {{at the front of the}} hull, with the exhaust outlet on the right. The vehicle can accommodate 10 personnel, including three crew plus seven infantrymen.The troop section is provided with individual mine blast seats for passengers. Troops can enter and exit the vehicle through a <b>power-operated</b> <b>ramp</b> at the rear. An emergency door is also provided on the ramp.The combat weight of the vehicle is 14t, which is considered to be much lighter in comparison with other modern IFVs. Primarily designed to transport a squad of infantry and their weapons, Lazika delivers mobility, protection and fire power for the operators.The driver's cabin and remotely controlled weapon station are equipped with day / night and thermal imaging cameras. The observation systems aboard the vehicle can detect and identify multiple targets located at long ranges. Four roof hatches are provided for observation purposes.The fire control system ensures accurate firing in all weather conditions. Other equipment includes friend or foe (IFF), digital controls and satellite linked navigation. The modern communication systems fitted on the vehicle ensure effective communication between troops.|$|R

50|$|Drophead coupe, coupé {{cabriolet}} or coupé cabrio:A type of convertible {{with only}} two doors, and thereby recalling the cabriolet carriage. With its Mazda RX-7 convertible, Mazda introduced a two-seater convertible with a removable rigid section over the passengers, removable independently <b>of</b> <b>power-operated</b> textile section behind with heatable glass rear window. During the 1980s, Jaguar produced an XJ-SC with two removable panels over the front seats and a partial fold-down convertible section in the back. It retained the rear side windows of the coupe and had fixed cant rails above these and the door glass. This allowed an almost full convertible with rollover safety. Going back in Jaguar history, during the 1950s, the XK 120 Drophead Coupe and later variants provided open-air motoring with quite civilized, fully lined, insulated tops with the weather protection of the hardtop models.|$|R
50|$|Infantry {{fighting}} vehicle {{based on}} SPG-1M. The {{hull of the}} vehicle is made entirely out of welded steel. It protects the vehicle against APFSDS-T projectiles of up to 35 mm in calibre over the frontal arc. The roof and sides protect it against 12.7 mm rounds fired {{from a range of}} 100 m. The other parts of the armour protect it against 7.62 mm rounds from any distance and angle. Both the hull and the turret can be fitted with additional passive of explosive reactive armour. The driver has a single-piece hatch cover that lifts and opens to the right (like in the BWP-1). In front of the driver's hatch is located a wide-angle periscope which can be replaced by a passive night vision device for use during night conditions. The power pack an air inlet/outlet louvres in the roof and the exhaust outlet on the right hand side. The turret is the Italian Oto Melara T60/70A which is normally armed with a stabilized 60 mm rifled autocannon, a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun and 12.7 mm anti-aircraft heavy machine gun. Inside the turret are the stations of both the gunner and the commander. The 60 mm autocannon can be replaced by a variety of guns from 25 mm autocannons to 105 mm guns. The turret is equipped with two clusters of four electrically operated smoke grenade launchers on each side. The troop compartment can transport up to eight fully equipped soldiers. Like in the BWP-1 the troops enter and leave the vehicle through the rear of the vehicle but in BWP-2000 they do this via a <b>power-operated</b> <b>ramp.</b> Two prototypes were made and in 1997 one of them was fitted with a fully developed and tested Italian Oto Melara T60/70A turret. This turret was developed as a private venture by Oto Melara and it has remained in prototype stage. There are no plans for the Polish BWP-2000 IFV to enter production for the Polish Army.|$|R

50|$|Trim {{levels were}} carried {{over from the}} {{previous}} generation. The Voyager and Caravan were available in base, mid-grade SE and high-end LE. The Caravan had a {{top of the line}} ES trim available on short and long wheelbase models, while the Voyager had a top of the line LX. Both came with the most standard equipment including alloy wheels, fog lamps, and wide array <b>of</b> <b>power-operated</b> features. The Town & Country was only available in one trim. Additionally, the Caravan was available in a cargo van model known as the Caravan C/V. As with the previous generation, the minivans were differentiated from each other in both trim and options. The Caravan and Voyager had different grilles, headlamps, taillamps and bumpers. The Chrysler Town & Country used the headlamps, taillamps and bumpers of the Voyager, but with a unique grille. Woodgrain trim was optional on all vans. The Town & Country was set apart on the exterior by its chrome (later body colored) waterfall grille, crystal pentastar hood ornament, body colored side mirrors, body side cladding, and unique alloy wheels.|$|R
