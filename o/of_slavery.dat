5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push for the expansion <b>of</b> <b>slavery,</b> and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue <b>of</b> <b>slavery,</b> he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, {{setting the stage for}} the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s however, Tucker's views <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> changed notably with {{personal}} experience, and profit, realized in his purchase {{and sale of}} slaves for his account {{and that of his}} father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the insipid benefits <b>of</b> <b>slavery,</b> he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|Recently, Calhoun's {{reputation}} {{has suffered}} particularly {{due to his}} defense <b>of</b> <b>slavery.</b> The racially motivated Charleston church shooting in South Carolina in June 2015 reinvigorated demands {{for the removal of}} monuments dedicated to prominent pro-slavery and Confederate States figures. That month, the monument to Calhoun in Charleston was found vandalized, with spray-painted denunciations of Calhoun as a racist and a defender <b>of</b> <b>slavery.</b>|$|E

5|$|Slavery in Greek antiquity {{has long}} been an object of apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History <b>of</b> <b>Slavery</b> in Antiquity among his works for the abolition <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> in the French colonies.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close {{personal}} friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view <b>of</b> <b>slavery.</b> Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> as seen {{through the eyes of a}} northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue <b>of</b> <b>slavery,</b> but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor <b>of</b> <b>slavery,</b> and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E

The following month, the Whig government introduced the Bill for the Abolition <b>of</b> <b>Slavery,</b> formally saluting Wilberforce in the process.
