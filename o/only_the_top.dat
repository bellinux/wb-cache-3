6000|$|... 14. Here, however, I must {{anticipate}} another objection. It may {{be asked}} why we are to build <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> windows pointed,--why not follow the leaves, and point them at the bottom also? ...|$|R

60|$|After a {{somewhat}} wearisome journey {{they came in}} sight of a high wall, painted blue with pink ornaments. This wall was circular, and seemed to enclose a large space. It was so high that <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> trees could be seen above it.|$|R

5|$|As of the 2009–10 season {{qualification}} for the UEFA Champions League changed, the {{top four}} teams in the Premier League qualify for the UEFA Champions League, with the top three teams directly entering the group stage. Previously <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> two teams qualified automatically. The fourth-placed team enters the Champions League at the play-off round for non-champions and must win a two-legged knockout tie in order to enter the group stage.|$|E
5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team {{can compete with}} as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E

5|$|Compared to the {{previous}} season's Claxton Shield tournament, there were few structural changes to the competition. With the expansion from five to six teams, the need for teams to have a bye was eliminated, with all teams participating in games each round. The individual rounds were expanded from three to four games per round, resulting in an increase from 24 to 40 games per team for the season. The postseason was also expanded to include the top four teams, rather than <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> three.|$|E
5|$|In the 1991–92 season, Al-Talaba {{finished}} in fourth place with 55 points. The vice-president of Al-Talaba, Salim Rasheed, organised a competition called the Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup (now known as Iraqi Elite Cup) in which <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> six {{teams in the}} league could participate with all the matches being played at the Al-Shaab Stadium. Al-Talaba won their first match against Al-Shorta 1–0 and lost their second match against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya 1–0, qualifying them for the semi-finals where they lost to Al-Zawra'a 1–0 after an early goal by Mohammed Jassim Mahdi. In the third-place match, Al-Talaba faced Al-Karkh whom they defeated 4–3 on penalties after a 2–2 draw. The 1991 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup ended with Al-Zawra'a as winners.|$|E

5|$|The UFA government, {{which had}} campaigned on electoral reform, {{introduced}} AV {{in the rural}} constituencies in 1926, with the unique feature of only two rounds: rather than redistribute votes from each last-place candidate in several counts, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> two candidates from the first count would advance to the second count. Edmonton and Calgary were also converted to STV districts, where a complicated system of vote transfers resulted in roughly proportional results.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{official}} levels of competition: local/scrimmage, regional, state, and national (Rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively). With {{the exception of}} Round 1, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> finishers in each round advance to the next level. California, the state with the largest Academic Decathlon, holds local scrimmages using the Round 1 tests, which are largely for practice and do not determine whether a team can compete at the regional level, which uses Round 2 tests. In the 2008–09 season, 43 states participated in statewide Academic Decathlons, though only 35 and an international school participated in the national competition.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, for which points were awarded for reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other riders. Each climb was categorised as either first, second, or third-category, with more points available for the more difficult, higher-categorised climbs. For first-category climbs, the top seven riders earned points; on second-category climbs, five riders won points; on third-category climbs, <b>only</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> three riders earned points. The leadership of the mountains classification was marked by a white jersey with red polka-dots.|$|E
