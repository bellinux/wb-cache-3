40|$|Although an {{efficiency}} of microscope has improved recently, no {{report on the}} design of the instrument can be found. The fundamental consideration on the problem was attempted by the authors, basing upon the human engineering. Subjects mainly discussed were the design and the place of fluorescent screen, <b>operation</b> <b>panel</b> and others. Human conditions, such as human physique, working posture, kinetic curve, working area and others, were also considered. As a result, the following matters were decided to be pratical use. The height of fluorescent screen was 85 cm and the distance between the center of the screen and operator was 25 cm. The location, shape and size of <b>operation</b> <b>panel</b> were decided to be placed on both sides of fluorescent screen plate with 20 X 40 cm square and the slope of 30 to 45 degree.

The key problem in this project is the large scale change where the panel detection has to start at a significant distance away, and end up with the camera very near to the panel button. The process has three steps: (1) hunting for the panel using a coarse searching algorithm; (2) guiding the robot arm towards the panel; at close range, a model based matching algorithm is applied to verify (or identify) the panel; (3) after verification, tracking the button to guide the robot towards it. Two algorithms were used and it is shown that the weak perspective model outperforms the affine model.

40|$|Brain {{computer}} interface (BCI) {{is a kind}} {{of human}} machine interface, which provides a new interaction method between human and computer or other equipment. The most significant characteristic of BCI system is that its control input is brain electrical activities acquired from the brain instead of traditional input such as hands or eyes. BCI technique has rapidly developed during last two decades and it has mainly worked as an auxiliary technique to help the disable people improve their life qualities. With the appearance of low cost novel electrical devices such as EMOTIV, BCI technique has been applied to the general public through many useful applications including video gaming, virtual reality and virtual keyboard. The purpose of this research is to be familiar with EMOTIV EPOC system and make use of it to build an EEG based BCI system for controlling an industrial manipulator by means of human thought. To build a BCI system, an acquisition program based on EMOTIV EPOC system is designed and a MFC based dialog that works as an <b>operation</b> <b>panel</b> is presented. Furthermore, the inverse kinematics of RV- 3 SB industrial robot was solved. In the last part of this research, the designed BCI system with human thought input is examined and the results indicate that the system is running smoothly and displays clearly the motion type and the incremental displacement of the motion...|$|E

30|$|However, these {{requirements}} have mainly been proposed to support aeronautical operations (ranging from en-route phase to approach operation with vertical guidance, called APV II). In fact, continuity requirements were introduced {{for the first}} time in aviation in the late 1960 s to define precise approach requirements for a radio navigation system, called the Instrument Landing System (ILS). The purpose was to describe the quality of service during a most critical phase of operation (e.g. 15  s for the precise approach phase of an aeroplane before landing, duration in which service interruption is dangerous). Continuity requirement was derived by means of a risk allocation from the Target Level of Safety (TLS), whereas TLS results from statistical analysis of historical accident data of aeroplanes for a given period. In 1993, the ICAO’s Air Navigation Commission requested All Weather <b>Operations</b> <b>Panel</b> (AWOP) to examine the possibility of extending the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) concept, which was originally intended for en-route operations, to include approach, landing and departure operations. At that time, it was proposed to use the accuracy, integrity, continuity, and availability quality criteria that were later retained for GNSS.|$|R
