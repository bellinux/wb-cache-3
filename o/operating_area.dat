5|$|The Kclass {{prototype}} operated {{without a}} name until 1925, when the Southern Railway's publicity department decided to name all express passenger locomotives. The locomotives constructed from 1925 were named after rivers {{found within the}} Southern Railway's <b>operating</b> <b>area,</b> and the class became known collectively as the River class. The first-completed Southern Railway Kclass No.A791 was named River Adur whilst the former SECR prototype was given the name River Avon; names were also allocated to the cancelled 1926 batch of locomotives. The K1class locomotive No.A890 was named River Frome. The names were displayed on a rectangular brass nameplate fitted to the water tank sides.|$|E

25|$|A recent {{application}} of piezoelectric ultrasound sources is piezoelectric surgery, {{also known as}} piezosurgery. Piezosurgery is a minimally invasive technique that aims to cut a target tissue with little damage to neighboring tissues. For example, Hoigne et al. reported its use in hand surgery for the cutting of bone, using frequencies in the range 25–29kHz, causing microvibrations of 60–210μm. It {{has the ability to}} cut mineralized tissue without cutting neurovascular tissue and other soft tissue, thereby maintaining a blood-free <b>operating</b> <b>area,</b> better visibility and greater precision.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 Hants & Dorset {{was split}} to form four new companies. The {{eastern end of}} its former <b>operating</b> <b>area,</b> which {{included}} its few services into Portsmouth, were merged with the former Gosport & Fareham Omnibus Company to form the Provincial Bus Co. When NBC was privatised in the mid-1980s, Provincial was the only company to be sold under an Employee Share Ownership Plan, becoming independent in May 1987. Southdown was sold to its management in October 1987, and both companies quickly made changes.|$|E
