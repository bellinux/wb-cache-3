5000|$|Broadband {{is a term}} {{normally}} {{considered to}} be synonymous with a high-speed connection to the internet. Suitability for certain applications, or technically a certain quality of service, is often assumed. For instance, low round trip delay (or [...] "latency" [...] in milliseconds) would normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable for Voice over IP, online gaming, financial trading especially arbitrage, virtual private networks and other latency-sensitive applications. This would rule out satellite Internet as inherently high-latency. In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured for example in seconds per 30 years <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> as in the PSTN network) or security (say AES-128 as required for smart grid applications in the US) are often also assumed or defined as requirements. There is no single definition of broadband and official plans may refer to any or none of these criteria.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{determination}} of recloser position has an important rule, especially in reliability of electical power system. Parameter used in reliability electrical power system is SAIDI and SAIFI. SAIDI and SAIFI can be calculated from the <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> and the failure rate occurred in one year. Reliability can be concluded better if SAIDI and SAIFI smaller. In this final project will be created simulation program. This program used for simulating optimum recloser position. The SAIDI and SAIFI data is result of failure rate and <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> calculation each electrical power system component. The electrical power system component consist of recloser, trafo, SUTM, FCO, and PMT. Programs will be created using algorithm genetic method with Matlab 7. 6 programming.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} the PROFIBUS MAC protocol when operated over error prone links, like wireless links. In order to show that the protocol is very sensible to loss of control frames (e. g. token frames) we evaluate three performance measures, using a simulation approach: the mean delay, the mean station <b>outage</b> <b>time</b> and the cumulated <b>outage</b> <b>time,</b> i. e. the fraction of time where a single station is not member of the ring due to loss or error of control frames. The results indicate that the PROFIBUS MAC protocol is not really a good choice for use over error prone links. ...|$|E

40|$|Investment and {{maintenance}} costs are higher for {{offshore wind power}} compared to onshore. Also, wind turbine components offshore are subjected to higher physical stresses compared to components onshore, due to harder winds. These strong winds often lead to longer <b>outage</b> <b>times</b> of failed offshore components compared to onshore. The reliability of the Swedish offshore wind farm Lillgrund is analysed in this report. The consequence of a component failure might be a smaller energy production than expected. This loss of energy is called {{expected energy not supplied}} (ENS) [GWh/year]. High ENS-values risks the profitability of the investment. Thus, the ENS-value of Lillgrund has been calculated with a reliability analysis and is then used as input in an investment analysis, to see how the reliability of the farm affects the investment proposal. Three alternative layouts, where the transformer is placed on land instead of on a platform offshore, are compared to the original layout. The results show that all layouts have positive net present values (NPV), but there are not that big relative differences between the NPVs of the layouts compared to the total investment outlay. The result shows that a transformer on land is preferable when the distance from farm to the shore is 7. 5 km or less, while for longer distances a platform is preferable. A sensitivity analysis shows that the NPV is most sensitive to long <b>outage</b> <b>times</b> of the turbines, compared to long <b>outage</b> <b>times</b> for cables and transformer. Results and views in the report are my own conclusions, based on the input parameters used. The views are not necessarily the views of Vattenfall. Also, it is important to notice that some data have been changed because of confidentiality. However, the qualitative results and conclusions still remain the same...|$|R

40|$|Distribution Network Operators (DNO) are {{encouraged}} to improve their operation to prevent outages and to decrease overall <b>outage</b> <b>times</b> {{in order to improve}} the reliability of electricity distribution. The integration of a Distribution Management System (DMS) and a Work Management System (WMS) enables DNOs to decrease the amount of outages and to shorter the <b>outage</b> <b>times.</b> In addition, this system integration {{can also be used to}} improve customer service during outages. A concrete outcome of this thesis is an integration of the ABB MicroSCADA Pro DMS 600 distribution management system and a work management system. Use of standard interfaces is evaluated in this information system integration. Standard interfaces are expected to ease the implementation and the maintenance of information system integration. The suitability of the Common Information Model (CIM) for the DMS-WMS integration is evaluated here. This thesis covers the system integration process starting from capturing requirements, designing the interface according to the requirements and evaluating the implementation, maintenance and testing of the integration. Different methods and techniques are discussed. As a result, it is noted that the CIM standard cannot directly be applied to integrate the DMS and the WMS and some alterations are required. However, it was concluded that using the CIM as a basis data model for the interface eased the design and the implementation of the system integration...|$|R
