40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} theory of (semi) star {{operations}} for torsion-free modules. This extends the analogous theory of star <b>operations</b> <b>on</b> domains as in [R.

We investigate some properties of (semi) star <b>operations</b> <b>on</b> a given module over a domain D and their relation with the properties of some classes of semistar <b>operations</b> induced <b>on</b> D.
