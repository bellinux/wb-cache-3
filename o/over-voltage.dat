40|$|Arc {{suppression}} coil {{systems are}} able to improve the high voltage system reliability and safety. One {{of the reasons why}} these systems are not more widely used is the occurrence of simultaneous faults caused by the neutral voltage displacement combined with the transient voltages {{at the time of the}} initial earth fault. These transient <b>over-voltages</b> are analysed in detail and the capability of system components to withstand the <b>over-voltages</b> is assessed.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{issues to be}} noted {{regarding}} behavior of transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS) incorporating MOVs under <b>over-voltage</b> conditions. Depending {{on the level of}} conducted current, dissipated heat may be insufficient to cause failure, but may degrade the MOV device and reduce its life expectancy. If excessive current is conducted by a MOV, it may fail catastrophically, keeping the load connected, but now without any surge protection. [...] A user may have no indication when the surge suppressor has failed. Under the right conditions of <b>over-voltage</b> and line impedance, {{it may be possible to}} cause the MOV to burst into flames, the root cause of many fires and the main reason for NFPA’s concern resulting in UL1449 in 1986 and subsequent revisions in 1998 and 2009. Properly designed TVSS devices must not fail catastrophically, resulting in the opening of a thermal fuse or something equivalent that only disconnects MOV devices.|$|E
2500|$|Photothyristors are {{activated}} by light. The advantage of photothyristors is their insensitivity to electrical signals, {{which can cause}} faulty operation in electrically noisy environments. A light-triggered thyristor (LTT) has an optically sensitive region in its gate, into which electromagnetic radiation (usually infrared) is coupled by an optical fiber. [...] Since no electronic boards need to be provided at {{the potential of the}} thyristor in order to trigger it, light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as HVDC. [...] Light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built <b>over-voltage</b> (VBO) protection, which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high; [...] they have also been made with in-built forward recovery protection, but not commercially. Despite the simplification they can bring to the electronics of an HVDC valve, light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers.|$|E

If the improper suppression operation is applied due to incorrect identification, the accident is likely to worsen further. In this paper, the voltage and current features of these faults are analyzed, and a new effective classification criterion for fundamental ferroresonance and single phase-to-ground based on zero sequence current is proposed. A comprehensive identification method based on voltage, current and zero sequence current features is proposed, which is feasible and promising for real applications...|$|R
