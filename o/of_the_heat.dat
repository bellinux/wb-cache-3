5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally a fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> output, {{so it is}} always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E
