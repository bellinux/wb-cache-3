This thesis examines the fundamental {{behavior of a}} granular material subject to external vibrations. Experiments were designed to investigate the phenomena that appear in a container filled with glass spheres subject to vertical, sinusoidal oscillations. In addition, a discrete element computer simulation code was written to supplement the experimental program. Experiments and simulations reveal that {{the behavior of the}} particle bed can be classified into two regimes known as shallow and deep beds. For example, when a shallow bed consisting of less than six layers of glass spheres is subjected to oscillations with acceleration amplitudes greater than approximately 2. Og where g is the acceleration due to gravity, the particles in the container are fluidized and do not display coordinated movement. However, when more than six particle layers are used, the particles move coherently and the deep bed behaves as a single, completely inelastic mass. In the shallow bed regime three distinct sub-states are observed that differ in the degree of coherency in the particle motions. Each appears depending upon the number of particle layers in the bed and on the acceleration amplitude of the oscillations. The transitions between the states are gradual and not well-defined. The transition from the deep bed to the shallow bed state is characterized by a sudden expansion of the bed that occurs at a critical acceleration amplitude for a fixed bed depth and particle type. Simulations indicate that when the particle fluctuating kinetic energy is dissipated completely each oscillation cycle, the bed remains in the deep bed state. If the energy is not completely dissipated, a shallow bed state results. A simple model consisting of an inelastic ball bouncing on a sinusoidally <b>oscillating</b> <b>table</b> reproduces the sudden expansion. In the deep bed regime, phenomena such as side wall convection, surface waves, kinks, and kink convection cells appear depending primarily on the acceleration amplitude of the oscillations and, to a lesser degree, the number of particle layers in the bed. Phase maps of when these behaviors occur were constructed using both experimental and simulation data. When the acceleration amplitude is greater than approximately lg, side wall convection cells appear at the vertical wall boundaries of the container. Particles move down along the vertical walls of the container and up within the bulk of the bed. Simulations indicate that the convection cells are the result of the frictional contact between particles and the walls and the asymmetry of the particle/wall collision rate over an oscillation cycle. Using the simulations, the width of the boundary layer next to the walls, the height of the convection cell center from the container base, and the particle flux in the boundary layer were measured as functions of the vibration parameters and particle properties. The results from the simulation compare well with experimental measurements. The simulation indicates that the boundary layer width is proportional to the container width when the bed aspect ratio, defined as the bed depth to the bed width, is greater than approximately 0. 2. For beds with aspect ratios less than 0. 2, however, the boundary layer width remains constant. Simulation results also demonstrate that the convection cell height is proportional to the bed depth and that the flux of particles in the boundary layer increases with increasing particle/wall friction and decreases for coefficients of restitution near one. At acceleration amplitudes between approximately 2. Og and 3. 5 g, standing waves appear on the top free surface of the bed. These waves form at half the forcing oscillation frequency and are referred to as [ [...] . ]/ 2 waves. A second set of standing waves appears when the acceleration amplitude is greater than approximately 5. Og and persist up to at least 7. 0 g. These waves form at one-quarter the forcing frequency and are known as [ [...] . ]/ 4 waves. Experimental measurements indicate that the wave amplitude expressed as a Froude number increases with increasing acceleration amplitude for the [ [...] . ]/ 2 waves but remains constant for the [ [...] . ]/ 4 waves. Additionally, measurements of the wavelength suggest that the waves have a dispersion relation similar to that for deep fluid gravity waves where the wavelength is proportional to the square of the inverse frequency. Kinks and kink convection cells appear in the particle bed after a period doubling bifurcation occurs in the flight dynamics of the bed. The formation of kinks can be explained using a simple model consisting of a completely inelastic ball on a sinusoidally <b>oscillating</b> <b>table.</b> Experimental measurements indicate a minimum allowable distance between nodes that {{is a function of the}} bed depth and acceleration amplitude. The convection cells bracketing each kink are shown to be the result of the out-of-phase motion of the bed sections and the interaction between fluidized and solidified regions of the bed. The effect of vertical, sinusoidal vibrations on a discharging wedge-shaped hopper was also investigated. When the hopper exit is closed, side wall convection cells appear with particles moving up at the inclined container boundaries and down at the centerline of the bed. The same mechanism that causes downward convection at vertical walls can also explain the upward motion at inclined walls. Experimental measurements also indicate that the discharge rate from the vibrating hopper scales with the oscillation velocity amplitude. At low velocity amplitudes, the discharge rate from the hopper is slightly greater than the non-vibrating hopper discharge rate. At high velocity amplitudes, however, the discharge rate decreases significantly. A simple model accounting for the change in the effective gravity acting on the particle bed throughout the oscillation cycle and the impact velocity of the bed with the hopper predicts the observed trend. The experiments and simulations conducted in the present work suggest that the boundary conditions and the fluid- and solid-like nature of granular materials are significant factors affecting the response of a granular bed. Additionally, this work demonstrates the value of discrete element computer simulations as a tool for complementing experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|Conception and {{building}} of a photobioreactor adapted {{to the study of}} the production of hydrogen in microalgae. Application {{to the study of the}} influence of a Type II NAD(P) H dehydrogenase plastoquinone reduction chloroplast on the potential of hydrogen photo-production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Context and abstract of the thesis This project is part of a research framework to better understand the process of hydrogen photobioproduction in microalgae. Overall, we can say that hydrogen photobioproduction depends on the set of biochemical reactions that define cellular energy metabolism. In Chlamydomonas, H 2 photobioproduction is ensured by two enzymes (Hyda 1 and Hyda 2). These two enzymes are located in the chloroplast stroma, they catalyze the reaction of hydrogen production (Fig. 1). The electrons required for the synthesis of H 2 come from two different metabolic pathways, situated upstream of the PSI and CytB 6 f. The transport of electrons between these two paths and the CyB 6 f is via the plastoquinones (PQ) pool. The first pathway for the reduction of PQ involves the photolysis of water via photosystem II, known as the PSII-dependent pathway. The second reduction pathway is thought to involve an enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of NAD(P) H, and the reduction of PQ. Thought to be located on the stroma side of the membrane, it is known as the PSII-independent pathway. Succinctly, the PSII-dependent pathway could be considered as a contribution to the reductant supply from light energy and the PSII-independent pathway as a contribution to the reductant supply from starch, or more generally, from cellular carbon substrates. The existing situation: the NAD(P H-type II (Ndh-II) are enzymes capable of oxidizing NAD (P) H and transferring electrons to a quinone molecule (plastoquinone or ubiquinone). They are known as type II by analogy with mitochondrial complex I. As regards the chain of mitochondrial electron transport, NDH-II proteins constitute an alternative pathway to complex I and II to bring electrons to the ubiquinone pool. This alternative pathway would enable an adaptation to the yield of the electron transport chain based on the metabolic state of the algae. As regards the chloroplast electron transport chain, Ndh-II proteins are thought to participate in several mechanisms of adaptation to light intensity variations. Their function would be for the non-photochemical reduction of the PQ pool. In 2005, seven ''open reading frames'' corresponding to hypothetical type II NAD(P) H dehydrogenase (NDA 1 to NDA 2) were identified in the nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas. A study of Chlamydomonas NDA gene expression highlighted the most important expression of the NDA 2 gene. In order to specifically study the role of the NDA 2 enzyme, it was inactivated by RNA-interference. (Fred Jans thesis 2011). From the wt 84 strain (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), two lines of mutant deficient Nda 2 were obtained: G 4 : Nda 2 -RNAi (1) P 11 : Nda 2 -RNAi (2) If we consider these lines from a phenotypic point of view, two main theoretical hypotheses can be made: is there a significantly decreased reduction of the PQ pool by the PSII-independent pathway? is there an affected, reduced or even completely inhibited hydrogen photobioproduction? In order to study the effect of the deficiency of the enzyme (Nda 2) on the potential for hydrogen production, a set of tools and specific experimental protocols had to be developed to meet the second hypothesis (above). The aim of this project was mainly be to develop the study of modifications in hydrogen production. Purpose and specificity of the thesis: The purpose and specificity of this project was to break away from complex technical difficulties: knowing that the two mutant lines of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were wall-less cells and therefore, highly sensitive to hydrodynamic stress; knowing that the study of hydrogen photobioproduction by microalgae was based on the capacity of degassing the culture medium, i. e. the need to obtain optimal hydrodynamic agitation favoring gas exchange. The main challenge was therefore to develop a system to find a consensus technique in order to resolve the contradiction between preserving the fragile algae while causing sufficient hydrodynamic agitation to degas the culture medium. In 2005, experimental tools for the study of hydrogen production by microalgae were poorly developed. The majority of H 2 photoproduction experiments were conducted in glass bottles according to the Melis protocol. The Melis protocol is based on a temporal separation of two phases: the first is a phase of growth of microalgae in a culture medium that is optimal for photosynthesis and the accumulation of reserves (starch); the second phase begins after the transfer of the microalgae into a sulfur depleted medium. This procedure consists of causing biochemical stress, inducing reorganization and metabolic adaptation which will eventually lead to hydrogen photobioproduction. Although it is sufficient for a basic approach, the experimental procedure of bottle culture has several major drawbacks when it comes to studying the processes of hydrogen production over long periods (100 to 200 hours). In the bottles, the homogenization of the culture medium is conducted using magnetic stirrers moved by rotary shakers. To obtain good homogenization, a minimum speed of agitation is necessary. This process induces a relatively large hydrodynamic stress, resulting in significant cell death. On the other hand, microscope observation of Chlamydomonas cells grown in sulfur depleted medium deficient shows that the majority of algae lose their flagella and thus their natural mobility. This phenomenon reinforces the idea that magnetic stirrers severely limit the quality of experimental results: the agitation necessary for good homogenization must be more vigorous in sulfur depleted medium than in an optimal medium. Another major problem encountered in experiments using bottles is the quality of degassing. Generally, the analysis of gas products is done by gas chromatography; samples are taken in the gas phase, and then analysed. This method is unsuitable for this type of experiment. Is the gas phase in equilibrium with the liquid phase? Is there a risk of over or under-saturation of hydrogen? Is there an influence from pressure? Is there a risk of inhibiting the production of hydrogen by its own concentration in the medium? Does periodic and repeated sampling induce disturbances in how the reaction takes place? In order to solve these uncertainties and technical difficulties, a new and original concept of algal culture has been developed. The basic principle of this system involves placing a suspension of algae (culture medium) in a photobioreactor made of two transparent tubes connected at their ends. The photobioreactor is fixed on an <b>oscillating</b> <b>table.</b> A glass ball placed in one of the tubes slides because of the force of gravity, and this enables the homogenization of the medium. In addition to obtaining optimal homogenization without hydrodynamic stress (by three different types of mixing), a geometric feature of the whole has enabled active degassing of the hydrogen produced in the culture medium. Parallel and in annex to this photobioreactor (PBR), a system enabling the measurement and analysis in real time of the concentration of hydrogen in the gas phase has been developed. This system is based on the principle of polarographic analysis of oxygen concentration developed by Leland C. Clark. The O 2 and H 2 concentrations can be measured by a periodic reversal of the voltage across the electrodes. Finally, a theoretical model of evolution and equilibrium of hydrogen concentration in the PBR has been developed to monitor and compare the experimental results. The findings: The new concept of microalgae culture developed in this project has solved several problems. The homogenization of the culture medium by mixing the phases and stirring with a glass ball is a particularly effective alternative compared to mixing with the magnetic stirrers commonly used in bottles. Cell death by hydrodynamic stress can be reduced to virtually zero, whereas experience has shown that in this field, mixing using magnetic stirrers is a relatively harmful process. The original system of mixed phases with active degassing (at atmospheric pressure) has resulted in superior yields of hydrogen being produced than in other systems. The real-time analysis of changes in concentrations of oxygen and hydrogen via the probes has increased the accuracy of the results. It was observed that the variation of several experimental factors could lead to significant distortions between the theoretical model of evolution of the concentration of hydrogen (depending on the gas collected in the gasometer) and the measurements made using gaseous chromatography (GC). Those factors are the following: the quantity of culture medium in the reactor; he geometry of the interface between gas phase and liquid phase; he speeds of the mixing cycles; the pressure of the PBR; dynamic permeability and porosity; changes in production rates of hydrogen in different strains of microalgae. Because of these factors, changes in the experimental protocol were required: fixing an interval of time (within each experiment) to obtain the speed ​​of stable production; a study on the influence of pH, which helped validate the experimental range usually used; a study on the influence of hydrogen concentration on the rate of production. These changes have not only increased measurement accuracy, but have also confirmed certain hypotheses concerning a probable inhibition of hydrogen production by its own concentration in the culture medium. Confirmation of the inhibition of hydrogen production by its own concentration in the culture medium is undoubtedly the most important piece of information provided by the latter optimization of the protocol. Parallel to this, the observation of significant discrepancies between the theoretical model of the evolution of hydrogen concentration (depending on the gas collected in the gasometer) and the measurements made by gas chromatography (GC), result in the latter (GC) seeming to be unreliable in this type of experiment. The contribution of hydrogen / oxygen probes in the field of hydrogen photobioproduction by microalgae Developing of the system of measuring O 2 /H 2 probes by time multiplexing (periodic alternation of the polarity probe) has provided new insights into the possibilities of monitoring the evolution of hydrogen concentration in real time. Although these probes were made by hand and used without the real purpose of gaining precise quantification, their potential in this area of ​​research is clearly visible. It is obvious that developing a similar system, but more accurate in terms of electrode geometry, would allow the calibration and enhancement of measurements (from a quantitative point of view). Besides this, an optimization of surface characteristics of the electrodes would also improve performance and increase capacity of use. A perfectly sealed probe head could work in the liquid medium and directly provide the values ​​of hydrogen concentration in the liquid phase. It is likely that this method of measuring hydrogen concentration by polarography, may in future replace the current method of gas chromatography. Taking all these elements into account: In the semi-closed PBR, the main problem for obtaining the values ​​of metabolic fluxes to study is keeping the characteristics of the gas exchange in well-defined operating range (pressure, H 2 concentration and mixing dynamics). It is demonstrated in this paper that this procedure is relatively easy to carry out: the only constraint is to precisely define the characteristics of the PBR and the theoretical models. In the second part of the project, the photobioreactor is used to develop and complete a protocol analysis to characterize the relative contributions of the two metabolic pathways involved in hydrogen photobioproduction (the chloroplast electron transport chain) in the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Two publications have been written regarding the biochemical approach of the second part; interested readers can find there all the results and comments that this project has brought to the field. Follow-up to, and the future of, this project: Thanks to the PBR and its multi-adaptability, an original approach to the theoretical modeling of the metabolism of hydrogen production is possible if the following are known: the various flux values ​​of the metabolic pathways; the volumes of hydrogen produced; production rates based on metabolic configurations; the speed and quantity of starch consumed; the speeds of mitochondrial respiration and their involvement in hydrogen production (via PEDO 2). By standardizing and unifying the various units of measurement used to characterize the flow and the amounts of material as well as the electrochemical potentials and the gradients, through which the matter passes, it should be possible to construct a matrix model according to Kirchhoff's laws. From this model, it should be possible to deduce other values and other metabolic constants without having to necessarily pass through experimentation. This model would also, by successive iterative approaches and extrapolation, determine new optimal operating ranges for the PBR...|$|E

In particular, it presents the results of experiments performed to study the influence of an <b>oscillating</b> water <b>table</b> on storativity (i. e., effective porosity), the application of both harmonic and spectral analyses to water surface time histories measured in the field near Ewa Beach and in Honolulu Harbor, and an electric analog model designed to simulate the shallow, coral-limestone aquifer at Ewa Beach, Oahu, Hawaii. Results indicate that the effective porosity for an <b>oscillating</b> water <b>table</b> will, in general, depend on the frequency of the oscillation with dependence being strong or weak as either or both the specific yield and the transmissivity are larger or smaller, respectively. Also, water surface time histories can be considered to be composed of a fundamental (diurnal) component and a second harmonic (semidiurnal) component and a 24 -hr record analyzed and that the resulting average values of the amplitude and phase angles be used. The spectral analysis confirms that the semidiurnal power suffers a greater attenuation than the diurnal power. It is concluded that the technique of determining aquifer properties from tidal response data is a valid one, but that the results will be less reliable than those ascertained from pump test data. The optimum results are considered to be those based on both tidal data and pump test data, as one method serves as a check on the other.

Risks posed by such dynamic source zones vary over time as water <b>tables</b> <b>oscillate</b> from tidal effects, seasonality or anthropogenic interferences. In this study, the first automated multiphase flow dynamic water table experimental system comprising both hardware and software, was developed to: i) automatically implement programmable cyclic water table fluctuations via Raspberry Pi^T^M based inexpensive electronics; ii) dynamically monitor the real-time saturation distributions of all fluids (red-dyed-LNAPL, blue-dyed-water and air) in 2 -D sand tank, using high-temporal-and-spatial resolution automated multi-spectral photography; and iii) accurately interpret large detailed datasets via advanced multi-spectral imaging.

The project aims to provide further research and add to the general testing database of FRP enhanced masonry. An introduction to the problems and solutions associated with unreinforced masonry is discussed along with a literature review on previous testing done in the field of FRP enhanced masonry. The investigation {{on the effects of}} fatigue on FRP when applied to masonry walls subjected to out-of-plane loading is performed through experimental testing. A total of four wall specimens (6 ft x 4 ft x 8 in) were constructed. One of the specimens was left unreinforced and used as a baseline for testing while the remaining three specimens were reinforced with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips designed to take the out-of-plane loads capable of creating the cracking moment in the unreinforced wall. The material testing, construction of the test specimens, and CFRP application are all presented in this thesis. With the use of an <b>oscillating</b> shake <b>table</b> to generate the out-of-plane loading, the walls were fixed at the base and cantilevered from the shake table. By determining the frequency and amplitude that generated the cracking moment in the baseline unreinforced wall, the remaining three CFRP reinforced walls were tested at the same frequency and amplitude. The results from the testing of the three CFRP reinforced walls are presented along with time histories showing the shake table displacement and wall’s tip displacement versus time. In general, fatigue of masonry walls reinforced with CFRP strips can be managed as long as the out-of-plane reinforcement has sufficient strength and development length. Additional findings were made as a result from the testing. The development length of a vertical CFRP strip can be increased by adding a horizontal CFRP strips near the critical section and surface damage to CFRP may have severe consequences...|$|R

While the different versions of SWAT {{have been widely used}} throughout the world for agricultural and water resources applications, little has been done to test the performance, variability, and transferability of the parameters in the crop growth, soil water, and groundwater modules in an integrated way with multiple sets of field experimental data at the process scale. Using an multiple years of field experimental data of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the irrigation district of the Yellow River Basin, this paper assesses the performance of the plant-soil-groundwater modules and the variability and transferability of SWAT 2000. Comparison of the simulated results by SWAT to the observations showed that SWAT performed quite unsatisfactorily in LAI predictions during the senescence stage, in yield predictions, and in soil-water estimation under dry soil-profile conditions. The unsatisfactory performance in LAI prediction might be attributed to over-simplified senescence modeling; in yield prediction to the improper computation of the harvest index; and in soil water under dry conditions to the exclusion of groundwater evaporation from the soil water balance in SWAT. In this paper, improvements in crop growth, soil water, and groundwater modules in SWAT were implemented. The saturated soil profile was coupled to the <b>oscillating</b> groundwater <b>table.</b> A variable evaporation coefficient taking into account soil water deficit index, groundwater depth, and crop root depth was used to replace the fixed coefficient in computing groundwater evaporation. The soil water balance included the groundwater evaporation. The modifications improved simulations of crop evapotranspiration and biomass as well as soil water dynamics under dry soil-profile conditions. The evaluation shows that the crop growth and soil water components of SWAT could be further refined to better simulate the hydrology of agricultural watersheds. © 2008 Elsevier B. V.
