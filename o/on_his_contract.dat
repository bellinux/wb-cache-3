5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox.

He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>contract,</b> wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever.

Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended Cagney. Cagney {{announced that he would}} do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>contract.</b> He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine.

At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>contract,</b> he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.|$|E
