50|$|Living marine {{resources}} covered by SEAFO including fish (such as orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus, alfonsino Beryx splendens, Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides, hake Merluccius paradoxus, horse mackerel Trachurus capensis, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, cardinalfishes Epigonus species, <b>oreo</b> <b>dories</b> and armourhead Pseudopentaceros species, some shark species and rays), molluscs (such as octopus and squid) and crustaceans (such as {{deep sea red crab}} Chaceon maritae). Some {{of the most}} notable commercially important species are orange roughy, alfonsino - harvested by bottom trawling, and deep sea red crab - capture by pots or traps and Patagonian toothfish caught by longlining. Highly migratory fish stocks such as tuna, swordfish, marlin and sharks in the region are covered by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Most of SEAFO fish resources are found in deep waters (greater than 500 m depth) and tend to be slow grower, long-lived, late-matured and therefore could be vulnerable to over-exploitation. Their biological and ecological dynamics are not well known and there are no good historic time series.|$|E
50|$|The {{fishing grounds}} near the {{subtropical}} front {{and particularly the}} Chatham Rise provide 60% of New Zealand’s fish catch. Because the Chatham Rise is relatively shallow, it is accessible to both midwater trawling and bottom trawling. Species include the main hoki, hake, ling, silver warehou, squid, orange roughy and deep sea (<b>oreo)</b> <b>dory</b> fisheries.|$|R
5000|$|The rise forms {{a sector}} of an {{international}} fishery managed by Australia and New Zealand. [...] New Zealand ceased fishing {{the area in the}} 2000-01 fishing season. By agreement between New Zealand and Australia the zone has been closed to commercial fishing since 2007. The principal species of fish sought after are the Orange Roughy and <b>Oreo</b> <b>Dory</b> using deepwater demersal trawlers.|$|R
40|$|Two serine proteases {{from the}} viscera of deep-sea fish, black <b>oreo</b> <b>dory</b> (Allocyttus niger),were {{purified}} by hydrophobic, affinity, and cation exchange chromatography. They were designated as chymotrypsins {{on the basis}} of substrate specificity and susceptibility to inhibitors. The pH optima of chymotrypsin I and II were 8. 6 and 10, respectively. Chymotrypsin II retained a remarkable 80 % activity at pH 12. 5. Thermal stability of both enzymes was enhanced in the presence of calcium ions. Both chymotrypsins were inhibited by high concentrations of substrate Suc-AAPF-NA...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{gradient}} {{refractive index}} of the crystalline lens in the Black <b>Oreo</b> <b>Dory</b> (Allocyttus Niger) was determined using two methods; an optimisation program based on finite ray-tracing and the path of laser beams through the lens, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the linear relationship between refractive index and nuclear transverse relaxation rates. The methods showed good agreement in the cortical zone of the lens, {{but the lack of}} free water in the core of the lens made MRI measurement impossible in this region. The laser-optimisation method gave mean values of 1. 368 and 1. 543 for the surface and core refractive indices respectively, with a radial distribution for the gradient refractive index given by n(r) = 1. 543 − 0. 121 r 2 − 0. 033 r 4 − 0. 021 r 6...|$|R
50|$|The smooth <b>oreo</b> or smooth <b>dory,</b> (Pseudocyttus maculatus), is an oreo, {{the only}} {{species in the}} genus Pseudocyttus. It is found in all {{southern}} oceans at depths of between 400 and 1500 m. Its length is up to 60 cm.|$|R
