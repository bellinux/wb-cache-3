25|$|The {{situation}} on the Narva front was turning into a catastrophe for the German Army Group North. The Leningrad Front had formed bridgeheads both {{north and south of}} Narva, the closest of them a few hundred meters away from Narva–Tallinn Highway. The Sponheimer Group was in direct danger of getting besieged. The defence of the highway was held only by small infantry units formed of the 9th and 10th Luftwaffe Field Divisions, supported by Panther tanks after every few hundred metres along the highway. They obscured direct observation of the highway by placing branches of spruce trees along it, however, this did not distract the Soviet artillery from keeping the highway under constant bombardment. The faith of the Sponheimer Group, that the defence could go <b>on</b> <b>like</b> this, started to diminish.|$|E
500|$|Spins Joe Levy {{named the}} song the only [...] "great" [...] dance record <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer, and also {{observed}} that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] was a [...] "girly-disco" [...] song that drew influences from Sister Sledge's [...] "We Are Family" [...] and Madonna's own [...] "Into the Groove". Stephen Holden from The New York Times {{believed that the}} song brought the pop-funk style and hippie happiness of Sly and the Family Stone. Journalist J. D. Considine, while reviewing Like a Prayer for Rolling Stone, felt that [...] "Keep It Together" [...] portrayed [...] "an impressive invocation {{of the importance of}} family". Considine was concerned that since the confessional nature of the songs <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer evoked strong emotions from the listener, [...] "Keep It Together" [...] would probably seem almost trivial by comparison to them. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic believed that the song constituted of deep funk music. Louis Virtel of The Backlot gave the song a positive review, calling it a [...] "rollicking family reunion" [...] that is the [...] "sunny side of “Oh Father’s” grim familial reckoning." [...] Kenneth Partridge from Billboard described the song as a mid-tempo synth-funk tune with a [...] "tense" [...] groove, on which Madonna offers an olive branch to her estranged father and siblings.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Pyromaniac" [...] {{features}} a [...] "sweet melody" [...] and [...] "occasional minor-key twists". Leonie Cooper from NME described the song's genre as [...] "straight-up lo-fi funk" [...] and claimed it [...] "com <b>on</b> <b>like</b> Robyn produced by Phoenix". Continuing, Michael Jose Gonzalez of Gaffa {{called it a}} mixture of pop, funk, and soul music. Throughout the song, Oh Land repeatedly sings [...] "woo-hoo", which was considered reminiscent to some of her previous singles. Jennifer Joh from Neon Tommy compared it to the Cardigans' 1996 single [...] "Lovefool".|$|E
500|$|When Madonna went {{to record}} [...] "Oh Father", her troubled role in Speed-the-Plow {{was on her}} mind, with the result being that she vented her {{emotions}} in the recording of the song.

40|$|An {{impressive}} empirical {{literature suggests}} that physical attractiveness is associated with interpersonal attraction and with specific personality traits, {{some of which are}} favorable and many of which are objectively unrelated to attractiveness. Interestingly, much of the research investigating the impact of attractiveness <b>on</b> <b>liking</b> and personality inference has not accounted for the role of the self in social perception. In this project I investigated the possibility that perceptual similarity between the self and target contributes to differential judgments of attractive and unattractive individuals. Participants completed self-ratings of physical attractiveness and evaluated a target who was high, medium, or low in physical attractiveness. As expected, participants rated themselves as relatively attractive and as similar on attractiveness to attractive targets. Target evaluations varied as a function of target attractiveness; however, self- ratings on attractiveness moderated the impact of target attractiveness <b>on</b> <b>liking</b> for and personality inferences about the target. Attractiveness similarity also completely mediated the effect of target attractiveness <b>on</b> <b>liking.</b> The findings are discussed with regards to implicit personality theory and implicit egotism...|$|R

[...] Norman describes the chorus as Lennon restating his message of [...] "peace campaigning and non-violent, optimistic togetherness". Lennon biographer John Blaney writes that the song is an appeal [...] "for mankind to take responsibility for its fate" [...] and that it was [...] "Lennon developing his own brand of egalitarianism".|$|E

The actual version was made available on March 6, 2015, whilst its precedent mix was predominantly influenced by disco and house music before being reworked in the album cut. Lyrically, [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] portrays Madonna addressing her insecurities and the release that follows, in addition to her questioning her career's longevity. The recording was generally well received by music critics, with the majority of them comparing it to the singer's previous work <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer (1989), Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005).|$|E
500|$|... "Dress You Up" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Madonna {{from her}} second studio album Like a Virgin (1984). It was {{released}} on July 31, 1985 as the album's final single, by Sire Records. The song was the last track {{to be added to}} the album as it was submitted late by songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale. Madonna pushed for the song's inclusion <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin as she particularly liked its lyrics. Musically, the song is a drum beat driven dance track featuring instrumentation from guitars and vocals from a choir and a guitar solo played by Nile Rodgers, who also produced the song. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up with passion. A live performance from Madonna's first tour was used as the music video.|$|E

Artists like DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince and Trace Adkins referenced the game in songs. Episodes of television series such as The Simpsons, Futurama, Crank Yankers and The Fairly OddParents have also contained references to the game. Even today, sound effects from the Atari 2600 version often serve as generic video game sounds in films and television series. The phrase [...] "It's <b>on</b> <b>like</b> Donkey Kong" [...] {{has been used in}} various works of popular culture.

500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going <b>on,</b> <b>like</b> other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories {{about what is going on}} on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to what is happening in the news media.

500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single from her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, on May 9, 1989, with [...] "The Look of Love", from the 1987 film soundtrack Who's That Girl, on its B-side. When Madonna started work <b>on</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer, she considered many options, {{and thought about the}} musical direction for it. She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her ex-husband Sean Penn, her family, her lost mother and even her belief in God. Madonna thought about lyrical ideas for the songs on topics that, until then, were personal mediation never to be shared with her public so openly and pointedly. She came to the realization that as she and her fans were growing up, and it was time for her {{to move away from the}} teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market.

[...] Melinda Newman of HitFix called it [...] "one of the most compelling tracks, with Madonna singing in a low whispery register, detailing that she’s shot her lover dead in the head and, furthermore, she has no regrets. It’s violent and explicit and it’s what Madonna used to represent: a sense of danger." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News called it [...] "historic" [...] and [...] "may be the world’s first murder-ballad-as-disco song." ...|$|E
