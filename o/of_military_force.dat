In an op-ed, Paul disputed the Obama administration's claims that the threat <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> caused Syria's government to consider turning over its chemical weapons, instead arguing that the opposition to military action in Syria, and the delay that it caused, led to diplomatic progress.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Shoup was molded by the {{progressive}} ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives {{fighting against the}} interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.|$|E

In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four {{days prior to}} the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.|$|E

5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with a show <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 1861 Helm chaired {{a meeting}} in Louisville that {{advocated}} for Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War. Helm was an outspoken opponent of secession, but also denounced the election of Abraham Lincoln and his use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to subdue the southern states. Because Helm did not condemn his son, Benjamin, for joining the Confederate Army, federal authorities classified him as a southern sympathizer.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive. The court should abstain from interfering where a {{judicial}} pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview. In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant's true purpose for seeking the court's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government's freedom in relation to the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance. Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E

5|$|He later {{received}} appointments {{that took}} him away from Washington, D.C.. He served first as Governor of the Florida Territory from 1834 to 1836. In 1835, violence began to escalate between the Seminole Indians and white settlers. Members of the Seminole had signed Treaty of Payne's Landing in which they agreed to move westward. However, many began to resist. Eaton warned Jackson against an excessive show <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force,</b> fearing that this would only provoke the Seminole further. Jackson heeded his advice at first, but continuing to do so proved impossible, as Seminole attacks continued. The violence {{eventually led to the}} Second Seminole War. In 1836, Eaton was replaced as governor by Richard K. Call. Eaton was then appointed Ambassador to Spain, serving until 1840. His tenure was undistinguished.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security Council {{resolution}} were initially contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China {{were opposed to}} any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a second vote of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five {{permanent members of the}} UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution. On the following day, just hours after the OPCW Executive Council approved a detailed implementation plan for the U.S./Russian Framework, Security Council Resolution 2118 was unanimously passed, making the OPCW plan binding on the Syrians.|$|E
5|$|Biden is {{considered}} to be a moderate liberal, clocking a 77.5 percent liberal voting record in 2006 and lifetime score of 76.8 percent. Biden is Pro-Choice on abortion rated 100% by NARAL and supports a state's right to have civil unions. He favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and a rollback of the Bush tax cuts. He supports the PATRIOT Act, the war in Afghanistan and voted in favor of authorization <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> into Iraq. He believes a political solution can be met in Iraq through federalization. Biden would favor American military intervention into Sudan to end the Darfur genocide. He supports Gun control and was given an F by the NRA. He opposes the No Child Left Behind Act although he voted in favor of it in 2002. Biden opposes capital punishment and supports the continuation of the war on drugs. In 2007 he voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill and supports a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.

5|$|Upon {{the signing}} of the treaty, Tyler {{complied}} with the Texans' demand for military and naval protection, deploying troops to Fort Jesup in Louisiana and a fleet of warships to the Gulf of Mexico. In the event that the Senate failed to pass the treaty, Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution. Tyler's cabinet was split on the administration's handling of the Texas agreement. Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly, touting the economic and geostrategic benefits with relation to Great Britain. Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler's application <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> without congressional approval, a violation of the separation of powers. Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization, he resigned.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use <b>of</b> <b>Military</b> <b>Force</b> Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Through its {{absorption}} of the principalities of Novgorod (1478) and Pskov (1510), the Tsardom of Russia had become Livonia's eastern neighbour and grown stronger after annexing the khanates of Kazan (1552) and Astrakhan (1556). The conflict between Russia and the Western powers was exacerbated by Russia's isolation from sea trade. The new Ivangorod port built by Tsar Ivan {{on the eastern}} shore of the Narva River in 1550 was considered unsatisfactory on account of its shallow waters. Thereafter the tsar demanded that the Livonian Confederation pay about 6,000 marks to keep the Bishopric of Dorpat, based on the claim that every adult male had paid Pskov one mark when it had been an independent state. The Livonians eventually promised to pay this sum to Ivan by 1557, but were sent from Moscow when they failed to do so, ending negotiations. Ivan continued {{to point out that the}} existence of the Order required passive Russian support, and was quick to threaten use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> if necessary. He aimed to establish a corridor between the Baltic and the new territories on the Caspian Sea, because if Russia were to engage in open conflict with major western powers, it would need imports of more sophisticated weaponry.|$|E

40|$|A {{bilateral}} military co-operation between Norway and Sweden {{has essentially}} required handling security challenges and rising costs. In addition, during recent {{years it has}} been revealed that cooperation with other nations is a prerequisite to obtain operational influence in multinational operations. These operations have required <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> {{with a high level}} of interoperability, to get the necessary fighting power. The aim of this study is to describe each country’s understanding of the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces,</b> and then compare them. It is also to present an unbiased assessment of what kind of implications co-operation between Norway and Sweden may have on military interoperability. To achieve this intention, I have chosen to focus on contemporary military strategic and operational doctrines in Norway and Sweden by addressing the following questions: - What is the Norwegian understanding of the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces?</b> - What is the Swedish understanding of the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces?</b> - What kind of differences and similarities exist between the Norwegian and Swedish understanding of the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces?</b> The analysis indicated both similarities and differences between the Norwegian and Swedish understanding. I have focused on the differences. As basic tools in this study I have used NATO`s classification of interoperability and British reflections on what shapes an effective fighting power. The study has discovered that the two countries` understanding of the use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> does not form an acceptable basis for their <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> to be interoperable. Through different use of definitions and theories, implications are revealed as to the development and use <b>of</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces,</b> e. g. lack of common doctrines. These implications will reduce the general understanding which is necessary in a military co-operation. In its turn this may reduce the core interoperability. The study shows that if military co-operation is to be useful, it is important to have a common understanding of the doctrines that constitute the basis for military co-operation...|$|R
