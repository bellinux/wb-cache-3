This paper considers the estimation of split parameters that prescribe an origin-destination trip-table based on dynamic information regarding entering and exiting traffic volumes through an intersection or a small freeway segment. Two models are developed and motivated for this problem, one based on a least-squares estimation approach and the other based on a least absolute norm approach. Both models enhance existing dynamic origin-destination trip-table estimation models in that they also consider freeway segments having differing time-dependent transfer lags between different pairs of entrances and exits. A projected conjugate gradient scheme is employed for solving the constrained least-squares problem and is compared against a standard commercial software. The least absolute norm estimation problem is posed as a linear programming problem and is also solved using a commercial software {{for the sake of}} comparison.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the performance of multi-commodity capacitated networks in a deterministic but time-dependent environment. For a given time-dependent <b>origin-destination</b> <b>table,</b> the paper asks if it is easy to find a way of regulating the input flows into the network so as to avoid queues from growing internally; i. e., to avoid capacity violations. Problems of this type are conventionally approached in the traffic/transportation field with variational methods such as control theory (if time is continuous) and with mathematical programming (if time is discrete). However, these approaches can only be expected to work well if the set of feasible solutions is convex. Unfortunately, it is found in this paper {{that this is not the}} case. It is shown that continuous- time versions of the problem satisfying the smoothness conditions of control theory can have a finite but very large number of feasible solutions. The same happens for the discrete-time case. These difficulties arise even with the simplest versions of the problem (with unique origin-destination paths, perfect information and deterministic travel times). The paper also shows that the continuous-time feasibility problem is NP-hard, and that if we restrict our attention to (practical) problems whose data can be described with a finite number of bits (e. g., in discrete time), then the problem is NP-complete. These results are established by showing that the problem instances of interest can be related to the Directed Hamiltonian Path problem by a polynomial transformation...|$|E

It is also assumed that the time-dependent <b>origin-destination</b> <b>table</b> and the time-dependent bottleneck capacities are known, although not always a priori. The proposed control strategies attempt to minimize the total delay (including both system delay and access delay) while avoiding queues inside the system. The problem is formulated as a constrained calculus of variations exercise that can be cast in the conventional form of optimal control theory and can also be discretized as a mathematical program. Although the first-in-first-out (FIFO) requirement for the access queues introduces undesirable non-linearities, exact solutions for four important special cases can be obtained easily. More specifically, for networks with (1) a single origin or (2) a single bottleneck, a myopic strategy which requires the solution of a sequence of simple linear programs is optimal. For networks with (3) a single destination the non-linearities disappear and the problem becomes a large-scale linear program. This is also true for general networks if (4) the fractional distribution of flow across destinations for every origin is independent of time. A greedy heuristic algorithm is proposed for the general case. It has been programmed for a personal computer running Windows. The algorithm is non-anticipative in that it regulates access at the current time without using future information. As a result, it is computationally efficient and can be bolstered with dynamically-updated information. Globally optimal for cases (1) and (2), the heuristic has been developed with slow-varying O-D tables in mind. Significant improvements will likely require anticipatory information. An illustrative example is given. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a valid and {{efficient}} method for estimating <b>origin-destination</b> <b>tables</b> from roadside survey data. Roadside surveys, whether conducted by interviews or postcard mailback methods, typically have in common the sampling of trip origin and destination information at survey stations. These survey stations are generally located where roads cross "screenlines," which are imaginary barriers drawn to intercept the trip types of interest. Such surveys also include counts of traffic volumes, by which the partial <b>origin-destination</b> (O-D) <b>tables</b> obtained at the different stations can be expanded and combined to obtain the complete O-D table which represents travel throughout the entire study area. The procedure used to expand the sample O-D information from the survey stations must recognize and deal appropriately with a number of problems: 1. (i) The "double counting" problem: Long-distance trips may pass through more than one survey station location; thus certain trips have the possibility of being sampled and expanded more than once, leading to a potentially serious overrepresentation of long-distance trips in the complete expanded trip table. 2. (ii) The "leaky screenline" problem: Some route choices, particularly those using very lightly traveled roads, may miss the survey stations entirely, leading to an underestimation of certain O-D patterns, or to distorted estimates if such sites are arbitrarily coupled with actual nearby station locations. 3. (iii) The efficient use of the data: There is a need to adjust expansion factors to compensate for double counting and leaky screenlines. How can this be accomplished such that all of the data obtained at the stations are used without loss of information? 4. (iv) The consequences of uncertainty and unknown travel behavior: Since the O-D data and other sampled variables are subject to random error, and since in general the probability of encountering a long-distance trip at some survey stations is affected by traveler route-choice behavior, which is not understood, the sample expansion procedure must rely on the use of erroneous input data and questionable assumptions. The preferred procedure must minimize, rather than amplify, the effects of such input errors. Here, five alternate methods for expanding roadside survey data in an unbiased manner are proposed and evaluated. In all cases, it is assumed that traveler route choice generally follows the pattern described by Dial's multipath assignment method. All methods are applied to a simple hypothetical network in order to examine their efficiency and error amplification properties. The evaluation of the five methods reveals that their performance properties vary considerably and that no single method is best in all circumstances. A microcomputer program has been provided as a tool to facilitate comparison among methods and to select the most appropriate expansion method for a particular application. ...|$|R
