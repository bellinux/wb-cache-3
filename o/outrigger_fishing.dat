50|$|<b>Outrigger</b> <b>fishing</b> canoes {{are also}} used among certain non-Austronesian groups, such as the Sinhala in Sri Lanka, where they are known as oruwa, as well as among some groups in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The ethnological {{significance}} of this spread has been studied by James Hornell.|$|E
5000|$|The wood of H. tiliaceus has a {{specific}} gravity of 0.6. It {{has been used}} in a variety of applications, such as seacraft construction, firewood, and wood carvings. It is easy to plane and turns well, so it is regarded by many as a high quality furniture wood. Its tough bark can be made into durable rope and used for sealing cracks in boats. The bark and roots may be boiled to make a cooling tea to cool fevers, and its young leafy shoots may be eaten as vegetables. Native Hawaiians used the wood to make iako (spars) for waa (<b>outrigger</b> canoes), mouo (<b>fishing</b> net floats), and au koi (adze handles). Kaula ilihau (cordage) was made from the bast fibers. [...] Hau would be used to make ama (canoe floats) if wiliwili (Erythrina sandwicensis) was unavailable.|$|R
40|$|The Core-University Scientific Corporation Program {{has started}} between Philippines and Japan from 1998. The project of fishing craft is {{conducted}} {{to improve the}} performance of Philippine <b>outrigger</b> craft. Most <b>fishing</b> craft of the Philippines are constructed in the double outrigger form with a main hull and floats at both sides. Generally, a float and its beam are made of bamboo. In this paper, the characteristics of ship motions are experimentally investigated to clarify dangerous sea conditions for the craft in waves. A computer program has been developed to calculate ship motions of the craft. The accuracy of this computer program is checked by measurement of ship motions in waves. Furthermore, results of the calculation are in good agreement with the measured ones. From these results, the outriggers increase heaving and pitching motions in head seas at the short wave length, although significantly decrease heaving and rolling motions in beam seas. ...|$|R
