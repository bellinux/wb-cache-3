5|$|When {{moving through}} a fluid, {{rotating}} systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low Reynolds numbers (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) {{such as those}} experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas <b>oscillating</b> systems have the advantage at higher (inertia-dominated) Reynolds numbers. Whereas ship propellers typically have efficiencies around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered Gossamer Condor), much higher efficiencies, {{in the range of}} 96%–98%, can be achieved with an <b>oscillating</b> flexible foil like a fish tail or bird wing.|$|E

50|$|A {{chemical}} reaction cannot <b>oscillate</b> about {{a position of}} final equilibrium because the second law of thermodynamics requires that a thermodynamic system approach equilibrium and not recede from it.

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{was used by}} the LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transformer) energy converter which was installed on the island of Islay by Wavegen Ltd. It was a shore-based unit and generated power when waves run up the beach, creating pressure inside an inclined <b>oscillating</b> water column. This in turn creates pneumatic power which drives the twin 250kW generators. Islay LIMPET was opened in 2001 and was the world's first commercial scale wave-energy device. In March 2013 Voith Hydro decided to close down Wavegen choosing to concentrate on tidal power projects.|$|E

In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers Corners and southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands.

5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted <b>oscillating</b> chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology {{reported}} {{producing an}} electricity generating device (called flexible charge pump generator) delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide nanowires.

Researchers used wires with lengths of 0.2–0.3mm and diameters of three to five micrometers, but the device could be scaled down to smaller size.|$|E
5|$|The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follow trails laid by meat ants {{to locate}} them, and the snakes are also known {{to feed on}} the brood. Various species of spiders prefer to prey on meat ants, mainly {{attracted}} by the alarm pheromone the ants release. One spider, in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is a specialist predator against these ants and uses their alarm pheromones that are released during territorial disputes to locate them. These alarm signals are created by <b>oscillating</b> the body along the longitudinal axis, which are mostly released when an ant encounters a nest mate.|$|E

50|$|Chemical systems cannot <b>oscillate</b> about a {{position}} of final equilibrium because such an oscillation would violate the second law of thermodynamics. For a thermodynamic system which is not at equilibrium, this law requires that the system approach equilibrium and not recede from it. For a closed system at constant temperature and pressure, the thermodynamic requirement is that the Gibbs free energy must decrease continuously and not <b>oscillate.</b> However {{it is possible that}} the concentrations of some reaction intermediates <b>oscillate,</b> and also that the rate of formation of products <b>oscillates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{necessity}} of halteres in flight {{has been well}} documented, yet {{little is known about}} their use in other behaviors such as walking. Certain flies in the families Muscidae, Anthomyiidae, Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae, Tachinidae, and Micropedizae have been documented to <b>oscillate</b> their wings while walking in addition to during flight. The oscillation of the haltere is similar in amplitude and frequency during walking and flight for these flies, and the halteres always <b>oscillate</b> when walking or when flying. All other families of Diptera never <b>oscillate</b> their halteres while walking, but always do so while flying. Flesh flies are among those that <b>oscillate</b> their halteres while walking, and also perform more poorly at certain walking tasks when their halteres are removed. In contrast, fruit flies, which do not <b>oscillate</b> their halteres when walking, do not exhibit any differences in ability when their halteres are removed. This indicates that haltere inputs are behaviorally relevant to those species which <b>oscillate</b> them while walking and that they aid those individuals in walking behavior.|$|R
5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of <b>oscillating</b> aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{effect of}} these passages is often further enhanced by textural and/or cyclical devices, such as a sudden shift of musical texture, concomitant with the shift in tonality; the use of mechanically repetitive accompanimental patterns, such as ostinati and repeated chords, in the tonally remote or <b>oscillating</b> passages; and the allusion to previously stated material, which appeared earlier in the piece, in tonally detached passages. Schubert's frequent use of similar harmonic, textural and cyclical devices in his settings of poems depicting such emotional states, only strengthens the suggestion of these psychological connotations.|$|E
5|$|His {{controversial}} first mandate, {{marked by}} a political crisis and <b>oscillating</b> support from the PNL's leader Ion I. C. Brătianu, {{played a part in}} legislating land reform and repressed communist activities, before being brought down by the rally of opposition forces. His second term of 1926–1927 brought a much-debated treaty with Fascist Italy, and fell after Averescu gave clandestine backing to the ousted Prince Carol. Faced with the People Party's decline, Averescu closed deals with various right-wing forces and was instrumental in bringing Carol back to the throne in 1930. Relations between the two soured over the following years, and Averescu clashed with his fellow party member Octavian Goga over the king's attitudes. Shortly before his death, he and Carol reconciled, and Averescu joined the Crown Council.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the fifth-longest-lived Atlantic {{tropical}} or subtropical cyclone on record. The eleventh named {{storm and}} third hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Kyle {{developed as a}} subtropical cyclone on September 20 to the east-southeast of Bermuda. Looping westward, it transitioned into a tropical cyclone and became a hurricane on September 25. For the next two weeks, Kyle tracked generally westward, <b>oscillating</b> in strength several times because of fluctuations in environmental conditions. On October 11, the cyclone turned northeastward and made landfalls near Charleston, South Carolina, and Long Beach, North Carolina, at tropical storm status. After lasting as a cyclone for 22days, Kyle dissipated on October 12 as it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an <b>oscillating</b> body {{is an example of a}} Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E

The ups and downs of her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her <b>oscillating</b> actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E

5|$|The band {{structure}} of carbon nanotubes having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The <b>oscillating</b> shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but {{the latter is a}} semiconductor.|$|E
5|$|The statue has {{required}} repair work {{on several occasions}} to fix damage and defects. Only {{a few months after}} it was installed, it was reported to be <b>oscillating</b> in strong gusts of wind. Marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary. During the winter of 1908–09, frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part of the statue. It was found that between 60–80 leaks were letting water into the interior of the statue and causing further damage when it froze. It was also discovered that the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under its own weight on the two ends of its base. Repair work took place to remedy these problems.|$|E
5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included <b>oscillating</b> gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E
