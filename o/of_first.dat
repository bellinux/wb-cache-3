5|$|After the {{succession}} of King George I in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury {{as opposed to a}} single Lord High Treasurer became permanent. For the next three years, the government was headed by Lord Townshend, who was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Subsequently, Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland ran the government jointly, with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland managing domestic affairs. Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later; Townshend and Robert Walpole were then invited to form the next government. From that point, the holder of the office <b>of</b> <b>First</b> Lord also unofficially held the status of Prime Minister. It was not until the Edwardian era that the title Prime Minister was constitutionally recognised. With only few exceptions, the Prime Minister still holds the office <b>of</b> <b>First</b> Lord by constitutional convention.|$|E

However, he did provide a general coordination for heavy industry. When Alexei Kosygin, the Premier, was on sick leave in 1976 Brezhnev took advantage of his illness by appointing Tikhonov to the office <b>of</b> <b>First</b> Deputy Premier. As First Deputy Premier, Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby figure. Tikhonov was, however, {{one of the few who}} got along with both Brezhnev and Kosygin, both of them liked his candor and honesty. In 1978 Tikhonov was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and was made a voting member of the Politburo in 1979. Tikhonov was not informed of the decision to intervene in Afghanistan; the reason being his bad relationship with Dmitriy Ustinov, the Minister of Defence at the time.|$|E
