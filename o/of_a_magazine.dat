40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{underlying}} causes and implications {{of the relationship between}} the demographics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magazine's</b> readership base and its advertising rates. The analysis generates three central insights. First, not unexpectedly, <b>magazines</b> with <b>a</b> disproportionate fraction <b>of</b> readers who are young or affluent or both command a significant premium over other magazines of comparable size. Second, the magnitude of the premium paid for <b>magazines</b> with <b>a</b> disproportionate fraction <b>of</b> young or affluent or both readers is so large that it cannot solely be explained by standard economic explanations of media valuation. Third, if the size and demographic composition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magazine's</b> readership has <b>a</b> significant impact on <b>a</b> <b>magazine's</b> revenue stream, then there is an economic incentive to skew editorial content to readers that are more "valuable" to advertisers. This article provides some empirical evidence of the strength of these influences. ...|$|R

25|$|ASCII {{was founded}} in 1977 by Kazuhiko Nishi and Keiichiro Tsukamoto. Originally a {{publisher}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magazine</b> with the same name ASCII, talks between Bill Gates and Nishi led to a creation of Microsoft's first overseas sales office, ASCII Microsoft, in 1979. Nishi was also known {{for his role in}} marketing the MSX in 1983, an 8-bit standard computer well known in the former USSR and Japan. In 1984, ASCII engaged itself in semiconductor business, followed by a further expansion into commercial online service in 1985 under the brand of ASCII-NET. As the popularity of home video game systems soared in the 1980s, ASCII became active in the development and publishing of software and peripherals for popular consoles such as the Family Computer and Mega Drive. After Microsoft's public stock offering in 1986, ASCII Microsoft was dissolved. At around the same time, the company was also obliged to reform itself {{as a result of its}} aggressive diversification in the first half of the 1980s. The company went public in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Annie and Dixon {{are going}} through rough times after their parents' divorce and attempt to keep the family close. Debbie deals {{with the realities of}} being a newly single mother. Annie has spent the summer on house arrest (in {{addition}} to being on probation and having a suspended license) after confessing to her hit-and-run. Annie and Liam have feelings for each other but think it best to put it away so it doesn't interfere with their relationships with others. Annie finds romance with a college student, Charlie, who turns out to be Liam's half-brother. Charlie and Annie {{have a lot in common}} and both are theater kids. Liam has a tumultuous relationship with Charlie due to their rocky past. Teddy and Silver are happy to be together, but in the earthquake Teddy injures his leg, which could possibly end his tennis career. Teddy is also struggling with his sexuality, after realizing that he drunkenly slept with another guy, Ian. After some discouraging behavior from Teddy, Silver breaks up with him. This discouraging behavior was a result of Teddy being so insecure with himself being gay. With all that going on in school, Adrianna is driving back from a summer of touring with the pop star, Javier. The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to get her back, Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her to do some things she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to give in to the threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>magazine.</b> She begins to treat Victor badly and starts alienating Navid and her friends. Navid, however, begins to have family problems when he and Silver discover that his father has been employing underage girls to be in his porn films.
