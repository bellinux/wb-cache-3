40|$|Acceptance {{testing of}} the Turboprop Test Chamber was {{conducted}} during the weeks of 27 April and 4 May 1964. The tests were conducted by personnel from the Overhaul and Repair Department, Alameda Naval Air Station, from the Bureau of Naval Weapons Fleet Readiness Represent­ative, Pacific and from the USNPGS Department of Aeronautics. The power plant utilized for correlating purposes for a T- 56 -lOW turboprop engine, recently overhauled at NAS Alameda while the propeller was the Hamilton Standard model required for this engine. The test data reveal satisfactory correlation of the engine performance data with the Alameda test results. The discrepancies that do appear {{are the result of}} errors in the instrumentation system and do not present a major problem. All of the major facility systems function satisfactorily except the oil supply system and the chamber lighting fixtures. Engine starting and control systems were adequate although somewhat different from the designs utilized in the NAVWEPS specifica­tions for this engine. The engine support stand and thrust measuring assembly were found to be structurally sound and functioned satisfactorily. The propeller orifice assembly did not induce prohibitive vibrational stresses as was anticipated. However, the vibrational loads did cause the majority of the orifice retaining bolts to loosen during the test sequence. Three bolts were found beneath the test stand; these could have caused object damage to the engine. The major areas of discrepancy are the engine oil supply system and the test chamber lighting fixtures. The engine oil system as designed could not satisfy the requirements for the T- 56 series engine. It was necessary to re-route the <b>oil</b> <b>by-pass</b> system, to obtain a more precise control of the engine oil supply and pressure, and to provide a method to heat the oil for operation of the engine at high power set­tings. The system as temporarily modified, did function adequately during the test period. The lighting fixtures mounted on swivel joint bases oscillated vio­lently when operating the engine at Idle power. One fixture above the engine broke loose during this short period and was blown clear of the engine stand by the propeller air stream. All ceiling-mounted light fixtures were removed from the chamber before further engine operation. The acoustic survey revealed that the acoustic paneling in the in­ let and the exhaust passages functioned satisfactorily. However, the Sound Pressure Level reduction across the chamber front double-doors did not meet the specified limits. Corrective action is required to (1) provide adequate and safe lighting in the test chamber, (2) re-design and install an oil supply system compatible for operation with the T- 56 engine, and (3) provide positive locking devices on all bolted fixtures in the test chambers...|$|E
30|$|The gas {{flooding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} accepted and widely used methods for enhancing oil recovery (EOR) from oil reservoirs (Green and Willhite 1998; Lake 1996; Franklin and Orr 2007). However, since the viscosity of the gas is an order of magnitude lower than liquid, gas often fails to displace oil in a piston-like manner and tends to <b>by-pass</b> <b>oil</b> in the form of fingers and channels, especially when high permeability streaks present. Another problem encountered by gas injection is gravity segregation due to the low density of gas vs. oil, which causes gas to <b>by-pass</b> <b>oil</b> through gravity tongues (Namani et al. 2012). To overcome these problems, operators often inject a small slug of foaming surfactant before beginning gas injection with the aim of generating foam to reduce the mobility of injected gas as many studies have suggested (Bond et al. 1958), (Hirasaki 1985). This EOR method is called single-cycle surfactant-alternating-gas (SAG) or unsteady state test.|$|R

Waterflooding has become standard practice for extending the productive life of many solution gas drive reservoirs, but has the disadvantage of leaving a substantial residual oil volume in the reservoir. Solvent flooding has been offered as a method whereby oil may be completely displaced from the reservoir, leaving no residual volume. Field results have demonstrated that solvent floods suffer from early solvent breakthrough and considerable <b>oil</b> <b>by-passing</b> owing to high solvent mobility. The injection of both water and solvent has been demonstrated to offer advantages. Water partially mitigates both the adverse mobility and high cost of solvent floods, while solvent mobilizes oil which would be left in the reservoir by water alone. The process is equally applicable to reservoirs currently at residual oil saturation (tertiary floods) and to reservoirs at maximum oil saturation (secondary floods). In stratified reservoirs high permeability layers may be preferentially swept by solvent floods, while low permeability layers may be scarcely swept at all. Presence or absence of transverse communication between layers can modify overall sweep efficiency. This work is a study of water-solvent injection in stratified reservoirs based on computer simulation results. Fractional oil recovery as a function of injected solvent fraction, permeability contrast between layers, initial oil saturation, and presence or absence of transverse communication between strata has been determined. Results are presented as a series of optimization curves. Permeability contrast between layers is shown to be the dominant control on fractional oil recovery. Transverse communicating reservoirs are shown to require a higher solvent-water ratio in order to attain recoveries comparable to transverse noncommunicating reservoirs. In actual field projects, water and solvent are injected alternately as discrete slugs. This process is known as "WAG" for "water-alternating-gas". In the simulations used in this study, continuous water-solvent injection at a fixed fraction rather than true WAG was employed. It is demonstrated that the two methods give equivalent results. In summary, this work is the first comprehensive study of the behavior of stratified reservoirs undergoing water-solvent injection...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{demonstrate}} targeted infill and extension drilling opportunities, better determinations of oil-in-place, and methods for improved completion efficiency. The investigations and demonstrations were focussed on Red River and Ratcliffe reservoirs in the Williston Basin within portions of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. Both of these formations have been successfully explored with conventional 2 -dimensional (2 D) seismic. Improved reservoir characterization utilizing 3 -dimensional (3 D) seismic was investigated for identification of structural and stratigraphic reservoir compartments. These seismic characterizations were integrated with geological and engineering studies. The project tested lateral completion techniques, including high-pressure jetting lance technology and short-radius lateral drilling to enhance completion efficiency. Lateral completions should improve economics for both primary and secondary oil where low permeability is a problem and higher-density drilling of vertical infill wells is limited by drilling cost. New vertical wells were drilled to test bypassed oil in ares that were identified by 3 D seismic. These new wells are expected to recover as much or greater oil than was produced by nearby old wells. The project tested water injection through vertical and horizontal wells in reservoirs where application of waterflooding has been limited. A horizontal well was drilled for testing water injection. Injection rates were tested at three times that of a vertical well. This demonstration well shows that water injection with horizontal completions can improve injection rates for economic waterflooding. This report {{is divided into two}} sections, part 1 covers the Red River and part 2 covers the Ratcliffe. Each part summarizes integrated reservoir characterizations and outlines methods for targeting <b>by-passed</b> <b>oil</b> reserves in the respective formation and locality...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringManaged {{pressure}} drilling (MPD) {{has been}} known to the industry for a few years. MPD with the ability of coping with risky down-hole pressure situations has gained a great deal of attention. Compared to MPD, the drilling method designated ‘’through tubing drilling’’ (TTD) is considerably younger. StatoilHydro, as one of the TTD pioneers, has drilled TTD wells in its North Sea assets, of which the majority have been the ‘’through tubing rotary drilling’’ (TTRD) wells. The aim of initiating this technology was to access small and <b>by-passed</b> <b>oil</b> pools in mature assets in a cost effective manner, since TTRD rules out the need of pulling the well completion. From StatoilHydro’s experience we see that TTRD is one of the complex drilling methods. Drilling by this technique has seen a number of challenges and drilling problems. In fact, the majority of these problems are linked to system and down-hole pressure environments, and thus to drilling hydraulics. Pressure induced drilling problems can be solved by application of MPD. The idea in this study is that the simultaneous application of TTRD and MPD will enable us to mitigate problems relating to pressure conditions and drill cost effective TTRD. Therefore, this thesis was initiated to study the hydraulics of ‘’through tubing rotary managed pressure drilling’’ (TTRMPD). In this study two specially looked at MPD methods: back pressure and continuous circulation system allow for the reduction of the static mud weight in order to manage circulating mud weight and stay within available drilling window. This study looks into hydraulics of the TTRMPD operation in terms of equivalent circulating density (ECD), hole-cleaning, extended reach ability. In the TTRD, ECD management is particularly challenging due to narrow annular clearance. This master thesis focuses on the feasibility of combining MPD and TTRD to improve the ECD management in TTRD. We will look into the effects that the reducing mud weight may have on drilling parameters...|$|R
40|$|The Oklahoma Geological Survey (OGS), the Geo Information Systems department, and the School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering at the University of Oklahoma {{are engaged}} in a five-year program to {{identify}} and address Oklahoma`s oil recovery opportunities in fluvial-dominated deltaic (FDD) reservoirs. This program includes a systematic and comprehensive collection and evaluation of information on all FDD oil reservoirs in Oklahoma and the recovery technologies that have been (or could be) applied to those reservoirs with commercial success. During 1996, three highly successful FDD workshops involving 6 producing formations (4 plays) were completed: (1) Layton and Osage-Layton April 17 (2) Prue and Skinner June 19 and 26 (3) Cleveland October 17 (4) Peru October 17 (combined with Cleveland play). Each play was presented individually using the adopted protocol of stratigraphic interpretations, a regional overview, and two or more detailed field studies. The project goal was to have one field study from each play selected for waterflood simulation in order to demonstrate enhanced recovery technologies {{that can be used to}} recovery secondary oil. In this effort, software utilized for reservoir simulation included Eclipse and Boast 111. In some cases, because of poor production records and inadequate geologic data, field studies completed in some plays were not suitable for modeling. All of the workshops included regional sandstone trend analysis, updated field boundary identification, a detailed bibliography and author reference map, and detailed field studies. Discussion of general FDD depositional concepts was also given. In addition to the main workshop agenda, the workshops provided computer mapping demonstrations and rock cores with lithologic and facies interpretations. In addition to the workshops, other elements of FDD program were improved during 1996. Most significant was the refinement of NRIS MAPS - a user-friendly computer program designed to access NRIS data and interface with mapping software such as Arc View in order to produce various types of information maps. Most commonly used are well base maps for field studies, lease production maps, and regional maps showing well production codes, formation show codes, well spud dates, and well status codes. These regional maps are valuable in identifying areas of <b>by-passed</b> <b>oil</b> production, field trends, and time periods of development for the various FDD plays in Oklahoma. Besides maps, NRIS MAPS provides data in table format which can be used to generate production decline curves and estimates of cumulative hydrocarbon production for leases and fields. Additionally, many computer-related services were provided by support staff concerning technical training, private consultation, computer mapping, and data acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Within the Illinois Basin, {{most of the}} oilfields are {{mature and}} have been {{extensively}} waterflooded with water cuts that range up to 99 % {{in many of the}} larger fields. In order to maximize production of significant remaining mobile oil from these fields, new recovery techniques need to be researched and applied. The purpose of this project was to conduct reservoir characterization studies supporting Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer Floods in two distinct sandstone reservoirs in Lawrence Field, Lawrence County, Illinois. A project using alkaline-surfactantpolymer (ASP) has been established in the century old Lawrence Field in southeastern Illinois where original oil in place (OOIP) is estimated at over a billion barrels and 400 million barrels have been recovered leaving more than 600 million barrels as an EOR target. Radial core flood analysis using core from the field demonstrated recoveries greater than 20 % of OOIP. While the lab results are likely optimistic to actual field performance, the ASP tests indicate that substantial reserves could be recovered even if the field results are 5 to 10 % of OOIP. Reservoir characterization is a key factor in the success of any EOR application. Reservoirs within the Illinois Basin are frequently characterized as being highly compartmentalized resulting in multiple flow unit configurations. The research conducted on Lawrence Field focused on characteristics that define reservoir compartmentalization in order to delineate preferred target areas so that the chemical flood can be designed and implemented for the greatest recovery potential. Along with traditional facies mapping, core analyses and petrographic analyses, conceptual geological models were constructed and used to develop 3 D geocellular models, a valuable tool for visualizing reservoir architecture and also a prerequisite for reservoir simulation modeling. Cores were described and potential permeability barriers were correlated using geophysical logs. Petrographic analyses were used to better understand porosity and permeability trends in the region and to characterize barriers and define flow units. Diagenetic alterations that impact porosity and permeability include development of quartz overgrowths, sutured quartz grains, dissolution of feldspar grains, formation of clay mineral coatings on grains, and calcite cementation. Many of these alterations are controlled by facies. Mapping efforts identified distinct flow units {{in the northern part of}} the field showing that the Pennsylvanian Bridgeport consists of a series of thick incised channel fill sequences. The sandstones are about 75 - 150 feet thick and typically consist of medium grained and poorly sorted fluvial to distributary channel fill deposits at the base. The sandstones become indistinctly bedded distributary channel deposits in the main part of the reservoir before fining upwards and becoming more tidally influenced near their top. These channel deposits have core permeabilities ranging from 20 md to well over 1000 md. The tidally influenced deposits are more compartmentalized compared to the thicker and more continuous basal fluvial deposits. Fine grained sandstones that are laterally equivalent to the thicker channel type deposits have permeabilities rarely reaching above 250 md. Most of the unrecovered oil in Lawrence Field is contained in Pennsylvanian Age Bridgeport sandstones and Mississippian Age Cypress sandstones. These reservoirs are highly complex and compartmentalized. Detailed reservoir characterization including the development of 3 -D geologic and geocellular models of target areas in the field were completed to identify areas with the best potential to recover remaining reserves including unswept and <b>by-passed</b> <b>oil.</b> This project consisted of tasks designed to compile, interpret, and analyze the data required to conduct reservoir characterization for the Bridgeport and Cypress sandstones in pilot areas in anticipation of expanded implementation of ASP flooding in Lawrence Field. Geologic and geocellular modeling needed for reservoir characterization and reservoir simulation were completed as prerequisites for design of efficient ASP flood patterns. Characterizing the complex reservoir geology that identifies the geologic conditions that will optimize oil recoveries for expansion of the ASP pilots in the Bridgeport and Cypress sandstones to other areas of Lawrence Field is the primary objective of this project. It will permit evaluation of efficiency of oil recovery from Bridgeport and Cypress sandstone reservoirs using ASP technology. Additionally evaluation of similar Pennsylvanian and Chesterian reservoirs shows that it is likely that ASP flood technology can be successfully applied to similar reservoirs in the Illinois Basin as well as to other U. S. reservoirs. Chemical flooding was introduced in stages with the first flood initiated in 2010 and a second offset pilot project initiated during 2011. Rex Energy Corporation is reporting a positive response on its ASP Middagh pilot project in the Pennsylvanian Bridgeport B reservoir, Lawrence Field. Oil response in the 15 acre flood has continued to show an increase in oil cut from 1 % to 12 %. Total pattern production increased from 16 BOPD and stabilized at a range of 65 - 75 BOPD in the last three months of 2011. Peak production rose to 100 + BOPD. Oil cut in the pilot increased for 1. 0 % to ~ 12. 0 % with an individual well showing oil cuts greater than 20 %. A second, 58 acre pilot (Perkins-Smith) adjacent to and likely in communication with the Middagh pilot has been initiated. Preliminary brine injection has been implemented and ASP injection was initiated in mid- 2012. Response is expected by mid- 2013 with peak recovery expected by late 2013. Rex Energy is projecting full scale expansion with the next step of development being a 351 acre project scheduled to begin in mid- 2013. Preliminary development has been initiated in this Delta Unit area located in the south half of section 32, T 4 N, R 12 W...|$|R
40|$|About 60 % of {{oil still}} lays {{trapped in the}} {{reservoir}} even after primary and secondary recovery processes have been completed. This trapped oil could be residual or <b>by-passed</b> <b>oil.</b> Residual oil {{occurs as a result}} of high capillary action of water that keeps the oil immobile. One way ofrecovering this capillary trapped oil is by flooding the reservoir with surfactants. Surfactants are surface active agents that act on the interface between oil and water with the aim of reducing the interfacial tension between them thereby causing trapped oil to flow. In the Norne field E-Segment, pockets of oil are still trapped after water flooding for a number of years, especially in the Ile and Tofte Formations which holds about 80 % of oil in the Norne E-Segment. With increasing water cut and reduced oil production, it becomes obvious that water flooding alone cannot recover the oil effectively, thus a need for an enhancing agent, like surfactant. When flooding the reservoir with surfactants, {{it is very important to}} ascertain the right quantity of surfactant that would yield the maximum recovery without unnecessary waste of the surfactant because of the high cost. In this thesis, a series of screening methods were used in order to come up with the appropriate surfactant quantity and concentration that would yield maximum recovery of trapped oil at a minimal cost. The first step was modeling of continuous surfactant flooding into the reservoir for a period of 4 years and 7 years respectively. It was discovered that flooding the reservoir for a period of 7 years did not necessarily lead to a better oil recovery than flooding for 4 years. Also, flooding for 7 years led to a high quantity of surfactant injection into the reservoir and a subsequent production of same at the producer well E- 2 H. A situation like this is not desirable because of the cost of surfactants. Having established that a 4 -year surfactant injection period is preferable to a 7 -year period, the second step was to compare between slug injection of surfactants at 2 months intervals and at 6 months intervals respectively. It was discovered that injecting surfactant slug every 2 months(that is 3 times in a year) did not necessarily do better than injecting at every 6 months interval. Also, injecting surfactant every 2 months required very high quantities of surfactants to meetthe demand. Also there is a high production of surfactant at the producer well. Having confirmed through reservoir modeling that surfactant slug injection for a 6 -month interval is better than that of a 2 -month interval, the next step was to compare between continuous surfactant injection for 4 years and surfactant slug injection for 4 years (at 6 -monthinterval). Continuous surfactant flooding was discarded in favor of the slug injection because of the high quantity of surfactant needed compared to the quantity needed in case of slug injection. Also, continuous surfactant flooding did not necessarily lead to better oil recovery than slug surfactant flooding. Having established that the most effective method to inject surfactant into the reservoir is slug injection for 4 years at 6 months interval, the next challenge was to determine the appropriate surfactant concentration that would be needed for optimal recovery of residual oil. Eight (8) different surfactant concentrations were modeled and these include concentrations at 10 kg/m 3, 20 kg/m 3, 30 kg/m 3, 40 kg/m 3, 50 kg/m 3, 60 kg/m 3, 80 kg/m 3 and 100 kg/m 3. Net present value (NPV) was used to determine the best concentration that would yield the maximum profit. The concentration of 10 kg/m 3 gave the best NPV. Having discovered that the surfactant slug of 10 kg/m 3 concentration would yield better recovery, the next task was to check the effect of drilling new wells or re-completing already drilled wells on recovery. Four cases were considered; 1. Original wells without injection of surfactant slug. 2. Original wells with surfactant slug injection. 3. Injecting surfactant slug into original wells in addition to a newly drilled well. 4. Injecting surfactant slug into wells that had been re-completed/extended in addition toa newly drilled well. From the economic analysis, it was discovered that recompleting the wells in addition to a new well gave the best NPV followed by the case where surfactant was injected to the original well with a newly drilled well. All these options did better than the base-case where surfactant was not injected at all. The case of re-completion of the wells gave a better recovery because the re-completed wells were made to inject surfactants directly into the Ile and Tofte formations which hold about 80 % of oil in the reservoir. In conclusion, surfactant flooding is a good option for the Norne field E-Segment especially when the Ile and Tofte formations are targeted. Based on this conclusion, it is recommended that the right surfactant structure that would be suitable for the Norne field E-Segment fluid and rock property be developed in the laboratory (this thesis involved only simulation studies). It is also important that up-scaling the appropriate laboratory identified surfactants to a field-scale usage be done correctly. Studies have shown that the reason why many surfactants that seem to do well in the laboratory but do not do well in the field is due to incorrect up-scaling. The timing of surfactant injection into the Norne field E-Segment is also recommended to be early in the life of the field. This is because of the heterogeneous nature of the field. Injection of surfactant at a later time might not lead to optimum oil recovery. Thus, simulation studies show that surfactant injection, at the appropriate time is good for the Norne E- Segment. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of growing energy demands, the declining performance of conventional oil fields and attractive {{oil prices have}} renewed interest in both Heavy Oil resources (HO) and the methods of exploiting them. The vast volume of these resources notwithstanding, their low reservoir-scale mobility precludes exploitation using traditional primary and secondary recovery techniques, making enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods (both thermal and non-thermal) natural candidates. However, the influence of several factors, technical and non-technical, require that rigorous studies inform the choice of EOR method(s). HO is a thick, viscous, tar-like crude oil that does not pump easily or flow well. This presents huge challenges when estimating reserves and extracting them from the reservoir, as does pipeline transportation to refineries. Increasingly, focus is moving towards those technologies that can most efficiently recover and process HO. The challenge here is finding {{the best way to}} produce, transport and process the oil. In this study, the focus is on how to identify the best way to recover the HO medium from an unconsolidated sand stone reservoir; to achieve this aim the Lower Fars formation in Kuwait is used as an exemplary case to test our screening methodology and to discover the best strategies. At present, Kuwait is pursuing a national objective to produce 4 million barrels per day (b/d) of oil by the year 2020. However, this target can only be achieved sustainably with HO development. Although there is evidence in the Kuwait Oil Company’s (KOC) long-term plan that this is understood, there is not yet a clear-cut strategy for its realisation. Hence, the primary objective {{of this study is to}} establish possible development options for the medium heavy oil reservoirs. Other objectives include understanding the physics of selected thermal EOR processes in different medium heavy oil reservoirs and developing a robust screening tool for HO resources. Numerical modelling studies will be used to achieve these objectives. Given the huge number of EOR methods and their various combinations, it is not pragmatic to conduct detailed studies on each method for potential application to the reservoir. To accelerate decision-making, using experiences taken from field performances elsewhere, a relatively simple screening procedure has been developed and implemented. Using this tool, less favourable options have been eliminated, retaining only the ‘best’ options for further evaluation; these are unheated-water flooding, hot water flooding, Steam flooding (SF) and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS). For the preliminary numerical simulations, a homogenous, three-phase and multi-component numerical model was constructed using the known (average) geological, petrophysical and fluid properties of the Northern sector of the Ratqa field. Information from analogue fields and correlations was also used to complete the data. The reservoir was considered homogeneous in the first part of the study, allowing for the separation of process effects from reservoir geology. The second part of this study presents the results of the sensitivity study on a small scale model, extracted from a large field scale sector model of 0. 9 Million cells. Several simulation runs were conducted to investigate the effects of petrophysical properties and operating variables on the performance of unheated-water flood, hot water flood, steam flood processes, and CSS. The simulation results show that any positive impacts from thermal injection on oil production are not instantaneous - they only become noticeable after an appreciable number of pore volumes have been injected. This finding is attributed to the time lag required to heat up the reservoir to a temperature that gives reasonable reduction of oil viscosity, creating a more favourable mobility ratio. In addition to giving a higher ultimate recovery rate, the preliminary results also indicate that high-temperature operation accelerates performance. From an economic viewpoint, production acceleration would improve overall project economics by mitigating the negative impact of discounting on the revenue stream. Another important finding from the simulation study is that while hot water flood is characterised by a stable displacement of oil by water, unstable fronts are evident in the cold-water process, resulting in a significant quantity of <b>by-passed</b> <b>oil.</b> When conducting the study it was also imperative to conduct a detailed economic analysis to assess the economic feasibility of each recovery process/case. To achieve this, a preliminary matrix of the main factors was integrated into the developed economic model. The input for project performance specified cumulative oil recovery (income) versus cumulative energy injected into the reservoir in terms of heated fluids (cost). Continuing the work to investigate the best development options for a major unconsolidated, shallow HO reservoir a comparative study and a sensitivity analysis of various operational conditions and reservoir parameters were conducted in order to: (1) find the best conditions to achieve a high RF, and (2) to understand the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on the reservoir’s performance. The operational parameters investigated are injected fluid type, injection swapping time and the perforation location. The reservoir parameters examined are oil viscosity, initial water saturation, porosity and permeability. In addition to studying these reservoir parameters, oil price sensitivity was investigated to evaluate the financial feasibility of the selected recovery methods within both the historical and forecasted oil price range. The preliminary results show that the recovery factor (RF) is very sensitive to the oil viscosity value and the relationship between them is nonlinear. The simulation results also indicate that an increase in the porosity and permeability accelerates performance; however, the opposite is not true of the initial water saturation value. From an economic perspective, production acceleration would improve overall project economics by mitigating the negative impacts of discounting on the revenue stream due to the low oil price. Economically, successive ({{combination of}} injected fluids) cases support successful investment at the lowest (expected) oil price; in contrast, the continuous steam and hot water flooding development options show a higher economic risk after the second year. This work contributes significantly towards our understanding of the performance of different development options in high permeability HO reservoirs. This is critical for the decision making process when determining the applicability of EOR recovery methods and their successful application in the field. Open Acces...|$|R
