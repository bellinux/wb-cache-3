An <b>odd</b> <b>copy,</b> in The Bun's rag-and-bone library, of Hone's Every-Day Book had revealed to me {{the existence of a}} village dance founded, like all village dances, on Druidical mysteries connected with the Solar Solstice (which is always unchallengeable) and Mid-summer Morning, which is dewy and refreshing to the London eye. For this I take no credit--Hone being a mine any one can work--but that I rechristened that dance, after I had revised it, 'The Gubby' is my title to immortal fame. It was still to be witnessed, I wrote, 'in all its poignant purity at Huckley, that last home of significant mediæval survivals'; and I fell so in love with my creation that I kept it back for days, enamelling and burnishing.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} four acts {{take place}} in Hjalmar Ekdal's apartments. The Ekdals initially appear to be living a life of cozy domesticity. Hjalmar's father makes a living doing <b>odd</b> <b>copying</b> jobs for Werle. Hjalmar runs a portrait studio out of the apartment. Gina helps him run the business in addition to keeping house. They both dote on their daughter Hedvig. Gregers travels directly to their home from the party. While getting acquainted with the family, Hjalmar confesses that Hedvig is both his greatest joy and greatest sorrow, because she is slowly losing her eyesight. The family eagerly reveals a loft in the apartment where they keep various animals like rabbits and pigeons. Most prized is the wild duck they rescued. The duck was wounded {{by none other than}} Werle, whose eyesight is also failing. His shot winged the duck, which dived {{to the bottom of the}} lake to drown itself by clinging to the seaweed. Werle's dog retrieved it though, and despite its wounds from the shot and the dog's teeth, the Ekdals had nursed the duck back to good health.|$|R

50|$|Founded in 2004, the Festival {{originated}} in Wisconsin and Minnesota by Joe Pickett, Nick Prueher and Geoff Haas, childhood friends from Wisconsin. While {{still in high}} school, Pickett and Prueher began collecting videos from garage sales, training videos from <b>odd</b> jobs, and <b>copies</b> of tapes from a video production house. The friends would then play selections from this collection for entertainment at parties, a practice which continued through their college years at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. In 2004, Pickett and Prueher quit their day jobs to focus on production of their first feature documentary, Dirty Country. They started the touring Found Footage Festival show to fund {{the production of the}} documentary. In addition to its regular touring schedule, the Festival has appeared at the HBO US Comedy Arts Festival, Just For Laughs (the Montreal comedy festival), the New York Comedy Festival, the Impakt Festival in the Netherlands, and the Central Standard Film Festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

You have an excellent memory, {{and you may not}} have forgotten that I received a note from Major Milroy's mother (after she had engaged me as governess) on Monday last. It was dated and signed; and here it is, as far as the first page: 'June 23d, 1851. Dear Madam--Pray excuse my troubling you, before you go to Thorpe Ambrose, with a word more about the habits observed in my son's household. When I had the pleasure of seeing you at two o'clock to-day, in Kingsdown Crescent, I had another appointment in a distant part of London at three; and, in the hurry of the moment, one or two little matters escaped me which I think I ought to impress on your attention.' The rest of the letter is not of the slightest importance, but the lines that I have just copied are well worthy of all the attention you can bestow on them. They have saved me from discovery, my dear, before I have been a week in Major Milroy's service! ...|$|R
40|$|The human {{salivary amylase}} genes display {{extensive}} copy number variation (CNV), and recent work has implicated this variation in adaptation to starch-rich diets, and {{in association with}} body mass index. In this work, we use paralogue ratio tests, microsatellite analysis, read depth and fibre-FISH to demonstrate that human amylase CNV is not a smooth continuum, but is instead partitioned into distinct haplotype classes. There is a fundamental structural distinction between haplotypes containing odd or even numbers of AMY 1 gene units, in turn coupled to CNV in pancreatic amylase genes AMY 2 A and AMY 2 B. Most haplotypes have one copy each of AMY 2 A and AMY 2 B and contain an <b>odd</b> number of <b>copies</b> of AMY 1; consequently, most individuals have an even total number of AMY 1. In contrast, haplotypes carrying an even number of AMY 1 genes have rearrangements leading to CNVs ofAMY 2 A/AMY 2 B. Read-depth and experimental data showthat different populations harbour different proportions of these basic haplotype classes. In Europeans, the copy numbers of AMY 1 and AMY 2 A are correlated, so that phenotypic associations caused by variation in pancreatic amylase copy number could be detected indirectly as weak association with AMY 1 copy number. We showthat the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay previously applied to the high-throughput measurement of AMY 1 copy number is less accurate than the measures we use and that qPCR data in other studies have been further compromised by systematic miscalibration. Our results uncover new patterns in human amylase variation and imply a potential role for AMY 2 CNV in functional associations...|$|R
40|$|Rare {{mutations}} of the {{low-density lipoprotein}} receptor gene (LDLR) cause familial hypercholesterolemia, {{which increases the}} risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Less {{is known about the}} implications of common genetic variation in the LDLR gene regarding the variability of cholesterol levels and risk of CAD. Imputed genotype data at the LDLR locus on 1 644 individuals of a population-based sample were explored for association with LDL-C level. Replication of association with LDL-C level was sought for the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the LDLR gene in three European samples comprising 6 642 adults and 533 children. Association of this SNP with CAD was examined in six case-control studies involving more than 15 000 individuals. Each copy of the minor T allele of SNP rs 2228671 within LDLR (frequency 11 %) was related to a decrease of LDL-C levels by 0. 19 mmol/L (95 % confidence interval (CI) [0. 13 - 0. 24] mmol/L, p = 1. 5 x 10 (- 10)). This association with LDL-C was uniformly found in children, men, and women of all samples studied. In parallel, the T allele of rs 2228671 was associated with a significantly lower risk of CAD (<b>Odds</b> Ratio per <b>copy</b> of the T allele: 0. 82, 95 % CI [0. 76 - 0. 89], p = 2. 1 x 10 (- 7)). Adjustment for LDL-C levels by logistic regression or Mendelian Randomisation models abolished the significant association between rs 2228671 with CAD completely, indicating a functional link between the genetic variant at the LDLR gene locus, change in LDL-C and risk of CAD. A common variant at the LDLR gene locus affects LDL-C levels and, thereby, the risk for CAD...|$|R
