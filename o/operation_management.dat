Under {{the second}} Karachi Water Supply Project, the World Bank contributed with US$92 million to {{increase}} water supply coverage and sanitation in Karachi {{and to improve}} <b>operation,</b> <b>management</b> and financial viability of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB). The project started in 1993 and provided {{for the construction of}} a canal to bring water from the Indus River, pumping stations, water and wastewater treatment facilities. In low income areas, small bore sewers were to be built. The operational efficiency of KWSB was expected to improve through technical assistance by the World Bank and increased cost reduction measures, e.g. reduction of water losses.|$|E
25|$|Operations {{management}} {{is an area}} of management concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. It involves the responsibility of ensuring that business operations are efficient in terms of using as few resources as needed and effective in terms of meeting customer requirements. It is concerned with managing an entire production system which is the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services), as an asset or delivers a product or services. Operations produce products, manage quality and creates service. <b>Operation</b> <b>management</b> covers sectors like banking systems, hospitals, companies, working with suppliers, customers, and using technology. Operations {{is one of the major}} functions in an organization along with supply chains, marketing, finance and human resources. The operations function requires management of both the strategic and day-to-day production of goods and services.|$|E

40|$|Several {{publications}} {{have appeared}} in the field of <b>Operations</b> <b>Management</b> which rank <b>Operations</b> <b>Management</b> related journals. Several ranking systems exist for journals based on, for example, perceived relevance and quality, citation, and author affiliation. Many academics also publish at conferences but we have not come across publications that rank conferences. Conference rankings are generally more complicated than journal rankings. Journal rankings are primarily for publishing purposes. Conferences on the other hand are attended by people for different reasons. In this paper the first attempt is made in developing an <b>operations</b> <b>management</b> conference ranking based upon author affiliation. Ranking based on an analysis of author affiliation assumes that one important motive for participants is to attend a high quality research conference. With that assumption it is reasonable to use the author affiliation approach. Based upon an existing ranking of institutes that offer <b>operations</b> <b>management</b> programs a ranking list of affiliations is developed. Subsequently, we compare several <b>operations</b> <b>management</b> related conferences such as POMS, EurOMA, OSCM and the <b>Operations</b> <b>Management</b> Division of the Academy of Management based on that ranked list of institutes. The results provide information for authors that help in deciding which <b>operations</b> <b>management</b> oriented conferences to attend...|$|R
