The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown.

25|$|Usually {{referred}} to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may take many forms, naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face peering out of dense foliage. Some may have leaves for hair, perhaps with a leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.|$|E

25|$|Case Study: One {{veterinarian}} {{reported that}} a dog was presented with a severe edema of the muzzle and several maxillary fractures of unknown cause. The maxilla was wired and the dog sent home. Four days later the owner noticed that skin and subcutaneous tissue appeared to be sloughing, so the veterinarian was again consulted. <b>On</b> <b>closer</b> examination, some of the teeth {{were found to be}} fractured and rotting and therefore, extracted. At this point, maggots were observed throughout the injured area, and the veterinarian took several radiographs. The radiographs indicated that almost 100 pieces of lead buckshot were present throughout the area. In this case, the presence of the maggots alerted the veterinarian to the more serious nature of the injuries.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 February 1942, lookouts on Christmas Island spotted an object out at sea, which <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> inspection {{turned out to be}} a carley float carrying the body of a Caucasian man wearing a blue boilersuit that had been sun-bleached white. The flesh of his right arm had been eaten away by fish, and his eyes and nose consumed by birds. Shrapnel was embedded in the float's outer covering, while the proliferation of marine growth indicated that it had been adrift for some time. As the island was under threat of Japanese invasion, after a brief examination, the body was buried in an unmarked grave near Flying Fish Cove. Evacuation began on 17 February with Japanese forces occupying the island on 23 March.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{evidence of}} religion in the text is meager. The phrase divina misericordia in the preface appears also in St. Augustine’s De civitate Dei, where the reference to divine mercy follows immediately after a passage on barbarian incursions. Marcellus and Augustine are contemporaries, {{and the use of the}} phrase is less a question of influence than of the currency of a shared Christian concept. Elsewhere, passages sometimes cited as evidence of Christianity <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> inspection only display the syncretism of the Hellenistic magico-religious tradition, as Stannard noted. Christ, for instance, is invoked in an herb-gathering incantation, but the ritual makes use of magico-medical practices of pre-Christian antiquity. A Judaeo-Christian reference — nomine domini Iacob, in nomine domini Sabaoth — appears as part of a magic charm that the practitioner is instructed to inscribe on a lamella, or metal leaf. Such “magic words” often include nonsense syllables and more-or-less corrupt phrases from “exotic” languages such as Celtic, Aramaic, Coptic, and Hebrew, and are not indications of formal adherence to a religion.|$|E
25|$|The African threadfish has {{the typical}} body {{structure}} of a large jack, with a distinctly angular, strongly compressed body. The major identifying feature of the species is its head profile, having a slight concavity near the eyes which distinguishes it from the African pompano. The dorsal profile of the fish is more curved than the ventral profile, and the body is deepest between {{the origins of the}} soft dorsal and soft anal fins. The first section of the dorsal fin consists of 5 to 7 visible spines, with the second section having one spine and 20 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines followed by a single spine and 18 or 19 soft rays. The pectoral fin is long and curved, extending beyond the junction of the straight and curved sections of the lateral line. Anterior to the caudal fin are two oblate keels {{on each side of the}} line of scutes. The body appears to be scaleless, but <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> inspection has minute, deeply embedded scales. The lateral line is strongly curved anteriorly, with a section of 6 to 11 scutes toward the tail. Juveniles and often adults have long, filamentous trailing first anal and dorsal fin spines, a trait of all members of Alectis. The species grows to at least 1 m in length.|$|E

500|$|Mermaids are {{included}} in the Shanhaijing (Classic of Mountains and Seas) compilation of Chinese geography and mythology, dating from the 4th century BC. A 15th-century compilation of quotations from Chinese literature tells of a mermaid who [...] "wept tears which became pearls". An early 19th-century book entitled Jottings on the South of China contains two stories about mermaids. In the first, a man captures a mermaid on the shore of Namtao island. She looks human in every respect except that her body is covered with fine hair of many colors. She can't talk, but he takes her home and marries her. After his death, the mermaid returns to the sea where she was found. In the second story, a man sees a woman lying on the beach while his ship was anchored offshore. <b>On</b> <b>closer</b> inspection, her feet and hands appear to be webbed. She is carried to the water, and expresses her gratitude toward the sailors before swimming away.|$|E
500|$|The cathedral is [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. Standing [...] high, it was Ani's tallest structure. It is very large by {{standards}} of Armenian architecture. Architecture historian Murad Hasratyan suggests that its relatively large size and rich ornaments symbolize the revived Armenian statehood under the Bagratids. Christina Maranci suggested what {{she describes as}} an [...] "extremely tentative" [...] hypothesis that the relatively {{large proportion of the}} cathedral may have been a [...] "reflection of Trdat's memory of the vast continuous spaces" [...] of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the dome of which he repaired. However, it is considered small if judged by a European standard, wrote H. F. B. Lynch and added, [...] "it is nevertheless a stately building. It bears the imprint of that undefinable quality, beauty, and can scarcely fail to arouse a thrill of delight in the spectator." [...] Luigi Villari wrote in his 1906 book on travels in the Caucasus: [...] "From a distance it seems to be merely a plain rectangular structure with no architectural pretensions. But <b>on</b> <b>closer</b> inspection it proves to be a building of really great beauty and of the most perfect proportions." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the death}} or capture of 77 out of 79 men, ZAPU, from its {{base in the}} Zambian capital, Lusaka, did not regard the {{incursion}} as a failure; on the contrary, its leaders were pleased that they had inflicted some casualties on the Rhodesian African Rifles. Buoyed by what they perceived as a success, they planned another operation {{to take place in}} northern Mashonaland: about 100 men—75 ZIPRA and 25 MK—were to infiltrate the Zambezi valley and establish a series of camps, including underground caches containing food, clothing, weapons and other equipment. They were instructed to avoid the Rhodesian Security Forces [...] "at all cost" [...] while they recruited local tribesmen to the nationalist cause and trained them. Once a sufficient indigenous force existed, they were to inform Lusaka, which would then coordinate a mass uprising. The aim was not to defeat the government forces, but rather to force the British military to intervene. If the operation were a success, the MK men were to be escorted to South Africa to begin similar activities. The group, which in the actual event numbered 126, crossed the Zambezi {{around the turn of the}} year, with 34 entering Rhodesia on 28 December 1967 and the remainder joining them on the nights of 3, 4 and 5 January 1968. The guerrillas busied themselves working their way into the country, setting up camps as they went, naming each [...] "Camp One", [...] "Camp Two" [...] and so on. After two and a half months in Rhodesia the ZIPRA cadres had created five bases, each further south than the next in an almost straight line pointing due south; the fifth was about halfway between Karoi and the border and nearly due east from Makuti. They remained undetected until unfamiliar bootprints were discovered by David Scammel, a game ranger, on a well-worn path, about the width of a [...] "four-lane highway", on 14 March 1968 around the midpoint between Camps Four and Five. <b>On</b> <b>closer</b> inspection Scammel found scraps of a sugar packet marked with Russian lettering. So began Operation Cauldron.|$|E
