25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a misprint on the dipstick and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the <b>oil</b> <b>level</b> to decline over time to a dangerously low level.

25|$|The Edsel {{offers several}} {{features}} that were considered innovative for the time, including its rolling-dome speedometer; warning lights for such conditions as low <b>oil</b> <b>level,</b> parking brake engaged, and engine overheating; and its push-button Teletouch transmission shifting {{system in the}} center of the steering wheel (a conventional column-shift automatic was also available at a reduced price). Other Edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and self-adjusting brakes (which Ford claimed for the Edsel as a first for the industry, even though Studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade). The Edsel also offers such features, advanced for the time, as seat belts (which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes) and child-proof rear door locks that could only be unlocked with the key.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>oil</b> price <b>levels</b> and volatility on key macroeconomic indicators of Indonesia. In particular, two measures of volatility – historical volatility and realized volatility – are utilized and compared for their different macroeconomic impacts. The relationships between <b>oil</b> price <b>levels,</b> the two volatility measurements, and macroeconomic indicators are explored with the Granger-causality test and the vector autoregressive system (VAR). Empirical analysis is done on two sets of data – one over the period between 1990 and 2008 and another between 1999 and 2008, following a structural break in the time series data during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 - 1998 (Rafiq, Salim and Bloch, 2008). Results from both sets of data show that realized volatility is {{a significant predictor of}} growth rates of GDP only when <b>oil</b> price <b>levels</b> is included in the VAR system. Another important result is that <b>oil</b> price <b>levels</b> has statistically meaningful impacts on government consumption and investment, and that the explanatory power of price levels to investment is strengthened when realized volatility is included in the time-series analysis...|$|R

Co-expression of these genes in the Nicotiana benthamiana transient leaf expression system resulted in TAG levels exceeding those expected from an additive effect and biochemical tracer studies confirmed increased flux of carbon through fatty acid and TAG synthesis pathways.

Dietary treatments replaced fresh soybean oil in the control diet (3 % fresh soybean oil, 15. 25 % crude protein, and 2858 Kcal/kg metabolizable energy) with 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % oxidized oil. Egg production and egg weight were recorded daily and feed intake, feed conversion ratio, and egg mass were calculated weekly. Egg quality traits were recorded on a biweekly basis. Hen’s body weight was measured individually {{at the beginning and}} end of the experiment. Serum metabolites were determined at the end of the experiment. There was a significant difference between diets with different oxidized <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> in egg weight, egg mass, Egg production, and feed conversion ratio (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{we propose}} novel {{decision}} support system (DSS) named OPEC-DSS to support OPEC’s decisions on <b>oil</b> production <b>level.</b> OPEC-DSS is based on two important factors in oil prices; the first is OPEC <b>oil</b> production <b>level</b> (OPEC-PL) {{and the second is}} USA <b>oil</b> imports <b>level</b> (USA-IL). The OPEC-DSS support the analysers and decision-makers in three following issues: 1) OPEC-DSS can propose the optimum decisions on OPEC-PL and USA-IL. 2) It can illustrate the strategies stabilizing the oil prices. 3) OPEC-PL can calculate the optimum OPEC-PL when USA-IL has been determined. The proposed system is based on Game Theory (GT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In GT model, OPEC plays with USA, as one of the major purchaser, to reach the maximum payoff formed by ANN. In fact the ANN is oil price predictor applied by the game model. The Nash Equilibrium Point(s) (NEPs) of the game is the optimum decisions and the strategies, fixing the oil prices, can be extracted by payoff function. According to the experimental results, the model can be used for decision-making in production, imports and exports of crude oil...|$|R

In EXP 1, 400 male Ross x Ross 308 broilers were reared in battery cages, and their performance was evaluated. A metabolism assay was performed. In EXP 2, 1344 broilers from the same strain were reared in floor pens with rice husks litter. In addition to performance, carcass yield and meat oxidative stability were evaluated. In both EXP, birds were distributed in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement, with two types of oils (SO or RBO) and four <b>oil</b> inclusion <b>levels</b> (1 %, 2. 5 %, 4 %, or 5. 5 %). Two periods were considered: starter (1 to 21 days of age) and grower (22 to 42 days). In both EXP, oil type had no influence on starter performance. Although treatments promoted similar in weight gain (WG) and feed intake (FI), grower birds fed RBO had better feed conversion (FCR) in EXP 2, but not in EXP 1. In both trials, increasing dietary <b>oil</b> <b>levels</b> negatively influenced FI and positively FCR. Weight gain was similar among all treatments in EXP 1, whereas in EXP 2, WG was higher when 4 and 5. 5 % oil {{was included in the}} feed.
