40|$|Summary Osmosensing and osmoregulatory {{processes}} {{undertaken in}} gills of euryhaline fish are coordinated by integrative actions of various signaling molecules/transcriptional factors. Considerable numbers of studies report the hyper- and hypo-osmoregulatory functions of fish gills, by illustrating {{the process of}} gill cell remodeling and the modulation of the expression of ion channels/transporters. Comparatively mechanistic information relayed from signal integration to transcriptional regulation in mediating gill cell functions {{has not yet been}} elucidated. In this study we demonstrate the functional links from cortisol stimulation, to Akt activation, to the expression of the transcriptional factor, Ostf 1. Using the synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist, dexamethasone (DEX), Ostf 1 expression is found to be activated via glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mediated by the Akt-GSK 3 β signaling pathway. Pharmacological experiments using kinase inhibitors reveal that the expression of Ostf 1 is negatively regulated by Akt activation. The inhibition of PI 3 K or Akt activities, by the specific kinase inhibitors (wortmannin, LY 294002 or SH 6), stimulates Ostf 1 expression, while a reduction of GSK 3 β activity by LiCl reduces Ostf 1 expression. Collectively, <b>our</b> <b>report</b> <b>for</b> the first time indicates that DEX can induce Ostf 1 via GR, with the involvement of the Akt-GSK 3 β signaling pathway in primary eel gill cell cultures.

The need for land-use transportation interaction is explored, followed by a synthesis of inventory of land use models for agency use. This is followed by an overview of three operational land use models. Details of three operational models — DRAM-EMPAL (S. H. Putman), MEPLAN (Marcial Eche-nique) and METROSIM (Alex Anas) — are explored in terms of model formulation and special features. In order {{to draw on the}} main factors in implementation, we conducted detailed telephone interviews with five major Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) who use land use mod-els. These interviews were performed as part of our work for the enhancement of DVRPC’s travel simulation models in 1996. A two-step model selection and implementation process is proposed.

40|$|The Council's commitment, as {{outlined}} {{in the rest of}} the report, has been in three main areas. Individual research projects are put forward by medical and scientific applicants in the universities and hospitals and are evaluated by expert sub-committees in the fields of cancer, cardiovascular research, gastroenterology, haematology, mental health, metabolism and endocrinology, microbiology, immunology and pathology, pregnancy and congenital deformities. The second main area has been in the support of four research units as already described in <b>our</b> <b>report</b> <b>for</b> 1980. These have covered aspects of alcoholism, brucellosis, coeliac disease and hypertension. Finally, the Council continues to have a large financial commitment to its own Laboratories. While financial constraint has been necessary in all three areas, it is in the first area that the greatest difficulties have been encountered. As the universities and hospitals have expanded both in terms of number of personnel and expertise, the number of first class research proposals that are emerging and being placed before the Council has grown steadily over the years. This has led to the situation where enormous pressure has been put on the Council's meagre resources. Even by drastic restriction in the level of support to any worker by declining to fund most equipment costs and by reducing running costs :;ranted to a bare minimum, it has not been possible to make the available funds meet the minimal requirements. Thus, to an even greater extent than in previous years, the Council has found itself turning down highly recommended grant applications where the considered opinion of the expert sub-committee was that the research should be carried out. The Council sees no possibility of this situation improving until the investment in medical research by the State is improved. Tn this context, it was worth noting that the contribution to medical research either on the basis of population or on gross national product is one of the lowest, if not the lowest, in the EEC. It is obviously difficult in such stringent economic times to make too many demands on hard pressed State resources. However, the Council considers that it has an obligation to ensure that the small amount of money devoted to medical research in this country is increased to bring us nearer to our other partners within the EEC. It is perhaps worth pointing out that within our total grant of £ 837, 000 last year, the Council supported no less than 98 peopl...|$|E
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses ending elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Each day, news reports cite instances of older adults across the U. S. being abused and denied needed care, often by those they depend on the most. Neglect and abuse often {{go hand in hand}} with financial exploitation, which can rob older adults of the life savings and property they count on to support them in old age. In addition to the physical, psychological, and economic harm elder abuse inflicts on older adults, it can impose an economic burden on all Americans, increasing public expenditures on health care and the demand for a range of supportive services. A 2009 study estimated that 14. 1 percent of non-institutionalized older adults nationwide had experienced some form of elder abuse in the past year. In all likelihood, this underestimated the full extent of elder abuse, however, because older adults who are highly cognitively impaired may be underrepresented in this study. States are primarily responsible for protecting older adults from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. In each state, an Adult Protective Services (APS) program aims to identify, investigate, resolve, and prevent such abuse. On the federal level, two statutes establish the government's role and responsibility with regard to elder justice in general [...] the Older Americans Act of 1965 (OAA) and the Elder Justice Act of 2009 (EJA). The OAA requires the Administration on Aging (AoA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to administer formula grants to state agencies on aging for elder abuse awareness and prevention activities and lays out AoA's responsibilities to provide leadership, disseminate information, collect data, and support research in the elder justice area. The EJA authorizes funding for state APS programs and calls for federal leadership and coordination in the elder justice area. It also requires HHS, in conjunction with the Department of Justice (Justice), to disseminate best practices, provide technical assistance, collect data, and support research aimed at responding to elder abuse. Justice is also authorized to award grants to provide assistance to victims of abuse in general under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 and of domestic violence under the Violence Against Women Act.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This letter responds to a Congressional request concerning our January 21, 2005, report Student Financial Aid: Need Determination Could Be Enhanced through Improvements in Education's Estimate of Applicants' State Tax Payments (GAO- 05 - 105). The Department of Education (Education) proposed an update {{to the state and}} other tax allowance, a part of the federal need analysis for student financial aid. Most federal aid, including Pell Grants and student loans, and some state and institutional aid are awarded based on a student's cost of attendance less the student's and/or family's ability to pay these costs [...] known as the expected family contribution (EFC). The allowance, which accounts for the amount of state and other nonfederal taxes paid by students and families, effectively reduces the EFC. Education proposed to update the allowance on the basis of information compiled by the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income (SOI) Division, specifically state and other taxes paid by taxpayers and reported on their federal income tax returns for tax year 2000. Our January 2005 report discussed (1) the factors that had affected the updating of the tax data on which the allowance is based, (2) the effects Education's proposed 2003 update would have had on financial assistance for student aid applicants for the 2004 - 2005 award year, (3) the limitations associated with the method used to derive the allowance, and (4) various strategies available to address the limitations. Although the proposed 2003 update to the state and other tax allowance did not take effect, shortly before we issued our report [...] on December 23, 2004 [...] Education updated the state and other tax allowance for award year 2005 - 2006 on the basis of information compiled by SOI for tax year 2002, which was collected {{in the same manner as}} the tax year 2000 data. For this update, Education used the same methodology that was used for the proposed 2003 update. As of January 2005, Education has begun processing student aid applications for the 2005 - 2006 award year using the updated allowance. In light of Education's 2004 update of the state and other tax allowance for award year 2005 - 2006, Congress asked us to update certain analyses included in our January 2005 report, which focused on Education's prior proposal. In particular, we determined how Education's update will affect, with respect to the 2005 - 2006 award year, (1) the state and other tax allowance, by state and dependency status; (2) the average EFC, by state; (3) eligibility for Pell Grants, by state, household income, and dependency status; (4) the amount of the average Pell Grant award, by state, household income, and dependency status; and (5) aggregate Pell Grant expenditures and overall student eligibility for Pell Grants.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to construct a recommended course of action {{in the next year}} for Garuda Operations Control in its efforts to upgrade its information systems technology. The process of installing new technologies is not one that can be done quickly or easily. It is also not one that can be accomplished by simply purchasing new software, even if that software were to exist. Rather, the process of upgrading technologies must follow a carefully planned and designed path. Among information systems specialists, the process {{is often referred to as}} the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The scope of an SDLC can vary. For airline operations control projects, the scope of the SDLC process is large. It involves many people, both internal and external to the organization. It requires the establishment of a Systems Development Team with membership from several units of the airline to direct the project and to resolve problems. It (ultimately) involves a substantial resource commitment, typically on the order of $ 2, 000, 000 to $ 3, 000, 000 in development funding. It involves a number of tasks that need to be performed as part of the development effort. And the project typically takes a number of years to implement. Failing to follow a proper Systems Development process may lead to a number of risks, such as: e The new system may not meet the user's needs. e The acquisition of unnecessary or inappropriate hardware. e The acquisition of insufficient software, or software that does not allow the airline to grow or handle future expansion. e Software that may be inadequately tested and may not meet requirements or expectations. One way to look at systems development is to divide it into six phases: Phase 1 - Analyze the current system Phase 2 - Define new system requirements Phase 3 - Design the new system Phase 4 - Develop the new system Phase 5 - Implement the new system Phase 6 - Test and evaluate the system's performance and its ability to meet the user's requirements During the last year, MIT/FTL staff have been working on Phase 1. The results of our analysis of GA's current system have been documented in a separate report by Michael Clarke and Yudi Naryadi entitled "The Airline Operation Control Centre: An Overview of Garuda's Operation Control (EM) at Cengkereng", which was recently submitted to GA. Perhaps more work needs to be done in Phase 1 by GA internal staff after GA has reviewed <b>our</b> <b>report.</b> <b>For</b> example, it might be wise to: a) Evaluate the sources of all data needed to support operations control. b) Document the flows of these data as EM goes about solving various operations problems, or resolving irregular operations. c) Document the information needs which are not currently available. d) Review current EM policies and procedures to obtain suggestions for improvement. However, it is the next two phases in the SDLC process (Phase 2 - defining the new system requirements, and Phase 3 - designing the new system) for which we now need to turn our attention. Within the next year of the cooperation between MIT and GA, there are a number of tasks that can be accomplished to complete these next two phases. What follows is our suggestion for what should be accomplished within the next year. 2. Suggested steps for the next year of cooperation between MIT and GA Operations Control Step 1 - Establish a Systems Development Team. The very first step that should be taken is the establishment of a team of individuals from both within GA and external to GA. The mission of this team would be to oversee the development effort: direct all activities; approve all decisions; make recommendations on the design of the new system; and resolve problems that occur along the way. The team should consist of personnel from: e Operations (EP, EM) e Flight Dispatch, Navigation (EA, ON) e Operations Control Center (OCC) e Maintenance (MCC, MP) * Crew Planning (OB) e Airport Operations (KO) e Information Systems (DX) The team should have a leader from within GA, and MIT/FTL staff would act as "consultants" to this team. Step 2 - Complete Phase 2 of the System Development Life Cycle. In the second phase of the SDLC, we need to scope out the requirements for the new system in enough detail so that both the computer systems developers and the users know exactly what the new system is going to do and how the system is going to do it. Needless to say, these requirements should solve the problems identified in Phase 1. The requirements should identify the user's needs (what the system will do) as well as the hardware, software, and data needs. This phase concludes with a system requirements report. Step 3 - Configure and install the computer hardware and networking technology that is necessary to allow personnel to electronically communicate and interact with one another, make good use of existing Operations Control systems, and to establish reliable access to all necessary information/data. The design of the hardware and network configuration is not a trivial task. Questions need to be answered: e What would be the underlying operating system: UNIX, Windows NT? e What hardware will the system run on: 80486 PC's or UNIX Workstations? e What client - server architecture is optimum? e What local area network is best: Ethernet, Token-Ring? * What media: Twisted-Pair, Co-ax? e How is the network to be connected to the mainframe and other systems? e What communications and network software is needed? It is planned that the installation of this hardware and software will be incremental and evolutionary. GA can initially procure just a few workstations and connect them up on a local area network. This "test cell" of computers will allow GA to gain some experience with the new hardware before making a more substantial commitment of resources. In addition, this step will allow EM personnel to become familiar with the new computer hardware before the application software is designed and installed. It will also allow EM personnel to communicate with each other through a local area network. In addition, the hardware and operating system software that is chosen should allow EM to continue to access and use current systems, even if those systems are on the mainframe computer or other workstations. At the same time, it should allow an evolutionary transition to better systems and software. Step 4 - Begin installation of a centralized Database Management System to hold the data items that are needed for effective Operations Control. Refer to the earlier proposal entitled "System Operations Control Database Development" written by Dennis Mathaisel in July 1995 for a more detailed discussion of this step. Configuring and installing an effective DBMS is not trivial. It is intended that an improved DBMS will be available on-line at EP/EM by transferring and updating data currently in other systems. Step 5 - Complete Phase 3 of the System Development Life Cycle. This third phase focuses on the design of the new system software before the software is procured or developed. The phase involves two main objectives: e To optimally design the new system. e To establish a sound framework of controls within which the new system should operate (basically, meeting the requirements). The completion of the design phase is marked by a couple of events: the team completes, organizes, and assembles the system design documentation; and a series of meetings/presentations are organized to present and review the design proposal. From an overall perspective, next year would be devoted to a year of assessment and design, combined with the installation of necessary hardware, operating systems, and local area networks. It would require a commitment from Garuda to purchase necessary hardware and LAN technology, as well as taking the first steps necessary to install a centralized DBMS. 3. Beyond next year [...] . Once the above steps were completed, then GA can begin to acquire more advanced software to assist in planning and execution of Operations activities. The greatest mistake would be to acquire existing software packages before a thorough study and design was completed. A complete plan for developing a new operational system must be established first. Beyond next year, the basic steps would be as follows: a) Complete the construction of the centralized DBMS. b) Replace the ROC system currently in use in Operations Control with advanced computer-graphics displays on high-powered workstations that are connected on a local area network and connected with the mainframe computer. This step involves a transition to UNIX-based software. c) Then, and only after the above steps were taken, consider the introduction of automated decision-support models to solve specific problems that are encountered in irregular operations, etc. Cover title 19 October 199...|$|E

Coincident data collected at the Galapagos propagator (GLORIA, SeaMARC II, Sea Beam, Deep-Tow, camera sled, and Alvin) allow comparisons of how well seafloor features (e. g., faults and volcanoes) observed and characterized in high resolution data are represented in lower resolution, coarser-scale data sets. <b>Our</b> <b>reported</b> values <b>for</b> the minimum sizes of detected and well-represented features show that practical geological resolutions are generally ∼ 2 - 10 times lower than theoretical resolutions; care must be taken in evaluating which system to use to address a particular problem...|$|R

Goals of reduction mammaplasty are to alleviate physical, emotional and psychosocial discomforts and to restore a conical-shaped breast, maintaining scars as short as possible.

[...] Andrew Kaczynski, the CNN reporter who first reported instances of plagiarism in Crowley's book, called her claims of innocence false and [...] "complete BS," [...] stating: [...] "No one has yet to point out a single inaccuracy in <b>our</b> <b>reporting</b> or asked <b>for</b> a correction on it.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a search for {{technicolor}} using 110 pb- 1 of pp̅ collisions recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). In technicolor models containing a technifamily, color-octet technirhos enhance the pair production of color-triplet technipions, which behave as third-generation leptoquarks. From <b>our</b> previously <b>reported</b> search <b>for</b> third-generation leptoquarks, we present constraints on the production of color-triplet technipions and color-octet technirhos as a function of their masses...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} the heat capacity of He- 3 adsorbed on one-dimensional (1 D) nanopores of FSM- 16 with different pore-diameters. Dilute He- 3 atoms {{on more than}} one layers of He- 4 preplated nanotunnels with 22 angstrom in diameter show a Schottky-type peak around 0. 25 K, which is similar to <b>our</b> recent <b>report</b> <b>for</b> 28 angstrom nanotunnels. This behavior of heat capacity is explained as the crossover from 1 D to 2 D motion of Fermi gas in a confined geometry. The pore-size effect on the temperature and magnitude of the peak is quanlitatively reproduced by a simple calculation for non-interacting Fermi gas in the adsorption potential from the substrate...|$|R
40|$|Full {{thickness}} {{skin grafts}} and composite grafts are a workhorse in reconstructive surgery of nose and ear defects {{whether they are}} originated from trauma, cancer surgery or burns. The reliability of these grafts has been proved with an established clinical use and morbidity to the donor site is minimal if harvesting and donor site selection if appropriate. Use of double or multiple grafts to reconstruct a complex defect of the nose has not been described and <b>our</b> <b>report</b> is meaningful <b>for</b> {{the fact that it}} describes a further use of the surgical concept of grafting...|$|R
