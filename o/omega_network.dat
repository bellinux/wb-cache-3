However, most reconfigurable computing architectures suffer from computationally demanding placement and routing (P&R) steps. This problem may disable their use in systems requiring dynamic compilation (e. g., to guarantee application portability in embedded systems). Bearing in mind the simplification of P&R steps, this paper presents and analyzes a coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) extended with global multistage interconnect <b>networks,</b> specifically <b>Omega</b> <b>Networks.</b> We show that integrating one or two <b>Omega</b> <b>Networks</b> in a CGRA permits to simplify the P&R stage resulting in both low hardware resource overhead and low performance degradation (18 % for an 8 _ 8 array). We compare the proposed CGRA, which integrates one or two <b>Omega</b> <b>Networks,</b> with a CGRA based on a grid of processing elements with reach neighbor interconnections and with a torus topology. The execution time needed to perform the P&R stage for the two array architectures shows that the array using two <b>Omega</b> <b>Networks</b> needs a far simpler and faster P&R.

50|$|An 8x8 <b>Omega</b> <b>network</b> is a {{multistage}} interconnection network, {{meaning that}} processing elements (PEs) are connected using multiple stages of switches. Inputs and outputs are given addresses {{as shown in}} the figure. The outputs from each stage are connected to the inputs of the next stage using a perfect shuffle connection system. This means that the connections at each stage represent the movement of a deck of cards divided into 2 equal decks and then shuffled together, with each card from one deck alternating with the corresponding card from the other deck. In terms of binary representation of the PEs, each stage of the perfect shuffle {{can be thought of as}} a cyclic logical left shift; each bit in the address is shifted once to the left, with the most significant bit moving to the least significant bit.|$|E

Each TM ASIC controls four SDRAMs that make up one-eighth of the texture memory. The SDRAMs used are 16 bits wide and have separate address and data buses. SDRAMs with a capacity of 4 Mb are used by Raster Manager boards with 16 MB of texture memory while 16 Mb SDRAMs are used by Raster Manager boards with 64 MB of texture memory. The TM ASICs perform texel lookups in its SDRAMs according to the texel addresses issued by the TA ASIC. Texels from the TM ASICs are forwarded to the appropriate TF ASIC, where texture filtering, texture environment combination with interpolated color and fog application is performed. As each SDRAM holds part of the texture memory, all of the 32 SDRAMs must be connected to all of the 80 Image Engines. To achieve this, the TM and TF ASICs implement a two-rank <b>omega</b> <b>network,</b> which reduces the number of individual paths required for the 32 to 80 sort while maintaining the same functionality.|$|E

However, under a non-uniform traffic pattern, {{the performance of}} multistage interconnection networks suffers greatly because of hot spot traffic contention. The potential performance degradation due to even moderate hot spot traffic {{was found to be}} very significant, severely reducing all memory access, not just to shared locations. This phenomenon is called a tree saturation effect. ^ Prior studies have outlined several techniques to reduce the effects of hot spot and tree saturation contentions in multistage interconnection networks. These include multibuffer switching nodes, multipath networks, and request combining. Request combining strategy was found to be an effective method of reducing the tree saturation problem. Some request combining approaches have been proposed in the literature. These approaches have {{one or more of the}} following limitations: requirements for prior knowledge of messages in the network, restrictions on the routing of the messages in the network, and the use of sophisticated interconnection network nodes. ^ The interconnection-processor combining protocol which does not have the limitations of the other combining methods was an unexplored area of the design space. This study pioneers the interconnection-processor combining protocol with two original approaches. This research defines the operational characteristics, and analyzes these two approaches for performance measures and limitations on <b>Omega</b> <b>networks</b> and Serial Link Interconnection Networks (SLIN). The first approach is the interconnection-processor combining using a common bus to distribute the results (IP-BD).
