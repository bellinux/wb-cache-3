Both the {{employers and employees}} are highly concerned with the latter because work-related injuries are commonplace in the coal mining industry. <b>Social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums are replaced with revenues of the coal mine and wages of the employees. In other words, employees’ wages include <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums that should actually be used for purchasing <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> Based on the income levels in the coal mining industry, each employee should pay 200 – 300 yuan each month for <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> Instead, coal mines save these <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums. The average income of coal mine workers in L County is 3000 – 4000 yuan, and thus, coal mines should pay 500 – 800 yuan each month for each employee’s <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> For employees {{who are in their}} twenties or thirties, in-pocket wages are more valuable than a <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> policy that may only prove valuable in the future.

40|$|We examine optimal {{taxation}} and <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> with adverse selection in competitive insurance markets. In a previous literature, {{it has been}} shown that, with perfect <b>insurance</b> markets, <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> improves welfare since it is able to redistribute without creating distortions. This result has been taken as robust to the introduction of adverse selection as this would only provide additional justifications for <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> We show, however, that adverse selection can weaken the case for <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> compared to a situation with perfect markets. Whenever <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> mitigates private underinsurance, it also causes welfare-reducing effects by decreasing precautionary labor supply and hence tax revenue. In addition, adverse selection may reduce the redistributive potential of <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> We illustrate our general results using different equilibrium concepts for the insurance market. Notably, we derive conditions under which a complete renunciation of <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> is optimal and the government only relies on income taxation to achieve its redistributive objectives...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{political}} economy of <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> in a world where individuals differ in both income and risk. <b>Social</b> <b>insurance</b> is financed through distortionary taxation and redistributes across income and risk. Individuals vote on <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> that they can complement with insurance bought on the private market. Private insurance is actuarially fair but suffers from adverse selection, which results in a screening equilibrium with partial coverage. The equilibrium <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> is the result of an electoral competition game where parties maximize the utility of their members. We calculate the equilibrium <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> offered by the two parties as well as their equilibrium membership, and study how the equilibrium outcome is affected by electoral uncertainty, distortions from taxation, risk aversion and the distribution of risk and income.

A further aim was to determine whether <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers from different local insurance offices have uniform attitudes regarding professional practice in their application of the insurance system. METHODS: A register-based investigation of 815 vocational rehabilitees served by 6 local <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> offices in a Swedish county. The study was supplemented with a questionnaire to 30 officers about attitudes to <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> RESULTS: The office with the lowest rate of sick-listing periods exceeding one year, and a high frequency of employment training, showed the highest degree of work resumption and the lowest pension rate after vocational rehabilitation.

30|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} is therefore heavily affected by state intervention instead of operating purely {{in accordance with}} the market, which causes problems in <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> For instance, handling employees’ <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> when coal mines are forced by the local state to suspend production presents a difficult problem. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, as long as the labor contract is valid, <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums should be paid even when enterprises suspend their business operations. However, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security does not explain whether such policy is applicable to forced suspension required by the state. If enterprises suspend production due to state intervention, enterprises are reluctant to pay their employees’ <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums because enterprises are not voluntarily suspending production. During my fieldwork, one owner of coal mine calculated the costs of <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> for me. Taking a coal mine employing 300 workers as an example, the coal mine has to pay 500 – 800 yuan per month for each worker as <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums, totaling 150, 000 yuan for all 300 workers. If the coal mine suspends production for 5  months a year on average, the coal mine has to pay <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums in the amount of 750, 000 yuan during suspension, which is hard for a coal mine whose profit averages three million yuan a year. 11 In addition, since workers have no wages during suspension, they are unable to pay <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums. Heavy state intervention makes it difficult for the coal mining industry to enforce mandatory <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> compared to other industries.|$|R

Also it arranged unstructured interviewing with government officials from various departments, the managers at work units, and the academic who are the experts on income maintenance in the country. This research also reviewed policy papers and internal documents on labour and <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> in China. The most distinguished part of this study is the quantitative research work carried out in Guangzhou Shi, Guangdong Province in 1995. 25 managers from work units of different types of ownership were interviewed and 520 employees participated in the structured interviewing with questionnaires administered by extraordinary interviewers.
