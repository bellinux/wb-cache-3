Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was why it took her so long to exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by <b>other</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at times when she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E

25|$|The {{membership}} of the PCA is predominantly Caucasian, but the denomination includes more than 260 Korean-American Churches in 9 Korean Presbyteries. The first Korean Presbytery was formed in 1982; since then the number of presbyteries has grown to 9, namely the Korean Capital Presbytery, the Korean Central Presbytery, the Korean Eastern Presbytery, the Korean Northeastern Presbytery, the Korean Northwest Presbytery, the Korean Southeastern Presbytery, the Korean Southern Presbytery and the Korean Southwest Presbytery, and the recently formed Korean Southwest Orange County Presbytery. Koreans comprise approximately 15% of the denomination, {{and the majority of}} them are located in the West coast and Northeast regions. In recent years several independent Korean congregations have joined the PCA {{to be a part of}} a conservative Presbyterian denomination. The largest PCA church is a Korean church located in Anaheim, CA called Sarang Community Church. All the Korean churches in the PCA appoint non-ordained deaconesses and women encouragers (Kwonsa) who are elected and installed so that women can care for <b>other</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church. Such has been the practice of all Korean Presbyterian churches since its inception which is practiced across denominational boundaries.|$|E

500|$|The twice-divorced Brett Ashley {{represented}} the liberated New Woman (in the 1920s, divorces were common {{and easy to}} be had in Paris). James Nagel writes that, in Brett, Hemingway created {{one of the more}} fascinating women in 20th-century American literature. Sexually promiscuous, she is a denizen of Parisian nightlife and cafés. In Pamplona she sparks chaos: in her presence, the men drink too much and fight. She also seduces the young bullfighter Romero and becomes a Circe in the festival. Critics describe her variously as complicated, elusive, and enigmatic; Donald Daiker writes that Hemingway [...] "treats her with a delicate balance of sympathy and antipathy." [...] She is vulnerable, forgiving, independent—qualities that Hemingway juxtaposes with the <b>other</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book, who are either prostitutes or overbearing nags.|$|E

500|$|Before the 1980s, it was {{uncommon}} for Japanese women {{to perform on}} traditional instruments, including taiko, as their participation had been systematically restricted.

Thereafter, female participation in kumi-daiko started to rise dramatically, and by the 1990s, women equaled and possibly exceeded representation by men. While the proportion of women in taiko has become substantial, some have expressed concern that women still do not perform in the same roles as their male counterparts and that taiko performance continues to be a male-dominated profession. For instance, a member of Kodo was informed by the director of the group's apprentice program that women were permitted to play, but could only play [...] "as women". <b>Other</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apprentice program recognized a gender disparity in performance roles, such as what pieces they were allowed to perform, or in physical terms based on a male standard.|$|E

Investigators ruled out the story about Condit, because Guandique had already admitted to assaulting two <b>other</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same park where Levy's remains were found. Guandique failed to show up for work on the day of Levy's disappearance. His former landlady recalled that his face appeared scratched and bruised at around that time.

500|$|When Cisneros {{describes}} the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas, {{the theme of}} place often emerges. Place refers not only to her novels' geographic locations, {{but also to the}} positions her characters hold within their social context. Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo-dominated and male-dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home. As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described, the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads-of-household, {{or in the case of}} their own home, it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively. In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist, Esperanza, longs to have her own house: [...] "Not a flat. Not an apartment in back. Not a man's house. Not a daddy's. A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow, my pretty purple petunias. My books and my stories. My two shoes waiting beside the bed. Nobody to shake a stick at. Nobody's garbage to pick up after." [...] An aspiring writer, Esperanza yearns for [...] "a space for myself to go, clean as paper before the poem." [...] She feels discontented and trapped in her family home, and witnesses <b>other</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same position. According to Saldívar, Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential—a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence, but instead [...] "a site of poetic self-creation." [...] One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros's Chicana characters is that the male-dominated society in which they live denies them this place. Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf's famous essay [...] "A Room of One's Own", that [...] "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction," [...] or put another way, [...] "economic security" [...] and personal liberty are necessary for [...] "artistic production." ...|$|E
