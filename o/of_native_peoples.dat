25|$|Even more {{consequential}} than warfare or mistreatment on indigenous populations was {{the geographic}} displacement of Native American tribes. The increased European population due to immigration and high birth rates of Native European settlers {{put pressure on}} native tribes to relocate and alter their traditional ways of life. Displacement <b>of</b> <b>native</b> <b>peoples</b> living traditionally often resulted in increased infant mortality and often higher death rates which steadily lowered their populations for some time. In the United States, for example, the relocations of Native Americans resulting from the policies of Indian removal and the reservation system created a disruption which resulted in fewer live births and a short term population decline.|$|E

There are some researchers collecting plants in the reserve but they are looked upon with suspicion and considered to be thieves by many in indigenous communities. One of these is a station run by Conservation International to map the flora and fauna of Montes Azules. Mexican agro-business and biotech enterprise Grupo Pulsar also has research stations in Chiapas. However, the pressure from academics, biotech firms, pharmaceutical companies and others to explore the area’s natural resources have raised concerns of “bio-piracy” or the patenting of wild plants and animals at the expense <b>of</b> <b>native</b> <b>peoples.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European/Canadian early {{interactions}} {{in the east}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful compared to the later experience <b>of</b> <b>native</b> <b>peoples</b> in the United States. Combined with a late economic development in many regions, this relatively peaceful history resulted in Indigenous peoples having a fairly strong influence on the early national culture, while preserving their own identity. From the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged Aboriginals to assimilate into the mainstream European-influenced culture, which they referred to as Canadian culture. The government attempted forced integration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. National Aboriginal Day recognises the cultures and contributions of Aboriginal peoples of Canada. There are currently over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands encompassing 1,172,790 2006 people spread across Canada, with distinctive Aboriginal cultures, languages, art, and music.|$|E
40|$|A survey based {{questionnaire}} {{research was}} conducted in Sainj Valley, Himachal Pradesh. The survey was conducted in June-July 2015 in an area affected due to hydro power projects (HPPs).

25|$|Spanish {{interest}} in Guerrero {{during the colonial}} period was mostly focused on the gold and other minerals coming out of Taxco and the Asian trade centered on Acapulco. Third in line was the production of various cash crops such as cotton, cacao and coconuts, much of which was grown on the coast. These were produced on large encomiendas and haciendas, which exploited the local indigenous and later mestizo populations. As part of the Conquest, most of the lands of the Costa Grande were divided among conquistadors into “encomiendas,” which used and overworked indigenous labor. This caused a severe drop in the already sparse native population. This led to the importation of African slaves in a few areas of the Costa Grande closest to Acapulco, but the practice was wider spread in the Costa Chica. In other parts, fields and forests were worked by Spaniards due to the utter lack <b>of</b> <b>native</b> <b>peoples,</b> leaving {{little in the way of}} the colonial system what was prevalent in other parts of Mexico. The main early export was tropical woods such as cedar, oak, walnut and others. Much of this was exported to Europe. The Spanish galleons of Manila brought coconut trees to the area, which became the basis of the economy of the coast for some time. Few, if any, vestiges of the haciendas of the area remain, mostly because lasting constructions such as stone mansions or aqueducts were ever built, as they were in other parts of Mexico.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the peacemaking potential <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> justice initiatives {{within the context}} of Canadian criminal justice. Like peacemaking which rose as a revitalization of peace and non-violence within criminology and its concerns, Native justice initiatives {{can be viewed as a}} revitalization movement which has risen in response to the injustice of the criminal process for <b>Native</b> <b>people.</b> By offering alternatives to criminal justice or healing approaches within the structure of the conventional criminal process, Native justice initiatives seek to provide healing and restoration and a meaningful delivery <b>of</b> justice to <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> in conflict with the law. The peacemaking potential of such alternatives lies in the observation that the current euro-based structure of criminal justice is foreign to the traditional spiritual and social understanding <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>people.</b> The tragic consequence of this incompatibility is the overincarceration <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> and the failure of conventional correctional programming to help them. The offering of a process which is sensitive to the needs <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> in conflict with the law is a move toward peace and social justice within the Canadian criminal justice system which provides an illustration of how Peacemaking may be achieved. This thesis proposes that Native Justice Initiatives facilitate a healing process between <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> and the criminal justice process and do not represent a full restoration to health. Deep healing for <b>Native</b> <b>people</b> in conflict with the law will require an ongoing process of understanding and accommodation both within the realm of criminal justice and society in general.
