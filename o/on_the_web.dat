40|$|Use of the {{internet}} as a trade platform has resulted in a shift in the illegal wildlife trade. Increased scrutiny of illegal wildlife trade has led to concerns that online trade of wildlife will move onto <b>the</b> dark <b>web.</b> To provide a baseline of illegal wildlife trade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>web,</b> we downloaded and archived 9852 items (individual posts) from <b>the</b> dark <b>web,</b> then searched these based on a list of 121 keywords associated with illegal online wildlife trade, including 30 keywords associated with illegally traded elephant ivory <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>web.</b> Results were compared with items known to be illegally traded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>web,</b> specifically cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, to compare the extent of the trade. Of these 121 keywords, 4 resulted in hits, of which only one was potentially linked to illegal wildlife trade. This sole case was the sale and discussion of Echinopsis pachanoi (San Pedro cactus), which has hallucinogenic properties. This negligible level of activity related to the illegal trade of wildlife <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>web</b> relative to <b>the</b> open and increasing trade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>web</b> may indicate a lack of successful enforcement against illegal wildlife trade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>web...</b>|$|R
40|$|Online social {{networks}} {{have become a}} seamless and critical online communication platform for personal interactions. They are a powerful tool that businesses are using to expand among domestic markets. The increase in participation in online social networking can and has caused damage to individuals and organizations, and the issuance of trust has become a concern <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social <b>web.</b> <b>The</b> factors determining the reputation of persons (customers) {{in the real world}} may relate to the factors of reputation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social <b>web,</b> though relative to how trust is established in the physical world, establishing trust <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social <b>web</b> can be fairly difficult. Determining how to trust another individual’s online social profile becomes critical in initiating any interaction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social <b>web.</b> Rather than focusing <b>on</b> content <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social network page, this research proposes and examines the application of user reputations to determine whether the trust should be issued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social <b>web.</b> A top-level framework to establish trust in an identity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Social Network Sites (SNS) {{as a function of the}} users’ associations, usage patterns and reputation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social <b>web</b> is presented...|$|R

5|$|Several {{supporters}} of the attack later said on a messageboard that taking down websites {{was not enough to}} convince the government to back down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> filtering policy and called for violence.

A spokesman for Electronic Frontiers Australia said he believed there was no real intention or capacity to follow through with any of the violent threats.|$|E
40|$|Three-point flexure tests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> of 12 {{pultruded}} Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) Wide Flange (WF) specimens are described. <b>The</b> <b>webs</b> of <b>the</b> specimens {{were tested}} with their ends either simply or semi-rigidly supported. Dual knife-edge fixtures and rigid steel supports were designed and fabricated to simulate these support conditions. A series of low load tests {{were carried out}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> of <b>the</b> WF specimens for both types of end conditions and deflections and strains were recorded at mid-span. Using simple beam analysis models {{in conjunction with the}} test data, both the transverse elastic modulus of <b>the</b> <b>web</b> and <b>the</b> rotational stiffness per unit length of the web-flange junctions of each specimen were determined. <b>The</b> <b>webs</b> of five of the specimens were failed under simply supported end conditions and the remaining seven under semi-rigid end conditions. From these failure tests the initial failure strengths of the web-flange junctions and the ultimate bending strengths of <b>the</b> <b>webs</b> were determined. <b>The</b> failure loads and modes of failure for both sets of end conditions have also been quantified...|$|R
40|$|Information interoperatbility has {{received}} increased attention since {{the growing popularity}} of <b>the</b> Internet, <b>the</b> <b>Web</b> and distributed computing infrastructures. During this evolution, <b>the</b> attention <b>on</b> semantics and ontologies to achieve this interoperatbility has also increased. The same thing is happening <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web,</b> where ontologies are used to assign (agreed) meaning to the content of <b>the</b> <b>Web.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web,</b> data will inevitably be linked to many different ontologies, and information processing across ontologies is not possible without knowing the semantic mappings between them. As <b>the</b> resources <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web</b> are annotated using these ontologies, new search techniques can be applied to find specific and structured information. This evolution calls for new tools to assist the user in the discovery and extraction of specific information resources from <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web.</b> In this thesis, we describe an ontologyfocused crawler for <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web.</b> We argue that this crawler can exploit the semantic meta data to efficiently discover and extract information resources <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web.</b> In our approach, we use a topic ontology to guide the crawler to the relevant information...|$|R

5|$|Growing up in Pittsburgh, creator Ben Jones had an {{appreciation}} for comics and animation. His father's Macintosh computer served {{as a vehicle for}} Jones to create art and influenced his later visual style. Jones attended the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in the mid-1990s, where he became motivated to launch a project he could adapt to different media. This impetus manifested itself in the characters Alfe, Horace, and Roba. Tux Dog, another principal character, was designed while Jones was in primary school. After his graduation, Jones formed the art collective Paper Rad with Jessica and Jacob Ciocci in 2000. The collective moved that year to Providence, Rhode Island, to participate in the Fort Thunder music venue. After the venue's closure in 2001, Jones released animations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Web</b> using Adobe Flash, with some featuring Alfe.|$|E
