5|$|The Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) was a United States {{military}} agency {{responsible for}} those aspects <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> remaining under military control after the Manhattan Project was succeeded by the Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. These responsibilities included the maintenance, storage, surveillance, security and handling <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> as well as supporting nuclear testing. The AFSWP was a joint organization, staffed by the United States Army, United States Navy and United States Air Force; its chief was supported by deputies from the other two services.

5|$|The Interim Committee {{held its}} first meeting on 9 May 1945. Stimson began by {{outlining}} its broad terms of reference, which included advising the President on wartime controls {{and the release of}} information, and making recommendations on post-war controls and policies related to nuclear energy, including legislation. The Interim Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the Interim Committee's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later {{asked him for}} a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|Operation Crossroads {{was a pair}} {{of nuclear}} weapon tests {{conducted}} by the United States at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946. They were the first nuclear weapon tests since Trinity in July 1945, and the first detonations of nuclear devices since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. The purpose of the tests was to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> on warships.|$|E
5|$|Project Camel was the codename {{given to}} work {{performed}} by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) {{in support of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II.

5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} {{in the lee of}} the atoll to test the effect <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing that Charlie was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E
5|$|The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement {{extended}} both {{commercial and}} military cooperation into the post-war period. The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons {{would not be}} used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July 1945, Wilson agreed that the use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.|$|E
5|$|The USAF {{issued a}} new policy {{directive}} regarding the handling <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and delivery systems, which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed weapons in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating {{that they are not}} armed with nuclear warheads. Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> from weapons storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and weapons custodian. All units that handle nuclear weapons must develop a coordinated visual inspection checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining nuclear weapons cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their duty period can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases.|$|E
