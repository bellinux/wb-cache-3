40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} <b>order-wire</b> functionality in NG-SDH devices ODS 2 G 5 and OTS 622 IRITEL. The paper also {{describes the}} operation of <b>order-wire</b> in networks with arbitrary topologies, {{as well as the}} configuration of <b>order-wire</b> functionality by using network management software SUNCE. The presented solution for <b>order-wire</b> functionality is compared with VoIP solutions. The paper shows that the presented solution provides fast reaction to network failures, while keeping the implementation simple...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1976 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThis paper {{describes}} the earth terminals in the Biomedical Communications Experiment via the Communications Technology Satellite (CTS). Important analyses {{performed in the}} selection of the earth terminal parameters are summarized. In particular, analyses of the link, inter-modulation products, and rain attenuation are presented as rationales for selecting ground transmitter power, receiver G/T, frequency spacing, that are optimum for TASO Grade 1 video quality, full-duplex color video/audio and an audio <b>order-wire</b> capability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{multiple access}} techniques for a mobile radio system which incorporates a geosynchronous orbiting satellite repeater through which mobile terminals communicate. The communication capacities of FDMA, TDMA and CDMA systems are examined for a 4 MHz bandwidth system to serve up to 10, 000 users. An FDMA system with multibeam coverage is analyzed in detail. The system includes an <b>order-wire</b> network for demand-access control and reassignment of satellite channels. Satellite and terminal configurations are developed to a block diagram level and system costs and implementation requirements are discussed...|$|E
