However, the average value of consumers’ perceived risk was 5.06, indicating that consumers were still willing to make <b>online</b> <b>payments</b> and try <b>online</b> financial products even if the perceived risk existed. In tandem with the rapid development of <b>online</b> transaction and <b>payment</b> systems and the increased popularity of <b>online</b> <b>payments,</b> our respondents also indicated a higher frequency of use of <b>online</b> <b>payments.</b> In addition, most respondents were young people aged 20 – 30 years who are more prone to be impulsive and willing to try new financial management options of online financial products. Finally, the security risk of online financial products was mainly reflected in payment, account, and privacy security. Perceived risk is less important today for consumers already accustomed to the use of <b>online</b> and mobile <b>payment</b> methods and who have deemed <b>online</b> <b>payments</b> as an essential part of their lives.|$|R
