The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) advised the tribe that the tribe owed excise taxes and federal <b>occupational</b> <b>taxes</b> on revenue generated from the sales of these pull-tabs to the public. The tribe paid the amount sought by the IRS and then filed a claim for reimbursement, averring that the tribe was exempt from such taxes under the provisions of Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), [...] The United States denied the claim, and the tribe filed suit in the Federal District Court, Eastern District of Oklahoma.

40|$|The United States is {{becoming}} a country of urban dwellers. Much of this urbanization is occurring outside of the legal city in {{what is called the}} urban fringe. Among the solutions advanced to deal with the problems of urban sprawl is the annexation of such areas by the central city. Before annexation can become a reality, its feasibility from a cost-revenue approach must be assessed. This was accomplished by dividing the urban fringe of Bowling Green, Kentucky, into nine study areas and investigating the costs incurred by the city for the provision of services associated with annexation as compared to the expected revenues to be obtained from these sections. Costs were derived by analyzing the expenditures for each city service. This was done by examining the past budgets for each department. The analysis was accomplished by translating municipal services into measurable units of activity and determining the actual expenditure per unit or performance for each activity. The services analyzed were fire and police protection, the transportation system, and general government. The expected revenue from the annexation units was obtained for four major sources [...] fines and forfeitures, and personal, property, and <b>occupational</b> <b>taxes.</b> The two components, costs and revenues, were compared. This resulted in a net surplus or deficit for the provision of services to each sector after annexation. Among the conclusions reached in this study is that the cost-revenue concept is an important aspect of annexation, but should not be the only consideration. The fringe residents 2 ̆ 7 tie to the city and the threat of small scale incorporation are among the questions which should be answered before any annexation is instituted...|$|E

Many {{built-up}} areas in neighboring Laurel County have a Corbin postal address, but lie outside of the city limits. This arrangement has created some problems with taxes, and also the census records. The city receives a portion of the <b>occupational</b> <b>tax</b> collected in Whitley County, but Knox County has refused to give Corbin a part of the tax collected there. On March 10, 2008, the City Commission voted to file a lawsuit against Knox County to receive a portion of the tax collected within city limits. On May 23, 2014, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled that the [...] "Stivers amendment", passed as part of KY HB 499 [...] "Tax Amnesty" [...] legislation in 2012, did not violate the state's constitution.
