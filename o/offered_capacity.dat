30|$|The above MRF {{formulation}} of the secondary network facilitates the estimation of optimal solutions exploiting powerful MRF energy minimization techniques in an otherwise difficult to be solved problem. Given that the space of possible configurations can be very large, the MRF formulation can leverage algorithms for the computation of global optimum solutions relying on repeated computation of local characteristics (Equation 4). As a result, by finding configurations (i.e., specifying channel allocations and power control at each secondary link) with minimum MRF system energy, {{we are able to}} both maximize the <b>offered</b> <b>capacity</b> per link and provide to SUs an efficient scheduling scheme avoiding collisions and, hence, improve the overall secondary network performance.|$|E

40|$|A {{capacity}} mechanism {{next to the}} energy-only market provides necessary investment incentives that spot markets lack. The adequate capacity mix can only be achieved by accounting for the current transition phase to electricity generation with a growing share of renewables. We show that an increasing share of renewable energy leads to a comparative advantage for peak-load power plants in a capacity market. This results in higher flexibility as opposed to missing flexibility induced by the merit order effect at the spot market. Suggested {{capacity mechanism}}s do {{not account for the}} promotion of renewable energy so far. We consider support for renewables via endogenous discrimination of prices paid for <b>offered</b> <b>capacity.</b> This triggers more efficient incentives to direct the capacity mix to its long-run equilibrium where discriminated prices converge to one equilibrium capacity price...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{model and}} {{investigate}} the in-teraction between the TCP protocol and rate adaptation at intermediate routers. Rate adaptation aims at saving energy by controlling the <b>offered</b> <b>capacity</b> of links and adapting {{it to the}} amount of traffic. However, when TCP is used at the transport layer, the control loop of rate adaptation and one of the TCP congestion control mechanism might interact and disturb each other, compromising throughput and Quality of Service (QoS). Our investigation is lead through mathematical modeling consisting in depicting the behavior of TCP and of rate adaption through a set of Delay Differential Equations (DDEs). The model is validated against simulation results and it is shown to be accurate. The results of the sensitivity analysis of the system perfor-mance to control parameters show that rate adaptation can be effective but a careful parameter setting is needed to avoid undesired disruptive interaction among controllers at different levels, that impair QoS...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{increasing}} mobile data traffic adds extra {{pressure on the}} almost congested mobile networks. In {{order to meet the}} new demand, mobile operators have to improve their networks but as revenues are not expected to rise, they have to add extra capacity in a cost-efficient way. The solution might come from shifting the mobile data traffic towards indoor alternative networks, an approach known as mobile data offloading. Among indoor solutions two technologies stepped forward, Wi-Fi and smallcells. This paper analyses the two technologies as complementing solutions for macrocell layer in the mobile data offloading context. The main discussed questions are whether the two solutions are interchangeable and what are the risks and pitfalls when choosing one of the two technologies. In order to answer the research questions, based on a proposed real life deployment scenario, a capacity-cost calculation has been driven. Thus, a newly built office building lacking indoor mobile coverage has been considered. Based on the calculated <b>offered</b> <b>capacity,</b> the deployment costs for a comprehensive solution using either of the two technologies have been estimated. The cost of provisioning for different solutions is {{based on the fact that}} either of these solutions needs to be built from scratch and no former type of coverage exists...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{specific}} {{challenges of}} multihop wireles networks {{lead to a}} strong research effort on efficient protocols design where the <b>offered</b> <b>capacity</b> is a key objective. More specifically, routing strategy largely impacts the network capacity, i. e. the throughput offered to each flow. In this work, we propose a complete framework to compute the upper and the lower bounds of the network capacity according to a physical topology and a given routing protocol. The radio resource sharing principles of CSMA-CA is modeled {{as a set of}} linear constraints with two models of fairness. The first one assumes that nodes have a fair access to the channel, while the second one assumes that on the radio links. We then develop a pessimistic and an optimistic scenarios for radio resource sharing, yielding a lower bound and an upper bound on the network capacity for each fairness case. Our approach is independent of the network topology and the routing protocols, and provides therefore a relevant framework for their comparison. We apply our models to a comparative analysis of a well-known flat routing protocol OLSR against two main self-organized structure approaches, VSR and localized CDS.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose an {{integrated}} planning model to adequate the <b>offered</b> <b>capacity</b> and system frequencies to attend the increased passenger demand and traffic congestion around urban and suburban areas. The railway capacity is studied in line planning, however, these planned frequencies were obtained without accounting for rolling stock flows through the rapid transit network. In order to provide the problem more freedom to decide rolling stock flows and therefore better adjusting these flows to passenger demand, a new integrated model is proposed, where frequencies are readjusted. Then, the railway timetable and rolling stock assignment are also calculated, where shunting operations are taken into account. These operations may sometimes malfunction, causing localized incidents that could propagate throughout the entire network due to cascading effects. This type of operations will be penalized with the goal of selectively avoiding them and ameliorating their high malfunction probabilities. Swapping operations will also be ensured using homogeneous rolling stock material and ensuring parkings in strategic stations. We illustrate our model using computational experiments drawn from RENFE (the main Spanish operator of suburban passenger trains) in Madrid, Spain. The results show that through this integrated approach a greater robustness degree can be obtaine...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{statistical}} and econometric model {{to analyze the}} generators' bidding behavior in the NYISO day-ahead wholesale electricity market. The generator level bidding data show very strong persistence in generators' grouping choices over time. Using dynamic random effect ordered probit model, we find that persistence is characterized by positive state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence {{is more important than}} unobserved heterogeneity. The finding of true state dependence suggests a scope for economic policy intervention. If NYISO can implement an effective policy to switch generators from higher price groups to lower price groups, the effect is likely to be lasting. As a result, the market price can be lowered in the long-run. Generators' <b>offered</b> <b>capacity</b> is estimated by a two-stage sample selection model. The estimated results show that generators in higher-priced groups tend to withhold their capacity strategically to push up market prices. It further confirms the importance of an effective policy to turn generators into lower price groups in order to mitigate unexpected price spikes. The simulated market prices based on our estimated aggregate supply curve can replicate most volatility of actual DA market prices. Applying our models to different demand assumptions, we find that demand conditions can affect market prices significantly. It validates the importance of introducing demand side management during the restructure of electricity industry. Electricity Bidding behavior Sample selection Ordered probit model...|$|E
40|$|Provision {{of mobile}} and {{wireless}} services today within a competitive environment and {{driven by a}} huge amount of steadily emerging new services and applications is both challenge and chance for radio network operators. Deployment and operation of an infrastructure for mobile and wireless broadband connectivity generally requires planning effort and large investments. A promising approach to reduce expenses for radio access networking is offered by Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). Here traditional dedicated backhaul connections to each access point are replaced by wireless multi-hop links between neighbouring access nodes and few gateways to the backbone employing standard radio technology. Such a solution provides at the same time high flexibility in both deployment and the amount of <b>offered</b> <b>capacity</b> and shall reduce overall expenses. On the other hand currently available mesh solutions do not provide carrier grade service quality and reliability and often fail to cope with high traffic load. EU project CARMEN (CARrier grade MEsh Networks) was initiated to incorporate different heterogeneous technologies and new protocols to allow for reliable transmission over "best effort" radio channels, to support a reliable mobility and network management, self-configuration and dynamic resource usage, and thus to offer a permanent or temporary broadband access at high cost efficiency. The contribution provides an overview on preliminary project results with focus on main technical challenges from a research and implementation point of view. Especially impact of mesh topology on the overall system performance in terms of throughput and connection reliability and aspects of a dedicated hybrid mobility management solution will be discussed.

Over the last decade, mobile networks have become a critical infrastructure. Private individuals, governments and businesses rely on mobile networks to provide stable and robust services, both in everyday life and in crisis. There is also an increasing demand for capacity as new and more mobile broadband challenging services are being used. The society will rely on the mobile networks to provide higher capacity, more coverage and increased robustness in the future to come. This provides new challenges for all actors in the mobile industry, {{in order to meet the}} increasing demands of the society. The thesis is written in collaboration with the Norwegian Communication Authority (Nkom) in order to investigate the future development of the mobile network infrastructure with a techno-economical and regulatory point of view. Through literature studies, the thesis has investigated the <b>offered</b> <b>capacity,</b> coverage, and robustness of mobile networks today, as well as the current market structure and current market shares in the Norwegian mobile market.

The first part of the methodology relates to the characterization and evaluation of the current system, while a second part proposes an approach to analyze the possible development limit. As part of the work, general criteria are established to define the framework in which the analysis and diagnostic methodology presented is placed. They are: the use of Air Traffic Control (ATC) sectors as analysis unit, the presence of network effects, the tactical focus, the relative character of the analysis, objectivity and a high level assessment that allows assumptions on the human and Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) elements, considered as the typical high density air traffic resources. The steps followed by the methodology start with the definition of indicators and metrics, like the nominal criticality or the nominal efficiency of a sector; scenario characterization where the necessary data is collected; network effects analysis to study the relations among the constitutive elements of the ATC system; diagnostic by means of the “System Status Diagram”; analytical study of the ATC system development limit; and finally, formulation of conclusions and proposal for improvement.

40|$|The essay {{deals with}} the pro-family {{measures}} implemented at the municipal level {{in the village of}} Benesov. The theoretical approach for the treatment of the topic was mainly covered with the professional publications, recommendations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for the realisation of the social and pro-family policy in general at the municipal level, and selected legal standards that apply to the issue. Data relating to family policy were obtained from the archives of departments of the Municipality of Benesov (applied technology secondary data analysis), especially MLSA data, VÚPSV etc, further study of documents, and a private survey realised in the social services of the pro-family care. To obtain the necessary data, a qualitative research was used, as well as a basic research method. The aim was primarily to find out what family policy measures implemented by the village of Benesov at the municipal level, and their analysis. The aim of the analysis was to investigate what the offer of social services was like, which devices were offered and in what quality level, which of the services is of highest demand by families and if the <b>offered</b> <b>capacity</b> was sufficient. Furthermore, it was investigated to what extent the measures pro-family policy implemented within the municipality Benešov was in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and assess the real effectiveness of these measures. Therefore a comparison with the concept of family policy was made. All these investigations have been carried out and naturally, {{that took place in the}} context of a specific target group of these services in the village of Benesov, their structure (demographic, socio-economic, etc.) and the needs of different groups of recipients pro-family measures. When creating the job, everything was based on a hypothesis that the municipality of Benesov puts a high effort to fulfill the pro-family policies based on national pro-family policies level, however, it is being applied to the specific conditions of the village of Benesov and its inhabitants. The hypothesis presupposes the lack of capacity of equipment for pre-school education of children and further lack of space in shelters for mothers and children, as well as certain provisions in the area of social welfare, namely inflexibility in response to specific stimuli and the resulting solution to the acute crisis situations. The results of the survey showed that family policy community in Benesov is on a relatively good level, carried out in accordance with the pro-family policies, and respects the specific needs of the inhabitants of the village of Benesov. It was also found that the pro-family policy is implemented, inter alia, through grants and bodies under the aegis of the Středočeský kraj. It also appeared in the investigation that the hypothesis with which this essay was created was relevant and fully occurred to its confirmation.
