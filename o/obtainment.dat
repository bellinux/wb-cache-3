25|$|The Dragée de Valence is a {{confection}} of praline or {{of chocolate}} coated in sugar {{made in the}} purest tradition, to celebrate the solemn events of life such as baptisms, communions and weddings. The materials used are graded and regular almonds coming mainly from France (Ferraduelle), but also of Spain (Longuette, Planeta) or Sicily (Avola). These varieties {{are the only ones}} which allow the <b>obtainment</b> of a very pleasing dragée.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{stresses}} the <b>obtainment</b> {{and protection of}} land and passageways that promise commercial wealth. In the case of Algeria, the Port of Algiers, and the control over the Strait of Gibraltar, were considered by Tocqueville to be particularly valuable. Direct control of the political operations of the entirety of Algeria, however, was not. Thus the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence {{as a means to}} colonization of commercially valuable areas.|$|E
25|$|In the Mahayana world view, {{there are}} also pure lands which lie outside this {{continuum}} and are created by the Buddhas upon attaining enlightenment. Rebirth in the pure land of Amitabha {{is seen as an}} assurance of Buddhahood, for once reborn there, beings do not fall back into cyclical existence unless they choose to do so to save other beings, the goal of Buddhism being the <b>obtainment</b> of enlightenment and freeing oneself and others from the birth–death cycle.|$|E
25|$|This {{commission}} {{resulted in}} a number of changes, implemented in 1993, which instituted provisions that (among other things) required a bride’s verbal consent to marriage, eliminated a father’s right to force his daughter to marry, and mandated the <b>obtainment</b> of a judge’s permission in cases of polygamy and a husband’s repudiation of his wife. Generally these reforms were considered superficial, but significant as an indicator that the Mudawana was not an unchangeable standard, as it had previously been perceived. Considering the religious origin of the laws, {{the fact that they had}} been amended at all was a significant step in demonstrating that they were subject to the process of ijtihad and not completely unchangeable.|$|E
25|$|An exergoeconomic {{assessment}} {{accounting for}} the total and non-renewable unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions of Brazilian electricity is performed by Flórez-Orrego et al. (2014), comprising thermal, nuclear, hydro, wind farms and biomass-fired power plants. The analysis starts from the fuel <b>obtainment</b> and continues through the different stages of construction, fuel transportation and processing, operation and decommissioning of the plant, with electricity generation as the desired output. This approach allows the calculation of direct CO2 emissions {{as well as the}} upstream and downstream emissions, which {{play an important role in}} some technologies. In this way, a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved. An iterative calculation procedure is used to determine the unit exergy costs of electricity and processed fuels, since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes.|$|E

2500|$|According to Buddhaghosa, in his {{influential}} standard-work Visuddhimagga, samadhi is the [...] "proximate cause" [...] to the <b>obtainment</b> of wisdom. The Visuddhimagga describes 40 different {{objects for}} meditation, which are mentioned throughout the Pali canon, but explicitly enumerated in the Visuddhimagga, such as mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati) and loving kindness (metta).|$|E
2500|$|The National Research Council's Emergency Committee on Psychology {{decided to}} create a book that would focus on the {{psychology}} of the majority of soldiers in the army, the ordinary GI, instead of focusing on the higher level officers. In 1943 Psychology for the Fighting Man was published. [...] The book focused on practical information, such as boosting the morale of soldiers, personal-adjustment in the army, and <b>obtainment</b> of necessities such as food. The book sold 380,000 copies and brought The National Research Council about $10,000.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} was different with the [...] "second generation", born in France, [...] {{and as such}} French citizens by jus soli influenced law. As such, they cannot be designated [...] "immigrants", since they were born on national territory. A 1992 reform of the nationality laws delayed <b>obtainment</b> of French nationality until a request at adulthood (where previously it was automatically given). A large number of them are located in housing projects in the suburbs. Unlike in the United States and elsewhere, the French working classes often reside outside large cities, sometimes in villes nouvelles (such as Sarcelles, from which the term sarcellite was derived), for which limited infrastructure other than sleeping dormitories has been planned, partially explaining a general boredom which some have noted contributed to the 2005 Paris suburb riots.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Lynch {{suggests}} that the earlier 20th century historians made hasty evaluations of both Robert II and Robert III, when they characterised them as [...] "pathetically weak personalities" [...] and their reigns as [...] "nineteen years of senility and sixteen of infirmity". Lynch also {{makes the point that}} the complaints made in the later chronicles of lawlessness and disturbance in the country was mainly confined to the north with the king's brother Alexander, lord of Badenoch and Earl of Buchan at its root. The death of John, lord of the Isles heralded a state of dissension between the lordship and the crown that was to last for two generations and which even Robert III's successor James I was unable to deal with properly. Lynch states that much of the troubles during Robert III's reign derived from the sharp deterioration of the royal revenues. The unruliness of northern Scotland was the result of competing factions within the royal family—Lynch {{suggests that}} the weakness in kingship before 1406 [...] "can be exaggerated", citing Buchan's enforced appearance at Robert III's council to answer for his incendiary attack on Elgin and its cathedral, and Albany's <b>obtainment</b> of a submission from the lord of the Isles.|$|E
6000|$|To this end, {{a measure}} of value is the first requisite. And happily, {{respecting}} the true measure of value, as expressed in general terms, {{there can be no}} dispute. Every one in contending for the worth of any particular order of information, does so by showing its bearing upon some part of life. In reply to the question--"Of what use is it?" [...] the mathematician, linguist, naturalist, or philosopher, explains the way in which his learning beneficially influences action--saves from evil or secures good--conduces to happiness. When the teacher of writing has pointed out how great an aid writing is to success in business--that is, to the <b>obtainment</b> of sustenance--that is, to satisfactory living; he is held to have proved his case. And when the collector of dead facts (say a numismatist) fails to make clear any appreciable effects which these facts can produce on human welfare, he is obliged to admit that they are comparatively valueless. All then, either directly or by implication, appeal to this as the ultimate test.|$|E
60|$|Comparative Psychology, {{while it}} raises this inquiry, prepares {{the way for}} {{answering}} it. When observing the differences between races, we can scarcely fail to observe also how these differences correspond with differences between their conditions of existence, and consequent activities. Among the lowest races of men, love of property stimulates to the <b>obtainment</b> only of such things as satisfy immediate desires, or desires of the immediate future. Improvidence is the rule: there is little effort to meet remote contingencies. But the growth of established societies having gradually given security of possession, {{there has been an}} increasing tendency to provide for coming years: there has been a constant exercise of the feeling which is satisfied by a provision for the future; {{and there has been a}} growth of this feeling so great that it now prompts accumulation to an extent beyond what is needful. Note, again, that under the discipline of social life--under a comparative abstinence from aggressive actions, and a performance of those naturally-serviceable actions implied by the division of labour--there has been a development of those gentle emotions of which inferior races exhibit but the rudiments. Savages delight in giving pain rather than pleasure--are almost devoid of sympathy; while among ourselves, philanthropy organizes itself in laws, establishes numerous institutions, and dictates countless private benefactions.|$|E
60|$|And now {{we come to}} that {{remaining}} {{division of}} human life which includes the relaxations and amusements filling leisure hours. After considering what training best fits for self-preservation, for the <b>obtainment</b> of sustenance, for the discharge of parental duties, and for the regulation {{of social and political}} conduct; we have now to consider what training best fits for the miscellaneous ends not included in these--for the enjoyment of Nature, of Literature, and of the Fine Arts, in all their forms. Postponing them as we do to things that bear more vitally upon human welfare; and bringing everything, as we have, to the test of actual value; it will perhaps be inferred that we are inclined to slight these less essential things. No greater mistake could be made, however. We yield to none in the value we attach to aesthetic culture and its pleasures. Without painting, sculpture, music, poetry, and the emotions produced by natural beauty of every kind, life would lose half its charm. So far from regarding the training and gratification of the tastes as unimportant, we believe that in time to come they will occupy a much larger share of human life than now. When the forces of Nature have been fully conquered to man's use--when the means of production have been brought to perfection--when labour has been economised to the highest degree--when education has been so systematised that a preparation for the more essential activities may be made with comparative rapidity--and when, consequently, there is a great increase of spare time; then will the beautiful, both in Art and Nature, rightly fill a large space in the minds of all.|$|E
6000|$|Take other cases:--All {{phenomena}} recognised by the eyes, {{through which}} {{only are the}} data of exact science ascertainable, are complicated with optical phenomena; and cannot be exhaustively known until optical principles are known. The burning of a candle cannot be explained without involving chemistry, mechanics, thermology. Every wind that blows is determined by influences partly solar, partly lunar, partly hygrometric; and implies considerations of fluid equilibrium and physical geography. The direction, dip, and variations of the magnetic needle, are facts half terrestrial, half celestial--are caused by earthly forces which have cycles of change corresponding with astronomical periods. The flowing of the gulf-stream and the annual migration of icebergs towards the equator, depending as they do on the balancing of the centripetal and centrifugal forces acting on the ocean, involve in their explanation the Earth's rotation and spheroidal form, the laws of hydrostatics, the relative densities of cold and warm water, and the doctrines of evaporation. It is no doubt true, as M. Comte says, that [...] "our position in the solar system, and the motions, form, size, equilibrium {{of the mass of}} our world among the planets, must be known before we can understand the phenomena going on at its surface." [...] But, fatally for his hypothesis, {{it is also true that}} we must understand a great part of the phenomena going on at its surface before we can know its position, etc., in the solar system. It is not simply that, as we have already shown, those geometrical and mechanical principles by which celestial appearances are explained, were first generalised from terrestrial experiences; but it is that the very <b>obtainment</b> of correct data, on which to base astronomical generalisations, implies advanced terrestrial physics.|$|E
60|$|The {{status of}} {{children}} born of American parents residing {{in a foreign}} country, of American women who have married aliens, of American citizens residing abroad where such question is not regulated by treaty, are all sources of frequent difficulty and discussion. Legislation on these and similar questions, and particularly defining when {{and under what circumstances}} expatriation can be accomplished or is to be presumed, is especially needed. In this connection I earnestly call the attention of Congress to the difficulties arising from fraudulent naturalization. The United States wisely, freely, and liberally offers its citizenship to all who may come in good faith to reside within its limits on their complying with certain prescribed reasonable and simple formalities and conditions. Among the highest duties of the Government is that to afford firm, sufficient, and equal protection to all its citizens, whether native born or naturalized. Care should be taken that a right carrying with it such support from the Government should not be fraudulently obtained, and should be bestowed only upon full proof of a compliance with the law; and yet frequent instances are {{brought to the attention of}} the Government of illegal and fraudulent naturalization and of the unauthorized use of certificates thus improperly obtained. In some cases the fraudulent character of the naturalization has appeared upon the face of the certificate itself; in others examination discloses that the holder had not complied with the law, and in others certificates have been obtained where the persons holding them not only were not entitled to be naturalized, but had not even been within the United States at the time of the pretended naturalization. Instances of each of these classes of fraud are discovered at our legations, where the certificates of naturalization are presented either for the purpose of obtaining passports or in demanding the protection of the legation. When the fraud is apparent on the face of such certificates, they are taken up by the representatives of the Government and forwarded to the Department of State. But even then the record of the court in which the fraudulent naturalization occurred remains, and duplicate certificates are readily obtainable. Upon the presentation of these for the issue of passports or in demanding protection of the Government, the fraud sometimes escapes notice, and such certificates are not infrequently used in transactions of business to the deception and injury of innocent parties. Without placing any additional obstacles in the way of the <b>obtainment</b> of citizenship by the worthy and well-intentioned foreigner who comes in good faith to cast his lot with ours, I earnestly recommend further legislation to punish fraudulent naturalization and to secure the ready cancellation of the record of every naturalization made in fraud.|$|E
