We give {{a method}} to {{determine}} relative periodic <b>orbits</b> in <b>point</b> vortex systems: it consists mainly into perform a symplectic reduction on a fixed point submanifold {{in order to obtain}} a two-dimensional reduced phase space. The method is applied to point vortices systems on a sphere and on the plane, but works for other surfaces with isotropy (cylinder, ellipsoid, [...] .). The method permits also to determine some relative equilibria and heteroclinic cycles connecting these relative equilibria.

To color any such pixel, let [...] be the midpoint of that pixel. We now iterate the critical point 0 under , checking at each step whether the <b>orbit</b> <b>point</b> has modulus larger than 2.

50|$|This time {{derived from}} the phase angle is the {{required}} time the spacecraft must gain or lose to be located at the final position within the orbit. To gain or lose this time, the spacecraft must be subjected to a simple two-impulse Hohmann transfer which takes the spacecraft away from, and then back to, its original orbit. The first impulse to change the spacecraft’s orbit is performed at a specific point in the original <b>orbit</b> (<b>point</b> of impulse, POI), usually performed in the original orbit’s periapsis or apoapsis. The impulse creates a new orbit called the “phasing orbit” and is larger or smaller than the original orbit resulting in a different period time than the original orbit. The difference in period time between the original and phasing orbits will be equal to the time converted from the phase angle. Once one period of the phasing orbit is complete, the spacecraft {{will return to the}} POI and the spacecraft will once again be subjected to a second impulse, equal and opposite to the first impulse, to return it to the original orbit. When complete, the spacecraft will be in the targeted final position within the original obit.|$|E

40|$|The homoclinic {{bifurcation}} {{properties of}} a planar dynamical system are analyzed {{and the corresponding}} bifurcation diagram is presented. The occurrence of two Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation points provides two local existing curves of homoclinic orbits to a saddle excluding the separatrices not belonging to the homoclinic orbits. Using numerical techniques, these curves are continued in the parameter space. Two further curves of homoclinic orbits to a saddle including the separatrices not belonging to the homoclinic orbits are calculated by numerical methods. All these curves of homoclinic orbits have a unique intersection point, at which there exists a double homoclinic orbit. The local homoclinic bifurcation diagram of both the double homoclinic <b>orbit</b> <b>point</b> and the points of homoclinic orbits to a saddle-node are also gained by numerical computation and simulation...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{simulated}} {{the expansion}} of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) - the largest metropolitan area in Brazil- by the year 2030 using the Dinamica EGO software with data extracted from Landsat TM 7 (<b>orbit</b> <b>point</b> 219 076, resolution 30 x 30 m). Based on the urban area in 2008, we used an urban growth scenario to analyze urban expansion up to 2030. Subsequently, we used ArcGIS to integrate the spatial information, combining layers to create risk maps. In this case, environmental risk factors, along with flood and landslide probabilities, were considered in order to identify high-risk areas. By 2030, the urban area was projected to increase by approximately 38. 7 %, and to cover 3250 km(2). With this growth, 807 km(2) of the region (and similar to 4. 27 % of urban expansion areas) will be in flood risk zones...|$|E
40|$|Analysis and {{simulation}} {{results are presented}} for magnetic field models for use in attitude acquisition onboard Solar Maximum Mission (SMM). A study {{was made of the}} degree of the spherical harmonic expansion of the magnetic field required, considering mission requirements, modeling errors, and magnetometer quantization and biases. It is shown that a fifth-degree field is sufficient to provide two-degree roll angle determination accuracy with a residual magnetic bias of 10 milligauss. Also, a spherical harmonic expansion for the McIlwain L-parameter is included for the first time. This parameter will be telemetered to ground with experimental data. The fifth-degree expansion will provide the L-parameter to within two percent of accepted values. The additional onboard computational burden is the storage of 36 coefficients and an increase of about 15 % in computation time. Prototype flight code was developed which is anticipated to require about 2000 bytes of core storage and 30 milliseconds of computation time per <b>orbit</b> <b>point</b> on the NSSC- 1 computer...|$|E

40|$|A {{non-moving}} electron hydrogen {{model is}} proposed, resolving a long standing contradiction (94 years) in the hydrogen atom. This, however, forces to {{not use the}} "in an <b>orbit</b> <b>point</b> particle kinetic energy" as the phenomenon responsible for the atom stability. The repulsion between the masses of the electron and proton is what is responsible of such stability. The mass of the electron is a field fully described by the uncertainty principle through the confinement of the particle, which {{is also consistent with}} the general theory of relativity that states: "mass-energy tells the space how to bend". Ergo, mass exerts a tension on its surrounding space and the lighter the mass the larger the space it will occupy. Based on this concept it is proposed that the orbital is the electron. The electron's orbitals are just the electron's different ways of intersecting the space; with different magnetic momenta. The coupling of this momenta with the magnetic moment of the proton finally explains the hyperfine structure of the hydrogen spectrum with an overwhelming simplicit...|$|E

We will put a hyperbolic ball around each <b>orbit</b> <b>point</b> of the origin and refer to their union as the archipelago of Γ. The main topic {{of this paper is}} the question: "How big is the archipelago of Γ?" We will study different ways to answer various meanings of that question using concepts from potential theory such as minimal thinness and rarefiedness in order to give connections between the theory of discrete groups and small sets in potential theory. One of the answers that will be given says that the critical exponent of Γ equals the Hausdorff dimension of the set on the unit sphere where the archipelago of Γ is not minimally thin. Another answer tells us that the limit set of a geometrically finite Fuchsian group Γ is the set on the boundary where the archipelago of Γ is not rarefied...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} {{of using the}} mission planning and analysis division (MPAD) common format trajectory data tape to predict temperatures for preflight and post flight mission analysis is presented and evaluated. All of the analyses utilized the latest Space Transportation System 1 flight (STS- 1) MPAD trajectory tape, and the simplified ' 136 note' midsection/payload bay thermal math model. For the first 6. 7 hours of the STS- 1 flight profile, transient temperatures are presented for selected nodal locations with the current standard method, and the trajectory tape method. Whether the differences are considered significant or not depends upon the view point. Other transient temperature predictions are also presented. These results were obtained to investigate an initial concern that perhaps the predicted temperature {{differences between the two}} methods would not only be caused by the inaccuracies of the current method's assumed nominal attitude profile but also be affected by a lack of a sufficient number of orbit points in the current method.

40|$|As part of {{the space}} {{qualification}} effort for blue-red reflecting coverslides designed for use with GaAs solar cells, the first long-term (3000 hours) UV testing of unirradiated and 1 MeV electron-irradiated GaAs solar cells, with 4 types of multilayer-coated coverslides to reduce operating temperature, has produced some unexpected results. Important conclusions from this study, which includes two parallel tests, are as follows: (1) All of the GaAs solar cells with multilayer-coated coverslides display UV degradation. The laboratory data, extrapolated to 10 years in <b>orbit,</b> <b>point</b> to a significant loss mechanism {{from a combination of}} absorption and a reduction in optical match in such coatings from this portion of the space environment; (2) The effects of contamination in a vacuum system, on the measured degradation in solar-cell short-circuit current during a UV test, depend upon the type of coverslide coatings present on the coverslide surfaces. This has implications for both coated coverslides and optical solar reflectors (OSR's) in space; and (3) Because of the observed trends in this test and uncertainties in the extrapolation of data for multilayer coated coverslides, the use of any multilayer-coated coverslides for extended missions (greater than 1 year) cannot be recommended without prior flight testing...|$|E

The atmospheric correction was preceded using the method developed by Chavez (1996), based on the subtraction of the dark object, and known like COST. For this, an algorithm was developed in a computational language LEGAL (Space Language for Algebraic Geoprocessement), based on the method described by Skirvin (2002). Were derived fraction-images soil, shadow and vegetation through the technique of MLME. In the fraction-image shadow forest stains were detected with differentiated values of fraction shadow of the remaining of the area.
