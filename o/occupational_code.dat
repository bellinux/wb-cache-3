40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The aim of this project was to analyse population, economy and social and family structure in mid- 19 th century Hertfordshire, in comparative perspective. The 1851 census {{was the first to}} provide details of both county and town or parish of birth of each individual, whilst clearer instructions were provided for the recording of occupations, the work of members of the head's family and for recording details of farm size and agricultural labour force. There is therefore a wealth of economic, social and demographic information contained in the 1851 census, whilst its consistent and highly structured format renders it ideally suited to treatment by database management systems. Main Topics : The dataset includes a full transcription of the Census Enumerators' Books for Berkhamsted Superintendent Registrar's District in Hertfordshire, enhanced with occupational codings. Variables in the dataset include : record number, surname, forename, schedule number, address, relation to head of household, marital status, age, gender, occupation, social status code, Booth/Armstrong <b>occupational</b> <b>code,</b> raw material <b>occupational</b> <b>code,</b> product <b>occupational</b> <b>code,</b> county of birth, place of birth, disabilities, enumeration district, parish/sub-parish unit, date, PRO reference, ages under one year...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} social class and {{corresponding}} measurement schemes has evolved separately in Europe and the US. On both continents a standardized <b>occupational</b> <b>coding</b> system exists {{that can be}} transferred into a wide scala of measures of socioeconomic status. This dataset contains a crosswalk between the two standardized historical <b>occupational</b> <b>coding</b> schemes: HISCO and Occ 1950. The Historical International Standardized Classification of Occupations (HISCO) is the European standard for <b>occupational</b> <b>coding</b> {{and can be used}} to generate social class schemes, such as HISCLASS, SOCPO, and HISCAM. The U. S. Bureau of the Census' 1950 standard (Occ 1950) is the U. S. standard for <b>occupational</b> <b>coding</b> and can be used to generate social class schemes, like NPBOSS, OCCSCORE, PRESGL, and SEI. With the crosswalk, HISCO can be converted to the American class coding schemes and Occ 1950 into the European class <b>coding</b> schemes. <b>Occupational</b> categories were linked between HISCO and Occ 1950 on the underlying occupations. Both HISCO and Occ 1950 consist of multiple layers of occupational groups. HISCO is divided in 7 major, 76 minor, 296 unit, and 1, 675 micro groups, which roughly correspond with: social classes, sectors, occupational groups, and occupational subgroups. Occ 1950 on the other hand is divided in 10 social classes and 269 occupational groups. HISCO’s micro groups and Occ 1950 ’s occupational subgroups are based on a well-documented number of occupations, which can easily be compared and matched between both <b>occupational</b> <b>coding</b> schemes. In the translation from HISCO to Occ 1950 1, 675 occupational categories were collapsed into 229 Occ 1950 unique occupational groups. Although 40 occupational groups in Occ 1950 could not be retrieved from HISCO, all occupations were successfully attributed to the right social class. Vice versa, 269 occupational groups in Occ 1950 were recoded into 227 HISCO micro groups. Together these 227 unique codes are well-spread over the different branches of the HISCO tree, as they cover most of the unit groups. #Please note {{that this is not the}} crosswalk from Occ 1950 to the intermediate HISCO used by the NAPP project, also known as OCCHISCO or NAPPHISCO.

40|$|M. A. Since {{personality}} plays a {{very important}} role in the choice of career, it was decided to undertake a study whereby the personality traits of individuals of a particular career, namely that of estate agent was explored. The purpose of the study therefore, is to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in certain personality dimensions between estate agents who according to Holland (1997) fit the estate agents category and estate agents who according to Holland (1997) do not fit the estate agents category. Career counselling is discussed {{on the basis of the}} current literature on the topic. Career counselling entails matching an individual’s interests and abilities to a suitable career. The viewpoints regarding career counselling that are discussed in this study are the Trait and Factor theory, the career developmental approach of Super (1953) and Holland’s (1997) occupational interest theory. Holland’s (1997) theory is conceptualised in depth as his theory plays a large role in the current study. Furthermore, because personality plays a large role in an individual’s decision of career, various temperament and personality theories are discussed. The factors differentiating temperament from personality have also been included. Finally the relationship between personality and work is explained. The sample group consisted of 44 estate agents who work at one of three branches of the same real estate agency in Johannesburg. Holland’s (1994 b) Self Directed Search (SDS) was used to establish the specific occupational three letter code of each of the participating estate agents. This code was compared to the code found in the Occupations Finder (1994 a) which specifies the code established by Holland (1994 a) as the suitable code for estate agents, (namely ESI). Based on their SDS codes, the participants were divided into two groups. Group one consisted of estate agents who have either ‘ES’ or ‘SE’ as the first two letters of their <b>occupational</b> <b>code,</b> in other words the estate agents closely resembling Holland’s (1994 a) code and therefore those that fit the estate agents category according to Holland (1994 a).

These descriptions are used to derive each respondent’s ISCO- 08 three-digit occupation. Using Quintini’s (2011 b) coding strategy, updated for ISCO- 08 codes, each occupation is assigned to one of the nine fields of study (see Appendix 1 for details on the calculation of field-of-study mismatch). Whenever a worker reports having studied in a field that is different than the field(s) that correspond to his/her occupation, the worker is considered to be mismatched by field-of-study. The coding that assigns each <b>occupational</b> <b>code</b> to the corresponding field or fields of study is available in Appendix 1. Under this coding scheme, certain occupations may be matched to more than one field, as a particular occupation may be a relevant destination for graduates from different fields (e.g. an author, journalist or linguist (ISCO- 08 code 264) is considered to be matched to his/her field of study if they graduated from the “Humanities, languages and arts” or “Social sciences, business and law” fields).

We show that our gender-specific crosswalk more accurately captures the trends in occupational segregation that are masked using the aggregate crosswalk (based on combined male and female employment) provided by the U.

A primary mechanism by which occupational segregation was reduced over the 1970 - 2009 period was through the entry of new cohorts of women, presumably better prepared than their predecessors and/or encountering less labor market discrimination; during the 1970 s and 1980 s, however, there were also decreases in occupational segregation within cohorts.
