25|$|On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol {{was driving}} a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he {{collided}} with the rear of a braking truck 10km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half {{of his face and}} incurred cuts <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> cost him the sight of his right eye. Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as “the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas”. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the main}} protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII. He is a young student at Balamb Garden who was {{identifiable}} by the scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> a fellow student, Seifer, inflicted. He rarely speaks and has {{the reputation of being}} a lone wolf. As Squall's story unfolds, he becomes fascinated with and falls in love with Rinoa, despite never outwardly expressing such until the ending. Squall is characterized by forlorn memories of standing out in the rain at the orphanage where he grew up, wondering where [...] "Sis" [...] went. Squall's weapon is a gunblade, a sword that uses components of a revolver to send vibrations through the blade when triggered. His Limit Break is a series of sword strikes called Renzokuken.|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific smile <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was {{very happy with the}} change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E
60|$|The man still {{sat with}} the {{invisible}} sneer-grin <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and <b>that</b> peculiar and immovable plant of his Italian posterior.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} was thoughtful, and Sigismund; whose eye {{had been}} earnestly riveted <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> thought <b>that</b> it denoted more of peace then usual.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! so shall I," [...] {{said the}} little waif, {{with a look}} of {{determination}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> small <b>face</b> <b>that</b> amused me greatly, [...] "for she's a good gal is Edie--if she ain't drownded." ...|$|R
60|$|And Barbara saw, {{once more}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> look, neither sad nor impatient, {{but as of}} one {{uninhabited}} and waiting.|$|E
60|$|Ay, I saw him once. The {{sun shone}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>that</b> smiled and smiled, A sight not {{wholesome}} {{to the eyes}} of man.|$|E
60|$|To {{all this}} Captain Wopper listened in perfect silence, {{with a blank}} {{expression}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> revealed nothing {{of the state of}} feeling within.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do that, indeed," [...] {{promised the}} school superintendent. But {{as he watched}} her depart, there was a queer {{expression}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> lean <b>face</b> <b>that</b> it was well Mary Louise did not see.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{the least}} {{impressive}} {{of those who}} stood by, smiling, was {{the figure of the}} tall Colonel, his hat off for once, and pride written <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Oh, <b>that</b> <b>his</b> dear wife might have lived to see this! ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Toots {{said this}} without the least {{notion of what}} he was talking about, and sat down on a chair, staring at Florence with the liveliest {{contention}} of delight and despair going <b>on</b> in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> any <b>face</b> could exhibit.|$|R
60|$|It {{was easy}} to see, by the glowering look <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>that</b> the meeting this night had not turned out as he had wished.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{sat down}} again and re-perused the letter, {{with a variety of}} {{expression}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> might have recalled the typical April day, minus the tears.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} Lieutenant Gulston entered the doctor's cabin. There was {{a look of}} anger {{as well as of}} grief <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> the doctor did not understand.|$|E
60|$|Old Jolyon {{turned the}} key softly in the lock, pushed open the door, and beckoned. His son saw him gravely hanging up his coat, with an {{expression}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> like <b>that</b> of a boy who intends to steal cherries.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pike stopped {{beside me}} a moment and while he watched the men I watched him. The {{expression}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was <b>that</b> of a cattle-buyer, and it was plain that he was disgusted {{with the quality of}} cattle delivered.|$|R
50|$|In {{a similar}} way, the paradox still occurs if the barber {{is a man}} in our town who cannot grow a beard. Once again, he does not shave himself (because he has no hair <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face),</b> but <b>that</b> implies that he does shave himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps. But {{you go back}} to the fire," [...] and Slavin went back, {{but with}} a look <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> rivaled the black clouds in the heavens outside.|$|E
6000|$|... (I was afraid--literally afraid--to turn my eyes Oscar's way. I {{glanced at}} Nugent instead. There was a devilish smile <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> it nearly drove me mad to see.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} will. Good night, miss," [...] and Tony {{walked away with}} a merry look <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>that</b> Nelly would not have {{understood}} if she had seen it.|$|E
60|$|Looking {{towards him}} with a {{movement}} of her eyes only, the girl noticed the strong feeling <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> with <b>that</b> intense interest which his person awakened in her mind and in her heart. But it soon passed away, leaving only a moody expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, come, Watson, {{you know}} you are extra strong," [...] put in Allen. [...] "Why, he can do some {{wonderful}} things when he wants to." [...] To this Watson made no reply, but the grin <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> showed <b>that</b> he appreciated the compliment.|$|R
6000|$|... "What has befallen Mabel Dunham?" [...] {{demanded the}} young man, {{with a frown}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{handsome}} <b>face,</b> <b>that</b> was visible even to those on the block. [...] "If a hair of her head has been touched, it will go hard with the whole Iroquois tribe." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Crusoe {{stood by}} the fire with his head up, and an {{expression}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> said, [...] "Hello, man! what's wrong? You've forgot Charlie! Hold on! Are you mad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Arthur's {{increasing}} wish {{to speak}} of something very different was by this time so plainly written <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>that</b> Flora stopped in a tender look, and asked him what it was? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} have let the poor beast drown because his mistresses were spiteful hags." [...] And there was a look <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> made me cry out in pain, [...] "Don't, Harry!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's away in Paris," [...] Val said, {{staring at}} the very queer {{expression}} <b>on</b> <b>his</b> uncle's <b>face,</b> like--like <b>that</b> of a snarling dog.|$|R
60|$|Not until Mr. Fernald had peremptorily {{ordered the}} boy to open the letter {{in order to see}} if it was {{intended}} for him, did the amateur as much as touch the soiled envelope; but after having torn it open the expression <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> told <b>that</b> the writer was not a stranger.|$|R
5000|$|An army of {{religious}} all-male fanatics who have sworn {{to kill the}} Blood King. Death means nothing to them. They are led by the Blood King’s brother, Rasha. Every Flark wears opaque goggles and has an “x” tattooed somewhere <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> Flarks <b>that</b> have been mentioned by name include Abdul, Achmed, Hussan, Kamal, Moses, and Rasha.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly my {{attention}} {{was arrested by}} a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace. It was the expression <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> was extraordinary--a curious mingling of terror and agitation.|$|E
60|$|The man {{sat with}} bent head, {{looking into the}} glowing coal, {{whistling}} through his teeth, a look of sullen resignation and endurance <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> had never been there before. His very attitude was alien and ominous.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour or two}} {{passed before}} Felix returned. At last he arrived, very white and pale, and Muriel saw at once by the mere look <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>that</b> he had learned some terrible news at the Frenchman's.|$|E
60|$|Dirk Stroeve, {{telling the}} story, {{had such a}} look of blank astonishment <b>on</b> <b>his</b> round, foolish <b>face</b> <b>that</b> it was almost {{impossible}} not to laugh.|$|R
60|$|Here, in the lamp-light, his figure (no {{more than}} medium height), well squared in its white evening waistcoat, his light {{overcoat}} flung over his arm, a pink flower in <b>his</b> button-hole, and <b>on</b> <b>his</b> dark <b>face</b> <b>that</b> look of confident, good-humoured insolence, {{he was at}} his best--a thorough man of the world.|$|R
60|$|So {{the talk}} ran on {{until there was}} a knock at the door and Aleck appeared. The look <b>on</b> <b>his</b> black <b>face</b> showed <b>that</b> he was excited.|$|R
