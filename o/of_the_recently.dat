5|$|Europium {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recently</b> discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and {{who was able to}} isolate it in 1901; he then named it europium.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the French in the south {{threatened}} existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on opposite sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recently</b> ended Nine Years' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{cladogram}} {{was published}} in 2007, inverting the placement of Goura and Dicunculus and including the pheasant pigeon (Otidiphaps nobilis) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) {{at the base of}} the clade. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recently</b> extinct spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E

5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recently</b> ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a {{reduction in the number of}} military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recently</b> promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E

5|$|As {{the siege}} continued, {{supplies}} once again {{began to run}} out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a priority. On 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, the Commander in Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recently</b> established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.|$|E
5|$|Bezen Kadoudal {{was placed}} under the {{supervision}} of Sicherheitsdienst Obersturmbannführer Hartmut Pulmer, and under the military command of Hauptscharführer Hans Grimm, its headquarters were located at 7 Rue de Vincennes, Rennes. Its initial 33 members were recruited from a variety of Breton nationalist organizations, some of them had already served in collaborationist militias. Terms of enlistment specified that it will only engage French opponents within the borders of Brittany. On 15 December, Bezen Kadoudal was renamed into Bezen Perrot (Perrot Unit), in honor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recently</b> assassinated Breton nationalist Jean-Marie Perrot, German documents record it under the name Bretonische Waffenverband der SS. At the top of its strength the unit numbered 80 members the pseudonyms of 65 of whom are recorded. Pseudonyms were used {{in order to protect the}} members' identities. It was headed by Lainé, and his assistants, field commander Ange Péresse and Jean Chanteau, the latter being responsible for intelligence.|$|E
5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recently</b> founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E
