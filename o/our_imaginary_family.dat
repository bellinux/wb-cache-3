This model naturally begins effectively to set up boundaries - whether it be in future or past! - especially strongly whenever we reach to high energy physics regimes, such as near the black hole singularity, or in Higgs producing machines as LHC or SSC.

But the notion that the tactile surface itself moves, cannot be given by touch alone, which is competent to testify only to the fact of change of place, not to its cause. The idea of the motion of the tactile surface could not, in fact, be attained, unless the idea of change of place were accompanied by some state of consciousness, which does not exist when the tactile surface is immoveable.

40|$|What do {{we think}} about {{when we think about}} human evolution? With his {{characteristic}} wit and wisdom, anthropologist Jonathan Marks explores our scientific narrative of human origins—the study of evolution—and examines its cultural elements and theoretical foundations. In the process, he situates human evolution within a general anthropological framework and presents it as a special case of kinship and mythology. Tales of the Ex-Apes argues that human evolution has incorporated the emergence of social relations and cultural histories that are unprecedented in the apes and thus cannot be reduced to purely biological properties and processes. Marks shows that human evolution has involved the transformation from biological to biocultural evolution. Over tens of thousands of years, new social roles—notably spouse, father, in-laws, and grandparents—have co-evolved with new technologies and symbolic meanings to produce the human species, in the absence of significant biological evolution. We are biocultural creatures, Marks argues, fully comprehensible by recourse to neither our real ape ancestry nor <b>our</b> <b>imaginary</b> cultureless biology. [URL]...|$|R

Likewise, it will argue that the field photographs that botanists take while out in the field contribute to and are part of constructing <b>our</b> <b>imaginaries.</b> Taken together, they knit an uneven, inconsistent, and heterogeneous view of nature that collides with science. They are not objective nor absolute. They are not fixed nor refined. They are irregular records of knowledge production, which do not fit nicely into plant science research.
