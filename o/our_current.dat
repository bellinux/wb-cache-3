5|$|The Universe can {{be defined}} as {{everything}} that exists, everything that has existed, and everything that will exist. According to <b>our</b> <b>current</b> understanding, the Universe consists of spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation and matter), and the physical laws that relate them. The Universe encompasses all of life, all of history, and some philosophers and scientists suggest that it even encompasses ideas such as mathematics and logic.|$|E
5|$|While {{the book}} focused on ancient civilizations, the {{majority}} of the film addresses environmental impacts of <b>our</b> <b>current</b> 'global civilization', including the impact of concentrating wealth {{in the hands of the}} 'financial class'. It is filmed as a mixture of interviews with individuals, from Wright himself to Jane Goodall and Margaret Atwood, interspersed with striking footage from all over the world. Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks gave an interview in early 2012 on the challenges of adapting Ronald Wright's book into a succinct film.|$|E
5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of <b>our</b> <b>current</b> technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E

5|$|Stebbins wrote {{several books}} {{during his time}} at UC Davis. These {{included}} his follow-up to Variation and Evolution, , {{which was published in}} 1974, following his delivery of the Prather Lectures at Harvard. Stebbins discusses the origins, genetics and developmental biology of the angiosperms. He argues for the role of adaptive radiation in the diversification of the angiosperms and the usefulness of applying <b>our</b> <b>current</b> understanding of species' genetics and ecology to gain knowledge about the evolution of ancient species. He also wrote Processes of Organic Evolution, The Basis of Progressive Evolution, Chromosomal Evolution in Plants and the textbook Evolution with co-authors Dobzhansky, Francisco Ayala and James W. Valentine. His last book, Darwin to DNA, Molecules to Humanity was published in 1982.|$|E

40|$|Defect {{analysis}} {{is needed for}} samples ranging in thickness from thin films to large engineering parts. We are meeting that need with two positron beam lifetime spectrometers: on on a 3 MeV electrostatic accelerator and the second on <b>our</b> high <b>current</b> linac beam. The high energy beam spectrometer performs positron lifetime analysis on thick samples which can be encapsulated for containment or for in situ measurements in controlled environments. At <b>our</b> high <b>current</b> beam, we are developing a low energy, microscopically focused, pulsed positron beam to enable positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy for defect specific, 3 -D maps with sub-micron location resolution.

25|$|Swammerdam was not {{a pioneer}} in the study of anatomy as he was in study of insects, but he {{nonetheless}} made important contributions. His use of, and experiments with, frog muscle preparations {{played a key role in}} the development of <b>our</b> <b>current</b> understanding of nerve–muscle function. The experiments introduced a new method of studying nerves, the frog nerve-muscle preparation, which was still used centuries later.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, Bernard Katz and Paul Fatt {{observed}} spontaneous miniature synaptic currents at {{the frog}} neuromuscular junction. Based on these observations, they developed the 'quantal hypothesis' {{that is the}} basis for <b>our</b> <b>current</b> understanding of neurotransmitter release as exocytosis and for which they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970. In the late 1960s, Ricardo Miledi and Katz advanced the hypothesis that depolarization-induced influx of calcium ions triggers exocytosis.|$|E

25|$|Most Mesoamerican beliefs {{included}} {{cycles of}} suns.

25|$|Most of <b>our</b> <b>current</b> {{knowledge}} was gained during the 20th century. With {{the help of}} the use of photography, fainter objects were observed. Our sun was found {{to be part of a}} galaxy made up of more than 1010 stars (10 billion stars). The existence of other galaxies, one of the matters of the great debate, was settled by Edwin Hubble, who identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy, and many others at large distances and receding, moving away from our galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Hydro-electric, {{wind and}} solar power all derive their energy from the Sun. The Sun emits more energy in one second (3.827 × 1026 J) than is {{available}} {{in all of the}} fossil fuels present on earth (3.9 × 1022 J), and therefore has the potential to provide all of <b>our</b> <b>current</b> and future global energy requirements.

It was the taxonomical classification of Carl Linnaeus in the eighteenth century though, that generated a firm base for the knowledge to stand on and expand. The introduction of the concept of Darwinism in contemporary scientific discourse also had had an effect on the thinking on plant forms and their evolution.|$|E
