We compared three data sets of the same sample size obtained by three standard sampling methods: preferential, random, and systematic. These different <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> were applied to a study area comprising of 36 ha of intermittently wet Molinia meadows.

The effect of each <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> on the patterns of species composition and species–environment relationships was explored by redundancy analysis and the significance of effects was tested by the randomization test. Preferential sampling revealed different patterns of species composition than random and systematic <b>sampling</b> <b>methods.</b> Random and systematic <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> have resulted in broader vegetation variability than with preferential <b>sampling</b> <b>method.</b> Preferential <b>sampling</b> revealed different relationship between soil parameters and species composition in contrast to random and systematic <b>sampling</b> <b>methods.</b> Although we have not found significant differences in vegetation–environment relationships between random and systematic <b>sampling</b> <b>methods,</b> random <b>sampling</b> revealed a more robust correlation of species data to soil factors than preferential and systematic <b>sampling</b> <b>methods.</b> Intentional restriction of vegetation variation sampled preferentially may be detrimental to statistical inference in studies of species composition patterns and vegetation–environment relationships...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – Matching the adjusted average time to signal (AATS) of <b>sampling</b> <b>methods,</b> using as a reference the AATS of one of them the paper obtains the design parameters of the others. Thus, it will be possible to obtain, in control, the average number of samples required, so that the AATS of the mentioned <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> may be equal to the AATS of the method that the paper uses as the reference. Findings – A more robust performance measure to compare <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> because in many cases the period of time where the process is in control is greater than the out of control period. With this performance measure the paper compares different <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> through the average total cost per cycle, in systems with Weibull lifetime distributions: three systems with an increasing hazard rate (shape parameter b= 2, 4 and 7) and one system with a decreasing failure rate (b= 0, 8).
