40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{is closely related}} to intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) accumulation, and both are associated with increasing age. It remains to be determined to what extent perturbations in IMCL metabolism are related to the aging process per se. On two separate occasions, whole-body and muscle insulin sensitivity (euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp with 2 -deoxyglucose) and fat utilization during 1 h of exercise at 50 % VO 2 max ([U- 13 C]palmitate infusion combined with electron microscopy of IMCL) were determined in young lean (YL), old lean (OL), and old overweight (OO) males. <b>OL</b> <b>displayed</b> IMCL content and insulin sensitivity comparable with those in YL, whereas OO were markedly insulin resistant and had more than twofold greater IMCL in the subsarcolemmal (SSL) region. Indeed, whereas the plasma free fatty acid Ra and Rd were twice those of YL in both OL and OO, SSL area only increased during exercise in OO. Thus, skeletal muscle insulin resistance and lipid accumulation often observed in older individuals are likely due to lifestyle factors rather than inherent aging of skeletal muscle as usually reported. However, age per se appears to cause exacerbated adipose tissue lipolysis, suggesting that strategies to reduce muscle lipid delivery and improve adipose tissue function may be warranted in older overweight individuals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background CNS myelination {{disturbances}} commonly {{occur in}} chronic white matter lesions in neurodevelopmental and adult neurological disorders. Recent studies support that myelination failure can involve a disrupted cellular repair mechanism where oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate in lesions with diffuse astrogliosis, but fail to fully differentiate to mature myelinating OLs. There are no in vitro models that reproduce these features of myelination failure. Results Forebrain coronal slices from postnatal day (P) 0. 5 / 1 rat pups were cultured for 1, 5, or 9 days in vitro (DIV). Slices rapidly exhibited diffuse astrogliosis and accumulation of the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA), an inhibitor of OPC differentiation and re-myelination. At 1 DIV ~ 1. 5 % of Olig 2 + <b>OLs</b> <b>displayed</b> caspase- 3 activation, which increased to ~ 11. 5 % by 9 DIV. At 1 DIV {{the density of}} PDGFRα + and PDGFRα + /Ki 67 + OPCs were significantly elevated compared to 0 DIV (P P + OLs at 9 DIV compared to controls (217 ± 16 vs. 328 ± 17 cells/mm 2, respectively; P = 0. 0003), supporting an inhibitory role of HA in OL lineage progression in chronic lesions. Conclusions Diffuse white matter astrogliosis and early OPC proliferation with impaired OL maturation were reproduced in this model of myelination failure. This system {{may be used to}} define mechanisms of OPC maturation arrest and myelination failure related to astrogliosis and HA accumulation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a severe}} mental {{disorder}} affecting about 1 % {{of the population}} worldwide. Although the dopamine (DA) hypothesis is still keeping a dominant position in schizophrenia research, new advances have been emerging in recent years, which suggest the implication of white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia. In this paper, we will briefly review some of recent human studies showing white matter abnormalities in schizophrenic brains and altered oligodendrocyte-(OL-) and myelin-related genes in patients with schizophrenia and will consider abnormal behaviors reported in patients with white matter diseases. Following these, we will selectively introduce some animal models examining a putative role of white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia. The emphasis will {{be put on the}} cuprizone (CPZ) model. CPZ-fed mice show demyelination and <b>OLs</b> loss, <b>display</b> schizophrenia-related behaviors, and have higher DA levels in the prefrontal cortex. These features suggest that the CPZ model is a novel animal model of schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Oligodendrocyte (OL) {{differentiation}} and myelin {{development are}} complex events regulated by numerous signal transduction factors. Here, {{we report that}} phosphoinositide- 3 kinase enhancer L (PIKE-L) is required for OL development and myelination. PIKE-L expression is up-regulated when oligodendrocyte progenitor cells commit to differentiation. Conversely, depleting phosphoinositide- 3 kinase enhancer (PIKE) expression by shRNA prevents oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation. In both conventional PIKE knockout (PIKE-/-) and OL-specific PIKE knockout mice, the number of OLs is reduced in the corpus callosum. PIKE-/- <b>OLs</b> also <b>display</b> defects when forming myelin sheath on neuronal axons during neonatal development, which is partially rescued when PTEN is ablated. In addition, Akt/mTOR signaling is impaired in OL-enriched tissues of the PIKE-/- mutant, leading to reduced expression of critical proteins for myelin development and hypomyelination. Moreover, myelin repair of lysolecithin-induced lesions is delayed in PIKE-/- brain. Thus, PIKE plays pivotal roles to advance OL development and myelinogenesis through Akt/mTOR activation.

30|$|The {{long-term}} behaviour {{of stone}} structures {{depends on the}} durability of the stone materials (Macmillan 1967; Kieslinger 1968; Richardson 1991; Ordóñez et al. 1997; Vázquez et al. 2016; Přikryl et al. 2016; Přikryl 2017), vegetation cover (Coombes et al. 2018) and the environmental conditions (Amoroso and Fassina 1983; Siegesmund et al. 2007). When the various lithotypes of the studied Ruin Garden were compared it seemed that oolitic limestone (OL), which {{was the most common}} one, was less durable than other lithologies found at the site. Based on the in situ observation, <b>OL</b> <b>displayed</b> various forms of decay such as cracks, crumbling, granular disintegration, multiple scaling and flaking, black and white crust and biological colonisation (wall 1 (Fig.  5), walls 2 – 5). The bioclastic limestone also showed several decay forms, such as micro-cracks, crumbling, rounded surface, black crust and, in the case of blocks totally exposed to the exterior environment (wall 2), biological colonisation was also observed. The same forms of biological colonisation were observed on the blocks of travertine, which were exposed to the outdoor environmental conditions, in addition to cracks and micro-karstification (wall 4). Biological colonisation was not restricted to outdoor environments. At the covered parts of the ruin, green patches of microbial mats were observed (wall 1 (Fig.  5), walls 3 – 4). This was especially intense at low-lying blocks and in the joints, suggesting that capillary water rise of groundwater provided moisture for biological activity. A clear dependence on the substrate was also noticed, since porous stone types, such as OL, were preferentially covered, while lower porosity stones, such as travertine (T) or rhyolite (Rh), showed far less intense biological colonisation (walls 3 – 4). Among the different types of limestones, the red limestone appeared to be the most durable one, since only minor alterations were observed, such as decolourization of the surface (wall 3). Stylolitic planes were also observed in the red limestone and, as was shown previously (Aly et al. 2018), these clay-containing zones were prone to weathering. In some cases, cracks and multiple flaking developed even on blocks of relatively durable stone types, such as granitic blocks in the uncovered parts of the monument, which were exposed to the environmental conditions (wall 2).|$|R
25|$|In May 2008, Samsung {{unveiled}} an ultra-thin 12.1inch (30cm) laptop <b>OLED</b> <b>display</b> concept, with a 1,280×768 resolution with infinite contrast ratio.

2500|$|There are {{two main}} {{families}} of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. [...] Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) which has a slightly different mode of operation. An <b>OLED</b> <b>display</b> can be driven with a passive-matrix (PMOLED) or active-matrix (AMOLED) control scheme. In the PMOLED scheme, each row (and line) in the display is controlled sequentially, one by one, whereas AMOLED control uses a thin-film transistor backplane to directly access and switch each individual pixel on or off, allowing for higher resolution and larger display sizes.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, Samsung showcased the world's {{thinnest}} <b>OLED</b> <b>display,</b> {{also the}} first to be [...] "flappable" [...] and bendable. It measures just 0.05mm (thinner than paper), yet a Samsung staff member said that it is [...] "technically possible to make the panel thinner". To achieve this thickness, Samsung etched an OLED panel that uses a normal glass substrate. The drive circuit was formed by low-temperature polysilicon TFTs. Also, low-molecular organic EL materials were employed. The pixel count of the display is 480 × 272. The contrast ratio is 100,000:1, and the luminance is 200cd/m2. The colour reproduction range is 100% of the NTSC standard.|$|E

The new Clip Zip will be sold alongside the Clip+. Internally the Clip Zip is similar to the Clip+ (apart from the Zip having a color screen), and so retains its high quality DAC and amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|Bottom or top emission: Bottom or top {{distinction}} refers not to {{orientation of}} the <b>OLED</b> <b>display,</b> but to the direction that emitted light exits the device. [...] OLED devices are classified as bottom emission devices if light emitted passes through the transparent or semi-transparent bottom electrode and substrate on which the panel was manufactured. [...] Top emission devices are classified based {{on whether or not}} the light emitted from the OLED device exits through the lid that is added following fabrication of the device. [...] Top-emitting OLEDs are better suited for active-matrix applications as they can be more easily integrated with a non-transparent transistor backplane. [...] The TFT array attached to the bottom substrate on which AMOLEDs are manufactured are typically non-transparent, resulting in considerable blockage of transmitted light if the device followed a bottom emitting scheme.|$|E
