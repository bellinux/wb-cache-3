By the decree of January 1780 she established a town Sofia nearby with a separate administration. Further construction works without imperial orders were banned in Tsarskoye Selo and most merchants and clergy were moved to Sofia. The town was divided into rectangular districts with a vast <b>open</b> <b>place</b> in the center. A wooden church of Saints Constantine and Helen and then the stone Sophia Cathedral (1788) were raised in the town center. According to Johann Gottlieb Georgi, in 1794, Sofia was mostly populated by the palace workers and peasants. It had a number of stone buildings, a church resembling Hagia Sophia of Constantinople, and a factory in the suburbs producing paper for state bank notes. The town prospered owing to the proximity of St. Petersburg and imperial attention.|$|E

2500|$|Chomsky had befriended two {{linguists}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson, {{the latter}} of whom secured him an assistant professor position at MIT in 1955. There Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project, {{and the other half}} teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy. He later described MIT as [...] "a pretty free and <b>open</b> <b>place,</b> open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work." [...] In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor. That same year, Chomsky's first child, a daughter named Aviva, was born, and he published his first book on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris–Bloomfield trend in the field. The response to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused [...] "significant upheaval" [...] in the discipline. Linguist John Lyons later asserted that it [...] "revolutionized the scientific study of language". From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E

"Tonight in the threshingfloor": which afforded a fit {{opportunity}} of meeting with him, being at night, {{and out of}} the city, from his own house, and alone, and after a feast for his reapers and threshers of corn, seems, from Ruth 2:7 It was usual to have threshingfloors in an <b>open</b> <b>place</b> without the city, so to winnow at them, whereby the chaff was more easily separated from the corn, and that, in the evening, when in those countries there were the strongest breezes of wind to carry it off; hence the Targum here has it, [...] "behold, he is winnowing the barley floor with the wind, which is in the night." [...] For before the invention and use of fans in winnowing, it was only done by the wind carrying off the chaff, as the oxen trod the corn, for it was done in the threshingfloor, as here: hence Hesiod advises that the threshingfloors should be, [...] "in a place exposed to wind"; and so Varro observes, the floor should be in the higher part of the field, that the wind might blow through it; to this manner of winnowing Virgil has respect. Nor was it unusual for great personages, owners of farms and fields, to attend and overlook such service.

40|$|Capsule Nightjars prefer <b>open</b> <b>places</b> {{in younger}} forest areas, and open stands with wide forest tracks in older forest areas. Aims European Nightjars are a Species of European Conservation Concern (historical declines in both {{population}} and range). The reduction of heathland habitats means that forested areas are {{an increasingly important}} habitat for Nightjars. However, the ecology of Nightjars in forested areas is poorly understood. We set out to investigate Nightjar habitat preferences in a 5000 -ha forest landscape in northern Belgium. Methods Calling ‘churring’ males were counted in each year over ten years. Habitat descriptors were derived from detailed habitat mapping based on aerial photographs and extensive field surveys. The different habitat descriptors were compared between patches occupied by Nightjars and control patches (patches selected at random in the study area). Results As expected, Nightjars showed a preference for <b>open</b> <b>places</b> in younger forest areas (clearfelled areas, young stands, windfall and permanent <b>open</b> <b>places).</b> They also showed a preference for old and open stands that had wide forest tracks. Forest type appeared not to be significant. Heath, bare sand and, to a lesser extent, leaf litter have an increased presence in patches used by Nightjars. Conclusion For the conservation of Nightjars, we suggest that <b>open</b> <b>places</b> within larger forests should be created. Also a network of wide forest tracks can make smaller patches suitable for Nightjars. Patches of bare sand should be created or maintained...|$|R
