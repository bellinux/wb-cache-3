40|$|Abstract—A Bond Graph {{model of}} a hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (HEV) powertrain test cell is proposed. The test cell consists of a motor/generator coupled to a HEV powertrain and powered by a bidirectional power converter. Programmable loading conditions, including positive and negative resistive and inertial loads of any magnitude are modeled, avoiding the use of mechanical inertial loads involved in conventional test cells. The dynamics and control equations of the test cell are derived directly from the Bond Graph models. The modeling and simulation results {{of the dynamics of}} the test cell are validated through experiments carried out on a scaled-down system. Index Terms—Bond Graphs, hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), mechatronics, modeling, powertrain test cell, <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> control, <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> electric propulsion, <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> electronics, <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> testing, simulation.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a real-life vehicle {{delivery}} routing problem, which is a seafood product delivery routing problem. Considering {{the features of the}} seafood product delivery routing problem, this paper formulated this problem as a multi-depot <b>open</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem. Since the multi-depot <b>open</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem is a very complex problem, a method is used to reduce the complexity of the problem by changing the multi-depot <b>open</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem into an <b>open</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem with a dummy central depot in this paper. Then, ant colony optimization is used to solve the problem. To improve the performance of the algorithm, crossover operation and some adaptive strategies are used. Finally, the computational results for the benchmark problems of the multi-depot vehicle routing problem indicate that the proposed ant colony optimization is an effective method to solve the multi-depot vehicle routing problem. Furthermore, the computation results of the seafood product delivery problem from Dalian, China also suggest that the proposed ant colony optimization is feasible to solve the seafood product delivery routing problem...|$|R

40|$|<b>Vehicle</b> {{dynamics}} and <b>road</b> dynamics are usually {{considered to be}} two largely independent subjects. In <b>vehicle</b> dynamics, <b>road</b> surface roughness is generally regarded as random excitation of the <b>vehicle,</b> while in <b>road</b> dynamics, the <b>vehicle</b> is generally regarded as a moving load acting on the pavement. This book suggests a new research concept to integrate the <b>vehicle</b> and the <b>road</b> system {{with the help of}} a tire model, and establishes a cross-subject research framework dubbed vehicle-pavement coupled system dynamics. In this context, the dynamics of the <b>vehicle,</b> <b>road</b> and the vehicle-road coupled system are investigated by means of theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and field tests. This book will be a valuable resource for university professors, graduate students and engineers majoring in automotive design, mechanical engineering, highway engineering and other related areas.

40|$|The authors {{extend their}} earlier {{empirical}} work by exploring alternative specifications {{for the relationship}} between <b>vehicle</b> ownership, <b>road</b> length, and the ratio of <b>vehicles</b> to <b>road</b> length, on the one hand, and income, population, pollution density, and other variables on the other. For the constancy or variability of cross-section income elasticities for each of these variables, they find that: a) the income elasticity of vehicle ownership decreases slightly with income at the national level but is constant at the urban level; b) the income elasticity of road length is constant at the national level but increases with income at the urban level; and c) the income elasticity of the <b>vehicle</b> to <b>road</b> ration decreases with income at both the national and urban level and, at high income levels, becomes negative for urban roads and for national paved roads. Comparisons of income elasticities from cross-section and time series data indicated that they are generally similar for <b>vehicles,</b> <b>road</b> length, and the <b>vehicle</b> to <b>road</b> ration at the national level. But at the urban level the time series income elasticity of road length (0. 1) is much smaller than the cross-section elasticity (0. 7), and the time series income elasticity of the <b>vehicle</b> to <b>road</b> ration (0. 9) is much larger than the cross-section elasticities (0. 1 for low income cities and - 0. 5 or high income cities). This means that the <b>vehicle</b> to <b>road</b> ratio (a proxy for congestion) is increasing over time in cities, almost in step with per capita income - a trend with dire consequences for urban transport. Although the urban results are somewhat alarming, the national results indicate that the <b>vehicle</b> to <b>road</b> ration nationally (especially on paved roads) is relatively low and not rising rapidly. It also shows remarkable stability across country income levels. This contrast between the national and urban results reinforces the view that urban decentralization is likely to remain the major mode of adjustment to urban congestion.
