5|$|In {{order to}} secure a nomination, a number of non-party {{politicians}} sought the support of either 20 members of the <b>Oireachtas</b> or four city or county councils.|$|E
5|$|The {{coalition}} Government {{which took}} office in March 2011 convened a Constitutional Convention to discuss proposed amendments to the Constitution of Ireland, including plans to introduce same-sex marriage. On 10 July 2012, the Dáil, referred {{the issue of whether}} to make provision for same-sex marriage to the Constitutional Convention, to report back in a year. On 14 April 2013, the convention approved provisions allowing for same-sex marriage, to be discussed by the <b>Oireachtas</b> and be put to a public referendum. On 2 July 2013, the Constitutional Convention delivered the formal report to the <b>Oireachtas,</b> which had four months to respond.|$|E
5|$|Dana Rosemary Scallon {{announced}} on 19 September {{that she would}} be seeking a presidential nomination. She initially attempted to gain the signatures of 20 <b>Oireachtas</b> members. However, by 21 September, she only secured the support of one TD. She instead began the process of seeking support from county and city councils.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the abdication, the <b>Oireachtas,</b> the {{parliament}} of the Irish Free State, removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and {{to be involved in the}} making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was widely seen as a challenge to the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's <b>Oireachtas</b> members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} {{election}} in February 2011, and {{the election of the}} members of the 24th Seanad, only three political parties had the minimum 20 members of <b>Oireachtas</b> to nominate a candidate: Fine Gael (76 TDs and 19 senators), the Labour Party (37 TDs and 13 senators) and Fianna Fáil (19 TDs and 14 senators). Sinn Féin, the next largest party in the Dáil Éireann, have 14 TDs and 3 senators. For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (of which there are currently 14 TDs and 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September it was {{revealed}} that the party would seek to have Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, nominated to contest the election. With 14 TDs and three Senators, Sinn Féin were three short of the required twenty <b>Oireachtas</b> members to nominate a candidate for the presidency. Soon after the nomination was announced, four Independent TDs agreed to nominate McGuinness, securing his nomination: Michael Healy-Rae and Tom Fleming (both representing Kerry South), Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (Roscommon–South Leitrim) and Finian McGrath (Dublin North-Central). Both 'Ming' Flanagan and McGrath had previously pledged their support to Norris.|$|E
5|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} has been legal in Ireland since 16 November 2015. A referendum on 22 May 2015 amended the Constitution of Ireland {{to provide that}} marriage is recognised irrespective of {{the sex of the}} partners. The measure was signed into law by the President of Ireland as the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 August 2015. The Marriage Act 2015, passed by the <b>Oireachtas</b> on 22 October 2015 and signed into law by the Presidential Commission on 29 October 2015, gave legislative effect to the amendment. Marriages of same-sex couples in Ireland began being recognised from 16 November 2015 and the first marriage ceremonies of same-sex couples in Ireland occurred on 17 November 2015.|$|E
5|$|The all-party <b>Oireachtas</b> Committee on the Constitution, re-established in December 2002, was {{conducting}} {{a review of}} the entire Constitution. In October 2004, it invited submissions on the Articles related to the family. Chairman Denis O'Donovan stated that it was examining these Articles to ascertain {{the extent to which they}} are serving the good of individuals and the community, with a view to deciding whether changes in them would bring about a greater balance between the two. Among the many issues raised by the committee were the definition of the family and the rights of same-sex couples to marry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oireachtas</b> Rince na Cruinne is {{organised}} and {{overseen by}} An Coimisiún's Coiste Oireachtaisí (<b>Oireachtas</b> Committee), {{which is also}} responsible for the annual All-Ireland Championships. The committee's budget is set by Comhairle Bainistaíochta (the Council of Management). Detailed planning for each edition of <b>Oireachtas</b> Rince na Cruinne commences approximately two years in advance.|$|E
25|$|The Broadcasting Act 2009 {{provided}} {{provision for}} {{the launch of}} two additional public services. These include an <b>Oireachtas</b> Channel and an Irish Film Channel. The <b>Oireachtas</b> TV service currently broadcasts on Saorview channel 22. The Irish Film Board will oversee operation for the Irish Film Channel.|$|E

25|$|Adjudicators for <b>Oireachtas</b> Rince na Cruinne are {{selected}} from An Coimisiún's registered adjudicators, who may apply to adjudicate {{if they have}} at least two years' experience judging major competitions. Adjudicators may not judge at <b>Oireachtas</b> Rince na Cruinne more than once in a five-year period. The final selection of adjudicators takes into account experience, reputation and knowledge of competitive Irish stepdancing.|$|E
25|$|In Maguire v. Ardagh (2002), the Supreme Court {{held that}} <b>Oireachtas</b> Inquiries {{did not have}} the power to compel {{witnesses}} to attend and to make findings against them. The Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2011 proposed to allow <b>Oireachtas</b> Inquiries to make findings of fact and to balance the rights of the individual against the public interest; this referendum was defeated by 53% to 47%.|$|E
25|$|Locations for <b>Oireachtas</b> Rince na Cruinne are {{selected}} following a bidding process, which allows regional representatives {{to submit their}} preferred venue for consideration. Bidding is led by both local An Coimisiún teachers and business representatives. The final decision is made {{by a vote of}} the <b>Oireachtas</b> Committee, taking into account the suitability of venue and the area's capacity to support the event with appropriate accommodation.|$|E
25|$|Prohibition of {{ex post facto}} laws: The <b>Oireachtas</b> may not enact ex post facto {{criminal}} laws (Article 15.5.1°).|$|E

25|$|There {{are nine}} championships for ceili dance at <b>Oireachtas</b> Rince na Cruinne: five age groups for girls' teams, and four for mixed gender teams. The ceili dances {{performed}} at the Worlds are those which have been accepted by An Coimisiún {{as part of the}} stepdance tradition and which are found in the official publication of dances, Ar Rince Ceili. Presently, the only ceili dances accepted at <b>Oireachtas</b> Rince na Cruinne are eight-hand dances, that is, for eight dancers.|$|E
25|$|As a {{transitional}} measure, {{for the first}} three years after the election of the first President of Ireland a bill to amend the Constitution could be passed by the <b>Oireachtas</b> as an ordinary act. An amendment bill before the election of the first President (on 25 June 1938) would have required a referendum. To prevent the <b>Oireachtas</b> abusing this provision, the President had the power to refer such a bill to the people. The First and Second Amendments were adopted in this way; President Douglas Hyde chose to sign each into law without referendum. The three-year limit was entrenched to prevent it being extended without referendum. Since 25 June 1941, the third anniversary of President Hyde's election, every amendment has had to follow the pattern of passage through the <b>Oireachtas</b> followed by a referendum.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution {{establishes}} a government under a parliamentary system. It {{provides for a}} directly elected, largely ceremonial President of Ireland (Article 12), a head of government called the Taoiseach (Article 28), and a national parliament called the <b>Oireachtas</b> (Article 15). The <b>Oireachtas</b> has a dominant directly elected lower house known as Dáil Éireann (Article 16) and an upper house Seanad Éireann (Article 18), which is partly appointed, partly indirectly elected and partly elected by a limited electorate. There is also an independent judiciary headed by the Supreme Court (Article 34).|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of the Barron Report, an <b>Oireachtas</b> Sub-Committee was {{established}} to consider the Report and make recommendations. These recommendations were published in March 2004 as a 'Final Report'.|$|E

25|$|In May 1992, the Democratic Left T.D. Proinsias De Rossa subverted this ban {{by reading}} the {{offending}} telephone numbers into the Dáil record, using his absolute privilege {{as a member of}} the <b>Oireachtas</b> to avoid a lawsuit.|$|E

25|$|Hyde had no {{association}} with Sinn Féin and the Independence movement. He {{was elected to}} Seanad Éireann, the upper house of the Irish Free State's <b>Oireachtas,</b> at a by-election on 4 February 1925, replacing Sir Hutcheson Poë.|$|E
