5|$|The {{side effects}} of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of {{substance}} consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E
5|$|If {{the pain}} is still not managed adequately, short term use of opioids such as {{morphine}} may be useful. These medications carry a risk of addiction, may have negative interactions with other drugs, and have a greater risk <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> including dizziness, nausea, and constipation. The effect of long term use is unknown. Specialist groups advise against general long-term use of opioids for chronic low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier. Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E

5|$|The {{side effects}} of {{amphetamine}} are varied, {{and the amount of}} amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the effect of}} providing different formats about <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> information (verbal versus numerical) to acne patients in Saudi Arabia that are newly prescribed Roaccutane. DesignA prospective study assessing patients’ degree <b>of</b> estimation about <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> information. ParticipantsOne hundred and forty-one acne patients newly prescribed Roaccutane. SettingsFour dermatology clinics in Riyadh. Two in tertiary hospitals and the other two in private clinics. InterventionEach patient received information about two different <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> for Roaccutane. The <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> provided was supplemented with the probability of occurrence, which was written either in words or in numbers. (Dry eye “very common” or “ 30 %”; Loss of hair “rare” or “ 0. 01 %”). Main outcome measuresPatient’s estimation <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> occurrence. Other outcomes were the likelihood <b>of</b> experiencing the <b>side</b> <b>effect,</b> the severity <b>of</b> the <b>side</b> <b>effect,</b> their perception <b>of</b> risk <b>of</b> the <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> to their general health, their satisfaction with the information provided and, whether the information provided will influence their decision to take the medicine. ResultThe mean estimate for <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> occurrence for the dry eyes was 46 % in the verbal group and 41 % in the numerical group (p= 0. 5); for loss of hair it was 50 % in the verbal group and 39 % in the numerical group (p= 0. 03). There are no significant differences between verbal and numerical groups regarding the remaining measures. ConclusionPatients overestimate the probability <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> Verbal format <b>of</b> probability of occurrence is associated with higher estimation than the numerical format...|$|R

5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> and potential for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants {{and these are}} enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk <b>of</b> <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E
50|$|A highly {{relevant}} {{example of}} the description-experience gap has been illustrated: the difference in opinions on vaccination between doctors and patients. Patients who learn about vaccination are usually exposed to only information regarding the probabilities <b>of</b> the <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the vaccines so {{they are likely to}} overweight the likelihood <b>of</b> these <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Although doctors learn about the same probabilities and descriptions <b>of</b> the <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> their perspective is also shaped by experience: doctors have the direct experience of vaccinating patients and {{they are more likely to}} recognize the unlikelihood <b>of</b> the <b>side</b> <b>effects.</b> Due to the different ways in which doctors and patients learn about the <b>side</b> <b>effects,</b> there is potential disagreement on the necessity and safety of vaccination.|$|R

30|$|The {{research}} work {{to predict the}} <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> drugs {{is done by the}} relationship between chemical and target protein. Yamanishi et al. [7] proposed a kernel regression model as computational model. This method predicted a potential <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> profiles based on the chemical structures and the information on the target protein. This method ranked first one <b>of</b> the <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> 41.7 % (275 drugs) in 658 drugs, and ranked a correct <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> among the top five scoring for 70.0 % (461 drugs) in 658 drugs. Kuhn et al. [8] focused on similarities in the <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> drugs. The clinical data on chemical and protein were collected. And by combining drug-target protein and drug-side effect relations, overrepresented target protein-side effect pars are identified. 732 <b>of</b> 1428 <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> were predicted to be mainly caused by individual proteins. 137 <b>of</b> 732 <b>side</b> <b>effects</b> were proved by pharmacological or phenotypic existing data. From the results of these studies, classification and regression characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> are found. However, these studies will fall into a lack of an overall service-based solution because all data for the <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> prediction are not always prepared. Although the above-mentioned 2 studies focused on potential <b>side</b> <b>effect,</b> we focus not only on <b>side</b> <b>effect,</b> but also on its incidence. Therefore, we propose the comprehensive prediction model <b>of</b> drug <b>side</b> <b>effect</b> and its incidence using the data mining approach at the intersection of statics, machine learning and database system considering classification and regression characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>side</b> <b>effect.</b> And the gene information of target protein and the chemical (drug) - protein interaction are considered in this paper.|$|R
