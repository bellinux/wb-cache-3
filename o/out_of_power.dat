5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E

But the prominent officers know, as well as the party officials, that a lost war will sweep them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Therefore, the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end. The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party had been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming {{directly involved in the}} patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
5|$|NigComSat-1, a Nigerian {{satellite}} {{built in}} 2004, was Nigeria's third satellite and Africa's first communication satellite. It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese Long March 3B carrier rocket, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> {{because of an}} anomaly in its solar array. It {{was based on the}} Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: 4 C-band; 14 Ku-band; 8 Ka-band; and 2 L-band. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.|$|E
5|$|A French-aligned Haitian general, André Rigaud, had {{instructed}} his forces to attack all foreign shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once Experiment and her convoy of merchant ships neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing {{two of the}} American merchant ships before withdrawing. Experiment managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. On the American side, only {{the captain of the}} schooner Mary was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> by the forces of Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the 1791 Haitian Revolution, did the picaroon attacks cease.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> None had come close to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)).|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even {{if he or she is}} not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by the Speaker of the House. When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{neoconservative}} {{aspirations to}} use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end in massive bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E

5|$|On the October 27 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H would offer John Cena {{a chance to}} join forces with The Authority, which Cena refused. This led to Triple H announcing a five-on-five tag team {{elimination}} match for Survivor Series, with a team representing The Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Mr. McMahon announced that if Team Authority would lose, they would be removed from power. On the November 21 episode of SmackDown, Triple H announced that if Team Cena lost, all of Team Cena, except Cena himself, would be fired. At Survivor Series, Big Show joined The Authority by betraying Cena, but Sting made his WWE debut, attacking crooked referee Scott Armstrong and Triple H, and assisted Dolph Ziggler in pinning Rollins to give Team Cena the victory, putting the Authority <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|Quisling now {{reached the}} high-water mark of his {{political}} power. On 10 April, Bräuer travelled to Elverum where the legitimate Nygaardsvold government now sat. On Hitler's orders, he demanded that King Haakon appoint Quisling head of a new government, thereby securing a peaceful transition of power. Haakon rejected this demand. He went further {{in a meeting with}} his cabinet, letting it be known that he would sooner abdicate than appoint any government headed by Quisling. Hearing this, the government unanimously voted to support the king's stance, and urged the people to continue their resistance. With his popular support gone, Quisling ceased to be of use to Hitler. Germany retracted its support for his rival government, preferring instead to build up its own independent governing commission. In this way, Quisling was manoeuvred <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> by Bräuer and a coalition of his former allies, including Hjort, who now saw him as a liability. Even his political allies, including Prytz, deserted him.|$|E
5|$|The Jana Sangh's {{first major}} campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on {{a demand for}} the {{complete}} integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India. Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He {{died of a heart}} attack the following month, while still in jail. Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism, which formed the official doctrine of the party. Younger leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The major themes on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a uniform civil code, banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir.|$|E

5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's {{hands and}} {{appointed}} him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, {{to the office}} of Chief Justiciar, at that time not strictly a judicial office. Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king was outside the kingdom, able to act in the king's name. Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500marks (£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.|$|E
5|$|In the Republic of India's {{first three}} general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962, the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own {{unexpected}} death in 1966, by Indira Gandhi, {{who went on}} to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> in 1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government lasted just over three years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two years. Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.|$|E
