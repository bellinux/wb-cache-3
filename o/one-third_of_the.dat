40|$|Gephyrin is a {{multifunctional}} protein {{responsible for}} <b>the</b> clustering <b>of</b> glycine receptors (GlyR) and -aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAAR). GlyR and GABAAR are heteropentameric chloride ion channels that facilitate fast-response, inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain and spinal cord. We investigated <b>the</b> immunohistochemical distribution <b>of</b> gephyrin and <b>the</b> major GABAAR and GlyR subunits {{in the human}} light microscopically in the rostral and caudal <b>one-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pons, {{in the middle and}} caudal <b>one-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medulla oblongata, and in the first cervical segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord. The results demonstrate a widespread pattern of immunoreactivity for GlyR and GABAAR subunits throughout these regions, including the spinal trigeminal nucleus, abducens nucleus, facial nucleus, pontine reticular formation, dorsal motor nucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vagus nerve, hypoglossal nucleus, lateral cuneate nucleus, and nucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solitary tract. The GABAAR 1 and GlyR 1 and β subunits show high levels of immunoreactivity in these nuclei. The GABAAR subunits 2, 3, β 2, 3, and 2 present weaker levels of immunoreactivity. Exceptions are intense levels of GABAAR 2 subunit immunoreactivity in the inferior olivary complex and high levels of GABAAR 3 subunit immunoreactivity in the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei. Gephyrin immunoreactivity is highest in <b>the</b> first segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervical spinal cord and hypoglossal nucleus. Our results suggest that a variety of different inhibitory receptor subtypes is responsible for inhibitory functions in the human brainstem and cervical spinal cord and that gephyrin functions as a clustering molecule for major subtypes of these inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors...|$|R
