Around the same time, Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers; the Dev Phone 1 was a SIM- and hardware-unlocked version of the HTC Dream that came pre-configured for superuser access to the internal files <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> allowing users to completely replace the bootloader and operating system.|$|E

The trio also sent text messages to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised that the owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday, February 7, Murray's father Fred {{arrived in}} Amherst. He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety field tests being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone. The participants and content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> call are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> there were concerns that this could result in a loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments. The camera also includes optical image stabilization, and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 image processor.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{used those}} days {{to design the}} {{structure}} of the game and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, path to achieve the objective, and obstacles. He envisioned a three-dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the movie, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Feeling more adversity was needed, Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> as well as expand the game's world.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{brought forward}} bank statements {{that showed that}} Cisneros withdrew US$5,000 from a US$100,000 family safety deposit box on July 7, 1992 and March 3, 1993, the morning Fischer was killed. The defense stated {{that there was nothing}} illegal about visiting the safety deposit box or making the withdrawal. They stated that the US$5,000 was for a family trip to Mexico. The prosecution suggested that the money was to pay off the murderers, but they were unable to provide evidence linking the two actions. On May 11, the defense introduced two witnesses to rest their case after six days of prosecution arguments. Most of the testimonies from the prosecution that day were done by Garza, who stated that Martínez never mentioned Cisneros's name as the person of who she was working with to have Fischer killed. Garza stated that he consulted Martínez on his marriage, but that she would interrupt to ask him if he had found anyone who was willing to carry out her client's request and hurt Fischer. Garza claimed that he had at least four calls from phone booths in San Fernando and Matamoros, two Mexican cities. The defense stated that Garza told the FBI that he made collect calls, but Garza said they were mistaken. He said that making collect calls from Mexico was difficult, though he did not discard the possibility of having made one to Martínez. The prosecution did not enter evidence showing that Garza made calls from Mexico to the U.S., and one of the defense witness showed that Martínez's phone bill did not have any collect calls from Matamoros. The defense stated that Garza made the claim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> calls from Mexico to get a reduced sentence, while Garza responded that he was testifying to make sure everyone involved in the murder gets punished. The defense responded by showing the jury letters from Garza's jail stating {{that he was willing to}} cooperate with the FBI in the trial for a reduced sentence. Garza responded by saying that those letters were written by one of his English-literate inmates on his behalf. The other defense witness was a restaurateur who saw Cisneros a few hours after the murder and recalled seeing her behaving normally.|$|E

25|$|On the CDMA version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> {{there are}} four slits in the metal band. Two at the top (on the left and right) and two at the bottom.

The top portion of the band (divided by the top left and right slits) is for connecting to the CDMA network. The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS just like the GSM version. The right side is not an antenna, but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b>|$|E

25|$|On February 9, 2016, the FBI {{announced}} that it was unable to unlock one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phones</b> they had recovered because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> advanced security features. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> was an iPhone 5C owned by the county and issued to its employee, the shooter Farook. The FBI first asked the National Security Agency to break into <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> but <b>the</b> NSA was unable to do so. As a result, the FBI asked Apple Inc. to create a new version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> iOS operating system that could be installed and run in <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> random access memory to disable certain security features. Apple declined due to its policy to never undermine <b>the</b> security features <b>of</b> its products. <b>The</b> FBI responded by successfully applying to a United States magistrate judge, Sherri Pym, to issue a court order, mandating Apple to create and provide the requested software. The order was not a subpoena, but rather was issued under the All Writs Act of 1789.|$|R
