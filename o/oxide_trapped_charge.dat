Capacitor data from unbiased irradiations were used to simulate the impact of acceptor neutralization on the current gain of an npn bipolar transistor. Neutralized acceptors near the base surface enhance current gain degradation associated with radiation-induced <b>oxide</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>charge</b> and interface traps by increasing base recombination. The additional recombination results from the convergence of carrier concentrations in the base and increased sensitivity of the base to <b>oxide</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>charge.</b> The enhanced gain degradation is moderated by increased electron injection from the emitter.

40|$|Radiation-induced {{degradation}} of {{many types of}} bipolar transistors and circuits is more severe following low dose rate exposure than following high dose rate exposure. Since microelectronic devices in space are generally subjected to low dose rate irradiation, this complicates the hardness assurance testing of linear circuits {{and can lead to}} an overestimation of device lifetime in space. Previous work examining the physical mechanisms responsible for this dose rate effect has focused primarily on <b>oxide</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>charge.</b> Reduced net positive <b>oxide</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>charge</b> densities at high dose rates and zero bias have been attributed to space charge effects from slowly transporting holes trapped metastably at O vacancy complexes. Decreasing the dose rate or increasing the irradiation temperature leads to an increase in net positive <b>oxide</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>charge</b> near the Si-SiO{sub 2 } interface by reducing these space charge effects. In this work, concentrations of hydrogen transport through two types of bipolar oxides are estimated from dopant passivation measurements in MOS capacitors. For unbiased irradiations, hydrogen passivation of substrate acceptors is greatly reduced at high dose rates compared to that at low dose rates or elevated temperatures. Consistent with other widely accepted models, it is argued that fewer interface traps are formed by high dose rate irradiation under zero bias, because fewer H{sup +} ions can drift to the Si-SiO{sub 2 } interface and react with trap precursors. Similar to hole transport in these oxides, drift of the H{sup +} ions is inhibited at high dose rates by space charge accumulated in the oxide bulk...|$|E

Among these processes, fluorination and nitridation methods have emerged as promising techniques for ultra-large scale integrated circuit (ULSI) technology. Reported data in the literature is presented to show the advantages of these two processes. There are various ways to fabricate fluorinated and oxynitrided SiO 2 films. In this work, fluorination is done by shallow F-ion implantation through polysilicon gate, followed by thermal diffusion into the underlying gate oxide. Oxynitridation is done by a heat treatment in N 2 O gas. The samples are fabricated as lot-splits of the Mitel 1. 5 om process. As background, the mechanisms of generation of <b>oxide</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>charges</b> during hot carrier injection stress are discussed. In this light, the quality of fluorinated and oxynitrided gate-oxides are discussed, in comparison with control oxides. The dissertation also discusses methods used to characterize the electrical properties of oxides. According to the framework of DiMaria et al, gate voltage changes during Fowler-Nordheim stress are sensitive only to <b>trapped</b> <b>charges</b> located outside a tunneling distance from the cathode interface. The dissertation discusses how DiMaria's framework can be applied to obtain information about trapped-charge generated in the bulk <b>oxide</b> and <b>trapped</b> <b>charges</b> generated at or near the SiO 2 interfaces outside or within a tunneling distance from the cathode interface. This technique will be used to do electrical characterization on gate oxides treated by fluorination or oxynitridation.

However, under negative gate bias Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling injection stress, only the lower-temperature oxynitrides show advantages, not the higher-temperature oxynitrides.

40|$|As {{advanced}} Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) technology {{continues to}} minimize the gate oxide thickness, the exponential increase in gate leakage current poses a major challenge for silicon dioxide (SiO 2) based devices. In {{order to reduce the}} gate leakage current while maintaining the same gate capacitance, alternative gate insulator materials with higher dielectric constant (high-k) became the preferred replacement of SiO 2 gate dielectrics. Germanium (Ge) MOSFETs have been regarded as promising candidates for future high-speed applications because they possess higher carrier mobility when compared to silicon based devices. At present, advanced microelectronics devices and circuits are used in aerospace engineering, nuclear industry, and radiotherapy equipment. These applications are unavoidably exposed to space-like radiation, which has a relative low radiation dose rate at 10 - 2 - 10 - 6 rad(Si) /s. For these reasons, it is necessary to understand the low-dose-rate radiation response of high-k materials based on Si and Ge MOS devices. The radiation response of high-k materials such as radiation-induced <b>oxide</b> and interface <b>trap</b> density have been typically examined by carrying out off-site capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements. However, the conventional and off-site radiation response measurements may underestimate the degradation of MOS devices. In this study, a semi-automated laboratory-scale real-time and on-site radiation response testing system was developed to evaluate the radiationresponse. The system is capable of estimating the radiation response of MOS devices whilst the devices are continuously irradiated by -rays raysrays. Moreover, the complete CV characteristics of MOS capacitors were measured in a relatively short time. The pulse CV measurement reduces the impact of <b>charge</b> <b>trapping</b> behavior on the measurement results, when compared to conventional techniques. The total ionizing dose radiation effect on HfO 2 dielectric thin films prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been investigated by the proposed measurement system. The large bidirectional ΔVFB of the irradiated HfO 2 capacitor was mainly attributed to the radiation-induced <b>oxide</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>charges,</b> which were not readily compensated by bias-induced charges produced over the measurement timescales of less than 5 ms. Radiation response of Ge MOS capacitors with HfO 2 and HfxZr 1 -xOy gate dielectrics was also investigated. It was found that radiation-induced interface traps were the dominant factor for Flat-band Voltage shift (ΔVFB) in HfO 2 thin films, whereas the radiation response for Zr-containing dielectrics under positive bias was mainly affected by <b>oxide</b> <b>traps.</b> Under positive biased irradiation, the Zr-doped HfxZr 1 -xOy exhibited smaller ΔVFB than that of HfO 2. This is attributed to the de-passivation of Ge-S bonds in capacitors incorporating HfO 2 thin films, resulting in the build-up of interface traps.
