5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E

30|$|In fact, {{the liberation}} <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> by {{phytoplankton}} {{is not an}} instantaneous phenomenon, since it must be mediated by some time lag which {{is required for the}} maturity of toxic-phytoplankton. However, the liberation <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> at the time t depends on the population size <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> phytoplankton species at time t-τ _ 3.

25|$|Three {{recent studies}} by the Washington Department of Ecology showed that toxic {{chemicals}} banned decades ago continue to linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> in 93 samples of freshwater fish collected from 45 sites. The toxic substances included PCBs; dioxins, two chlorinated pesticides, DDE and dieldrin, and PBDEs.

Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the Washington State Department of Health is advising the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also indicated high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.|$|E

2500|$|In ALF, hepatic {{encephalopathy}} leads to cerebral edema, coma, brain herniation, and eventually death. [...] Detection of encephalopathy {{is central to}} the diagnosis of ALF. [...] It may vary from subtle deficit in higher brain function (e.g. mood, concentration in grade I) to deep coma (grade IV). [...] Patients presenting as acute and hyperacute liver failure are at greater risk of developing cerebral oedema and grade IV encephalopathy. The pathogenesis remains unclear, but {{is likely to be a}} consequence of several phenomena. [...] There is a buildup <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> like ammonia, mercaptan, benzodiazepines, serotonin and tryptophan in the brain. [...] This affects neurotransmitter level and neuroreceptor activation. [...] Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is impaired, and is associated with anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative stress.

2500|$|Neutrophils, {{along with}} two other cell types (eosinophils and basophils; see below), are known as granulocytes due to the {{presence}} of granules in their cytoplasm, or as polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) due to their distinctive lobed nuclei. [...] Neutrophil granules contain a variety <b>of</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> that kill or inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi. [...] Similar to macrophages, neutrophils attack pathogens by activating a respiratory burst. The main products of the neutrophil respiratory burst are strong oxidizing agents including hydrogen peroxide, free oxygen radicals and hypochlorite. Neutrophils are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50-60% of the total circulating leukocytes, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the site of an infection.
