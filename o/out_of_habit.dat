5|$|The {{boundary}} of the eastern Languedoc with the Southern Rhône Valley wine region was moved slightly in 2004, {{with the result that}} Costières de Nîmes AOC is now a Rhône appellation rather than a Languedoc one. In that year, INAO moved the responsibility for oversight of this appellation's wine to the regional committee of the Rhône valley. Local producers of Côtes du Rhône-styled wines made from Syrah and Grenache lobbied for this change since the local winemaking traditions did not coincide with administrative borders, and presumably due to the greater prestige of Rhône wines in the marketplace. Such changes of borders between wine regions are very rare, so <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit,</b> Costières de Nîmes remains listed as a Languedoc wine in many publications.|$|E
25|$|Ethical vegetarians {{say that}} the reasons for not hurting or killing animals {{are similar to the}} reasons for not hurting or killing humans. They argue that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be {{justified}} in extreme circumstances; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit</b> is not justifiable. Some ethicists have added that humans, unlike other animals, are morally conscious of their behavior and have a choice; this is why there are laws governing human behavior, and why it is subject to moral standards.|$|E
25|$|Late in the war, as {{they got}} desperate, and as it became obvious to the Algarvians that non-Kaunians were now far more of a worry than the {{thoroughly}} cowed blonds, the Algarvians began to display a somewhat more pragmatic, open attitude toward the Kaunians. They allowed Valmierans and Jelgavans to join their army, and they {{played an important role}} on the southern front against the Unkerlanters and in Jelgava. Their mages still defaulted toward wanting to kill Kaunians <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit,</b> including the soldiers fighting on their side, but Algarvian officers increasingly refused to allow this, leading the mages to turn to killing Yaninan deserters or turning to other magics.|$|E

25|$|Although Bane {{had sworn}} off using Venom in Vengeance of Bane II in 1995, and his {{character}} is actually written as having kept {{that promise to}} himself, {{it is still not}} uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device {{to the back of his}} head, as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of Secret Six, in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit,</b> even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.|$|E
25|$|Edward, {{like all}} vampires in the Twilight series, {{possesses}} superhuman stamina, senses, mentality, and agility, {{as well as}} a healing factor and night vision. His superhuman strength allows him to subdue his prey, uproot trees, throw cars, and crush metal. His bodily tissue is stronger than granite, making him much more durable and tougher than humans as well as contributing slightly to his body weight. He is described as being inhumanly beautiful with refined and perfected features. His scent and voice are enormously seductive to Bella, so much so that he occasionally sends her into a pliant daze entirely by accident. In Twilight, Edward explains that like other vampires, he does not need to breathe, though he chooses to do so <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit</b> and because it is helpful to smell his environment. He cannot digest regular food, and compares its attractiveness for him to the prospect of eating dirt for a regular person. Like other vampires, Edward is not able to sleep.|$|E

2500|$|A genetic {{study of}} men in the early 2000s showed that many Hispanos of the American Southwest are descended from Anusim (Sephardic Jews who were {{forcibly}} converted to Roman Catholicism). Only Catholic Spanish were allowed to go to the New World with the exploration and colonial expeditions. Families first kept their secrets for protection and then <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit.</b> Michael Hammer, a research professor at the University of Arizona and an expert on Jewish genetics, said that fewer than 1% of non-Semites possessed the male-specific [...] "Cohanim marker" [...] or Cohen Modal Haplotype, which is prevalent among Jews claiming descent from hereditary priests. 30 of 78 Latinos tested in New Mexico (38.5%), were found to have Y-DNA with the Cohanim marker. Wider DNA testing of Hispanic populations has revealed between 10% and 15% of men living in New Mexico, south Texas and northern Mexico have a Y chromosome associated with the Middle East. Their history makes it most likely that they are Jewish rather than Arabic Muslim.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his final}} {{first-class}} season, 1953, Brown scored 849 runs (24.97) and took 87 wickets (20.74). He was appointed {{chairman of the}} selection committee and recalled himself for the second Test against Australia {{at the age of}} 42, agreeing to play just one Test on the request of Len Hutton. Ray Lindwall recalled that most of the England players remembered Brown as captain and called him Skipper <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit,</b> even the new captain Hutton. Brown scored 22 runs off 14 balls in the first innings and Lindwall says he [...] "pitched and turned his leg-breaks on a good length equally well from either end" [...] to take 4/82. When Hutton damaged a finger trying to take a catch, Brown took over in the field. The match ended in a draw and was his last Test and Brown effectively retired from cricket {{at the end of the}} 1953 season, though he made occasional reappearances until 1961. He worked as an administrator, tour manager and radio commentator for Test Match Special on BBC Radio and wrote his autobiography Cricket Musketeer in 1954.|$|E

2500|$|Like many genre authors, Carl perfected her craft at {{the short}} fiction level.... I {{was delighted to}} find Carl's most {{important}} stories collected {{here for the first}} time.... Of the 11 stories contained here, all have some sort of underlying mythic/historical theme, which is Carl's forté.... Perhaps the most ambitious story here is [...] "From the Labyrinth of Night." [...] A Martian exploration setup is developed nicely with rich allusions to the Minotaur legends of ancient Crete, culminating in the [...] "sacrifice" [...] demanded by the beast in the maze. The interpersonal relationships are the real driving force to the narrative, as by this point, the astronauts' explorations are mechanical efforts done <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit</b> more than enthusiasm.... "Upon this Shoal of Time" [...] is another ambitious science fiction story cloaked in the trappings of mythology. This time, Carl takes the reader to a far-future archaeological dig, where real science is dependent upon the financial sponsorship of media conglomerates hopeful of unearthing exclusive rights to digs that capture the public fancy, King Tut-style. After unearthing an intact Pictish skull from a Scottish burial site in Cawdor, Dr. James Henderson subjects it to a series of elaborate processes, each one designed to unlock lost memories from the subject at the sub-atomic level. His experiment is far more successful than he'd ever dreamed. At turns disturbing and impressive, with MacBethian overtones, Carl crafts a moving tale around the strength and impact memories can have on a person. One of the strongest stories presented here — the fuzzy science of the premise is presented smoothly and logically, detracting nothing from the narrative.|$|E

6000|$|There came a {{knock at}} my door--Ella with my supper. I refused to open, and sent her away, to fall on my knees in the {{darkness}} and pray wildly to a God whose attributes and character were sufficiently confused in my mind. On the one hand was the stern, despotic Monarch of the Westminster Catechism, whom I addressed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit,</b> the Father who condemned {{a portion of his}} children from the cradle. Was I one of those who he had decreed before I was born must suffer the tortures of the flames of hell? Putting two and two together, what I had learned in Sunday school and gathered from parts of Dr. Pound's sermons, and the intimation of my father that wickedness was within me, like an incurable disease,--was not mine the logical conclusion? What, then, was the use of praying?... My supplications ceased abruptly. And my ever ready imagination, stirred to its depths, beheld that awful scene of the last day: the darkness, such as sometimes creeps over the city in winter, when the jaundiced smoke falls down and we read at noonday by gas-light. I beheld the tortured faces of the wicked gathered on the one side, and my mother on the other amongst the blessed, gazing across the gulf at me with yearning and compassion. Strange that it did not strike me that the sight of the condemned whom they had loved in life would have marred if not destroyed the happiness of the chosen, about to receive their crowns and harps! What a theology--that made the Creator and Preserver of all mankind thus illogical! ...|$|E

6000|$|But his {{attention}} was soon caught. Sinfulness stood before him {{not as the}} liability to penalty for transgressing an arbitrary rule, but as a taint to the entire being, mastering the will, perverting the senses, forging fetters <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit,</b> {{so as to be}} a loathsome horror paralysing and enchaining the whole being and making it into the likeness of him who brought sin and death into the world. The horror seemed to grow on Ambrose, as his boyish faults and errors rushed on his mind, and he felt pervaded by the contagion of the pestilence, abhorrent even to himself. But behold, what was he hearing now? [...] "The bond thrall abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth ever. Si ergo Filius liberavit, vere liberi eritis." [...] "If the Son should make you free, then are ye free indeed." [...] And for the first time was the true liberty of the redeemed soul comprehensibly proclaimed to the young spirit that had begun to yearn for something beyond the outside. Light began to shine through the outward ordinances; the Church; the world, life, and death, were revealed as something absolutely new; a redeeming, cleansing, sanctifying power was made known, and seemed to inspire him with a new life, joy, and hope. He was no longer feeling himself necessarily crushed by the fetters of death, or only delivered from absolute peril by a mechanism that had lost its heart, but he could enter into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, in process of being saved, not in sin but FROM sin.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{always went}} to the tavern {{with a sense of}} pleasure. Macalister, the philosophic stockbroker, was {{generally}} there and glad to argue upon any subject under the sun; Hayward came regularly when he was in London; and though he and Macalister disliked one another they continued <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>habit</b> to meet on that one evening in the week. Macalister thought Hayward a poor creature, and sneered at his delicacies of sentiment: he asked satirically about Hayward's literary work and received with scornful smiles his vague suggestions of future masterpieces; their arguments were often heated; but the punch was good, and they were both fond of it; {{towards the end of the}} evening they generally composed their differences and thought each other capital fellows. This evening Philip found them both there, and Lawson also; Lawson came more seldom now that he was beginning to know people in London and went out to dinner a good deal. They were all on excellent terms with themselves, for Macalister had given them a good thing on the Stock Exchange, and Hayward and Lawson had made fifty pounds apiece. It was a great thing for Lawson, who was extravagant and earned little money: he had arrived at that stage of the portrait-painter's career when he was noticed a good deal by the critics and found a number of aristocratic ladies who were willing to allow him to paint them for nothing (it advertised them both, and gave the great ladies quite an air of patronesses of the arts); but he very seldom got hold of the solid philistine who was ready to pay good money for a portrait of his wife. Lawson was brimming over with satisfaction.|$|E
