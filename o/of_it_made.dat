In a 1997 interview, Harrison said that the song's inclusion reflected the band's willingness to experiment during this period, adding: [...] "We were listening {{to all sorts of}} things, Stockhausen, avant-garde music, whatever, and most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> its way onto our records." ...|$|E

500|$|During the tour, filmmaker Baz Luhrmann {{commissioned}} Radiohead {{to write}} a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: [...] "When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt [...]45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately." [...] Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape {{the direction of the}} rest of the album; Yorke said it [...] "was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> my head spin—something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|Titan is {{the only}} known moon with a {{significant}} atmosphere, and its atmosphere {{is the only}} nitrogen-rich dense atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth's. Observations <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> in 2004 by Cassini suggest that Titan is a [...] "super rotator", like Venus, with an atmosphere that rotates much faster than its surface. Observations from the Voyager space probes have shown that Titan's atmosphere is denser than Earth's, with a surface pressure about 1.45 atm. It is also about 1.19 times as massive as Earth's overall, or about 7.3 times more massive on a per surface area basis. Opaque haze layers block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and obscures Titan's surface features. Titan's lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth's. The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many wavelengths and as a result, a complete reflectance spectrum of the surface is impossible to acquire from orbit. It {{was not until the}} arrival of the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft in 2004 that the first direct images of Titan's surface were obtained.|$|E

2500|$|The Greeks were favorably {{impressed}} by the constitution of Carthage; Aristotle had a study <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> which unfortunately is lost. In the brief approving review of it found in his Politica Aristotle saw one fault: that focus on pursuit of wealth led to oligarchy. So it was in Carthage. The people were politically passive; popular rights came late. Being a commercial republic fielding a mercenary army, the people were not conscripted for military service, an experience which can foster the feel for popular political action. On the other hand, Carthage was very stable; there were few openings for tyrants. [...] "The superiority of their constitution is proved {{by the fact that}} the common people remain loyal," [...] noted Aristotle. Only after defeat. by Rome devastated Carthage's imperial ambitions did the people express interest in reform.|$|E

2500|$|A 46-yard {{punt return}} by Colts {{defensive}} back Ray Buchanan to the Chargers 27 set up Harbaugh's 2-yard {{touchdown pass to}} tight end Ken Dilger a minute into the second quarter. But San Diego recaptured the lead on their ensuing possession by moving the ball 68 yards in 18 plays, converting five third downs on a drive in which no play gained more than 10 yards. [...] Humphries's 6-yard scoring pass to tight end Alfred Pupunu at the end <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> the score 10–7. However, the Colts came right back with an 80-yard drive in which Harbaugh completed 4 of 5 passes for 43 yards and rushed for 2 before Crockett scored on 33-yard touchdown run to give the Colts a 14–10 lead. The Chargers countered with a drive to Indianapolis's 17-yard line.

2500|$|The {{film was}} shot and edited in a cinéma vérité style, to look like it was taped with one {{hand-held}} camera, including jump cuts similar to ones found in home movies. T.J. Miller, who plays Hud, has said in various interviews that he taped {{a third of the}} movie and almost half <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> it into the film. Director Matt Reeves described the presentation, [...] "We wanted this to be as if someone found a Handicam, took out the tape {{and put it in the}} player to watch it. What you're watching is a home movie that then turns into something else." [...] Reeves explained that the pedestrians documenting the severed head of the Statue of Liberty with the camera phones was reflective of the contemporary period. According to him: [...] "Cloverfield very much speaks to the fear and anxieties of our time, how we live our lives. Constantly documenting things and putting them up on YouTube, sending people videos through e-mail– we felt it was very applicable to the way people feel now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The full disentangling of Greek statues {{from their}} later Roman copies, {{and a better}} {{understanding}} of the balance between Greekness and Roman-ness in Greco-Roman art was to take much longer, and perhaps still continues. [...] Greek art, especially sculpture, continued to enjoy an enormous reputation, and studying and copying it was a large part of the training of artists, until the downfall of Academic art in the late 19th century. [...] During this period, the actual known corpus of Greek art, and to a lesser extent architecture, has greatly expanded. [...] The study of vases developed an enormous literature in the late 19th and 20th centuries, much based on the identification of the hands of individual artists, with Sir John Beazley the leading figure. This literature generally assumed that vase-painting represented the development of an independent medium, only in general terms drawing from stylistic development in other artistic media. [...] This assumption has been increasingly challenged in recent decades, and some scholars now see it as a secondary medium, largely representing cheap copies of now lost metalwork, and much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made,</b> not for ordinary use, but to deposit in burials.|$|E

2500|$|The anime {{was popular}} with Japanese readers of Charapedia who voted it the ninth best anime show of Spring 2017. IGN writer Sam Stewart enjoyed {{the focus of}} the new {{generation}} of ninjas and their differences from the previous generation, praising the return of other characters like Toneri as well as famous [...] "Eye Techniques". Crunchyroll's Naruto expert and Brand Manager, Victoria Holden, joined once to discuss whether Next Generations could live up {{to the success of the}} old series while still reviewing previous episodes of the series. Stewart enjoyed the characterization of both Shikadai Nara and Metal Lee seeing their relationship and accidental fight as interesting to watch, and that Next Generations managed to improve itself with each episode. Beveridge enjoyed the series' first episode, remarking he felt Boruto's characterization was superior to the one from the manga. In a more comical article, Geek.com writer Tim Tomas compared Boruto with the series The Legend of Korra as, while sharing themes with its prequels, they were still different. Sarah Nelkin considered Boruto as a more lighthearted version of Naruto series but Amy McNulty from ANN acclaimed its 13th episode for the focus on a subplot that has been developing ever since its first episode and how the revelation <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>made</b> the series darker. Stewart agreed with McNulty, commenting on how the developers reached the climax of the anime's first story arc as well as the characterization of the revealed villain which impressed the reviewer. Allega Frank from Polygon noted that during the start of both the manga and anime, multiple fans were worried in regards to a flashforward; in this sequence an older Boruto is facing an enemy named Kawaki who implies Naruto might be dead so his fate left them worried.|$|E
