5|$|In 1950, Watts {{settled in}} Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, {{a native of}} the town.

The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allow African American doctors to perform surgery.

5|$|Also injured was Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Scales. Scales didn't play for 10 weeks {{during the regular}} season because <b>of</b> <b>surgery</b> to an injured tendon. Despite playing in only four games during the season, he finished the regular season as the Hokies' No. 5 receiver, catching 13 passes for 298 yards. Scales' injury caused the Hokies to be ranked among the worst in the Big East in receiving yardage, averaging less than 180 yards per game through the air. As the game moved closer, however, Scales recovered from his injury and appeared near full strength.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time <b>of</b> <b>surgery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942.

5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} for people with focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal <b>of</b> <b>surgery</b> is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E

Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief <b>of</b> <b>surgery</b> Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E
