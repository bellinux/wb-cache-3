5|$|Henry {{placed a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> if the King chose to ignore them. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{despite a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on royal power, Henry's rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> if the King chose to ignore them. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.

5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E

5|$|Dinges {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s the U.S. Justice Department had enough {{evidence}} to bring an indictment of Noriega on drug charges in a U.S. court, but chose not to do so because of the diplomatic consequences involved. This evidence included the testimony of an arrested boat courier, and of a drug smuggler arrested in New York. Though Torrijos frequently promised the U.S. cooperation in dealing with drug smuggling, Noriega would have headed any effort at enforcement, and the U.S. began to see him as the real problem. Dinges writes that the U.S. government considered several options to move Noriega out of the drug trafficking business, including assassinating him, and linking him to a fictional plot against Torrijos. Though no assassination attempt was made, the other ploys may have been tried in the early 1970s, according to Dinges. Beginning in 1972, however, Dinges writes that the U.S. relaxed its efforts at trapping individuals involved with smuggling within the Panama government, possibly {{as a result of an}} agreement between Torrijos and U.S. president Richard Nixon. Moreover, during the same period Noriega was becoming a trusted ally of the CIA, including acting as the U.S. emissary to Cuba during negotiations following the Johnny Express incident. Noriega, too, made an effort during this period to portray Panama as a hub <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> against drug smuggling, possibly as a result of pressure from Torrijos. Noriega's drug-related activities came to the U.S. government's attention once again during the ratification process for the Panama Canal treaties, but were once again downplayed by the U.S. intelligence services in order to get the treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate.|$|E
