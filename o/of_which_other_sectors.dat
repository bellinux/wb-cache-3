40|$|The 2017 Index tracks funding across 23 diverse issue areas, many <b>of</b> <b>which</b> {{overlap with}} <b>other</b> <b>sectors,</b> like climate, democracy-building, gender equality, and migration. The {{existence}} of peaceful, stable societies {{is critical to}} the success of other areas of work: children cannot be educated, health care clinics cannot provide services, and economic development projects will fail if people are experiencing violent conflict in their communities. In other words, peace and security funders are the "ground zero" of the philanthropic community: their work provides a foundation upon <b>which</b> <b>other</b> interventions can blossom and grow. It is this interconnectedness with other issues that makes peace and security grantmaking ever more important. We hope that foundations, policymakers, and civil society organizations will use the 2017 Index to advocate for increased attention to this fundamental work so we can continue to move towards a more peaceful, secure world for everyone...|$|R
30|$|A United Nations survey {{identified}} {{health as}} a universal priority for societies around the world (UNMC 2014). While a vital sector in itself, the health sector contributes across all <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> (for example, education and employment), {{as well as being}} one to <b>which</b> <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> contribute. In the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005 – 2015 (UNISDR 2005), there was little explicit mention of the important role of disaster risk reduction strategies in improving health outcomes for people at risk or affected by emergencies and disasters. Sendai has changed this, and health resilience is strongly promoted throughout the Framework.|$|R
30|$|The ICI {{mitigation}} {{technique is}} composed by two phases. Firstly, in the ‘restriction definition’ phase, each <b>sector</b> determines locally <b>which</b> <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> are producing harmful interference on specific resource blocks and generates {{a list of}} resource blocks that the interfering sectors would have to restrict or limit transmit power {{in order to improve}} on that sector’s throughput. This is done concurrently with the sector’s internal resource scheduling. Secondly, the sectors exchange information with the interfering sectors and in the ‘restriction negotiation’ phase each sector computes which resource blocks it has to restrict in order to maximize the overall network throughput. The IHA algorithm will be used here to determine which restrictions make sense from a system point of view. Below, the details of the algorithms are explained and summarized in Algorithm 1.|$|R

It is the largest industry and contributes about 10 % of the gross national product (GNP) in industrial-ized countries.

The current study aims to establish the factors required in the manage-ment of good site management on construction sites in Swaziland. The study is conducted with reference to existing theoretical literature, published and un-published research. The study is mainly a literature review/survey on site man-agement practices on construction sites. Findings emanating from the study reveal that realistic studies have identified a number of problems on site management practices such as management and administration problems, technical problems and communication problems. It also indicates that site management involves a mixture <b>of</b> activities <b>which</b> turn basic sources to a finished product.

The gradual decline of the Golden era of Nigerian cinema {{has been attributed to}} several factors, including the reduction in the value of Naira, lack of finance and marketing support, lack of standard film studios and production equipment, frequent Government structural adjustment programmes due to military dictatorships, as well as inexperience on the part of practitioners.

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{synthesis}} of work undertaken by countries in the movement for Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN). The costed nutrition plans for 20 countries are analysed, looking at the assumptions made, the priority areas and targets which were set and the methods used, {{to determine whether they}} are responsive to the identified needs. It provides a basis for identifying priority areas for investment in each country, exploring answers to the questions - Are plans aligned with evidence-based recommendations? Is responsibility going beyond health <b>sector?</b> <b>Which</b> <b>other</b> <b>sectors</b> are engaged? What is the balance between specific nutrition interventions, nutrition-sensitive approaches and governance? What are the opportunities for non-Government stakeholders? Each country’s data is presented in a 2 page summary, outlining the scale of malnutrition, the distribution of programmes between specific, sensitive and governance and an outline of the costs, priorities and funding gaps. The plans themselves all have different strengths and weaknesses. This heterogeneity is inevitable, if only because countries have different interlinked sets of nutrition problems as this report clearly shows. But countries also have different sets of nutrition capacities. Importantly, the heterogeneity of the plans is a strength, not a weakness. As Lawrence Haddad concludes, “the plans serve as the most credible basis for investments to accelerate the reduction of undernutrition. They should be analysed, used, improved and backed...|$|R

All activities rely on the successful and dependable delivery of energy, in whatever form. Access to electricity and other modern energy sources is necessary requirement for economic and social development. At the beginning of 1990 -s 15 countries which were as the part of former Soviet Union announced about state independence. Each of these countries began their own way of creating new democratic society, market oriented and world-integrated economy. Successes here relied to implement a lot of structural and reform changes in all of fields of country’s economy and most difficult issue here was the creating new energy system, because successes or failures in reforms implemented in power market can make huge positive or negative affects to whole economy. Looking to The Past Since {{the birth of the}} Soviet Union electricity in all former soviet countries has been seen {{as a part of the}} social infrastructure, similar to education. Therefore, electricity policy has been a key aspect of industrial and social development policy. During a long time the energy systems of all these countries were integrated to a single energy system, which was under state control and management. There were no competition in energy market or private production in this field. The positive factor was that until recent years in the post soviet space there was no region or areas without electricity. Lacks of electricity in some areas were covered by deliveries energy from different regions...|$|R
