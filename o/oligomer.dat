40|$|Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{associated}} with the aggregation of Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). It is believed that neurotoxicity is caused during the Aβ aggregation process, by soluble Aβ <b>oligomers</b> species, and not by the Aβ fibrils themselves that considered as inert end-products of the aggregation process. Nevertheless, stability of Aβ fibrils might be overestimated. We found that inert Aβ fibrils can be reversed to toxic <b>oligomers</b> in the presence of synthetic phospholipids and lipid rafts components as gangliosids, sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Interestingly, the equilibrium is not shifted towards monomeric Aβ but rather towards soluble amyloid <b>oligomers</b> (backward <b>oligomers).</b> Methods: Biochemical and biophysical analysis, neurotoxicity study on primary neurons and mice brain icv. injection of amyloid <b>oligomers</b> were performed. Results: Backward <b>oligomers</b> are very similar to the <b>oligomers</b> found during the classical aggregation process of monomeric Aβ (forward <b>oligomers).</b> Backward <b>oligomers</b> cause synaptic markers loss and immediate neurotoxicity to primary neurons followed by apoptotic cell death. In addition, mice brain icv. injection of backward amyloid <b>oligomers</b> causes Tau phosphorylation, Caspase 3 activation and memory impairment in mouse similarly to forward <b>oligomers.</b> Finally, we observe that release of toxic <b>oligomers</b> and subsequent neurotoxicity may be caused by other disease-associated amyloid peptides as TAU, Prion 1 and synthetic amyloidogenic peptide in the presence of lipids. Conclusions: We propose that lipid-induced fibrils disassembly and release of soluble <b>oligomers</b> is a common generic mechanism of amyloids. An important implication of our work is that amyloid plaques are not inert and should be considered as potential large reservoirs of neurotoxic <b>oligomers</b> that can rapidly be mobilized by lipids. Although lipid metabolism has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases the precise involvement of lipids in basic toxicity mechanisms in AD is a major question.

25|$|Anthrax toxin protein {{components}} must assemble into holotoxin complexes to function. In {{order for}} LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize {{to the cell}} and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped <b>oligomer.</b> This ring-shaped <b>oligomer</b> {{is often referred to}} as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore <b>oligomer,</b> which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA <b>oligomer</b> may then bind with up to three or four molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the endosome causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a pH gradient, allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.|$|E

The suggestion that intermediate oligomeric species may be cytotoxic has led to intensified investigations of pre-fibrillar <b>oligomers,</b> which are complicated by their transient nature and low population. Here we investigate alpha-synuclein <b>oligomers,</b> enriched by a 2 -pyridone molecule (FN 075), and the conversion of <b>oligomers</b> into fibrils. As probed by leakage assays, the FN 075 induced <b>oligomers</b> potently disrupt vesicles in vitro, suggesting a potential link to disease related degenerative activity. Fibrils formed in the presence and absence of FN 075 are indistinguishable on microscopic and macroscopic levels. Using small angle X-ray scattering, we reveal that FN 075 induced <b>oligomers</b> are similar, but not identical, to <b>oligomers</b> previously observed during alpha-synuclein fibrillation. Since the levels of FN 075 induced <b>oligomers</b> correlate with the amounts of fibrils among different FN 075 :protein ratios, the <b>oligomers</b> appear to be on-pathway and modeling supports an ‘oligomer stacking model’ for alpha-synuclein fibril elongation...|$|R

Although soluble polyQ <b>oligomers</b> have been proposed as a cytotoxic structure, the cytotoxicity of soluble polyQ <b>oligomers,</b> not inclusion bodies (IBs), has not been proven in living cells. To clarify the cytotoxicity of soluble polyQ <b>oligomers,</b> we carried our fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) confocal microscopy and distinguished <b>oligomers</b> from monomers and IBs in a single living cell.

25|$|Small {{peptides}} can specifically {{inhibit the}} RNR2 subunits from binding with RNR1 when {{they share a}} significant similarity with the normal RNR2 C-terminus. This inhibition RNR2 binding to RNR1 has been tested successfully in herpes simplex virus (HSV) RNR. When a 7 amino acid <b>oligomer</b> (GAVVNDL) truncated from the C-terminus of the RNR2 subunit was used in competition assays, it prevented the normal RNR2 from forming an enzymatically active complex with RNR1. Other small peptide inhibitors similar to the RNR2 C-terminus have also been used successfully to inhibit HSV RNR enzymatic activity and thus HSV replication. In mice models of stromal keratitis and corneal neovascularization (HSV ocular disease), a small RNR2 C-terminal analog BILD 1263 {{has been reported to}} inhibit RNR and is effective in preventing these diseases. In some cases, although treatment with small C-terminal analogs may not stop disease spreading, they can still help in healing. In the acyclovir-resistant HSV (PAAr5), a small peptide inhibitor BILD 1633 has been reported to be 5 to 10 times more potent than BILD 1263 against cutaneous PAAr5 infection. A combination therapy approach (BILD 1633 and acyclovir) is more effective to heal topical lesions in mice.

Amyloid <b>oligomers</b> are structurally and morphologically diverse, raising the question on whether this diversity is pathologically significant and whether different types of <b>oligomers</b> may have different toxic activities. Many of the amyloids associated with neurodegenerative diseases form three immunologically distinct types of <b>oligomers.</b> Fibrillar <b>oligomers</b> are structurally related to fibrils and may represent small pieces of fibrils or fibril protofilaments. Prefibrillar <b>oligomers</b> are kinetic intermediates in fibril formation and annular protofibrils that resemble membrane pores. These three classes of <b>oligomers</b> share common structures and toxic activities. Focus on these common mechanisms of toxicity provides a means of simplifying the list of primary disease mechanisms and opens the possibility of developing broad spectrum therapeutics that target several amyloid related degenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of amyloid-β (Aβ) as amyloid fibrils and toxic <b>oligomers</b> {{is an important}} step in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Here we show that Aβ <b>oligomers</b> can be assigned to one of at least two classes (type 1 and type 2) based on their temporal, spatial, and structural relationships to amyloid fibrils. The type 2 <b>oligomers</b> are related to amyloid fibrils and represent the majority of <b>oligomers</b> generated in vivo, but they remain confined to the vicinity of amyloid plaques and do not impair cognition at levels relevant to AD.

40|$|In protein {{conformational}} disorders {{ranging from}} Alzheimer to Parkinson disease, proteins of unrelated sequence misfold into a similar array of aggregated conformers ranging from small <b>oligomers</b> to large amyloid fibrils. Substantial {{evidence suggests that}} small, prefibrillar <b>oligomers</b> are the most toxic species, yet to what extent they can be selectively targeted and remodeled into non-toxic conformers using small molecules is poorly understood. We have evaluated the conformational specificity and remodeling pathways of a diverse panel of aromatic small molecules against mature soluble <b>oligomers</b> of the Aβ 42 peptide associated with Alzheimer disease. We find that small molecule antagonists can be grouped into three classes, which we herein define as Class I, II, and III molecules, based on the distinct pathways they utilize to remodel soluble <b>oligomers</b> into multiple conformers with reduced toxicity. Class I molecules remodel soluble <b>oligomers</b> into large, off-pathway aggregates that are non-toxic. Moreover, Class IA molecules also remodel amyloid fibrils into the same off-pathway structures, whereas Class IB molecules fail to remodel fibrils but accelerate aggregation of freshly disaggregated Aβ. In contrast, a Class II molecule converts soluble Aβ <b>oligomers</b> into fibrils, but is inactive against disaggregated and fibrillar Aβ. Class III molecules disassemble soluble <b>oligomers</b> (as well as fibrils) into low molecular weight species that are non-toxic. Strikingly, Aβ non-toxic <b>oligomers</b> (which are morphologically indistinguishable from toxic soluble <b>oligomers)</b> are significantly more resistant to being remodeled than Aβ soluble <b>oligomers</b> or amyloid fibrils.

Results Here we report that <b>oligomers</b> of recombinant full-length human tau protein are neurotoxic in vivo after subcortical stereotaxic injection into mice. Tau <b>oligomers</b> impaired memory consolidation, whereas tau fibrils and monomers did not.
