40|$|Maritime Pine {{is one of}} {{two species}} of exotic {{conifers}} present in Abel Tasman National Park, in significant numbers. The species was first planted at Bark Bay, (ca. 1900) and since then has established itself particularly well, throughout many of the southern coastal areas of the Park. The pines characteristic ecological features make it especially well adapted to colonise many of the infertile and harsh sites that exist in proximity to the Park's coastline and give it a distinct competitive advantage over the indigenous flora of the area. Spread has generally been strongest in a southerly direction, away from Bark Bay, presumably influenced by prevailing winds in addition to suitable sites for colonisation. The rate of spread of the pine was calculated as 9. 1 metres/year, at Bark Bay, away from the assumed initial seed source. It is important to note though, that this rate is considerably increased by the pine's ability to form outliers of pine, significant distances away from the <b>original</b> <b>seed</b> <b>source.</b> The outliers were generally found {{to be the result of}} strong winds (greater than Force 6) capable of carrying seed considerable distances, on to sites suitable for colonisation by maritime pin. Consequently this serves to increase the distribution of maritime pine within the Park. This pattern of long-range dispersal has only occurred since ca. 1940 and has only become increasingly prevalent in recent years. At present then, the pine occurs along some 9. 2 kilometres of the Park's coastline. The pine appears to be type specific in its invasion characteristics with low Leptospermum shrubland vegetation types being the most susceptible to invasion. The pine will not usually establish where there is a closed canopy (i. e. Podocarp/Hardwood/Beech vegetation types). Obviously the rate of spread is increasing at an exponential rate as the pine becomes more widespread in its distribution throughout the Park. For this reason a programme of control is recommended, aimed at confining the species to the Bark Bay area, where it initially originated from...|$|E

Dendrochronological analysis can illuminate differences among trees from different <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in terms of absolute annual growth and sensitivity to external growth factors. We analyzed annual radial growth of 567 36 -year-old pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) trees from 27 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to evaluate their performance in a New Jersey Pine Barrens provenance experiment. Unexpectedly, missing rings were prevalent in most trees, and some years- 1992, 1999, and 2006 -had a particularly high frequency of missing rings across the plantation. Trees from local <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> (< 55 km away from the plantation) had a significantly smaller percentage of missing rings from 1980 - 2009 (mean: 5. 0 %), relative to northernmost and southernmost sources (mean: 9. 3 % and 7. 9 %, respectively). Some years with a high frequency of missing rings coincide with outbreaks of defoliating insects or dry growing season conditions.

Plants from 37 <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> of silver birch from Scotland and northern England planted at two sites were compared for several characteristics related to hydraulic architecture, vulnerability to freezeâthaw cycle induced embolism and spring recovery from winter embolism during the period 2000 â 2002. Phenological rhythms were also monitored in late winterâearly spring to document relationships between phenology and water relations parameters. Significant differences were found across <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> in stage of bud flushing for four dates in spring. Early flushing <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> differed by about 1 to 2 weeks from late-flushing <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> across the two sites. Wintertime xylem embolism in stems reached a peak of about 50 to 70 % loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity, depending on the size and position of the sample shoots in the canopy. Small apical shoots were significantly more embolized than large basal shoots. Development of winter embolism was coupled to the occurrence of frost events. As percent loss of hydraulic conductivity increased during the winter, wood relative water content declined. Embolism reversal occurred rapidly in spring at the time of development of positive root pressure. No significant differences in the degree of winter embolism in 2001 were found among the three <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> examined.

Various seedling characteristics were measured, notably height growth from nursery to the fourth year on plantation. Other traits such as biomass and carbon allocation, nutritional status, and various photosynthetic traits before bud break, were evaluated during the fourth growing season. No interaction between sites and <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> was observed for any traits, suggesting similar plasticity between <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> There was no change in the rank of <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> and sites between years for height growth. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between the height from the nursery and that after 4 years in the plantation.

To what extent is community structure influenced by land-use history and distance to <b>seed</b> <b>sources?</b> Do these effects change in time? Location: A 350 -ha heathland (NOrholm) in southwest Denmark was abandoned in 1895 and left for free succession. Prior to abandonment the heathland was under traditional management for centuries. Method: Trees and shrubs were recorded and measured in ten surveys spanning 91 yr (1921 - 2012). In the first nine surveys, complete censuses were used, whereas 116 randomly placed plots (10 -m radius) {{were used in the}} most recent survey. We used mixed models and different multivariate techniques (non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate ANOVA) to analyse spatio-temporal patterns in stem densities, species richness and species composition and the effects of land-use history and distance to <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Results: Tree and shrub densities increased exponentially over time and were consistently lower at longer distance from <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> Land-use history affected the rate of increase in tree densities, with lower encroachment rates at previously cultivated soils. Initially, species richness increased rapidly but leveled off in later successional stages. Richness was marginally higher at areas closer to <b>seed</b> <b>sources,</b> whereas it was not affected by land-use history. The succession showed a shift from early to mid-successional species over time; but distance to <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> determined which species were colonizing at early stages. Conclusion: Distance to <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> and land-use history can differentially affect the structure and spatial patterns of developing forest communities. Although both factors had long-lasting effects on rates of colonization, the spatial patterns of colonization and species composition were mainly determined by distance to <b>seed</b> <b>sources.</b> The importance of distance to <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> became less over time, suggesting that dispersal is a stronger driver at early stages.

The validity of such a strategy {{will depend on the}} adaptation capacity of populations, which can partially be evaluated by the ecophysiological response of different genetic sources along a climatic gradient. This adaptation capacity results from the compromise between (i) the degree of genetic adaptation of <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to their environment of origin and (ii) the phenotypic plasticity of functional trait which can make it possible for transferred <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to positively respond to new growing conditions. We examined phenotypic variation in morphophysiological traits of six <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) along a regional climatic gradient in QuÃ©bec, Canada. Seedlings from the <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> were planted at three forest sites representing a mean annual temperature gradient of 2. 2 Â°C. During the second growing season, we measured, height growth (H 2014) and traits related to resources use efficiency and photosynthetic rate (Amax). All functional traits showed an adaptive response to the climatic gradient. Traits such as H 2014, Amax, stomatal conductance (gs), the ratio of mesophyll to stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency showed significant variation related to both physiological plasticity related to test site, and <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> variation related to local genetic adaptation. However, the amplitude of <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> variation was much less than that related to plantation sites in the area investigated. The six <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> presented a similar level of physiological plasticity. H 2014, Amax and gs, but not carboxylation capacity (Vcmax), were correlated and decreased with a reduction of the average temperature of the growing season at seed origin. The clinal variation in H 2014 and Amax appeared to be driven by CO 2 conductance. The presence of locally adapted functional traits suggests that the use of assisted population migration may have advantages for optimizing <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> productivity in future local climate...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{increase}} of forest plantation development to supply raw material for industry, the utilization of marginal land with high salinity is likely to be an alternative for the plantation of A. mangium. In an effort to increase the improvement of A. mangium to be extensively planted on the widely alternative land, breeding programs were conducted to get trees of A. mangium which are tolerant to environmental stress, such as salt stress. The {{purpose of this study was}} to observe the anatomical response of A. mangium collected from several <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to salinity stress as a basis for salt tolerance breeding program. The trial consisted of four <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> arranged in Completely Randomized Design with four level salt stresses(0; 22; 26 and 30 g/l) and 3 replications. The four tested <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> are two seedling seed orchard (SSO) originated from Papua New Guinea provenance (namely group A and B), one SSO originated from Far North Queensland provenance (group C) and one SSO originated from a combining both provenances (group E). The treatment is given by watering the seedlings from each provenance with saline solution in accordance with a predetermined concentration of 200 ml per day for 4 months. The observed parameters were stomatal index, length dan width of stomata, number and diameter of trachea, and chlorophyll content. The results showed that in general the differences in salt co ncentration provided a significant effect on anatomical response of A. mangium. Except for the length of stomata, <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> variations were significantly different for all parameters. Meanwhile, <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> x salt level interaction did not significantly affect the length and width of stomata. The higher the salt concentration, the lower the stomatal index and chlorophyll content. Conversely, the higher the salt concentration, the higher the amount of the tracheid. However the differences in salt concentration did not give a significant effect on diameter of tracheid. Overall, among the four tested <b>seed</b> <b>sources,</b> group B which is originated from Papua New Guinea provenancewas found to be the most tolerant <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> to salt stress...|$|R
40|$|Seedling {{performance}} of alkali bulrush sourced from different sites: implications for revegetation in Great Salt Lake wetlands. Bulrush (Schoenoplectus and Bolboschoenus species) are significant in Utah wetlands as they provide critical habitat {{for millions of}} migratory birds that utilize the Great Salt Lake. Many agencies in Utah are working to control Phragmites, an invasive species that has outcompeted and replaced bulrushes. Part of this process requires the introduction of native species into wetlands to restore wetland habitat, following Phragmites control, by sowing seeds into areas in need of revegetation. There are many potential <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> from which to acquire seeds; it is unknown how well plants sourced from various sites will vary in performance. In a greenhouse study, we have grown alkali bulrush (Bolboschoenus maritimus) seedlings from five geographically-distant wetland sites across the Intermountain West. We harvested seedlings and evaluated emergence timing, emergence proportion {{as well as the}} following seedling traits critical to restoration outcomes: stem diameter, root length, number of shoots, height of seedlings, and biomass production, at three different time points. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> as the fixed effect with 5 levels. We found that the Bear Lake <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> had lower seedling emergence than <b>seeds</b> <b>sourced</b> from Clear Lake and Sterling. There were no significant differences among the <b>seed</b> <b>sources</b> for the seedling performance metrics in the first and third harvests. At the second harvest, Bear Lake <b>seed</b> <b>source</b> had poorer performance overall. Analysis would suggest avoiding using Bear Lake seed for wetland managers. However, there may be no preference between using seeds from the remaining four sites...|$|R
