40|$|During {{the past}} few years, the demand for optical {{telecommunications}} has boomed (Scientifc American, January 2001). In order to satisfy this demand, new <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> are required to replace the electrical switches used up until now. In this work, 1 x N <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> are studied. Theoretical investigations are conducted to describe the physical properties of the switches and to determine their limitations. The merit function of <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> is their power coupling efficiency. The limitations are mainly aberrations and misalignments of the optical components. We experimentally demonstrate these limitations and realize improvements to the <b>optical</b> <b>switch.</b> Two approaches have been chosen. The first is to use an adaptive mirror for the correction of the aberrations. The second is to integrate microlenses into the <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> {{in order to reduce}} the aberrations and to relax the alignment tolerances. Both approaches have been realized and have brought significant improvements in power coupling efficiency. With the experiment, we demonstrate an <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> allowing up to 3019 receiver fibers to be addressed. The measured coupling efficiency (including losses due to the optical elements) is between 6 dB and 3 dB for the adaptive system and between 3 dB and 2 dB for the system using microlenses...|$|R
5000|$|Translucent OXCs (<b>optical</b> and {{electronic}} <b>switching)</b> - As {{a compromise between}} opaque and transparent OXC's, there {{is a type of}} OXC called a translucent OXC. In such a switch architecture, there is a switch stage which consists of an <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> module and an electronic <b>switch</b> module. <b>Optical</b> signals passing through the switch stage can be switched either by the <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> module or the electronic switch module. In most cases, the <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> module is preferred for the purpose of transparency. When the <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> module's switching interfaces are all busy or an optical signal needs signal regeneration through an OEO conversion process, the electronic module is used. Translucent OXC nodes provide a compromise of full optical signal transparency and comprehensive optical signal monitoring. It also provides the possibility of signal regeneration at each node.|$|R
