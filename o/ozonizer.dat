40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the study of the {{influence}} of advanced oxidation processes on degradation of organic dyes. The field of AOP – very effective physically-chemical methods of wastewater treatment – includes application of strong oxidation agents, UV and ionizing radiation and electrical discharges. For this thesis, two of these methods were chosen – the application of oxidation agent (ozone) and UV radiation. Along with electrolysis, which is mentioned rather marginally in this thesis (it is the subject of the previous thesis), these phenomena are products of electrical discharge in water, where they participate in the processes of degradation in a different way. For all measurement series, two direct azo dyes were chosen as model substances – C. I. Direct Blue 106 and C. I. Direct Red 79. The <b>ozonizer,</b> in which either oxygen or synthetic or technical air were loaded as carrier gases, was used for degradation of dyes by ozone. The generated ozone was loaded into the bubbling vessel with dye solution of different initial concentration (10 – 130 mg. dm- 3), which was followed by other bubbling vessel with KI solution for the next analytical determination of the amount of generated ozone. The other parameters changed were the gas flow (1 – 2 dm 3. min- 1), <b>ozonizer</b> output (minimal and maximal), type of dye, pH value of the solution (neutral or acid) and additional electrolyte (NaCl, Na 2 SO 4 or any). The reactor {{for the study of the}} influence of UV radiation on degradation of dyes was an UV sterilizer into which the equivalent volume of dye solution was added. The possibilities of experimental settings were limited and only the type of dye, an additional electrolyte and pH value of the dye solution were adjusted (as in the case of ozone). Several series of samples were measured with various input conditions which more or less influenced the degradation of investigated dyes in this experiment. It was found that for both used methods the Direct Blue 106 dye was more degradable (with significantly better results for ozone than for UV radiation). The degradation of Direct Red 79 dye proceeded only by ozone treatment, in the case of the application of UV radiation no degradation occurred. By investigation of the influence of initial concentration of dye on its degradation, it was confirmed that with the initial concentration enhancement the final concentration rises as well, whereas in low concentrations (10 – 50 mg. dm- 3) the initial concentration has no effect. The addition of an electrolyte had an accelerating effect on dye degradation in both methods (NaCl and also Na 2 SO 4 showed similar results though the degradation proceeded in different ways). The addition of HCl accelerated the degradation only in the case of UV radiation; during the application of ozone the pH level of the system did not have any influence on the degradation. Oxygen and synthetic air had the strongest effect on ozone degradation (comparable results); in the case of technical air the final dye concentration was higher up to 30 %.

In addition, ozone concentration at a flow rate of 8 L/min and an electrical discharge time of 3 minutes wasapproximately determined as 41, 60, 80 and 135 mg/L at 8, 9, 10 and 11 kVAC, respectively. Moreover, study of dye wastewater of Krajud mat was proposed and treated by three different methods. Firstly, dye wastewater was solely treated by a plasma ozonation. Secondly, a combination ofozonation and alum coagulation was used for dye wastewater treatment. Finally, the combined ozonation and activated carbon adsorption were used for dye wastewater treatment.
