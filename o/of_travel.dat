5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E

5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity {{suspension of}} snow and water, with the flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway.

Our approach is to use monotone iterations and a nonstandard ordering for the set of profiles of the corresponding wave system. New iterative techniques are established for a class of integral operators when the reaction term satisfies different monotonicity conditions. Following this, the existence <b>of</b> <b>travelling</b> wave fronts for reaction–diffusion systems with spatio-temporal delays is established. Finally, we apply the main results to a single-species diffusive model with spatio-temporal delay and obtain some existence criteria <b>of</b> <b>travelling</b> wave fronts by choosing different kernels...|$|R
