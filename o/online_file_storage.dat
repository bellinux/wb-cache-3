40|$|Most {{peer-to-peer}} <b>file</b> <b>storage</b> sharing systems work on wired networks. Due to the multi-hop {{wireless communication}} nature in ad-hoc networks, {{the development of}} mobile ad-hoc network <b>file</b> <b>storage</b> sharing system faces many challenges. In this paper, a hypothetical partitionable mobile file system (PMFS) is proposed. This new PMFS is a distributed file storing/sharing system built on partitionable mobile wireless ad-hoc networks. The main proposal of PMFS {{is focused on the}} system performance and service availability over wireless ad-hoc networks. To enhance performance and achieve efficient <b>file</b> <b>storage</b> and retrieval, various techniques have been proposed on the system. Overall, PMFS is aimed to be a more flexible and efficient <b>file</b> <b>storage</b> system over partitionable mobile wireless ad-hoc networks.
