25|$|After the 1803 Act of Mediation, Schwyz regained its {{independence}} {{and most of}} the changes introduced by Napoleon were reverted. The old subject lands were converted into full and equal districts and the formerly independent towns of Gersau and Reichenburg joined the new canton of Schwyz. The loss of power in the <b>old</b> <b>core</b> of Schwyz led to resentment and tension in the canton. After the abolition of the Act of Mediation in February 1814 the <b>old</b> <b>core</b> tried to usurp the leadership role in the canton and strip the right to political participation from the former subject lands. The old subject lands resisted this and the <b>old</b> <b>core</b> was forced to agree to the 1814 Constitution which granted equal rights to all citizens. However, they were able to include the provision that the two-thirds of the seats would come from the <b>old</b> <b>core</b> of Schwyz. Furthermore, the highest cantonal authorities came from the <b>old</b> <b>core.</b> While the new constitution removed the legal difference between citizens and residents, residents were not allowed to use the extensive land owned by the citizen's community. Tensions continued to escalate until in the Landsgemeinde of 1829, the residents from the former subject lands were driven out of the assembly. The former subject lands saw this as a clear threat to their equality, and encouraged by the July Revolution of 1830 the four outer districts; March, Einsiedeln, Pfaeffikon and Küssnacht signed a new constitution which guaranteed, among other things, proportional representation. The leaders of the <b>old</b> <b>core</b> saw this as a threat to their authority and rejected the new constitution. On 9 March 1831 the outer districts seceded from Schwyz and formed the canton of Outer Schwyz with the capital in Einseideln. In 1832 they established a new constitution, government and courts. In spring 1833, the Swiss Tagsatzung acknowledged the new canton, but insisted that they work toward reunification.|$|E

25|$|The <b>old</b> <b>core</b> of {{the empire}} was divided into three spheres of influence. Kangaba, the de facto capital of Manden {{since the time of}} the last emperor, became the capital of the {{northern}} sphere. The Joma area, governed from Siguiri, controlled the central region, which encompassed Niani. Hamana (or Amana), southwest of Joma, became the southern sphere, with its capital at Kouroussa in modern Guinea. Each ruler used the title of mansa, but their authority only extended as far as their own sphere of influence. Despite this disunity in the realm, the realm remained under Mandinka control into the mid-17th century. The three states warred with each other as much, if not more, than they did against outsiders, but rivalries generally stopped when faced with invasion. This trend would continue into colonial times against Tukulor enemies from the west.|$|E
25|$|To help {{break the}} {{political}} power of the Inner Cantons, Uri (without the Leventina but with the Urserental), Schwyz (without March and Höfe), both half-cantons of Unterwalden, Zug, the Republic of Gersau and Engelberg Abbey were merged into the canton of Waldstätten. The new canton only had 4 seats in the Tagsatzung instead of the 16 that its members had held before the invasion. Initially the victorious French army only lightly occupied the <b>old</b> <b>core</b> of the canton of Schwyz, but plundered the Einseideln Abbey. However, after a failed uprising in Nidwalden in the fall of 1798, Schwyz was forced to hand over all weapons and to provide supplies and housing to French troops. The heavy demands of the occupying French led to the uprising known as the Hirthemmli War in April 1799. After the French suppressed this uprising, they moved the capital of the canton of Waldstätten to Zug.|$|E

40|$|Growth {{potential}} of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants {{is influenced by}} seed-tuber age. After 24 days of growth, single-eye seedcores from 7 -month-old seed-tubers produced 64 % more foliar dry matter than those from 19 -month-old seed-tubers, reflecting a higher growth rate. This study was initiated to determine if differences in polyamine (PA) metabolism are associated with aging and age-reduced vigor of potato seed-tubers. As tubers aged in storage, putrescine (Put) increased 2. 2 -fold, while spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) decreased 33 % and 38 %, respectively. Ethylene content of the tuber tissue also increased with advancing age, suggesting that during the aging process S-adenosylmethionine was directed toward ethylene biosynthesis {{at the expense of}} the PAs. Single-eye cores from 7 - and 19 -month-old tubers were sown and PA levels in core and shoot tissues were monitored during plant development. Put titer of younger cores increased 8. 8 -fold by 12 days. In contrast, the increase in Put over the initial titer in <b>older</b> <b>cores</b> was 2. 9 -fold. The reduced ability of <b>older</b> <b>cores</b> to synthesize Put during plant establishment is probably due to a 45 % decline in ornithine decarboxylase activity between 12 and 16 days after planting. Lack of available Put substrate limited the biosynthesis of Spd and Spm, and thus their concentrations remained lower in <b>older</b> <b>cores</b> than in younger cores. Lower PA titer in <b>older</b> <b>cores</b> during plant establishment is thus coincident with reduced growth potential. Concentrations of Put and Spd were higher in shoots developing from <b>older</b> <b>cores</b> throughout the study, but there was no age-related difference in Spm content. In contrast, activities of arginine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases were higher in shoots from younger cores during establishment. The results indicate that aging affects PA metabolism in both tuber and developing plant tissues, and this may relate to loss of growth potential with advancing seed-tuber age...|$|R
