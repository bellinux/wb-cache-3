40|$|Three {{laboratory}} experiments {{were carried out}} to study the biodegradation of <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> herbicide (Goal) in a soil with no history of pesticides application at two temperatures (28 and 40 C) {{with or without the}} addition of mineral fertilizers (NPK). Different concentrations of <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> were applied to the soil samples and the herbicide residue was determined using Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC) at 0 time and then at 15 days intervals for 45 days. Various genera of microorganisms were isolated on different semi-selective media from soils treated with different concentrations of <b>Oxyfluorfen.</b> The ability of these isolates to utilize <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> as a sole source of carbon and energy was studied. Results indicated that biodegradation of <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> in soil incubated at 40 C after 45 days of incubation was better (55. 2 - 78. 3 %) than in soil incubated at 28 C (17. 5 - 36. 6 %). Addition of mineral fertilizers (NPK) increased the biodegradation of <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> in soils. Intensive degradation (27. 8 - 55. 5 %) was observed in NPK fertilized soils incubated at 40 C after 15 days of incubation at all <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> concentrations. Ten potential <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> degraders were identified. Results obtained showed that within 21 days, Bacillus spp. had the ability to degrade 80 - 95. 6 % of <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> followed by Pseudomonas sp. (82. 2 %), Arthrobacter spp. (82. 2 %), Aspergillus sp. (77. 8 %), Mycobacterium sp. (75. 6 %), Micrococcus sp. (73. 3 %) and Streptomyces sp. (68. 9 %). It could be concluded that biodegradation of <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> in soils is significantly affected by temperature and the microbial species. These microorganisms are considered as potential candidates for use in any program aiming at decontamination of <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> polluted sites...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of the p-nitrodiphenyl ether herbicides has remained ambiguous because of conflicting reports in the literature. The diphenyl ether herbicide <b>oxyfluorfen</b> causes a light induced consumption of oxygen which resembles the electron acceptor reaction of paraquat. However, this reaction is not linked to the transport of electrons through photosystem I. This conclusion {{is based on the}} observation that the rate of oxygen consumption, in the presence of <b>oxyfluorfen,</b> does not demonstrate a first order rate dependence on light intensity. Using the bleaching of N,N-dimethyl p-nitrosoaniline as a specific detector of singlet oxygen, we demonstrate that <b>oxyfluorfen</b> is a potent generator of this toxic radical. The production of singlet oxygen occurs in the presence of inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport (<b>oxyfluorfen</b> at 10 − 4 molar and paraquat) and also under temperature conditions (3 °C) which prevent electron transport. This light induced reaction results in oxygen consumption and is the primary cause of lethality for <b>oxyfluorfen.</b> The production of singlet oxygen occurs rapidly and at low herbicide concentrations (10 − 9 molar). The reaction occurs without photosynthetic electron transport but does require an intact thylakoid membrane...|$|E

Embora os herbicidas diuron, <b>oxyfluorfen</b> e prometryne sejam opções para uso nessa cultura, há informações limitadas referentes à eficácia desses herbicidas no controle de Euphorbia heterophylla. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi determinar a curva de dose-resposta de diuron, <b>oxyfluorfen</b> e prometryne para o controle de E. heterophylla, bem como analisar a eficiência biológica de misturas desses herbicidas no manejo dessa espécie. O trabalho foi composto por seis experimentos conduzidos simultaneamente em casa de vegetação, sendo três deles com doses crescentes de cada herbicida aplicado isoladamente e três compostos por misturas dos herbicidas dois a dois. A curva de dose-resposta foi ajustada para os dados das avaliações de porcentagem de redução de massa seca aos 28 dias após a aplicação. Determinoaram-se as doses I 80 e I 95, que correspondem ao controle de 80 % e 95 %, respectivamente, de controle visual ou redução da massa seca.

Although herbicides, such as diuron, <b>oxyfluorfen</b> and prometryn, are options for this crop, not much is known about their effect on Euphorbia heterophylla. This work aimed to elaborate dose-response curves for diuron, <b>oxyfluorfen</b> and prometryn in relation to E. heterophylla control, as well as to provide biological efficiency data for tank mixtures of these herbicides. Thus, six experiments were simultaneously carried out under greenhouse conditions, with three consisting of increasing doses of each herbicide applied isolated and three of tank mixtures of two herbicides.

However, even selective, herbicides can trigger the production of reactive species of oxygen and cause oxidative stress. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate changes in photosynthetic parameters, oxidative damage, antioxidant enzyme activity and altered metabolism of rice plants after applying pre-emergent herbicides. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse and herbicides used were oxadiazon, pendimethalin and <b>oxyfluorfen,</b> beyond the control without herbicide. There was a reduction of photosynthetic rate and efficiency of carboxylation, compared to the control, when applied herbicides <b>oxyfluorfen</b> and pendimethalin. The major lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation was observed for the herbicide <b>oxyfluorfen.</b> The <b>oxyfluorfen</b> and oxadiazon herbicides also resulted in increased activity of superoxide dismutase, compared to control. When evaluated ascorbate peroxidase activity, there was a higher enzyme activity in plants treated with oxadiazon and pendimethalin.

A monitoring study of two herbicides (terbuthylazine and <b>oxyfluorfen)</b> in the first 2 cm of soil, runoff water and sediment yield, was carried out after several rainfall events. Terbuthylazine was monitored in spring and winter seasons, whereas <b>oxyfluorfen</b> was monitored only in winter season. At the end of the experiment, no terbuthylazine soil residues were recovered from the winter application (107 days after application) whereas 15 % of terbuthylazine applied in spring still remained (85 days after application) in the soil. <b>Oxyfluorfen</b> was more persistent than terbuthylazine and 48 % of this applied herbicide remaining in the soil {{at the end of the}} winter (107 days after application). Very low percentage of the applied terbuthylazine was recovered in runoff water, although it was slightly higher in winter (0. 53 %) than in spring (0. 16 %). No differences in terbuthylazine sediment yields between both seasons were observed. Due to the low water solubility of <b>oxyfluorfen,</b> very low amounts of this herbicide was recovered in runoff waters, whereas in sediment yields 39. 5 % of the total applied herbicide was recovered. These data show that the dissipation of terbuthylazine due to runoff is low and it could be related to other soil processes like leaching and degradation, whereas <b>oxyfluorfen</b> dissipation is more affected by runoff processes, being mainly either co-transported in sediment yields or tagged to soil aggregates. These results show that the fate of terbuthylazine and <b>oxyfluorfen</b> depends partially on seasonal and environmental conditions, mainly on the rainfall events, but also, and even at larger extension, on the physicochemical character of the herbicide moleculesPeer Reviewe...|$|E

Dessa forma, objetivou-se avaliar a lixiviação dos herbicidas sulfentrazone, {{isoxaflutole}} e <b>oxyfluorfen</b> no perfil de três solos. As doses de 0, 5 e 0, 75 kg ha- 1 de sulfentrazone, 0, 113 e 0, 169 kg ha- 1 de isoxaflutole e 0, 72 e 1, 08 kg ha- 1 de <b>oxyfluorfen</b> foram aplicadas na superfície de colunas de PVC de 30 cm de altura preenchidas com três solos: um franco-arenoso e dois argilosos com teores alto (9, 0 dag kg- 1) e baixo (4, 4 dag kg- 1) de matéria orgânica. Após a aplicação, foram simuladas duas chuvas de 40 mm cada, com intervalo de 24 horas, respeitando o período de infiltração em cada solo. A lixiviação dos herbicidas ao longo do perfil dos solos foi verificada pelo método de bioensaio utilizando plantas de sorgo (Sorghum bicolor). A atividade herbicida do sulfentrazone e a movimentação no perfil dos solos foram elevadas na maior dose aplicada. A maior movimentação descendente do produto, na dose de 0, 75 kg ha- 1 de sulfentrazone, foi constatada no solo de textura franco-arenosa até 27, 5 cm, seguido pelos solos de textura argilosa com baixo e alto teor de matéria orgânica até 25 e 17, 5 cm, respectivamente. Verificou-se elevado potencial de lixiviação do isoxaflutole, ultrapassando a profundidade de 22, 5 cm nos três solos estudados e nas duas doses aplicadas, diferentemente do <b>oxyfluorfen,</b> que permaneceu adsorvido nas camadas superficiais dos solos. Ao comparar os solos, maior atividade herbicida e movimentação ocorreram naquele de textura franco-arenosa. Em relação aos herbicidas, o isoxaflutole apresentou maior mobilidade do que o sulfentrazone, enquanto o <b>oxyfluorfen</b> mostrou baixo potencial de lixiviação. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate herbicide leaching in three soil profiles. Doses of 0. 50 and 0. 75 kg ha- 1 sulfentrazone, 0. 113 and 0. 169 kg ha- 1 isoxaflutole, and 0. 72 and 1. 08 kg ha- 1 <b>oxyfluorfen</b> were applied on the surface of 30 cm high PVC columns filled with the three soil following types: one with a sandy loam texture and two clayey ones with low and high organic matter contents. After applying these herbicides, the columns were submitted to two rounds of 40 mm - simulated rain with a 24 h interval between them. Herbicide leaching was detected by bioassay method using sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) plants. Both the activity and movement of the herbicide sulfentrazone in the soil profile increased after application of the highest dose. After application of 0. 75 kg ha- 1 of sulfentrazone, the highest downward movement was observed in the sandy loam soil, down to 27. 5 cm, followed by the clayey soils with low and high organic matter contents, down to 25. 0 and 17. 5 cm, respectively. A high leaching potential was observed of isoxaflutole, which exceeded 22. 5 cm in depth for the three soils and both doses studied.

Unweeded control accounted for lower bulb yield which inturn reflected through higher weed index of 60. 6 and 56. 1 per cent, respectively during both the years, due to heavy competition of weeds for nutrients, space and light. </p...|$|E
40|$|Alfalfa(Medicago sativa) {{is one of}} {{important}} legume forages worldwide. However, weed is the main factor limiting alfalfa production. Biomass quality and yield and stability of dry matter production during cultivation are directly associated with the interference of weeds which compete with alfalfa for water, light and nutrients. The use of herbicides is a good alternative for weed control. In order to control weed in alfalfa field with suitable herbicide in Yellow River delta, the effect of four herbicides(imazethapyr, quizalofop-p-ethyl, haloxyfop-r-methyl and <b>oxyfluorfen)</b> with different concentration on afalfal yield and weed community characteristics were studied. The results showed that both imazethapyr and haloxyfop-r-methyl treatments could increase alfalfa yield, and the best herbicide application concentration was imazethapyr with 2 000 mL·hm- 2 and haloxyfop-r-methyl with 700 mL·hm- 2, but <b>oxyfluorfen</b> treatment would limit alfalfa growth significantly.
