The trunnions were supported by box-girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside trunnion posts were braced by a girder ran both between them and to the operating mechanism. Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the operating mechanism for the bridge. The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used reduction gears and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge. A manual-operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway, but it was later paved over. The <b>operator's</b> <b>house</b> was located on the south side of the western approach, it originally <b>housed</b> the <b>operator's</b> <b>house</b> and public bathrooms, but it was removed in 1936.

50|$|Portumna bridge lies east of {{the town}} of Portumna, in County Galway, Ireland. It is a five-span road bridge, which carries the N65 across the River Shannon to Lehinch in County Tipperary. The present bridge was {{designed}} by C. E. Stanier of London, and completed in 1911, with a central section resting on Hayes's Island which divides the river into two channels. The structure of the main bridge, consisting of steel girders supported by concrete filled cast iron cylinders, and the pivoting swing bridge over the navigation channel, are of technical and engineering interest. The house on Hayes Island, accessed from the bridge, was the bridge <b>operators</b> <b>house</b> and pre-dates the present bridge.The opening section was replaced in October 2008.|$|R

50|$|The bridge has {{two towers}} that rise an {{additional}} 65 feet (20 m) above the 35-foot (10.7 m) tall {{structure of the}} bridge's trusses, a 134-foot-long (41 m) center lift span, and a total length of 722 feet (220 m), excluding the 850-foot (260 m) timber trestle on the western end. The bridge's five spans sit atop five concrete piers designed to rise 35 feet (10.7 m) above mean low water, which was intended to hold the rails 5 feet (1.5 m) above the highest possible flood waters. The lift span was {{designed to provide a}} 55-foot (16.8 m) clearance during high water conditions. The lift span has been inoperable since 1980, and sometime after 1980 the <b>operator's</b> <b>house</b> - which sat atop the lift span - was removed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hull of the}} HB.5 was 17 m {{long and}} had a maximum width of 2.80 m. The forward planing hull had soft chine, ending at a single step under the wings. Entirely {{mahogany}} covered, the hull was divided internally into seven compartments. The bow compartment contained mooring gear and the pilot and co-pilot sat side-by-side in an open cockpit in the second. The flight engineer sat in another open cockpit in the third compartment, just behind the pilots. The fourth compartment contained the passenger cabin, [...] "luxuriously furnished" [...] for ten passengers and provided two large, glazed portholes for viewing. Cabin access was via a starboard side gangplank and the engineer's position. Their baggage, together with sacks of air-mail, was stored in the sixth compartment and the wireless <b>operator</b> <b>housed</b> in the seventh.|$|R
50|$|For {{much of the}} plant's history, {{it served}} {{as the center of}} a small community. Because of its remote location, rugged landscape, and {{primitive}} transportation, the only practical way to operate the plant was to have employees on site. The utility company employed one chief-operator and two assistant <b>operators,</b> <b>housed</b> in three frame cottages. In addition, a school teacher was hired to tutor children. A two story wood frame hotel was built around 1905 to house company officials, construction workers and other visitors. A section of the hotel was used as a classroom. Employment for the plant reached its peak between 1906 and the mid-1920s. Once the plant became automated by 1978, the cottages were demolished in order to discourage squatters from living there.The Power Plant was placed on The National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 1988.|$|R
50|$|The {{final section}} of the parkway, between Main Street in Everett and the Fellsway, was built between 1903 and 1905. This stretch {{included}} three significant bridges: two across railroad tracks, and one across the Malden River. The railroad bridges were of steel girder construction, and the Malden Street bridge was a drawbridge. The first of these bridges, across the B&M Saugus Branch line, is now used by the Poirer Memorial Roadway, and the parkway crosses {{the right of way}} on a modern six-lane bridge. The second, the Malden River drawbridge, is a double-leaf simple trunnion bridge built in 1954 to replace the earlier drawbridge. The drawbridge is no longer used, but the <b>operator's</b> <b>house</b> still survives. The third bridge, which now crosses the MBTA Orange Line as well as commuter rail lines, was replaced in 1956 with a modern six-lane bridge.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The thru truss rim-bearing swing span {{bridge on}} an ashlar {{substructure}} was erected in 1906 by the Owego Bridge Co. It is of riveted construction {{with the exception}} of the center tower, which has pinned top chords composed of stamped eye bars. The bridge has been altered. In 1985 the operating machinery and <b>operator's</b> <b>house</b> located above the roadway were removed. The flooring system was replaced, and additional section was bolted onto some verticals and diagonals. However, the changes do not preclude the individual eligibility of this structure for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion C as a representative example of a through truss rim-bearing span. All of the key visual elements of the bridge- the trusses by the Owego Bridge Company, the center pier, the wheels that run on a track making it a rim- bearing span, and the ashlar abutments retain integrity.
