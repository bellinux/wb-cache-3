Steve, not wanting a lawyer to take any of the million dollars he expects to win from the case, decides to act as one for the two families.

Next, Steve shows Peggy and Al's tape, which ends after a few seconds.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} ways in which various powerful groups used different genres of <b>opening</b> <b>statements</b> to create and control the version of the reality of a high stakes situation, namely, the April 20, 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. Specifically, in the dissertation I identify and analyze the features and rhetorical moves that typify the genres of legal and non-legal <b>opening</b> <b>statements,</b> and focus on the communicative dynamics that define interactions between speakers and audiences in court <b>opening</b> <b>statements,</b> Congressional <b>opening</b> <b>statements,</b> and public press conference statements. I use critical discourse analysis and genre analysis to pinpoint the rhetorical moves used in each genre of <b>opening</b> <b>statements.</b> I make the claim that legal court <b>opening</b> <b>statements</b> use epideictic rhetoric to convince decision makers to act in a particular way. I also make visible the connections that exist between technical and professional communicators and the development of corporate business texts, focusing particularly on positive changes needed in the field, including increased participation in the construction of texts for businesses, and need for using their experience, expertise and ethics t...|$|R

5|$|Shakur {{was indicted}} on May 30, 1974, on {{the charge of}} having robbed a Brooklyn bar and {{kidnapping}} bartender James E. Freeman for ransom. Shakur and co-defendant Ronald Myers were accused of entering the bar with pistols and shotguns, taking $50 from the register, kidnapping the bartender, leaving a note demanding a $20,000 ransom from the bar owner, and fleeing in a rented truck. Freeman {{was said to have}} later escaped unhurt. The text of Shakur's <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> in the trial is reproduced in her autobiography. Shakur and co-defendant Ronald Myers were acquitted on December 19, 1975 after seven hours of jury deliberation, ending a three-month trial in front of Judge William Thompson.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

5000|$|Opening {{statements}} in the new trial began on November 5, 2007, but quickly resulted in a mistrial. Prior to the <b>opening</b> <b>statements,</b> the defense requested that the judge bar prosecutors from commenting on Lee’s previous conviction in 1994. However, the prosecution noted in <b>opening</b> <b>statements</b> that Lee told deputies during the 2004 incident he had [...] "been through this before and beat it". The district attorney’s office planned to bring the case back to Floyd Superior Court the following year. [...] At this point, the CBLDF had spent over $80,000 on Lee's defense.|$|R
5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> to the jury, was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she {{attempted}} to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} bodies continued, but with winter setting {{in it was}} called off in November. Presented with the {{evidence}} of the tape recording, Brady admitted to taking the photographs of Lesley Ann Downey, but insisted that she had been brought to Wardle Brook Avenue by two men who had subsequently taken her away again, alive. Brady was further charged with the murder of John Kilbride, and Hindley with the murder of Edward Evans, on 2 December. At the committal hearing on 6 December, Brady was charged with the murders of Edward Evans, John Kilbride, and Lesley Ann Downey, and Hindley with the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey, as well as with harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had killed John Kilbride. The prosecution's <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> was held in camera, and the defence asked for a similar stipulation, but was refused. The proceedings continued in front of three magistrates in Hyde over an 11-day period during December, {{at the end of which}} the pair were committed for trial at Chester Assizes.|$|E

Cochran also added that although the evidence to be presented would not conclusively show that Cherry had actually planted or ignited the bomb, the combined evidence would illustrate that he had aided and abetted in the commission of the act.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} with opening {{statements}} by Theodore Olson and San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Therese Stewart for the plaintiffs.

Charles J. Cooper made an <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> for the defendants, saying that marriage had been universally limited to opposite-sex couples.

In Mock Trial, this deviation allows each team {{to have the opportunity}} to speak first, one for <b>opening</b> <b>statements</b> and one for closing arguments. Barring any disputes being raised, the second closing argument marks the conclusion of the trial, and the jury is dismissed to tally points.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecutors}} at Collins' trial, William Delhey and Booker Williams, {{opted to}} charge Collins {{only with the}} murder of Karen Sue Beineman, with the state contending that she had been murdered by Collins {{in the basement of the}} Leik household. In his <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> to the jury on July 20, Delhey outlined the prosecution's contention that the evidence to be presented would form a clear pattern indicating that Collins had been in the company of Karen Sue Beineman at the time she was last seen alive by Mrs. Joan Goshe and her assistant; that he had taken her to the home of his own uncle, where he had tortured and beaten the girl before strangling her to death at this location; and that he had then discarded her body, before attempting to persuade his roommate to provide him with a false alibi. The two primary questions before the jury, Delhey stated, would be the accuracy of eyewitnesses who would be called to testify and, ultimately, whether the more than 500 hair samples found upon Beineman's panties matched the hair clippings later recovered from the basement of Collins' uncle. Delhey also stated the prosecution's intent to prove that Collins had had sole access to his uncle's home and basement on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance, and although he had made concerted efforts to remove physical evidence from the crime scene, blood samples recovered from this location were a match for the blood type of the victim. Delhey formally closed his <b>opening</b> <b>statement</b> to the jury by requesting they return a verdict of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.|$|E

John McCain (R., Ariz.), the committee’s ranking Republican, in his <b>opening</b> <b>statement.</b> “Two banks and a handful of hedge funds developed a complex financial structure to engage in highly profitable trades while claiming an unjustified lower tax rate and avoiding limits on trading with borrowed money,” said Sen.
