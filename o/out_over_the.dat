Women who did not produce sons were not inscribed and were thus forgotten from family memory.|$|E

5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the launch}} site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the {{majority}} of the system was built above ground in a single-floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner of the roof, with two sides angled back to form a half-pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> water which was only a few tens of meters from the building. Illeginni did not have a radar site; it was operated remotely from Meck.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the underdrawing {{shows that}} the artist {{intended}} a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting. He heavily reworked {{the positions of the}} three main figures even towards the end of completion. The draperies of the mantles were at first larger. Christ's body at first faced Luke, but was later tilted in the direction of his mother. The mother and child were brought closer together. Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above. The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures looking <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> river were smaller, the river itself narrower.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{anticipation}} of a more westerly track on September23, a hurricane watch was issued for the northwestern Bahamas, later superseded by a warning, and a hurricane warning was declared for eastern Cuba. Early on September24, all watches and warnings for the Caribbean Islands, including the Bahamas, were discontinued as Emily moved <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean. On September25, a special advisory was issued for Bermuda as tropical storm-force winds were likely to impact the island. Following the unexpected intensification, another special advisory was issued stating that hurricane-force winds would impact the island during the day on September25. This advisory was discontinued following the storms' passage later that day.|$|E
