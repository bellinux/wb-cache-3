5|$|Burrow Mump, {{an ancient}} {{earthwork}} {{owned by the}} National Trust, is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl, standing at a strategic point where the River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett.

50|$|At the war hearing, Danckwardt {{was asked}} why he had not contributed more {{to the defense of}} the {{northern}} inlet <b>outworks.</b> The two <b>outworks</b> could have defended each other by cross fire and he could have sent one of the seven professional officers from Carlsten to act as a commander. Danckwardt defended himself by saying that he could not afford to send away even more personnel from Carlsten and that the men would have been cut off if the <b>outworks</b> were conquered.|$|R

5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery {{was added}} near Tigné Point, Sliema. The battery {{was funded by}} the Manoel Foundation and it was {{considered}} to be an <b>outwork</b> of Fort Manoel, since it was intended to prevent an enemy from bombarding the fort's northern flank. It was decommissioned following the construction of Fort Tigné in 1795. The construction of the latter fort was also partially funded by the Manoel Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with a mound and an outer {{enclosure}} defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an <b>outwork</b> reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop of rock, and could have acted as a motte.|$|E
5|$|In April 1863, {{the fort}} was {{named in honor}} of the {{recently}} deceased Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed on December 13, 1862, at the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the time of its dedication, the fort was roughly complete. Round in shape and surrounded by trenches and abati, the fort's guns faced north, overlooking River Road. A service road crossed the trenches in the southern half of the fort, connecting with River Road behind the fort. Rifle pits extended northeast to Fort Reno and southwest to Fort Simmons. A small battery of guns, named Battery Bayard, was an <b>outwork</b> of the fort and covered a blind spot in the ravine to the northwest of the fort.|$|E

50|$|Kontraskjæret is {{proximate}} to the Akershus Fortress, {{and was the}} location for <b>outworks</b> for Escarpe du Nord (Contre éscarpe), part of the fortifications from early 1600s. The <b>outworks</b> were demolished in the 19th century. The area had stables for the artillery and cavallery from the 1860s. In the early 1900s, there were plans for designing an Opera house at Kontraskjæret.|$|R
5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to <b>outwork</b> opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010–11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his children when they watch him play.|$|E
5|$|Rain {{interrupted}} the siege, but on 21March, immediately south of Krak des Chevaliers, Baibar's forces captured a triangular <b>outwork</b> possibly defended by a timber palisade. On 29March, the attackers undermined a tower {{in the southwest}} corner causing it to collapse whereupon Baibars' army attacked through the breach. In the outer ward they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle. Though the outer ward had fallen, {{with a handful of}} the garrison killed in the process, the Crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli, which granted permission for them to surrender. Although the letter was a forgery, the garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives. The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward. The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two mihrabs (prayer niches) were added to the interior.|$|E

Another curtain wall at right-angles runs down to the sea close to the landing-place, ending in a ruined round tower, whose vaulted base has poorly splayed and apparently rather unskillfully constructed embrasures. The entrance passes through this <b>outwork</b> wall close to where it joins the other.|$|E

60|$|The fort was oval in shape, {{and about}} nine hundred yards across, at its {{greatest}} diameter. It was defended by a broad rampart, strengthened by thirty semicircular bastions and five <b>outworks.</b> The two gates, one at each end, were also protected by <b>outworks.</b> In the fort stood the splendid palace built by Tippoo. Here also were immense foundries of cannon, factories for muskets, the arsenal, and large magazines of grain and ammunition.|$|R
25|$|The defences of the {{fortress}} {{at that time}} consisted of a stone wall 28 feet high and 14 feet thick, with seven towers. Near the northeastern part of {{the fortress}} was a castle, which itself consisted of a stone wall and three towers. The main defence of the fortress was the Neva river itself, along with Lake Ladoga, which together encircled the entire fort. On the right bank of the Neva, about 3,000 yards (1.5 miles) from the main fort, there was a separate fortification, consisting of a sconce-type <b>outwork,</b> where a regiment was garrisoned to assist with communication with the main fort and transportation across the river.|$|E
25|$|The {{siege of}} Bellegarde and its {{garrison}} of 1,536 French soldiers began on 23 May. The garrison's firepower included at least 41 cannon and seven mortars. The 6,000 Spanish besiegers and 34 cannon first concentrated {{their efforts on}} reducing two outworks {{on the north side}} of the main fort. The French Émigré Vallespir battalion fought alongside the Spanish. By 30 May, Ricardos had sited 16 guns in batteries at a distance of 1,200 paces from Fort les Bains. On 3 June, 350 Frenchmen surrendered the <b>outwork</b> after a bombardment. Two days later, the Fort de la Garde fell after its water supply was cut off, and 200 more French soldiers became prisoners of war. While siege operations proceeded, 3,350 Frenchmen tried to escort a supply convoy to the fortress but were driven off on 29 May.|$|E
25|$|Another runanga {{was held}} before dawn on 2 April and again Tupotahi {{urged them to}} break out. Though many of the chiefs {{remained}} steadfast in their refusal to retreat, Rewi insisted {{the effect of the}} water shortage was now so severe they had to break out, but urged they go out fighting. The plan was aborted when dawn broke and the fog lifted, removing their cover. Through the morning the British sap advanced close enough to the outer trenches of Ōrākau for hand-grenades to be thrown over the ramparts. At noon Cameron arrived with more men, bringing the besieging imperial and colonial force to 1800. One of the Armstrong guns was moved {{to the head of the}} sap and fired at the <b>outwork</b> of the pa about 30 metres away, breaching the wall. Under the combination of shells, hand grenades and rifle fire, Māori casualties began to climb rapidly.|$|E

50|$|The Royal Walls {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the Sieges of Ceuta, which began in 1694. Whenever there was an interval in the fighting, the Spanish added more <b>outworks.</b> The siege was broken in 1720 after the arrival of a relief force, and the <b>outworks</b> were completely rebuilt at this stage. Ceuta was besieged again in 1721, but by now the fortifications were much stronger and the last Moorish attempt to take the city ended in 1734.|$|R
25|$|On 10 January 1809 Grandjean's troops {{captured}} a key <b>outwork,</b> the San José Convent. On 22 January Marshal Jean Lannes took {{command of the}} siege from Junot. On 27 January the light companies of Grandjean's 1st Brigade successfully stormed a breach in the city walls near the Palafox Battery and Musnier's division broke into the city in another place. Ordinarily, a lodgment within a city's walls would prompt the defenders to ask for terms, but the Spanish continued to fight behind barricaded houses and churches. Lannes determined to reduce the city building-by-building if necessary. Grandjean's division stormed the Santa Monica Convent on 30 January. Two days later the French overran the adjoining San Augustin Convent after a murderous struggle amid the pews of the convent church. That day, the 44th Line broke through the defenders and advanced {{to the center of}} the city but were then driven back nearly to their starting point after losing 200 men. Henceforth, Lannes decreed that the attackers must first consolidate their gains. As the French continued to edge forward street by street, covered by their plentiful artillery, the defense finally started to collapse. On 18 February, Grandjean's division seized the University and two days later the Spanish capitulated.|$|E
500|$|The work in 1755 {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} beginning {{construction on the}} main walls and on the Lotbinière redoubt, an <b>outwork</b> {{to the west of}} the site that provided additional coverage of the La Chute River. [...] The next year saw the building of the four main bastions and a sawmill on the La Chute. [...] Work slowed in 1757, when many of the troops prepared for and participated in the attack on Fort William Henry. The barracks and demi-lunes were not completed until spring 1758.|$|E

In addition to examining Fort Stanton, the commission analyzed two smaller works that supported Fort Stanton. Fort Ricketts was identified in the report as [...] "a battery intended to see the ravine in front of Fort Stanton, which it does but imperfectly," [...] while Fort Snyder [...] "may be regarded as an <b>outwork</b> to Fort Stanton, guarding the head of one branch of the ravine just mentioned. Except additional platforms for field guns, and a ditch in front of the gorge stockade, and blockhouses, nothing further seems necessary." ...|$|E
50|$|Parts of the walls, {{especially}} the <b>outworks,</b> were demolished {{to make way}} for urban development.
