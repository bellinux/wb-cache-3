40|$|For {{the third}} {{consecutive}} June [l, 21 heat and drought dominated the weather over the eastern two-thirds of the United States except for the northern tier of States, while abnormally cool, wet weather prevailed in the Far West (Charts I-B and III-B). On the other hand, the temperature and precipitation anomalies of this June were nearly opposite {{to those of the}} preceding month [3]. Table 1 illustrates this year-to-year persistence and month-to-month reversal for temperature. For example, 43 of the 76 stations which reported <b>above</b> (A) <b>or</b> much <b>above</b> (MA) normal temperatures in June 1952 also reported <b>above</b> <b>or</b> much <b>above</b> in June 1954. On the other hand, of the 21 stations which reported <b>above</b> <b>or</b> much <b>above</b> normal in May 1954 only 4 again reported <b>above</b> <b>or</b> much <b>above</b> in June 1954, but 13 reported below or much below. The precipitation patterns showed similar persistence and reversal, though not so neatly. Iowa was a notably exceptional area where the May-June reversal did not occur; instead, May rains were followed by June rains to produce record floods.
