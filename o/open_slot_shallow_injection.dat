40|$|Manure {{application}} to grassland and arable land {{is an important}} source of ammonia and nitrous oxide losses. For both gasses, national and international policies have been developed with the objective of reducing the emissions. Since the early 1990 s, measurements have been carried out in The Netherlands to assess the gaseous losses from manure application, especially for ammonia. Measurements of nitrous oxide emissions are relatively scarce. This paper presents the results of these measurements with the objective of providing an updated quantification of the effect of techniques for application and incorporation of manure, and to assess influencing factors. The manure application techniques differ in their spreading or placement of the manure onto the grass or soil surface or into the soil. The following techniques are treated in this paper: surface spreading, narrow-band application, <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> with <b>open</b> <b>slots</b> on grassland, and surface spreading, surface incorporation, deep placement on arable land. Low emission techniques such as narrow band application, <b>shallow</b> <b>injection,</b> incorporation or injection on arable land show a significant reduction of ammonia emission compared to surface spreading. On grassland, average emission factors (% of total ammonium nitrogen) were 74 % for surface spreading and 16 % for <b>shallow</b> <b>injection.</b> On arable land, the emission factors were 69 % for surface spreading and 2 % for deep placement. However, the nitrous oxide emission factor from manure applied with low ammonia emissions techniques is higher than the emission factor for surface applied manures. In a whole farm context, the higher nitrous oxide emission with <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> is partly offset directly by reduced emissions from fertiliser savings and indirectly from lower ammonia losses...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate different injection methods for slurry on ley established on various soils. In full-scale experiments the placements of the slurry as well as ammonia emissions and yields were measured after injection in <b>open</b> <b>slots</b> with three techniques: pressurised injec-tion (PI), <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> with V-shaped discs (SIO 1), and <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> with two angled discs (SIO 2). The performance between the injectors varied and only the SIO 2 was able to place the slurry in ley below soil surface on all three soil types. The ammonia release was on average halved after injection with SIO 2 compared to band spreading, however there was an average loss of 19 kg N ha- 1. A tine for <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> in closed <b>slots</b> (tubulator) was therefore developed. In small scale with single tines, the tubulator was compared to SIO 2 with regards to slurry placement, ammonia emissions and draught requirements. Ammonia losses after injection with the tubulator tine were only 1. 6 % of the total applied ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) compared to 27 % with the SIO 2. The draught requirement for the tubulator was roughly the same, or a little higher than the SIO 2 tine. In the full-scale experiments, the reduced loss of ammonia nitrogen with SIO 2 did not result in higher DM yield or higher nitrogen efficiency of the second cut as compared to band spreading...|$|R

Several sets of comparative measurements were made with each type of machine on both grassland and arable land (mostly cereal stubbles), covering a range of soil, crop and weather conditions. Measurements of NH 3 emissions were made for 5 – 7 days following application using a micrometeorological mass balance technique. Mean reductions in NH 3 emission achieved from grassland, in comparison with surface broadcast application, were 73, 57 and 26 % for <b>shallow</b> <b>injection,</b> {{trailing shoe}} and band spreading, respectively, the latter not being significant (probability P> 005). Mean cumulative emissions, expressed as % total ammoniacal N applied in the slurry, were 13, 12 and 35 % for <b>shallow</b> <b>injection,</b> trailing shoe and band spreading, respectively. There was a trend (probability P= 0029) for decreasing emissions with increasing sward height (between 10 and 20 cm) following trailing shoe applications.

40|$|Investigations into nitrate {{leaching}} from sludge and sludge injection into grassland have been undertaken for many years, however phosphate leaching from soils and <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> of sludge into grassland are relatively new ideas. This lysimeter study {{sets out to}} investigate {{the influence of the}} type of slurry and application rate on the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen lost by leaching. The field trial assesses the influence of application methods on grass yield, sward damage and ritrogen loss by leaching through analysing the effects on a grass crop using two different methods of injection and comparing them with surface application and granular fertilizer. Losses of P from sandy loam soils were found to be minimal therefore contamination of groundwater is thought to be unlikely. Similar leacling patterns were observed from both the cake and liquid sludges at all four rates_ applied, however the liquid sludge released more phosphate than the cake sludge, resulting in higher concentrations recorded. The lysimeter study also found leaching losses of ritrate from both sludge types to be well above the EC maximum permissible level of 11. 3 mg nitrate-N l`l at all four rates. Residual N from the previously cropped soil masked the nitrate concentrations during the initial stages of the study. Losses of N from the cake sludge was lower than from the liquid treated plots due to slow release. It was also found that environmental factors such as high temperatures and rainfall influence {{nitrate leaching}}. The field trial analysed various disposal methods in terms of nitrate leached, crop yield and sward damage. N losses from <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> were reduced compared to the deep injection plots, as the sludge was placed in closer proximity to the crop roots. Olibhe Collins, Silsoe College, 1996.

A database of field measurements in the Netherlands was analysed to identify factors affecting the volatilization from manure applied to grassland by various techniques, and to quantify their effects. The application techniques were broadcast surface spreading, narrow-band application, and <b>shallow</b> <b>injection.</b> External factors considered were weather conditions, manure characteristics, soil type and soil moisture content, and grass height. Narrow-band application and <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> significantly reduced NH 3 volatilization, compared with broadcast surface spreading.

The volatilization rate increased with an increase in TAN content of the manure, manure application rate, wind speed, radiation, or air temperature. It decreased with an increase in the relative humidity. The identified influencing factors and their magnitude differed with the application technique.

Different methods of slurry application to land exist; some spread the slurry to the sward surface whereas others deliver the slurry under the sward and into the soil, thus helping to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the impact of two slurry application methods (surface broadcast versus <b>shallow</b> <b>injection)</b> on the survival of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) delivered via dairy slurry to replicated grassland plots across contrasting seasons. A significant increase in FIO persistence (measured by the half-life of E.  coli and intestinal enterococci) was observed when slurry was applied to grassland via <b>shallow</b> <b>injection,</b> and FIO decay rates were significantly higher for FIOs applied to grassland in spring relative to summer and autumn. Significant differences in the behaviour of E.  coli and intestinal enterococci over time were also observed, with E.  coli half-lives influenced more strongly by season of application relative to the intestinal enterococci population. While <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> of slurry can reduce agricultural GHG emissions to air it can also prolong the persistence of FIOs in soil, potentially increasing the risk of their subsequent transfer to water.

Grassland management systems at Drogeham and Harkema contrasted in manure application technique (surface application versus <b>shallow</b> <b>injection,</b> respectively), quality of applied manure (slurry + MX: slurry with Euromestmix® clay mineral additive versus regular slurry), and some relevant site characteristics (high versus low soil organic matter content and soil moisture supply). Effects of manure types and application techniques, and treatment of the soil with a micro-organism supplement, were tested in a factorial experiment at the two sites, two blocks per site, one with and one without additional application of 157 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 inorganic fertilizer. Apparent N recovery was higher after <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> than after surface application. For plots receiving no additional inorganic fertilizer, this difference was largest for slurry + MX applied at site Harkema, since this slurry-site combination resulted in the highest observed average apparent N recovery following <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> (47 %) and the lowest N recovery following surface application (20 %). For plots receiving additional inorganic fertilizer N the contrasts between treatments were less pronounced. Year effects on N uptake and dry matter production could be related to cumulative temperature and precipitation surplus over the growing season. A simple comparison between the grassland management systems was carried out based on the response curves derived from the experiment. This demonstrated that the grassland system where slurry was applied by <b>shallow</b> <b>injection</b> is not necessarily the lowest in actual amount of N not accounted for (i. e., potentially lost). The efficiency of the Harkema system strongly depended on high N recovery, but showed high potential losses in some years and a high herbage crude protein content in other years, due to the low DM production capacity. On the other hand, the Drogeham system was tuned to high DM production and was characterized by higher system stability, as reflected by more stable relationships between DM production and N not accounted for and herbage crude protein content. These differences between the systems were probably to a large extent caused by differences in water balance and soil organic matter content...|$|R
