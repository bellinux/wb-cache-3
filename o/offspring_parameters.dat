Time to delivery of the first litter, litter parameters, maternal inflammation and histopathology of lung and liver were recorded. In male offspring, locomotor activity, startle response, and daily sperm production (DSP) were assessed.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{mathematical}} model which described the 'global evolution' of human population. We {{are interested in the}} evolution of the genealogical structure of population, i. e. our model describes the nearness of individuals in the generalogical sense. The basic objects of this model are generalogical trees. As any mathematical model, our model is based on the idealization of real situation: we consider the ideal generalogical trees of the infinite length which contain all (possible) progency of an individual. We study the evolution processes on the configuration space of generalogical trees. To describe this evolution, we use some kind of the ergodicity postulate and reduce the time-dynamics to a dynamical system on the space of generalogical trees. It is very natural to describe genealogical trees by so-called p-adic numbers where p is the <b>offspring</b> <b>parameter.</b> Therefore, we can apply the theory of p-adic dynamical systems.

Population dynamics of rotifers help to optimize culture conditions, and to understand selection of asexual and sexual reproduction types.

The following demographic parameters were analyzed: intrinsic rate of increase (r), net reproductive rate (R 0), generation time (T), average lifespan (L), and the total percentage of mictic females in the offspring. The results showed that there were significant effects of strain on the parameters except for R 0.

40|$|Considering {{that the}} energy balance can be {{affected}} by factors such as pregnancy and food restriction and {{that the development of}} foetuses is different during different periods of pregnancy, the aim of this paper was to study the effects on the maternal and offspring energy balance of food restriction imposed at different periods of pregnancy. Pregnant and non-pregnant rats were subjected to four food intake treatments. Control groups received food ad libitum during the 20 days of the experiment. the other three groups were food restricted by receiving 50 % of the control group food intake during the first half, the second half, or the whole experimental period. Food restriction imposed {{during the first half of}} the experimental period permitted a recuperation of energy intake, but compared to the control group, the rats gained less energy in the body. the <b>offspring</b> <b>parameters</b> studied were not affected by food restriction during the first half of the experimental period. Food restriction during the second half was more deleterious to the dams and to the offspring, which were born with less energy and weight. When food restriction was applied during the whole experimental period, the impairment in energy balance of offspring was similar to the one observed when food restriction occurred during the second half of pregnancy added to a decreased number of offspring. the dams, however, were more deeply affected than when food restriction was applied during the first half of the experimental period.

30|$|Previous {{systematic}} reviews {{examining the}} role of prenatal exercise on offspring outcomes have been conducted with heterogeneous results and the interpretation of their findings are limited for several reasons: (1) the primary outcome of interest for previous systematic reviews varied (birth weight or large-for-gestational age (LGA) status); (2) inclusion criteria were variable (types of exercise targeted; inclusion of diet as an intervention; type and number of databases queried; low quality study designs); (3) there were flaws in methodological rigor (type of analysis, pooling heterogeneous studies together); and (4) few evaluated health outcomes in offspring beyond birth weight. The reviews that found a reduction in birth weight (from −[*] 440  g, 95 % confidence interval [CI] −[*] 610 to −[*] 270  g [18], to −[*] 31  g, 95 %CI −[*] 57 to −[*] 24  g [19], compared to sedentary controls) or LGA status after exposure to prenatal exercise pooled randomized trials and observational studies [18], included interventions that combined exercise and dietary changes [20], or used fixed effect models {{to analyze the data}} [19]. Fixed effect models assume that one true effect size is shared by all the included studies regardless of the population or type of exercise studied. Thus, utilizing a fixed effects model considers less variability in the primary studies, and is more likely to reach statistical significance with a large enough sample size [21]. Random effect models should, thus, be preferred when dealing with complex physiological conditions like the effect of different prenatal exercises undergone by different populations on <b>offspring</b> <b>parameters.</b> Other reviews [12, 22, 23] did not find any significant impact of prenatal exercise on birth weight, but were also limited by their specific scope [12, 23] or restricted search strategy [22].|$|E

40|$|High-fecundity organisms, such as Atlantic cod, can {{withstand}} substantial natural selection and the entailing genetic load of replacing alleles {{at a number}} of loci due to their excess reproductive capacity. High-fecundity organisms may reproduce by sweepstakes leading to highly skewed heavy-tailed offspring distribution. Under such reproduction the Kingman coalescent of binary mergers breaks down and models of multiple merger coalescent are more appropriate. Here we study nucleotide variation at the Ckma (Creatine Kinase Muscle type A) gene in Atlantic cod. The gene shows extreme differentiation between the North (Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Barents Sea) and the South (Faroe Islands, North-, Baltic-, Celtic-, and Irish Seas) with FST > 0. 8 between regions whereas neutral loci show no differentiation. This is evidence of natural selection. The protein sequence is conserved by purifying selection whereas silent and non-coding sites show extreme differentiation. The unfolded site-frequency spectrum has three modes, a mode at singleton sites and two high frequency modes at opposite frequencies representing divergent branches of the gene genealogy that is evidence for balancing selection. Analysis with multiple-merger coalescent models can account for the high frequency of singleton sites and indicate reproductive sweepstakes.

It was observed that adult male offspring displayed symptoms similar to the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome. A combination of sperm transcriptome and methylome data analysis allowed to detect a long-lasting DEHP-induced and robust promoter methylation-associated silencing of almost the entire cluster of the seminal vesicle secretory proteins and antigen genes, which are known to play a fundamental role in sperm physiology. It also resulted in the detection of a DEHP-induced promoter demethylation associated with an up-regulation of three genes apparently not relevant for sperm physiology and partially related to the immune system. As previously reported, DEHP induced an increase in mir- 615 microRNA expression and a genome-wide decrease in microRNA promoter methylation. A functional analysis revealed DEHP-induced enrichments in down-regulated gene transcripts coding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways, and in up-regulated gene transcripts coding for calcium binding and numerous myosin proteins.

40|$|Background: Interventions {{to protect}} {{offspring}} from the deleterious {{long-term effects of}} maternal obesity during pregnancy have been sought but have proven largely ineffective in humans. Metformin, an antidiabetic drug used to control gestational diabetes, failed to reduce obesity-associated fetal overgrowth in two human trials, yet long-term follow-up of these children will take many years. Thus, this thesis aims to characterize the effect of metformin on offspring in a mouse model of maternal obesity. Methods: Female mice were fed normal chow (C; 7 % kcal fat) or obesogenic high-fat diet (HF; 45 % kcal fat) for 6 weeks prior to mating. Metformin (m) was given in drinking water (250 mg/kg) to half of dams during pregnancy and lactation. Dam and fetal parameters were assessed in a subgroup at gestation day 16. 5. At weaning, offspring received C or HF diet. <b>Offspring</b> metabolic <b>parameters</b> were assessed at 28 weeks, and offspring were killed and tissue collected at 30 weeks. Plasma metabolic and inflammatory markers and hepatic gene expression, lipid levels and pathology were evaluated. Results: In fetuses, metformin treatment altered fetal hepatic gene expression and reduced fetal weight. Metformin {{had no effect on}} obese dam glucose homeostasis. In adult female offspring of obese dams, maternal metformin reduced adiposity, improved glucose homeostasis and reduced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) severity. In adult male offspring of obese dams, metformin had no beneficial effects. In adult offspring of either sex born to lean dams, maternal metformin increased offspring adiposity, impaired glucose homeostasis and worsened NAFLD severity. Conclusions: Metformin treatment in obese dams partially protects female offspring from the effects of maternal obesity, yet male offspring do not benefit. Offspring of metformin-treated lean dams, of either sex, have more severe metabolic disease. These data urge investigation of mechanisms priming adverse offspring responses to maternal metformin...|$|R

Additional economy in the CPU cost required to reach a successful design can be achieved by using surrogate evaluation models (the so-called metamodels) for the major part of search on each level. The metamodels exploit the “experience ” gained during the evolution to approximately pre-evaluate new offspring generated by the EA and select the most promising among them for re-evaluation on the problem-specific tool.

Wistar female rats (7 per group) were orally supplemented with retinyl palmitate (2500, 12, 500 and 25, 000 IU/kg/day) or saline (control) throughout pregnancy and nursing.

40|$|Since Smith and Fretwell’s seminal {{article in}} 1974 on the optimal {{offspring}} size, most theory has assumed a trade-off between offspring number and offspring fitness, where larger offspring have better survival or fitness, but with diminishing returns. In this article, we use two ubiquitous biological mechanisms to derive {{the shape of}} this trade-off: the offspring’s growth rate combined with its size-dependent mortality (predation). For a large parameter region, we obtain the same sigmoid relationship between offspring size and offspring survival as Smith and Fretwell, but we also identify parameter regions where the optimal offspring size is as small or as large as possible. With increasing growth rate, the optimal offspring size is smaller. We then integrate our model with strategies of parental care. Egg guarding that reduces egg mortality favors smaller or larger offspring, depending on how mortality scales with size. For live-bearers, the survival of offspring to birth {{is a function of}} maternal survival; if the mother’s survival increases with her size, then the model predicts that larger mothers should produce larger <b>offspring.</b> When using <b>parameters</b> for Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata, differences in both growth and size-dependent predation are required to predict observed differences in offspring size between wild populations from high- and low-predation environments...|$|R
40|$|Studies have {{established}} that developmental environmental exposures {{play a critical}} role in adult disease susceptibility. Epigenetic reprogramming is a molecular consequence of exposures during critical developmental periods. Linking environmental exposures to adult disease via epigenetic mechanisms may help our understanding of human disease. 	Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical monomer, is found in consumer products including beverage containers, receipts, and metal can linings, and thus, is ubiquitous in the environment. Studies have measured detectable levels of urinary BPA in populations around the world. 	This dissertation utilizes a mouse model of multiple human physiologically relevant levels of BPA exposure in utero and during lactation, and evaluates BPA’s influence on <b>offspring</b> metabolic/hormonal <b>parameters,</b> and epigenetic regulation. First, perinatal BPA exposure was associated with increased activity and energy expenditure, and decreased body weight and fat in female offspring throughout the life-course. Females displayed increased insulin sensitivity and adiponectin, and decreased leptin. Life-course metabolic analysis illustrates perinatal BPA exposure is associated with hyperactive and lean phenotypes. 	Second, perinatal BPA exposure was linked to epigenetic alterations at postnatal day 22. Global DNA methylation was significantly decreased in exposure groups. BPA exposed offspring displayed alterations to DNA methylation in four candidate genes including the Avy, CabpIAP, H 19, and Igf 2 loci. These epigenetic data suggest perinatal BPA exposure alters DNA methylation globally and in candidate genes. 	Lastly, an epigenome-wide discovery platform was utilized to elucidate epigenetic alterations in adult offspring following perinatal BPA exposure. Biological pathway analysis run on differentially methylated regions revealed enriched pathways involved in the metabolic phenotypes displayed in the BPA exposed females. Candidate genes from enriched pathways were chosen to assess DNA methylation as a mediator linking perinatal BPA exposure’s association on metabolic phenotypes. Methylation of Irs- 2 and Jak- 2 was linked as a potential mediator in the mechanistic pathway of BPA exposure and adiponectin and glucose phenotypes, respectively. 	 	This project illustrates that perinatal BPA exposure is associated with hyperactive and lean phenotypes mediated by DNA methylation. Data generated from this study is crucial for deciphering the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of chronic disease, and developing novel epigenetic-based prevention and therapeutic strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Maternal smoking during {{pregnancy}} {{has been reported}} to negatively impact sperm counts of the sons. Sufficient data on the effect of paternal smoking is lacking. Objectives: We wished to elucidate the impact of maternal and paternal smoking {{during pregnancy}} and current own smoking on reproductive function of the male <b>offspring.</b> Methods: Semen <b>parameters</b> including sperm DNA integrity were analyzed in 295 adolescents from the general population close to Malmö, Sweden, recruited for the study during 2008 – 2010. Information on maternal smoking was obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, and regarding own and paternal smoking from questionnaires. The impacts of maternal, paternal and own smoking were evaluated in a multivariate regression model and by use of models including interaction terms. Totally, three exposures and five outcomes were evaluated. Results: In maternally unexposed men, paternal smoking was associated with 46 % lower total sperm count (95 %CI: 21 %, 64 %) in maternally unexposed men. Both paternal and maternal smoking were associated with a lower sperm concentration (mean differences: 35 %; 95 %CI: 8. 1 %, 55 % and 36 %; 95 %CI: 3. 9 %, 57 %, respectively) if the other parent was a non-smoker. No statistically significant impact of own smoking on semen parameters was seen. Conclusions: Prenatal both maternal and paternal smoking were separately associated with some decrease in sperm count in men of whom the other parent was not reported to smoke...|$|R
40|$|Dowabstraction of the Darwinian {{principle}} of {{survival of the}} fittest in order to “breed ” good solutions over a predefined number of “generations”. Deposition rates for a given fuel which have been measured experimentally over a range of conditions are reproduced by solving the conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy and species using a CFD code and the optimised set of rate constants obtained using a genetic algorithm inversion process. The new set of rate constants lie within predefined boundaries based upon previous values found in the literature for the mechanism being used. In addition, this powerful technique promises the ability to develop reaction mechanisms whose newly optimised rate constants reproduce closely all the experimental data available, enabling a greater confidence in their predictive capabilities. The process is also shown to be an effective tool to facilitate the elucidation of shortcomings in current global chemistry models of fuel degradation. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate that the genetic algorithm inversion process may be used to develop and calibrate more detailed models for the thermal stability behaviour of aviation fuels than have been seen previously and, subsequently, accurately predict the locations and rates of deposit build-up in fuel handling systems. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that, modern high speed computers allow for evaluation of increasingly complex and expensive GA objective functions. s ki Reaction rate for the ith reaction nchild Number of <b>offspring</b> ne Elitism <b>parameter</b> npop Population siz...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{study the}} {{statistical}} properties of fragment coverage in genome sequencing experiments. In {{an extension of}} the classic Lander-Waterman model, we consider the effect of the length distribution of fragments. We also introduce a coding of the shape of the coverage depth function as a tree and explain how this can be used to detect regions with anomalous coverage. This modeling perspective is especially germane to current high-throughput sequencing experiments, where both sample preparation protocols and sequencing technology particulars can affect fragment length distributions. Results Under the mild assumptions that fragment start sites are Poisson distributed and successive fragment lengths are independent and identically distributed, we observe that, regardless of fragment length distribution, the fragments produced in a sequencing experiment can be viewed as resulting from a two-dimensional spatial Poisson process. We then study the successive jumps of the coverage function, and show that they can be encoded as a random tree that is approximately a Galton-Watson tree with generation-dependent geometric <b>offspring</b> distributions whose <b>parameters</b> can be computed. Conclusions We extend standard analyses of shotgun sequencing that focus on coverage statistics at individual sites, and provide a null model for detecting deviations from random coverage in high-throughput sequence census based experiments. Our approach leads to explicit determinations of the null distributions of certain test statistics, while for others it greatly simplifies the approximation of their null distributions by simulation. Our focus on fragments also leads to a new approach to visualizing sequencing data that is of independent interest. </p...|$|R
40|$|The two {{eucalyptus}} borers Phoracantha semipunctata and P. recurva were accidently {{introduced in}} Tunisia in 1962 and 1999, respectively. Their relative distribution is still unknown {{and very little}} is known about their preferences and performances in various host species under different Tunisian climates. We combined field data and laboratory follow-up, in order to define their present distribution, their relative abundance and to test the effects of sites and Eucalyptus species on attack density, reproductive and developmental performances and productivity of insects. The study was carried out in Eucalyptus plantations of ten localities ranging from humid to arid. Choice preference and colonization of various selected Eucalyptus species by the two borers were studied with standing trap trees and trap logs. Tree species differed among localities, but all localities contained {{at least one of the}} two species E. gomphocephala and E. camaldulensis, both being well appreciated by the two Phoracantha species. It appeared that both beetle species were present in all localities but P recurva was dominant over P semipunctata everywhere. Insect characteristics depended on attack localization on tree stem; attack densities were higher on the lowest than on the upper parts. It is perfectly coherent that the density of emerging beetles correlated positively with attack density, number of young larval galleries, larval survival and adult success in the trap tree experiment. High larval survival and adult success resulted in high <b>offspring</b> productivity. Insect <b>parameters,</b> especially the intensity of infestation, depended on locality but without relation with the climatic areas...|$|R
40|$|Pregnant {{women with}} {{congenital}} heart disease (CHD) are susceptible to cardiovascular, obstetric, and offspring complications. In women with CHD, cardiac dysfunction may compromise uteroplacental flow {{and contribute to the}} increased incidence of obstetric and offspring events. We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study of pregnant women with CHD and healthy pregnant women. We compared clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, and uteroplacental Doppler flow (UDF) parameters at 20 and 32 weeks gestation, and pregnancy outcome. We related cardiovascular parameters to UDF parameters and pregnancy outcome in women with CHD. We included 209 women with CHD and 70 healthy women. Cardiovascular parameters (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, left and right ventricular function) differed between both groups. UDF parameters were impaired in CHD women (umbilical artery pulsatility and resistance index at 32 weeks in CHD versus healthy women, P= 0. 0085 and P= 0. 017). The following cardiovascular parameters prepregnancy and at 20 weeks gestation were associated with UDF (umbilical artery resistance index) at 32 weeks at multivariable analysis: (1) right ventricular function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) (P= 0. 002), (2) high N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (P= 0. 085), (3) systemic (P= 0. 001), and (4) pulmonary (P= 0. 045) atrioventricular valve regurgitation. Women with CHD had more obstetric (58. 9 % versus 32. 9 %, P < 0. 0001) and offspring events (35. 4 % versus 18. 6 %, P= 0. 008) than healthy women. Impaired UDF was associated with adverse obstetric and <b>offspring</b> outcome. UDF <b>parameters</b> are abnormal in pregnant women with CHD. Cardiovascular function is associated with an abnormal pattern of UDF. Compromised UDF may be a key factor in the high incidence of offspring and obstetric complications in this populatio...|$|R
40|$|Usp 46 mutant mice (congenic {{strain on}} a B 6 genetic background; MT mice) {{have a low}} weaning rate and display poor {{maternal}} behavior compared to C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (B 6 mice). Based on these observations, we examined how maternal behavior is shaped by cross-fos-tering and in-fostering MT and B 6 mice. The experiments consisted of six groups: B 6 mice fostered by their biological mother (B 6 -CO); MT mice fostered by their biological mother (MT-CO); B 6 mice fostered by a different B 6 mother (B 6 -IF); MT mice fostered by a different MT mother (MT-IF); B 6 mice fostered by an MT mother (B 6 -CF); and MT mice fostered by a B 6 mother (MT-CF). Maternal behavior was assessed using the pup-retrieval test in adult female <b>offspring,</b> and four <b>parameters,</b> time nursing pups in the nest, time sniffing or licking pups, rearing behavior, and latency to retrieve pups, were measured. Cross-fostering signif-icantly reduced time spent nursing and sniffing/licking pup, and {{increased the number of}} instances of rearing in the B 6 -CF group, and improved three parameters of maternal behav-iors (nursing, rearing and latency) in the MT-CF group. These results indicate that the level of maternal care is transmitted to their pups and proper maternal behaviors can be shaped if adequate postpartum maternal care is given, even in genetically vulnerable mice. However, the offspring’s genotype may also influence the development of maternal behaviors in adult-hood. Thus, MT mice may prove useful as a model for trans-generational transmission of maternal care, and these findings may provide insight into the mechanisms of maltreating behaviors in human child abuse...|$|R
40|$|Caffeine is {{the world}} most popularly {{consumed}} legal neurostimulant. It is naturally found in beverage drinks including coffee and tea. It is also artificially added to several soft and energy drinks, as well as medicinal drugs including analgesics. Caffeine itself can be employed for therapeutic purposes. The wide range of caffeine distribution in substances and its popularity in some cultures makes {{it almost impossible to}} regulate its consumption. Several people consume caffeine from one or more sources, daily and almost inadvertently. Yet, caffeine ingestion during pregnancy has been reported to have observable effects on female fertility as well as on embryo, foetal and child health. This investigation was conducted to analyse the effect of different doses of caffeine on pregnancy and foetus at birth with emphasis on the number of <b>offspring</b> and morphological <b>parameters.</b> Thirty two (n= 32) adult female pregnant mice (Mus musculus) were divided into four groups- Group A as the Control, Group B was administered the low-dose caffeine (10 mg/kg body weight), Group C was administered the medium-dose caffeine (50 mg/kg body weight) and Group D was administered the high-dose caffeine (120 mg/kg body weight). Anhydrous caffeine was dissolved in distilled water to achieve the target dosage for each group and animals were administered caffeine daily throughout the period of pregnancy. At birth, the parameters of fecundity were examined especially with respect to the average litter number; total sum of litter weights as well as the average litters’ weights across the experimental animal groups. Caffeine significantly affected birth weight of the offspring; treated groups had fewer offspring per birth and lower sum of offspring weights. Caffeine had observable effects on pregnancy and litters in manner that were negative especially at the higher doses...|$|R

Group 1 {{received}} water and standard feeds for thirty-four days. Group 2 was fed with a cholesterol-containing diet (1 %) for two weeks prior to onset of gestation and maintained administration till parturition, produce atherosclerosis (34 days). Group 3 received intragastric administration of 100 mg homogenate of garlic (Allium sativum) /kg body weight for three weeks prior to onset of gestation as well as throughout the gestation period. Group 4 intragastrically administered garlic for one week of group B and maintained with combined garlic-treatment for the mentioned period. At parturition, the pregnant were sacrificed and serum total cholesterol (TCL), triglycerides (TG), HDL, LDL and creatine kinase activity (CK) were determined. The total numbers of offspring were recorded and examined morphological for congenital abnormalities. Biopsies of heart and dorsal aorta of both pregnant and their offspring (1 day-age) were processed for investigation at light and transmission electron microscopy. The skeleton of the newborn of different experimental groups were stained with alizarin red s and mor-phometric assessment of mandibular and appendicular bone length. The study revealed that the myocardium of atherosclerotic mother exhibited leuhkocytic inflammatory cell infiltration associated with necrosis, eosinophilia of myocardiai fibers, and edema of blood vessels. Ultrastructural studies revealed swelling of mitochondria, disruption of cristae in the myocardiai muscle fibers. The dorsal aorta possessed accumulation of extra-cellular lipid in intima lining of endothelium. The collagenous fibrils in the tunica adventitia became fragile and loosely separated from each other. Numerous foamy lipid loaden cells were detected within the tunica intima causing deterioration of the elastic fibers, resulting in fibrinoid necrosis. Oral supplementation with Allium sativum (100 mg/ kg) ameliorated these effects in myocardium muscle of mothers and offspring; however the dorsal aorta of mothers showed partial amelioration. Hypercholesterolemic mothers exhibited marked alterations in serum TCL, TG, LDL and CK activity. Supplementation with Allium sativum ameliorated the drastic biochemical alterations. Concerning pregnancy, hypercholesterolemia increased the incidence of abortion and abnormalities of the newborn including decreased body weight, reduced ossification of axial (mandible) and appendicular bones. All these effects were markedly ameliorated by supplementation with Allium sativum. The author finally concluded that hypercholesterolemia exhibits pathological alterations of myocardiai muscles reducing its optimal capacity for pumping blood to different body organs along with atherosclerosis of dorsal aorta which intern affect the progress of gestation and development of both morphological and skeletal abnormalities.
