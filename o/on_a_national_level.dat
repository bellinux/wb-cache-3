5|$|The region, {{as defined}} above, has a total {{population}} of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as Macedonian <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>level,</b> while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both Macedonian on a regional, and Greek <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>level.</b> According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, {{the use of the}} term <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>level</b> lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD - plus) {{will be affected by}} governance conditions within host countries. The top eight countries, which are responsible for 70 percent of the world's total annual deforestation, have implemented certain forms of decentralization in public administration and forest management. This paper analyzes implications of decentralized forest management for the {{implementation of}} REDD. Three possible options for the involvement of local governments in the implementation of REDD are: 1) the central government decides <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> reference <b>level</b> and devolves the implementation to local governments; 2) the central government decides <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> reference <b>level</b> and seeks expressions of interest from local governments to implement REDD in their administrative areas; and 3) the central and local governments decide <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> reference <b>level</b> jointly and local governments implement REDD activities locally. This paper also highlights fiscal instruments for REDD revenue distribution...|$|R

As in the 1988 fires, protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts.|$|E

5|$|Some {{claim that}} the FVdG {{influenced}} strikes in the arms industry as early as February or March 1918, but the organization was not re-established <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> <b>level</b> until December 1918. On December 14, Fritz Kater started publishing Der Syndikalist (The Syndicalist) in Berlin {{as a replacement for}} Die Einigkeit. On December 26 and 27, a conference organized by Kater and attended by 33 delegates from 43 local unions took place in Berlin. The delegates reflected upon the difficult times during the war and proudly noted that the FVdG was the only trade union which did not have to adjust its program to the new political conditions because it had remained loyal to its anti-state and internationalist principles. The delegates reaffirmed their rejection of parliamentarianism and refused to participate in the National Assembly.|$|E
