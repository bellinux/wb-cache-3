5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> a box {{to use it as a}} jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E

5|$|Corpses {{thought to}} be vampires were {{generally}} described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed footwear such as boots and shoes {{can reduce the}} risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E

5|$|Restrictions on Jews {{were already}} in place before the invasion, {{including}} a prohibition on marrying Christians. After the invasion, Randolph Braham writes, the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews {{from the rest of}} the community. From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8inch (10 x 10cm) yellow badge. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, non-Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its takeoff roll exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased the stall speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E
5|$|Shōkaku was {{the first}} carrier in the IJN to be fitted with radar, a Type 21 early-warning radar, mounted {{on the top of}} the island around September 1942. The date of Zuikakus {{installation}} is unknown, but both ships received a second Type 21 radar in a retractable installation adjacent to the flight deck after October. Before June 1944, a Type 13 air-search radar was installed on the light tripod mast abaft the island. The Shōkaku-class carriers were also fitted with a Type 91 hydrophone in the bow that was only useful when anchored <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> very slowly.|$|E

5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of the rōnin Shiren, who travels through thirty areas {{on his way to the}} Land of the Golden Condor. The game is turn-based, with all enemies and {{characters}} in an area moving whenever the player performs an action, such as attacking <b>or</b> <b>moving.</b> If the player falls in battle, they lose all their progress and are forced to restart from the beginning of the game: to counter-act this, they can choose to store powerful items in warehouses, and pick them up again on further playthroughs; the Nintendo DS release also adds rescue quests, where a player can save other players who have fallen, allowing them to continue from where they left off.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
5|$|The family uses {{a number}} of {{techniques}} to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are arboreal, with most of those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show {{a number of}} techniques and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> on. The time paused varies, although smaller species {{tend to be more}} active and pause for shorter times.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E

5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E
5|$|Within the Indian Ocean {{north of}} the equator, {{tropical}} cyclones are tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the officially designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also tracks storms in the basin on an unofficial basis. The Arabian Sea, which borders the Arabian Peninsula, typically spawns tropical cyclones in the southeastern portion {{of the body of}} water, offshore of western India. About 48.5% of cyclones dissipate without making landfall, <b>or</b> <b>moving</b> ashore, and around one in three storms move toward the Arabian Peninsula. However, storms do not form in the western Arabian Sea because of cool sea surface temperatures (the result of strong winds from the monsoon), as well as dry air from the Arabian Peninsula.|$|E
