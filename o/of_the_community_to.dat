5|$|The abbey {{was founded}} in the late twelfth century as a house for monks of the austere Cistercian order. Over its 350-year monastic history Cleeve was undistinguished amongst the abbeys of its order, {{frequently}} ill-governed and often financially troubled. The sole member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> achieve prominence was John Hooper, who became a bishop during the Reformation.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions {{are based on the}} results of a merit review board. The composition of the merit review board includes a minimum of three to a maximum of five members. As appointed by the squadron commanding officer, members include: Commanding officer (or delegate) acting as board chairperson; Air Cadet League or local sponsor representative; and a minimum of one and maximum of three additional members from the following: representative(s) of the RCSU CO (area Cadet Instructor Cadre officer, regional cadet advisor, area cadet officer, etc.), squadron CIC officer(s) (from within own or members of neighbouring squadrons), and member(s) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> (<b>to</b> include: school principal, Legion member, etc.). Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron dictated the top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking cadet.|$|E
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E

5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself to be a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> which the election is reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E

25|$|The modern jury evolved out of {{the ancient}} custom of many ancient Germanic tribes whereby {{a group of men}} of good {{character}} was used to investigate crimes and judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the vehmic court system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the Norman Conquest, {{some parts of the country}} preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece.|$|E

25|$|By 1825, Jewish {{population}} in Wallachia (almost completely Sephardi) {{was estimated at}} between 5,000 and 10,000 people - of these, the larger part resided in Bucharest (probably as much as 7,000 in 1839); around the same time, Moldavia was home to about 12,000 Jews. In parallel, the Jewish {{population in}} Bukovina rose from 526 in 1774 to 11,600 in 1848. In the early 19th century, Jews who sought refuge from Osman Pazvantoğlu's campaign in the Balkans established communities in Wallachian-ruled Oltenia. In Moldavia, Scarlat Callimachi's Code (1817) allowed members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> purchase urban property, but prevented them from settling in the countryside (while purchasing town property became increasingly difficult due to popular prejudice).|$|E
25|$|Starting Archeology Museum: Swamiji {{had a very}} keen acumen {{regarding}} archeology {{and hence}} wanted the people at Shirali and rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> understand the beauty of archeology. For that purpose He planned to start an archeology museum at Shirali. Certain {{members of the community}} opposed this plan citing reasons like Idols of Gods (that were displayed at the museum) should not be used for purposes of entertainment and public display. Moreover, the funds used for that project could be used for other purposes. Swamiji was adamant with His decision which resulted in the museum being completed in 1974. This caused tensions within the administration of the matha.|$|E

The game was praised for its overall gameplay and faithfulness to the previous iterations in the series. Some of the early features were criticized, and while the console versions received positive reviews, reviewers believed there were obvious differences between the console and PC versions of the game.|$|E

Teens and small children then follow in the same order. Following the Grand Entry, the MC will invite a respected member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> give an invocation. The host drum that did not sing the Grand Entry song will then sing a Flag Song, followed by a Victory or Veterans' Song, during which the flags and staffs are posted at the MC's table.|$|E
25|$|Australians {{reacted to}} the event with {{widespread}} shock and horror, and the political effects were significant and long-lasting. The federal government led state governments, some of which (notably Tasmania itself and Queensland) were opposed to new gun laws, to severely restrict the availability of firearms. While surveys showed up to 85% of Australians 'supported gun control', many people opposed the new laws. Concern was raised within the Coalition Government that fringe {{groups such as the}} 'Ausi Freedom Scouts', the Australian League of Rights and the Citizen Initiated Referendum Party, were exploiting voter anger to gain support. After discovering that the Christian Coalition and US National Rifle Association were supporting the gun lobby, the government and media cited their support, along with the moral outrage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> discredit the gun lobby as extremists.|$|E

25|$|The {{first section}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> be built, Lake Anne Plaza, was {{designed}} by James Rossant (who studied under Walter Gropius at the Harvard Graduate School of Design) to emulate the Italian coastal town of Portofino. Lake Anne village was designed with modern architectural themes that extend to a nearby elementary school, a gasoline station, and two churches. Lake Anne also has an art gallery, several restaurants, the Reston Historic Trust Museum, shops, and a senior citizens' fellowship house. All are local businesses, as there are no chain stores or chain restaurants allowed in Lake Anne. Close by are the cubist townhouses at Hickory Cluster that were designed by the noted modernist architect, Charles M. Goodman, in the International Style. Other sections of the town, such as Hunters Woods, South Lakes, and North Point, were developed later, each with a neighborhood shopping center and supermarket.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} studies of {{improving}} the transportation system within {{and out of the}} island. Proposals and studies vary between a port, runway and the Intercontinental Tunnel or Bridge. According to the National Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP) the difficult and limited access to the island has put economic pressure on the community, and the tribal council has already voted to begin planning for relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> the mainland if access and housing conditions are not improved. No plan for constructing a port, airport, runway, tunnel or bridge has been put into action. According to 2006 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documentation, however, better access to the island will raise issues with its dedicated nature, environment and local traditions and also impact the identity of the Iñupiat community by increasing social contacts with the outsiders.|$|E
25|$|This {{development}} oriented mindset {{was something}} that was usually never anticipated from a religious figure. This progressive outlook did not go well with certain orthodox members of society. Swami Parijñānāshram felt restrained by the lack of acceptance from certain sections of society and which finally resulted in His abdication of the post of the Head of Chitrapur Math (Mathādhipati) in 1979. He relinquished the title of the Head of the Community fully by 1981. After this, He travelled all across India and even went abroad (The first guru <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>to</b> do so), before He settled down in a matha constructed under his regime, at Karla. He continued His service for the welfare of the people even though He was not Mathādhipati of the community. This allowed Him to extend His welfare programs to the down-trodden people irrespective of community, caste, creed or status.|$|E
