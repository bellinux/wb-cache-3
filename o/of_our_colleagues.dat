It struggled {{to prevent the}} crimes that happened in and around Srebrenica in 1995 but admitted, [...] "We must acknowledge that despite our efforts to help thousands of civilians forcibly expelled from the town and despite the dedication <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>colleagues</b> on the spot, the ICRC's impact on the unfolding of the tragedy was extremely limited." [...] It went public once again in 2007 to decry [...] "major human rights abuses" [...] by Burma's military government including forced labor, starvation, and murder of men, women, and children.|$|E
2500|$|The MNFIR {{became the}} object of {{government}} repression, soon after the antisemitic student Corneliu Zelea Codreanu was arrested on charges of terrorism. Codreanu had attempted to assassinate the staff of Adevărul, including the Jewish manager Iacob Rosenthal, and, during the interrogations, implicated other fascist alliances. His testimony was disputed by Vestul României, the pro-fascist newspaper of Timișoara, which claimed: [...] "The attempt [...] is not the work of terrorists, as was quickly proclaimed by some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>colleagues,</b> but the mere revenge of one Sandi Bacaloglu who wished to defend the honor of his sister, that had been compromised by one Adevărul article, wherein it had been claimed that Elena Bacaloglu had been convicted for immodesty by the appellate court of Genoa." [...] Several other theories circulate regarding Codreanu's motivation, but {{it is known that}} his group of assassins included an FNR man, Teodosie Popescu, and also that the act was celebrated in the FNR media.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{presidents have}} also {{commented on the}} {{reputational}} survey. [...] Former president of Scripps College, Nancy Y. Bekavac also stated in a press release on the college website that Scripps will also no longer submit the Reputational Survey to U.S. News as [...] "for years we have known of flaws in the methodology; {{many of us have}} spoken with editors at U.S. News in an attempt to improve its approach [...] but nothing can really improve a system that seeks to reduce 3,300 educational programs in American higher education to one set of numbers, and then rank them. College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>colleagues</b> likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E

6000|$|Such was {{the scheme}} that Mr. Gladstone now {{worked out in}} many weeks of toil {{that would have been}} slavish, were it not that toil is never slavish when {{illuminated}} by a strenuous purpose. When by and by the result had made him the hero of a glorious hour, he wrote to Lord Aberdeen (April 19): 'I had the deepest anxiety with regard to you, as our chief, lest by faults of my own I should aggravate the cares and difficulties into which I had at least helped to bring you; and the novelty of our political relations with many <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>colleagues,</b> together with the fact that I had been myself slow, and even reluctant, to the formation of a new connection, filled me with an almost feverish desire to do no injustice to that connection now that it was formed; and to redeem the pledge you generously gave on my behalf, {{that there would be no}} want of cordiality and zeal in the discharge of any duties which it might fall to me to perform on behalf of such a government as was then in your contemplation.' ...|$|E
6000|$|May 30, 1885.—I {{am sorry}} but not {{surprised}} that your rather [...] remarkable strength should have given way {{under the pressure of}} [...] labour or anxiety or both. Almost the whole period of this [...] ministry, particularly the year and a half since the defeat of [...] Hicks, and most particularly of all, the four months since the [...] morning when you deciphered the Khartoum telegram at Holker, have [...] been without example in my experience, as to the gravity and [...] diversity of difficulties which they have presented. What I hope [...] is that they will not discourage you, or any <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>colleagues,</b> in [...] your anticipations of the future. It appears to me that there is [...] not one of them, viewed in the gross, which has been due to our [...] own action. By viewing in the gross, I mean taking the Egyptian [...] question as one. When we subdivide between Egypt proper and the [...] Soudan, I find what seem to me two grave errors in our management [...] of the Soudan business: the first our landing at Suakin, the [...] second the mission of Gordon, or rather the choice of Gordon for [...] that mission. But it sometimes happens that the errors gravest in [...] their consequences are also the most pardonable. And these errors [...] were surely pardonable enough in themselves, without relying on [...] {{the fact that they were}} approved by the public opinion of the day [...] and by the opposition. Plenty of other and worse errors have been [...] urged upon us which we have refused or avoided. I do not remember [...] a single good measure recommended by opponents, which we have [...] declined to adopt (or indeed any good measure which they have [...] recommended at all). We certainly have worked hard. I believe that [...] according to the measure of human infirmity, we have done fairly [...] well, but the duties we have had to discharge have been duties, I [...] mean in Egypt and the Soudan, which it was impossible to discharge [...] with the ordinary measure of credit and satisfaction, which were [...] beyond human strength, and which it was very unwise of our [...] predecessors to saddle upon the country.|$|E
