Feeding behaviour and growth performance of the juveniles in relation to food availability were studied. Babylonia formosae habei juveniles were exposed {{to one of the}} four ration levels with food provided once either every 1, 2, 5 or 10 days. Higher food consumption, longer time spent on feeding and higher percentage of feeding individuals were <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> maintained at lower ration levels. Similar growth performances were observed in individuals fed once every day or every two days. A sustained production of shell was obtained in the juveniles maintained at low ration levels. At the end of the experiment, lower protein and lipid content as well as lower energy content were measured in the somatic tissue of juveniles maintained at lower ration levels. During the 30 -day experiment, food availability is not a crucial factor on survival of juvenile B. formosae habei due to its physiological and behavioural adaptations developed in association with starvation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} chiefly with {{the behavior of a}} duplicating chromosome derived from the undescribed scute allelomorph known as scute- 10 - 2. This allelomorph, obtained by x-raying scute- 10, is associated with a reciprocal 1 - 4 translocation. The X-chromosome is broken near its left end, between the loci of silver and broad, and the short terminal piece (loci from yellow to silver) is exchanged for a section of the fourth chromosome that includes all the known loci of that chromosome (with the possible exception of cubitus-interruptus, which is difficult to test, since this translocation shows the position effect recently described by Dubinin and Sidoroff(1)). The small chromosome, made up of the left end of X attached to the spindle-fibre region of 4, may be <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> (of either sex) that are otherwise normal diploids. (2) If the normal X's of such hyperploids carry the recessive gene for yellow, the flies are wild-type in appearance {{because of the presence of}} +y in the duplicating chromosome.

40|$|The {{independent}} {{contribution of}} postprandial glucose (PPG) excursions {{to the overall}} glucose exposure {{and its role in}} the development of both micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes remain subject to continuing debate in type 2 diabetes. Discussion continues on whether postprandial hyperglycemia is the main contributor to the overall hyperglycemia in fairly well-controlled individuals, whereas basal hyperglycemia becomes the preponderant contributor in poorly controlled patients. The concern about the role of PPG as a risk factor for diabetes complications is related to the controversial data <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> with impaired glucose tolerance. It remains, however, that the total glucose exposure as reflected by hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) levels is an undoubted major vascular risk factor. Excluding the contribution of PPG is nonsensical. In support of this position is the fact that the absolute impact of PPG on HbA 1 c, expressed as percentage levels of HbA 1 c, remains constant at 1 % across the HbA 1 c continuum in non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. This key feature clearly depicts the absolute contribution of PPG in contrast to its relative contribution and better explains why PPG contributes to the excess of glycation with the basal hyperglycemia...|$|E

Objective: To research the audiologic findings and DPOAE in workers exposed to occupational noise and plaguecides and to compare them with data <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> without exposure to these harmful elements. Method: 51 individuals were evaluated (102 ears), divided into three groups. Group I was composed by 17 workers with exposure to noise and plaguecides, all with neurosensorial auditory loss; group II was composed by 17 workers with exposure to noise and plaguecides with audiometric thresholds within normality standards (up to 25 dBNA) and group III by 17 healthy individuals without auditory alterations and without exposure to noise and plaguecides, control group. Results: In the audiologic anamnesis, as for groups I and II, we observed that the main auditory complaints presented by the workers were those of recruitment (29. 5 %), tinnitus (26. 5 %), allergy (23. 5 %) and arterial hypertension (12 %). The findings of the audiometry appointed that the research's individuals did not present with auditory losses in the frequencies of 500 Hz, 1 and 2 kHz, the losses occurred in the frequencies of 3 and 8 kHz. As for the distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), we observed that the individuals in group III had a major incidence of responses when compared to those of groups I and II. Conclusion: The results analysis allowed us to conclude that the DPOAE test represents an important tool for follow up and prevention of NIHL...|$|E
40|$|Prospective {{assessment}} of cardiovascular control in individuals with {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) in response to active stand training. Cardiovascular parameters were measured at rest and in response to orthostatic challenge before and after training in individuals with clinically complete SCI. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of active stand training on arterial blood pressure and heart rate and changes in response to orthostatic stress in individuals with SCI. Measurements were <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> with SCI (n[*]=[*] 8) prior to and after 40 and 80 sessions of the standing component of a locomotor training intervention (stand LT). During standing, all participants wore a harness and were suspended by an overhead, pneumatic body weight support (BWS) system over a treadmill. Trainers provided manual facilitation as necessary at the trunk and legs. All individuals were able to bear more weight on their legs after the stand LT training. Resting arterial blood pressure significantly increased in individuals with cervical SCI after 80 training sessions. At the end of the training period, resting systolic blood pressure (BP) in individuals with cervical SCI in a seated position, increased by 24 % (from 84 [*]±[*] 5 to 104 [*]±[*] 7 mmHg). Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension present in response to standing prior to training (decrease in systolic BP of 24 [*]±[*] 14 mmHg) was not evident (decrease in systolic BP of 0 [*]±[*] 11 mmHg) after 80 sessions of stand LT. Hemodynamic parameters of individuals with thoracic SCI were relatively stable prior to training and not significantly different after 80 sessions of stand LT. Improvements in resting arterial blood pressure and responses to orthostatic stress in individuals with clinically complete cervical SCI occurred following intensive stand LT training. These results may be attributed to repetitive neuromuscular activation of the legs from loading and/or conditioning of cardiovascular responses from repetitively assuming an upright posture...|$|E

Second, there is an opportunity to enrich standard economic models of strategic behavior by allowing for different types of bounded rationality and by relaxing assumptions about utility formulation. These new models can help us to more accurately predict strategic choices.

40|$|Long-term {{binaural}} auditory deprivation {{is associated}} with poorer speech recognition outcomes after cochlear implantation, even for postlingual hearing loss. It is, however, unknown {{to what extent the}} outcomes of implantation are related to the peripheral changes occurring monaurally or to changes at a higher level in the auditory system related to binaural deafness. This retrospective study aimed to unravel peripheral and central contributions to cochlear implantation outcomes by comparing outcomes <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>individual</b> ears for adults with long-term monaural auditory deprivation (i. e. unilateral use of hearing aid) who received bilateral cochlear implants. Results showed that similar outcomes can be obtained with the implant placed in the auditory-deprived or in the aided ear.

Some of the young as well as aged animals could respond very well to antigen, mitogen or both and there was a complete lack of correlation between the magnitude of individual responses to mitogen and the number of PFC produced in the in vitro antibody response to SRBC. Additionally, we investigated whether the magnitude of the immune responses measured <b>in</b> <b>individual</b> mice had any influence on their lifespan.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the growth and}} structural characteristics of InAs nanowire junctions evidencing a transformation of the crystalline structure.

The NW junctions reveal large sections of zinc blende crystal structure free of extended defects, despite the high stacking fault density <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>individual</b> InAs nanowires. This segment of zinc blende crystal structure in the junction is associated with a crystal phase transformation involving sets of Shockley partial dislocations; the transformation takes place solely in the crystal phase. A model is developed to demonstrate that only the zinc blende phase with the same orientation as the substrate can result in monocrystalline junctions. The suitability of the junctions to be used in nanoelectronic devices is confirmed by room-temperature electrical experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most of the CAD Systems for Mammograms are {{composed}} of algorithms analysing the four X-ray images individually. It is a general experience, that algorithms in search of microcalcification clusters can obtain high sensitivity only if specificity is low. To overcome efficiency problem this paper proposes a simple algorithm to combine information of the two views (MLO/CC) of the breast. The procedure {{is based upon the}} experiences of radiologists: masses and calcifications should emerge on both views, so if no matching is found, the given object is a false positive hit. A positioning system is evolved to find corresponding regions on the two images. Calcification clusters <b>obtained</b> <b>in</b> <b>individual</b> images are matched in “ 2. 5 -D ” provided by the positioning system. The credibility value of the hit is reassessed by the matching. The proposed approach can significantly reduce the number of false positive hits in calcification. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA locally {{analytic}} numerical {{method is}} developed {{to predict the}} two-dimensional internal and external steady laminar flow of an incompressible viscous fluid. In this method, analytic solutions of locally linearized partial differential equations are incorporated into the numerical solution. This is accomplished by dividing the flow field into computational grid elements. <b>In</b> each <b>individual</b> element, the nonlinear convective terms of the Navier-Stokes equations are locally linearized, with analytic solutions then determined. The solution for the complete flow field is obtained by the assembly of these locally analytic solutions.
