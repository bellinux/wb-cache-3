40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper compares {{alternative}} {{concepts of}} production and prices with special emphasis on time. First it is demonstrated that the point input-point <b>output</b> representation of <b>processes</b> used in von Neumann-Sraffa models is not restrictive and {{can be derived from}} general flow input-flow <b>output</b> <b>processes.</b> Second, the concept of long-period positions, which {{can be traced back to}} the work of the classical authors, is discussed. Third, the von Neumann-Sraffa approach is compared to the neo-Austrian model and to the flow-fund model developed by Hicks and Georgescu-Roegen respectively. It turns out that these latter two models are, at best, a special case of the former. Finally, some problems and intricacies concerning observable input-output coefficients are discussed and, as an alternative, a possibly applicable method to determine coefficients for general flow input-flow <b>output</b> <b>processes</b> is presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Electric spin {{effects are}} effects of {{electric}} fields on the dynamics/motions of nuclear/electron spins and related phenomena. Since classical brain activities are largely electric, we explore here {{a model of}} mind-brain interaction {{within the framework of}} spin-mediated consciousness theory in which these effects in the varying high-voltage electric fields inside neural membranes and proteins mediate mind-brain input and <b>output</b> <b>processes.</b> In particulars, we suggest that the input processes in said electric fields are possibly mediated by spin transverse forces and/or Dirac-Hestenes electric dipoles both of which are associated with the nuclear/electronic spin processes. We then suggest that the <b>output</b> <b>processes</b> (proactive spin processes) in said electric fields possibly involve Dirac negative energy extraction processes, shown by Solomon, and also Dirac-Hestenes electric dipole interactions of nuclei/electrons besides non-local processes driven by quantum information. We propose that these <b>output</b> <b>processes</b> modulate the action potentials, thus influencing the brain, by affecting the cross-membrane electric voltages and currents directly and/or indirectly through changing the capacitance, conductance and/or battery in the Hudgkin-Huxley model. These propositions are based on our own experimental findings, further theoretical considerations, and studies reported by others in the fields of spintronics, high-energy physics and alternative energy research...|$|R

5000|$|Because {{stuttering}} is such {{a common}} phenomenon, {{and because it is}} not entirely understood, various opposing schools of thought emerge to describe its etiology.

Cerebral dominance theories (in the stutterer, no cerebral hemisphere takes the neurological lead) and theories of perseveration (neurological [...] "skipping record" [...] of sorts) are both Breakdown theories. Auditory Monitoring theories suggest that stutters hear themselves differently from how other people hear them. Since speakers adjust their communication based upon the auditory feedback they hear (their own speech), this creates conflict between the input and the <b>output</b> <b>process.</b> Psychoneurotic theories posit repressed needs as the source of stuttering.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with how fiscal policy in emerging markets should respond to economic fluctuations. We model the behaviour of a fiscal authority in an emerging market country who can use external borrowing to smooth the effects of exogenous output shocks on domestic agents’ private consumption. We focus on the policy implications of the facts that (1) the GDP process in emerging markets is characterised by a relatively volatile trend growth rate, and (2) that policymakers cannot directly observe the output gap or the trend GDP growth rate. We have two key findings. First, we find that risk-averse policymakers who face EME-style <b>output</b> <b>processes</b> (ie processes dominated by shocks to the trend growth rate) should run tighter fiscal policies, with lower average debt-GDP ratios, than those in industrialised countries, who face different <b>output</b> <b>processes.</b> Second, our baseline parameterisation suggests that EME policymakers should run countercyclical fiscal policies. This result contrasts with other papers which have used optimising frameworks and the features of EME <b>output</b> <b>processes</b> to rationalise the observed procyclicality of EME fiscal policies or external balances. Simulations suggest that the welfare costs of naively running a fiscal policy that would be appropriate for an industrialised country are around 1 % of certainty-equivalent consumption, but this result is sensitive to parameterisation. We find that a simple rule-of-thumb policy that stabilises the debt-GDP ratio in every period entails much smaller welfare losses. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{stationary}} {{theory of}} quantum stochastic processes of second order is outlined.

It is shown that for each stationary noise there exists a natural <b>output</b> <b>process</b> <b>output</b> <b>process</b> which {{is identical to the}} noise in the infinite temperature limit, and flipping with the noise if the time is reversed at finite temperature. A canonical Hilbert space representation of the quantum noise and the fundamental <b>output</b> <b>process</b> is established and a decomposition of their spectra is found. A brief explanation of quantum stochastic integration with respect to the input-output processes is given using only correlation functions. This provides a mathematical foundation for linear stationary filtering transformations of quantum stochastic processes. It is proved that the colored quantum stationary noise and its time-reversed version can be obtained in the second order theory by a linear nonadapted filtering of the standard vacuum noise uniquely defined by the canonical creation and annihilation operators on the spectrum of the input-output pair.
