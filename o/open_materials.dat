Design/methodology/approach – Borrowing requests for <b>open</b> access <b>materials</b> were quantitatively analysed and compared to total borrowing requests. Findings – During the period studied, borrowing requests for <b>open</b> access <b>materials</b> increased while overall requests held steady. As the number of requests filled with open access documents continues to rise, IUPUI University Library is able to provide a service to users and cost savings for the library by utilizing this material.

Benefits (both in terms of costs and effectiveness) of e-learning are well known and confirmed by several works (Fenu and Picconi 2010; Pittard 2004; Wilson and Wilson 2007). Starting from 2008, the increasing of online presence and open learning opportunities have create {{the basis of the}} new e-learning phenomenon: the development and diffusion of MOOCs (Guerra and Ferrari 2015).

Copper cell-structured materials are employed to describe the effect of topological regularity on the static and dynamic deformation behavior. Essential difference is recognized between normally and regularly cell-structured materials on the dynamic/static stress ratio and the strain-rate sensitivity. Topological design of cells becomes important for <b>open</b> cell-structured <b>materials...</b>|$|R
