To ascertain {{the performance of the}} risk group policy in <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age and over and provide a baseline to estimate the impact of the universal elderly programme. Methods Information was gathered on vaccine uptake for the period 1989 – 2003 in England from a national survey of general practitioners (GPs) through NHS primary care trusts (PCTs), the prescription cost analysis (PCA) system and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Results Between 1991 and 2003, 4. 5 million doses of PPV were prescribed. The GP survey found that by 2003, 29 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> and over of age and 36 % <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> age over had received PPV.
