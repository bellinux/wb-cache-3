5|$|The 1st Brigade {{had just}} 33 tanks {{remaining}} after losing 20 tanks. This prompted Second Army command to transfer {{a battalion of}} 21 tanks on October 18 from the 2nd Infantry Division to the north to reinforce the dwindling tank numbers in 16th Division's bridgehead. As the battalion moved south, {{a large number of}} Israeli aircraft attacked the formation, forcing it to undertake evasive maneuvers, turning eastwards and fanning <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> terrain, thereby avoiding losses. The battalion was then attached to the 21st Division.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Villa's {{funeral was}} held and {{thousands}} of his grieving supporters in Parral followed his casket to his burial site while Villa's men and his closest friends remained at the Canutillo hacienda armed and ready for an attack by the government troops. The six surviving assassins hid <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> and were soon captured, but only two of them served {{a few months in}} jail, and the rest were commissioned into the military.|$|E
25|$|Another time Saint Anthony was {{travelling}} in the desert, {{he found}} a plate of silver coins in his path. He pondered {{for a moment as}} to why a plate of silver coins would be <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> where no one else travels, and realised the Devil must have laid it out there to tempt him. Anthony continued walking along and saw a pile of gold in his way which the Devil had laid there to deceive him, but he ignored them and continued on his way.|$|E

25|$|The Daily Star {{reported}} in November 2011 that SIS helped capture Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The top-secret mission, dubbed Operation X to disguise its purpose, used modern electronic intelligence (ELINT) technologies to bug him {{along with his}} friends and family. Gaddafi had been hiding <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> for a month but the breakthrough came when he made two phone calls, one after the other, {{to say he was}} safe. It allowed the joint British and French bugging operation to pinpoint his location. SIS agents using the £25million top-secret equipment closed in on him before calling in the Libyan snatch squad to apprehend him.|$|E
25|$|For {{more than}} 1,000 years, the {{inhabitants}} of Oxyrhynchus dumped garbage at a series of sites <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> sands beyond the town limits. The fact that the town was built on a canal {{rather than on the}} Nile itself was important, because this meant that the area did not flood every year with the rising of the river, as did the districts along the riverbank. When the canals dried up, the water table fell and never rose again. The area west of the Nile has virtually no rain, so the garbage dumps of Oxyrhynchus were gradually covered with sand and were forgotten for another 1,000 years.|$|E
25|$|Because Egyptian society {{under the}} Greeks and Romans was governed bureaucratically, and because Oxyrhynchus was {{the capital of}} the 19th nome, the {{material}} at the Oxyrhynchus dumps included vast amounts of papyri. Accounts, tax returns, census material, invoices, receipts, correspondence on administrative, military, religious, economic, and political matters, certificates and licenses of all kindsall these were periodically cleaned out of government offices, put in wicker baskets, and dumped <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert.</b> Private citizens added their own piles of unwanted papyri. Because papyrus was expensive, papyri were often reused: a document might have farm accounts on one side, and a student's text of Homer on the other. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri, therefore, contained a complete record {{of the life of the}} town, and of the civilizations and empires of which the town was a part.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were way <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> and we drove around this corner of these hills and I felt like we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings {{that looked like a}} bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect."

So much so that he kills Solon because he outlived his usefulness.|$|R

500|$|Just {{before midnight}} on 3/4 August, three columns of the German Pasha I and the 4th Ottoman Army, {{consisting}} of about 8,000 men, began their attack on an outpost line {{held by the}} 1st Light Horse Brigade {{three and a half}} hours after the return of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade from their regular daytime patrol. In addition to the usual officers patrols left out overnight to monitor the enemy's positions, Chauvel decided to leave out for the night the whole of the 1st Light Horse Brigade to hold an outpost line of about 3 miles (4.8km), covering all entrances to the sandhill plateau which formed the Romani position and which were not protected by infantry posts. A shot or two fired <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> to the south-east of their position put the long piquet line of the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) on alert about midnight, when the 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) was called up to the front line. The Austrian, German and Ottoman advance paused after finding the gullies held by the light horsemen, but at about 01:00, a sudden heavy burst of fire along the whole front began the attack of the considerably superior Ottoman and German forces, and by 02:00 they had in many places advanced to within [...] of the Australian line.|$|E

[...] SFX described Oswald's journey as one from a Hannibal Lecter type character to a Billy Graham or messianic figure.

Discussing Oswald's fall from grace, series writer Jane Espenson explains that [...] "humanity doesn't seize on heroes for the long–term", and that Oswald's descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic. Though Oswald dies helping the Torchwood team, Espenson remarked that [...] "we didn't want to outright redeem this horrible, horrible man" [...] commenting that his death is intended as [...] "redemption and comeuppance both." [...] The Independents Neela Debnath observed that whilst {{the character of}} Danes had [...] "become likeable in an odd-sort of way" [...] his last scenes [...] "reiterated just how despicable he was" [...] and that it was the right time for him to depart the cast.|$|E

The movie quickly spawned a sequel and, once again, Enslow made an impact by coming up short on a jump and landing on supercross racer Jeremy McGrath's practice bike. This notoriety made Enslow {{one of the first}} bike riders to receive sponsors without having a racing career.|$|R
