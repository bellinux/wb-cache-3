5|$|Using {{the stellar}} spectrum, astronomers can also {{determine}} the surface temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity of a star. If the distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is found, such as {{by measuring the}} parallax, then the luminosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> can be derived. The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances. Gravitational microlensing {{has been used to}} measure the mass of a single star.) With these parameters, astronomers can also estimate the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
