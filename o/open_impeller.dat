5000|$|The air escapes {{through the}} pump {{discharge}} nozzle whilst the fluid drops {{back down and}} is once more entrained by the impeller. The suction line is thus continuously evacuated.

For these reasons this solution is only adopted for small pumps, e.g. garden pumps. More frequently used types of self-priming pumps are side channel and water ring pumps. Another type of self-priming pump is a centrifugal pump with two casing chambers and an <b>open</b> <b>impeller.</b> This design is not only used for its self-priming capabilities but also for its degassing effects when pumping twophase mixtures (air/gas and liquid) for a short time in process engineering or when handling polluted fluids, for example when draining water from construction pits.|$|E
50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An <b>open</b> <b>impeller</b> design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry.

A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|E

40|$|Pumps {{are among}} the most spread {{machines}} in industrial facilities. In this work a comparative CFD analysis using different software is presented. The three-dimensional flow in the semi-open impeller and volute of a centrifugal pump is numerically simulated. The main advantage of semi-open impeller centrifugal pump is its efficiency which can be considered constant thanks to the clearance adjustment. In addition this kind of impeller is less likely to clog with solid bodies (important in case of slurry-processing). The <b>open</b> <b>impeller</b> has all the parts visible, so it is easier to inspect for wear and damages. Eventually it is lighter than a shrouded impeller: it can spin faster. The stress due to centrifugal force is indeed a limit for the speed of this machines. On the other hand its main disadvantage if compared to a shrouded pump is its lower efficiency due to the heavier tip leakage. In addition it cannot be employed in case of explosive products: the risk of contact between impeller and volute causing sparks is not negligible. The simulations have been carried out using both open-source and proprietary software: OpenFOAM®, PumpLinx ® and ANSYS-CFX ®. The performance of the machine handling both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are also investigated. The numerical models and the results of the different computational strategies were compared with the experimental data and the accuracy of different software is evaluated in the case of Newtonian model. It is well known that the performance of a centrifugal pump drops processing a viscous fluid. Even so the behavior during the pumping of non-Newtonian fluids has not been investigated so far. The non-Newtonian fluid processed is a shear-thinning fluid (the apparent viscosity decreases with an increase stress). The slurries which are usually processed in the food industries, chemical plants and oil&gas processes show a usual behavior which correspond to this kind of model...|$|E
40|$|LectureGreat {{interest}} {{is being paid}} by Oil & Gas industry {{to the design of}} high speed and high pressure ratio centrifugal compressors. Static and dynamic stresses are becoming higher and, under critical conditions, aerodynamic forcing may lead to impeller high cycle fatigue failures. Thorough aeromechanics knowledge is hence necessary for the advanced design of centrifugal compressors, to ensure reliability and life-time. Open impellers, which are commonly used for high speed applications, may be prone to relatively high vibration levels, due to aerodynamic excitations present in the flow field. Indeed, resonant crossings with forcing functions are in some cases unavoidable in variable speed machines since a wide speed range results in a wide frequency range of rotor-stator interactions, as well as flow-field circumferential distortions, occurring at multiples of the impeller excitations. Impeller forcing amplitudes and aeromechanical damping both contribute to vibratory response levels and must be properly predicted. This paper is focused on the aerodynamic damping prediction. A comprehensive study was undertaken to develop and validate aerodynamic damping prediction capability for open impellers for the operating conditions and mode shapes of interest. An extensive experimental campaign was conducted on a full scale multistage compressor equipped with transonic unshrouded impellers instrumented with strain gauges connected to a telemetry system. The strain gauge data are compared to the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) predicted damping for blade and disk modes and show good agreement. The present paper describes the challenges related to aerodynamic damping prediction in a real machine environment taking into account complex flow features, for example flow distortions, off-design conditions and different pressure levels. The level of agreement between test data and CFD predictions achieved in this work represents a significant step forward towards building and validating a fully physics based predictive capability for <b>open</b> <b>impeller</b> forced response. In fact, such validated aerodynamic damping prediction capability is required for aeromechanic risk mitigation and accurate impeller high cycle fatigue analysis in early stages of the design process...|$|E
40|$|Many pumping {{stations}} in drainage & irrigation applications are currently equipped with conventional (not fish friendly designed) pumps. Field tests {{have been performed}} [1] for several pump types of a certain size at certain pumping conditions to assess survival rates of fish passing through pumps. In order to compare different pump types of different sizes at different pumping conditions, a general criterion is required. Testing of fish friendliness of pumps is expensive and involves animal tests with living fish for which permits are required. Therefore, pump manufacturers prefer to perform fish friendliness tests for a single pump size. In order to convert such results to other pump sizes, a scaling law is desired. Van Esch [2, 3] made a first attempt to address scaling principles for fish friendliness of pumps. In {{the current study a}} general criterion is described to predict fish friendliness of pumps by means of models of mortality rates of fish passing through pumps. The criterion is validated with literature data [1 – 3] and experimental full-scale test data from the newly developed fish-friendly axial flow concrete volute pump by Flowserve with an impeller diameter of 850 mm. The full-scale tests involved a total of 1800 roach, perch and eel deployed over 7 pumping conditions, including 3 different heads and 5 different rotational speeds. The fish-friendliness criterion includes different aspects that together predict the survival rate of fish passing through pumps. The first and most important contributor is the impeller, which can have an axial, mixed or radial flow design. The criterion involves the leading edge shape of the blades. Secondly, the diffuser or volute is considered, which provides a strike probability with diffuser vanes or volute tongue(s). In case the gap between the trailing edge of the impeller vanes and {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes or volute tongue(s) is small relative to the fish size, there is the possibility of a “scissor” effect. Research in the USA for fish friendliness of hydropower turbines [4 – 7] showed that shear velocity and pressure drops can be of importance. Also cavitation (involves pressure drop & vapor bubble implosions), recirculation and turbulence can influence survival rates. At this stage these flow effects are roughly captured using the pump performance curve. This way, extensive CFD calculations to evaluate detailed flow effects can be avoided. For <b>open</b> <b>impellers,</b> the gap between the impeller vanes and wear ring is included in the criterion. In addition, fish species-dependent effects are taken into account, since fish vary widely in their internal and external building plan. For instance salmonid, percid and cyprinid fish respond differently to the same pump design than for example eel. Sharp edges and rough surfaces (for example caused by cavitation, erosion or corrosion) can also be harmful to fish but are not included at this stage...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{hydraulic}} force on magnetically levitated (maglev) pumps should be studied carefully to improve the suspension performance and {{the reliability of the}} pumps. A maglev centrifugal pump, developed at Ibaraki University, was modeled with 926 376 hexahedral elements for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. The pump has a fully <b>open</b> six-vane <b>impeller</b> with a diameter of 72. 5 mm. A self-bearing motor suspends the impeller in the radial direction. The maximum pressure head and flow rate were 250 mmHg and 14 l/min, respectively. First, a steady-state analysis was performed using commercial code STAR-CD to confirm the model’s suitability by comparing the results with the real pump performance. Second, transient analysis was performed to estimate the hydraulic force on the levitated impeller. The impeller was rotated in steps of 1 ° using a sliding mesh. The force around the impeller was integrated at every step. The transient analysis revealed that the direction of the radial force changed dynamically as the vane’s position changed relative to the outlet port during one circulation, and the magnitude of this force was about 1 N. The current maglev pump has sufficient performance to counteract this hydraulic force. Transient CFD analysis is not only useful for observing dynamic flow conditions in a centrifugal pump but is also effective for obtaining information about the levitation dynamics of a maglev pump. 10 page(s...|$|R

In addition, the turbulence kinetic energy within the passages was substantially lower. The efficiency of the shrouded pump was, however, lower than the unshrouded version.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to compare the effects of two different diffuser vane geometries on the performance of a centrifugal compressor. Vaned diffusers are commonly used in aeroengines because they can achieve higher pressure recoveries than vaneless diffusers of similar size. Improving the diffuser’s pressure recovery and effectiveness can result in overall compressor performance benefits that are sought out by engine manufacturers looking to improve overall engine efficiency. An airfoil vane was tested and compared to a baseline wedge diffuser in the Purdue CSTAR research facility, where the centrifugal compressor used for this study is intended to be the last stage of an axial-centrifugal compressor. ^ The overall stage performance for the compressor with the airfoil diffuser was first obtained at <b>open</b> <b>impeller</b> tip clearances and then at tight clearances. In the tight clearance configuration, the compressor consistently had higher total pressure ratio and higher isentropic efficiency compared to the open clearance configuration. In particular, impeller isentropic efficiency and shroud static pressure along the entire impeller passage were highest at the tight impeller clearance configuration, indicating less losses due to tip leakage flow. The reduction in tip leakage flow, and resulting blockage, at tight clearance operation was also suggested by the increase in choke mass flow rate for all corrected speeds. ^ For the comparison of the airfoil and wedge diffuser assemblies, data were acquired with the impeller in the tight clearance configuration. Despite slight differences in exducer tip clearances (less than 2 x 10 - 3 in.), stage total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency at 100 % corrected speed were not significantly different between the two diffuser assemblies. Upon closer inspection of individual components, the airfoil diffuser actually had, on average, higher pressure recovery and higher diffuser effectiveness than the wedge diffuser. However, the airfoil diffuser assembly had higher losses in the deswirl region compared to the wedge diffuser assembly. Excluding measurements from the deswirl, the total pressure ratio for the airfoil diffuser assembly was slightly greater than that of the wedge diffuser assembly. A physical mismatch in the airfoil diffuser and deswirl assembly could be responsible for the losses recorded in the deswirl region and could have resulted in the limited performance improvements observed. Additionally, the similar vane geometries at the leading edge (in terms of inlet metal angle and thickness) combined with any deviation from design during manufacturing could have limited the predicted performance benefits. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith a {{decrease}} in orders for their regular standard cargo-pump for chemical tankers, Frank Mohn Fusa started developing a new cargo-pump for the Offshore Supply Vessel market. This meant designing a pump which both {{should be able to}} pump high viscous oil-emulsion and a fluid called drilling-mud, which is a mixture of salt-water and small particles of barite stone. The first test performed when the thesis started showed that their initial design would not withstand the erosion from the particles for a long enough period of time; this because both the pump impeller and the pump volute casing suffered from heavy erosion. This master thesis has the objective of first quantifying the erosion in the original design and then comparing the CFD-simulations with real physical tests. From these results, together with analytical estimations of the erosion on the components and in compliance with erosion and fluid mechanical theory, a recommendation for a new design will be given. CFD-results for this new design will also be given. There is also a focus on finding the areas where erosion often occurs. Recommendations for material choice and coating are given for the original design. The results from the impeller simulations show that there are still some unknown variables in the prediction of erosion in CFD. While the steady state simulation differs quite much from the physical test, the transient simulation gives a better prediction for the pump impeller. It is found that the boundary layer in the grid has a large influence for the prediction of particle erosion. For the impeller it is found that the new design is a better solution than the original <b>open</b> <b>impeller</b> in regards to erosion rates, both at full-load and in the best efficiency point, while they are almost equal at part-load. The result from the pumps volute casing gives a good representation of the measured erosion from the physical test. The volute casings inlet tongue in the original design is a region where design changes are needed, since it has a high erosion rate caused by high velocity and high impinging angle. The new volute casing designed in this thesis, where the volume expansion is changed from radial to axial, gives better results, having approximately three times less maximum erosion rate at the inlet tongue. The analytical model used in this thesis gives a good estimation for some of the surfaces, while others differs to some degree from the CFD calculations. This is mainly caused by forces acting on the particles that are not accounted for in the analytical model. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that shear force during mashing, transferring and lautering should be avoided, {{especially in the}} case of thin bed filtration, using a fine milled grist. Therefore pump rotation speed is limited up to 1000 rpm during thin bed filter operations. However, in order to achieve the targets of flow, filtration pressure and low rotation speed, the transfer pump is mostly too large and operates far from the ideal performance potential. Transferring tomatoes and milk products, where shear force directly leads to damage of the product, learned that the efficiency is much more important instead of the rotation speed. This phenomenon is tested for mash transfer during thin bed filtration on pilot and industrial scale. Mashes of 3. 5 hl were transferred with an oversized channel impellor pump (MWP 2 / 40 - 160 / 116 (3 K- 160) and maximum rotation speed of 1200 rpm. A smaller <b>open</b> <b>impeller</b> pump (FP/ 63 - 25 / 114 (O- 132) D 09 S 18 KEB Y 55 S 5019 [...] M 2) is used to test the hypothesis of higher rotation speed (1500 rpm). Industrial mashes (120 hl) were filtered using 4 pump types: P 1 = MCP 2 / 65 - 250 / 1104 (O- 260) ("open / semi-open impeller"-reference), P 2 = ICP 3 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (C- 220) ("closed impeller"), P 3 = IFF 2 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (VO- 220) ("vortex impeller"), P 4 = ICP 3 / 80 - 200 / 1104 (4 K- 200) ("channel impeller"). Following parameters were measured during lautering: flow, pressure, rotation speed, filtered volume, extract, β-glucan, and arabinoxylan content of first wort. At pilot scale, an increased rotation speed of 1500 rpm with the smaller new pump resulted in a somewhat improved lauter performance compared to the reference pump with a max rotation speed of 1200 rpm. However, the efficiency of this new pump is 17, 6 % vs 4 % with the reference pump. At industrial scale, no important differences in lauter performance were noticed with varying rotation speed. However higher pump efficiency resulted in a somewhat decreased extraction of β-glucans and pentosans meaning that pump efficiency is indeed more important compared to rotation speed. Higher pump efficiencies resulted in an improved lauter performance, even when rotation speed of the pump is higher. The β-glucan level in the first wort decreases with increased pump efficiency. It was generally accepted that rotation speed of transfer pumps for lautering should be below 1000 rpm to avoid shear forces. The determined factor was only the speed of rotation of the pump, efficiency was never a ‘key’ selection criterium. With these experiments, firstly proven by transferring tomatoes and milk products, pump efficiency is much more important compared to rotation speed. Decreased electricity consumption and lower investment cost is a direct result of these new findings. status: publishe...|$|E

The pump had an <b>open</b> faced <b>impeller</b> of 33. 65 cm diameter with 5 blades of backswept design. It was felt {{that the best way}} to resolve some of the questions related to Hossain?s results was to determine the fluid velocity field inside the pump. Thus the flow field through the impeller passages was measured using a 1 -D Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) system. The LDV was used to measure the radial and tangential velocity components as well as the turbulence intensities over the region accessible through the two optical windows in the front of the pump housing. Five axial planes were investigated by recording measurements along two radial lines at azimuthal angles of 45 ? and 315 ? (with respect to the horizontal axis of the pump) for design operating conditions. A once per revolution signal was used to supply the LDV system with a reference for the rotor position. It was found out that a leakage flow existed near the front wall of the impeller at z/h = 0. 11, which was generated by the pressure difference between the impeller exit and inlet. It was also concluded that the velocity field was not fully two-dimensional in nature.

There are primarily two types of fatigue failures: blade failures and disk failures. Metallurgical inspection of failed impellers can be used to identify fatigue as the root cause. It is imperative, however, that rigorous engineering analysis is applied in the initial design phase to prevent resonance that will result in impeller failures. To meet the objective of designing reliable and trouble-free impellers, blade and disk modal analyses are of the utmost importance. Development of a Campbell diagram is a typical means of identifying potential harmonic frequencies. The blade frequencies and disk frequencies overlap each other on the Campbell diagram because of the complex blade geometry and influence of disk flexibility. This makes it difficult to identify the possible resonance. This paper describes a practical method, which combines 3 -D finite element modal analysis, Campbell diagram, Singh?s advanced frequency evaluation (SAFE) diagram, and the authors? experience in an effort to prevent excitation of undesirable natural frequencies. Presented within the paper are particular modal analysis steps, which include: ?	Techniques to identify possible disk resonance ?	Techniques to identify possible blade and bladed disk resonance ?	Techniques to improve the design The method has been successfully used in centrifugal compressor impeller design process and failure cause analyses. A case study in which these methods are applied is given as an example...|$|R
