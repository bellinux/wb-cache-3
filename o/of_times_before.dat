5|$|The Brazilian ironclad Barroso was an {{armoured}} gunboat {{built for}} the Brazilian Navy during the Paraguayan War in the mid-1860s. Barroso bombarded Paraguayan fortifications in 1866 and 1867 a number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> she participated in the Passagem de Humaitá in February 1868. Afterwards the ship provided fire support for the army {{for the rest of}} the war. She was assigned to the Mato Grosso Flotilla after the war. Barroso was decommissioned in 1882, but was not scrapped until 1937.|$|E
5|$|Case {{took over}} the lease on the hotel in 1907 and bought the {{property}} on which the building sat in 1927 for US$1 million. Case remained owner and manager of the hotel {{until his death in}} June 1946. In October that year, The Algonquin was purchased by Ben Bodne of Charleston, South Carolina for just over US$1 million. Bodne undertook an extensive restoration and renovation effort. Bodne sold the hotel in 1987 to a group of Japanese investors and the Algonquin changed hands a number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> ending up with Miller Global Properties in 2002. Following a two-year, US$3 million renovation, the hotel was sold again in 2005 to HEI Hospitality.|$|E
5|$|Goya went to {{exile in}} France in 1824, and {{ownership}} of the house passed to his grandson Mariano. An 1830 inventory by Brugada indicates that the work took a full wall between two windows on the first floor, opposite A Pilgrimage to San Isidro. On the wall to the right were Saturn Devouring His Son and Judith and Holofernes. Leocadia, Two Old Men and Two Old Men Eating Soup were on the left wall. Art historian Lawrence Gowing observed that the lower floor was divided thematically, with a male side– Saturn and A Pilgrimage to San Isidro– and a female side– Judith and Holofernes, Witches' Sabbath and Leocadia. The house changed owners a number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> March 1873, when it came into the possession of the Belgian Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger, who speculated that the area would appreciate in value over the coming years. The murals had deteriorated badly after many years on the walls. To preserve them, the new owner of the house had them transferred to canvas {{under the direction of}} the art restorer of the Museo del Prado, Salvador Martinez Cubells. Following their exhibition at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1878, where they were met with little reaction, d'Erlanger donated them to the Spanish state in 1881.|$|E
50|$|Another system, {{known as}} VACMA, oversees the driver's alertness. It {{consists}} of a foot pedal control that the driver needs to hold down for the TGV to move. This pedal must be released then re-pressed once every 60 seconds if no other activity takes place. There is one period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> a buzzer sounds, and another period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the automatic emergency brakes come on. The control can be released for {{a very short period}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> a buzzer sounds, and another very short period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the automatic emergency brakes come on.|$|R

5|$|The basic {{function}} of equipment in SaGa games {{is to increase}} character attributes. Arming a character with a gold helmet increases his or her base defense statistic, for example. The amount of equipment that can be placed on any one character at any time depends on the character's class. Humans can hold eight, mutants four, and monsters none. There are five types of armor: shields, helmets, breastplates, gauntlets, and shoes. Only one of each at a time may be added to one character and cannot be added to monsters. Weapons, consisting of swords, hammers, whips, spell books, and guns, utilize either the strength, agility or mana attribute of a character, {{and can be used}} only a certain number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> breaking and being removed from the player's inventory. Shields can be used as items in combat, most with a limited number of uses, and allow the user to evade enemy attacks.|$|E

On 19 December 1999, JCW was launched and released several DVDs in the following years.

25|$|The 33rd Battalion was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army. Formed in 1916, the battalion fought on the Western Front during World War I. It was disbanded after the war, but later re-raised {{as a part-time}} unit based in New South Wales. During the inter war years, it was amalgamated with other battalions a couple <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> being re-raised {{in its own right}} in 1936. During World War II, the battalion remained in Australia and in 1942 was amalgamated with the 13th Battalion, which was disbanded the following year having not served overseas.|$|E

25|$|A thirteenth {{was later}} issued to Bob Forbes Racing. A Level 1 {{franchise}} required {{a team to}} race at least one car at all events, and at various times allowed a team to enter up to four cars. Other teams received Level 2 and Level 3 franchises based on their level of participation. The structure was changed a number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> the present system of 28 RECs was arrived at in 2011. Supercars bought a number of RECs as they became available {{in order to achieve}} a long-held desire to reduce the field to 28 cars.|$|E
25|$|SIUE gained {{its fourth}} {{straight}} win by downing Evansville 2–0. After controlling {{the ball for}} most of the scoreless first half, the Cougars got on the board when Lane headed a long Hackett throw-in over the Purple Aces' keeper 64 minutes in for his second consecutive game-winner. Fifteen minutes later, another throw-in was headed a couple <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> Duncan sent it to Bilyeu {{at the top of the}} box, who fired a blazing shot past the keeper to give the Cougars the margin of victory. The defense limited Evansville to only one shot on goal, as Dal Santo recorded his seventh shutout.|$|E
25|$|In 1723, Vilhena {{financed the}} {{construction}} of Fort Manoel on the Isolotto (now Manoel Island after the Grand Master) in Marsamxett Harbour. The fort was completed ten years later, and it remained in use until the 20th century. Its chapel was dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, {{the patron saint of}} the Grand Master. Vilhena also set up the Manoel Foundation in order to maintain and garrison the fort and its outworks. A bronze statue of the Grand Master was installed in the fort's piazza in 1736, and it was relocated a number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> being placed in its present location at Pope John XXIII Square in Floriana.|$|E

25|$|Bows are the ranged {{weapon of}} the game, best used by rogues. Staves, while capable of {{physical}} attacks, are mainly {{used for the}} spell charges that they contain, as casting from a staff {{does not require the}} player to learn the spell or use mana. A staff's spell can only be cast a certain number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> it requires a recharge. Swords are typically one-handed (though two-handed varieties also exist), while axes are all two-handed. Maces and clubs add a 50% damage bonus against the undead. Shields, when paired with single-handed weapons, allow attacks to be blocked. There are three classifications of armor: light, medium and heavy. Characters are also allowed to wear a helmet, two rings, and one amulet.|$|E
25|$|Andy Hug's eight fight win streak {{was brought}} to an end by then-two-time K-1 Grand Prix {{champion}} Peter Aerts {{in the first of}} their four meetings at K-1 Kings '97 on March 16, 1997. Soundly beaten inside the opening stanza, he was hurt by Aerts' right hand a number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> being put away with a combination of an uppercut and a knee. He then fought to a five-round split draw with Sam Greco at K-1 Braves '97 on April 29, 1997 before having his fourth and final battle with Mike Bernardo in his first WKA world super heavyweight title defence on June 7, 1997 at K-1 Fight Night '97 in Zurich. Bernardo registered a knockdown of Hug with a powerful left hook at the end of round two but it was not enough as Hug took the unanimous decision in the only fight of their 2-2 series to go the distance.|$|E
25|$|At the {{railroad}} tracks, Chanie {{turns in the}} direction away from the school and toward where he thinks his home will be. When it is dark, he decides to sleep next to a beaver pond, lighting a small fire with the matches {{given to him by}} the girl. However, the fire gives him little to no protection against the extremely cold temperatures that night. He ends up dreaming about the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of one of his teachers. Back on the tracks, Chanie continues to slowly make his way on his journey, weakened from exhaustion and exposure. He falls a number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> finally succumbing to the cold. After his death, a mother lynx lifts Chanie’s spirit and carries him into the forest, away from the tracks. In the morning an engineer comes across Chanie's frozen body by the tracks and notifies the authorities. The story ends with Chanie, warm and happy, dancing in the forest with all of the animals featured throughout the novel.|$|E

25|$|Once all the {{preparations}} are made, battle begins. Turn order is decided by a countdown based on agility, last move used and formation. A player character may select from {{as many as}} eight different skills: one normal skill for each item, and, if they are well trained with that item and the OverDrive Gauge is sufficiently filled, a secondary, more interesting OverSkill. Using a skill, however, reduces how many more times that item can be used, as Riviera employs a Fire Emblem-styled system of item endurance allowing the item to be used only a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> it breaks entirely. The OverDrive Gauge fills throughout battle, as characters receive and deal damage, and with certain skills. At various levels, characters can use different skills, because certain skills require more of the gauge be filled. There are five levels of skills for player characters: Level 0 skills that may be used whenever and without training; Levels 1 through 3 skills, which require training and deplete that amount of the OverDrive Gauge; and Execution Level skills that may be used at any level of OverDrive Gauge fullness, but will shatter the gauge for the battle, and are only obtained through the story. Enemies have a similar gauge with three levels: Normal, Rage and Max. At Normal they may only use normal attacks. At Rage they may use Rage and Normal attacks, but the latter depletes the gauge. At Max, they may use all three, but only Max skills will deplete the gauge, and will deplete it fully. Enemies also have Etc. attacks, ranging from healing to transformation, that may be used at any time.|$|E
