40|$|We have {{implemented}} a synthesis-for-test algorithm to implement orthogonal scan paths in data path logic. Orthogonal scan paths [Avra 92] facilitate {{the sharing of}} the functional and the test logic, thereby reducing the overhead of the scan features. Traditional scan paths, shown in Figure 1, connect individual flip-flops within a register and then connect the registers, e. g., bit one <b>of</b> <b>register</b> one is connected to bit two <b>of</b> <b>register</b> one, and bit two is connected to bit three <b>of</b> <b>register</b> one, and so on until the last bit <b>of</b> <b>register</b> one is connected to bit one <b>of</b> <b>register</b> two. An orthogonal scan path, shown in Figure 2, is orthogonal to the traditional scan path.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use <b>of</b> <b>register</b> files as storage elements in integrated circuits, {{the problem of}} assigning data variables to ports <b>of</b> <b>register</b> files has assumed significance. The assignment involves simultaneous optimization of several cost functions, namely, number <b>of</b> <b>register</b> files, number <b>of</b> <b>registers</b> and access ports per register file, and the interconnect {{both internal and external}} to memories. In this paper, we refer to multiplexers, busses, and tristate switches when we refer to interconnect.

A total of 1, 306 cases <b>of</b> <b>register</b> clashes were identified, of which 761 cases (58. 3 percent) were clear cases and 545 cases (41. 7 percent) were somewhat more doubtful. Nearly all cases <b>of</b> <b>register</b> clashes found were considered to have been used to create humor. Eight out of the ten most productive characters with respect to the utterance <b>of</b> <b>register</b> clashes were found to be characterized as witty; the other two characters produced register clashes in a way that characterized them as geeky.
