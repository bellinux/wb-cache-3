Hyperbaric {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E

The military had always been anti-communist, and Ambassador Peurifoy had applied a lot <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> senior officers ever since his arrival in Guatemala in October 1953. Árbenz had intended the secret shipment of weapons from the Alfhem to be used to bolster peasant militias, in the event of army disloyalty. But the U.S. informed army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and his top generals.|$|E
5|$|William {{also began}} to {{reconstruct}} {{the inside of the}} inner bailey, a programme of work that was continued by his descendants over the next few decades. The work included a chapel, a hall and solar, and various service buildings. An open-backed square tower was built in stone along the wall on top of the motte; this tower was later rebuilt, possibly because <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> it from the motte earthworks, and the top of the motte was relaid with flagstones to form pathways around the top. A stone gatehouse was built {{on the west side of}} the wall, leading from the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|Although {{horse and}} ox-drawn carts and spoke-wheeled chariots had existed in China {{long before the}} Han dynasty, {{it was not until}} the 1st century BCE that {{literary}} evidence pointed to the invention of the wheelbarrow, while painted murals on Han tomb walls of the 2nd century CE show the wheelbarrow in use for hauling goods. While the 'throat-and-girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive amount <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the State of Chu (as seen on a Chu lacquerware). By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer breast strap, as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb reliefs. In the final stage of evolution, the modern horse collar was invented in China by the 5th century CE, during the Northern Wei period.|$|E

His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not putting a lot <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He {{is not going to}} make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Tuđman {{spent the}} night in a Croatian Air Force and Air Defence command posta tunnel running under the Gornji Gradwhere {{information}} on the movement of Yugoslav aircraft was relayed. In the morning, Yugoslav General Andrija Rašeta informed the press that his superiors may decide to attack Zagreb as a form <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> Tuđman. Three air raid alarms were sounded during the morning of 7 October because the Yugoslav Air Force deployed as many as 30 to 40 combat jets in the Zagreb area, and numerous tip-offs of imminent air raids were received from Yugoslav military bases. During the morning, Yugoslav Air Force jets were observed taking off from bases near Pula and Udbina in Croatia and Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina. No flights were recorded taking off from Željava Air Base, presumably because of low cloud cover in the area. At 1:30pm, the Croatian Army captured a Yugoslav military communications centre and radar post near Velika Buna, south of Zagreb, hindering Yugoslav Air Force control of aircraft in the area. It is believed that the event affected the timing of the raid on the Banski dvori, the official residence of the President of Croatia at the time.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} <b>of</b> light <b>pressure,</b> Einstein in 1909 predicted {{the existence of}} [...] "radiation friction" [...] which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, “radiation will exert <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> both sides <b>of</b> the plate. The forces <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> exerted <b>on</b> {{the two sides are}} equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> exerted <b>on</b> the front surface is thus larger than the force <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> acting <b>on</b> the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.” ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} <b>of</b> competitive <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> a firm's incentives to undertake both fundamental research and development.

The key insight is that the effects <b>of</b> competitive <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> a firm's incentives to innovate depend on the firm's efficiency level relative to that of its opponents. Finally the effects <b>of</b> competitive <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> industry wide fundamental research and development are analyzed. It turns {{out that there is}} a trade off between development and fundamental research: a rise in competitive pressure cannot raise both types of innovative activity at the industry level. ...|$|R
