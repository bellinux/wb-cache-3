5|$|Madame Schmidt did {{not talk}} about the matter even after the war. She died in 1954 at the age of 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>former</b> employees.

In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E
