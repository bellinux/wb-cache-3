40|$|Abstract The {{ability to}} reverse-engineer models of {{software}} behaviour is valuable {{for a wide}} range of software maintenance, validation and verification tasks. Current reverse-engineering techniques focus either on control-specific behaviour (e. g., in the form of Finite State Machines), or data-specific be-haviour (e. g., as pre / post-conditions or invariants). However, typical soft-ware behaviour is usually a product of the two; models must combine both aspects to fully represent the software’s operation. Extended Finite State Ma-chines (EFSMs) provide such a model. Although attempts have been made to infer EFSMs, these have been problematic. The models inferred by these techniques can be non-deterministic, the inference algorithms can be inflexible, and only applicable to traces with specific characteristics.

40|$|This paper studies {{an economy}} with credit risk in which borrowers cannot commit to {{exclusive}} contracts with lenders as in Bizer and DeMarzo (1992). But we study a framework with multiple borrowing periods. In particular, we remove the exclusive contracts assumption from a baseline model of credit risk à la Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), {{similar to those}} used in quantitative studies of household bankruptcy, corporate bankruptcy and sovereign default. We compare equilibrium allocations with and <b>without</b> <b>commitment</b> to exclusive contracts. We show that borrowing levels may be lower <b>without</b> <b>commitment.</b> This is the case because when commitment to exclusive contracts is not assumed, an increase in current borrowing levels deteriorates future borrowing conditions. This does not occur when commitment is assumed. This finding stands in sharp contrast with the results in previous work that study environment where current borrowing does not affect future borrowing opportunities. We also show that borrowing levels tend to be lower <b>without</b> <b>commitment</b> if the borrowers’ discount factor is higher or debt needs to be rollover more often, and when the endogenous default probability is lower...|$|R

An agency problem exists because the entrepreneurs cannot commit to supplying their human capital which is essential to the project.

At the end of the experiment, one period is randomly drawn to count for real money. Subjects all face the same variance in their income but not necessarily the same mean.

If couples bargain with commitment, fertility outcomes take account of both spouses' fertility preferences and do not depend on the threat point in marital bargaining. If couples bargain <b>without</b> <b>commitment,</b> the influence of each spouse's fertility preference on fertility outcomes depends on the relevant threat point in marital bargaining, and the distribution of bargaining power. We test the models using household data from the Malaysia Family Life Survey. This data set contains information on each spouse's desired fertility level, as well as fertility outcomes. We exploit differences in threat points in marital bargaining across ethnic groups to help identify the underlying bargaining model.

40|$|To {{meet the}} demands of today's students, {{teaching}} in veterinary medicine evolved away from sheer, classical frontal teaching. In addition to seminars and practical exercises, the students are provided with new teaching tools such as e-learning. However, problem-based learning is still offered rarely. To fill this gap, several German-speaking veterinary universities established the use of the internet-based interactive multimedia online learning- and authoring-system CASUS. The first aim {{of this study was to}} create ophthalmologic teaching cases in collaboration with students as a part of an elective course called „Augenpatienten gehen on-line“. Later on these cases were made available for students enrolled to the lecture “Allgemeine Augenheilkunde” as an additive teaching tool. It was hypothesized that students would experience this offer attractive, would use it, and would playfully deepen their knowledge. The use of CASUS cases by the students was documented anonymously. Student’s achieved level of knowledge in the current semester and of the previous year was determined and compared with a multiple choice test at the end of the semester. Ten students of the fifth and seventh semester participated in the elective course „Augenpatienten gehen on-line“ and created a total of eight CASUS cases. Additional ten cases were written by the author of this study. Overall 18 cases were made available to the students of the eighth semester as a voluntary option of a blended learning in addition to the lecture "Allgemeine Augenheilkunde" in the summer semester (SS) in 2014. Of the 165 students invited to use this tool in the summer semester 2014, 13 participants processed a total of 32 cases. 22 cases were completed. 113 students of the SS 2013 and 115 students of the SS 2014 participated in the multiple choice test at the end of the lecture. The SS 2013 answered a total of 47. 25 % of the questions correctly; the summer semester 2014 (with CASUS as blended learning) answered a total of 48. 70 % of the questions correctly. The lack of use of the <b>offered</b> CASUS cases <b>without</b> <b>commitment</b> and/or temporal relation to an exam leads to the assumption that the option of CASUS as blended learning tool parallel to a frontal lecture does not increase the interest and/or the learning success of students...|$|R
