40|$|Background: A {{woman of}} 41 years old {{underwent}} surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. She developed a long-lasting sharply demarcated erythematous skin reaction, appearing one hour after parathyroid surgery. This erythematous reaction felt like sunburn and {{was limited to}} the light exposed skin of the operation field, leading to the diagnosis of a phototoxic reaction. Since this phototoxic reaction occurred just after changing the <b>operation</b> <b>lamp</b> from a halogen type to a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) type, we suspected that the type of <b>operation</b> <b>lamp</b> could {{be a part of the}} cause of this phototoxic reaction. This is because our department has never before diagnosed phototoxic reactions (with a halogen type of <b>operation</b> <b>lamp)</b> during methylene blue (MB) assisted parathyroid surgery. Methods: To investigate the cause of this phototoxic reaction, we performed an analysis of the adverse effects of all administered peroperative drugs and an evaluation of altered operation conditions. Results: MB, used as a peroperative surgical marker of the parathyroid glands, was the most likely causal agent of this phototoxic reaction. Emission spectrum analysis of the operation light shows that the new LED <b>operation</b> <b>lamp</b> gives a high intensity of blue light. This may have resulted in activation of MB leading to a phototoxic reaction. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first described phototoxic reaction in adults due to MB used as peroperative marker. Although rare, this potential side effect should be considered when using high doses of MB in combination with high intensity of blue light...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{influence}} of different degrees of additional illumination on visual caries detection using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). Two calibrated examiners assessed 139 occlusal surfaces of extracted permanent molars using a standard <b>operation</b> <b>lamp</b> with or without an additional headlamp providing three default brightness intensities. Histology served as the gold standard. Pooled data showed no differences in sensitivities. Specificities were not influenced by additional light. The area under the curve for the Marthaler classification D 3 threshold was significantly lower when an additional strong headlamp was used (0. 59 compared to 0. 69 - 0. 72 when reduced illumination intensities were used). One of the two examiners also had a significantly lower sensitivity for the D 1 threshold when an additional headlamp was used. The use of additional white light led to a reduced detection of dentine lesions...|$|E

40|$|Background: Operating lamps {{are often}} seen as the most {{disruptive}} factors within the protective area in the operating theater (OT). The effect of the <b>operation</b> <b>lamps</b> (with different shapes) should be demonstrated in an OT by trial, since research {{on the effects of}} the lamps is still limited. Objectives: The main aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of a skirt, different lamps, and the position of the lamp on the protected area. Methods: The concentration of airborne particles was measured under different circumstances, in order to determine the size and quality of the protected area. This entrainment/segregation test is based on the deliberate and controlled emission of particles outside the zone that is protected. Findings and Conclusions: The degree of protection (DP) at the center of the protected area was higher for the case with the skirt. This skirt stimulates more down flow and prevents the early entry of particles into the protected area. It can also be concluded that Lamp Y, due to its open shape, has the most positive effect on the DP at the center. It has also been shown that the position of the lamp has an effect on the protected area...|$|R

With counterweights (named forks) on the arms, the Chappe system was controlled by only two handles and was mechanically simple and reasonably robust. Each of the two 2-metre-long arms could display seven positions, and the 4.6-metre-long cross bar connecting the two arms could display four different angles, for a total of 196 symbols (7×7×4).

40|$|Electronic HID {{ballasts}} provide {{many advantages}} over magnetic HID ballasts including size, weight, overall efficiency, and greater control of operating conditions. Electronic ballasts add complexity to the system, requiring {{a greater understanding}} of the <b>operation</b> of HID <b>lamps.</b> Electronic ballasts also introduce a host of issues for the HID ballast designer including possible acoustic resonances, arc stability issues, and operation across broad operating conditions. In this work, research of a Low-Frequency Square-Wave (LFSW) HID solution is performed that includes use of a non-linear soft saturation core material for the inductor. Modeling of the converter with this core is presented as well. Difficulties with <b>operation</b> of HID <b>lamps</b> are outlined, as well as the previous methods to overcome such obstacles. Ignition and steady-state <b>operation</b> of HID <b>lamps</b> occur with very different operating conditions. Ignition occurs with very little lamp current, but large lamp voltage, and steady-state operation is the opposite. Due to this mismatch, any single ignitor/ballast design requires the inductor {{to be able to handle}} both operating points. Use of a soft saturation material allows for a reduction in size and weight of the overall system due to the higher magnetic capacity of the material as compared to hard saturation alternatives. The downside to using this material is inductance varies with magnetizing force on the core. A resonant ignition approach with soft saturation material is presented, motivating the need for phase control of the system. A fast transition between resonant and LFSW mode operation is presented, which requires a large design space for possible lamp impedances. Transition times between LFSW modes are dependent on natural frequency and Q factor of a buck filter response, which is shaped beneficially by the soft saturation material. A design method for this is presented, along with considerations for core selection. A two loop control method is analyzed with an inner current loop that stabilizes the lamp arc and an outer power loop in order to obtain regulated light output. The current loop is able to monitor currents of a positive and negative buck mode operation using a single sense point. A system that uses input power sensing to ultimately control output power is analyzed and experimentation is presented...|$|R

40|$|Trends in the {{development}} of different types of light sources and their energy characteristics have been described in the paper. Analysis of regulatory documents has been given. The results of experimental studies of a number of modern LED lamps have been described. Investigation has been made for a number of LED lamps produced by Philips, Xavax and Melitec. The experimental data have been obtained with the complex of devices: the dual-channel oscilloscope (GDS- 71042), the power quality analyzer (Fluke- 434) and the multi-function device EcoLight- 01 (light-, pulse- and luminance meter). It has been shown that <b>operation</b> of LED <b>lamps</b> is characterized by emission of higher current harmonics and reactive power consumption, which depends on the type and design of the lamp driver. It has been found that the value of luminance created by LED lamps in case of acceptable (for ships) prolonged deviation of voltage (– 10 %) is reduced by 3 %; in case of permissible short-term voltage deviation (– 20 %) luminance is reduced by 7 %. For incandescent lamps this indicator is characterized by a decrease in luminance by 40 % and 60 %, respectively. Despite the low sensitivity to voltage changes (in comparison with other types of <b>lamps),</b> the <b>operation</b> of LED <b>lamps</b> is also associated with the appearance of flicker. Absence of limitations for fluctuations of the light flux in shipboard lighting systems and imperfection of methods for determining the flicker make it difficult to ensure electromagnetic compatibility of LED lamps.
