5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, {{a bridge}} {{replacement}} and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94. This {{was necessary for}} the tollway which travels underneath to be widened to eight lanes. The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> eight lanes and includes full length dual left turn lanes in both directions. Other benefits are the improved entrances and exits {{to and from the}} interstate, modernized traffic signals, and the use of concrete pavement. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however both sets of dual left turn lanes were not in operation until the following spring.|$|E

5|$|The {{first state}} highway along the general route of M-54 was M-10, {{one of the}} {{original}} state trunklines signed in 1919. Later, it was redesignated as part of US Highway10 (US10) in the 1920s. After a series of realignments in the 1940s and 1960s, the roadway was given the M-54 designation in 1962. A segment of Saginaw Road through Flint was redesignated a business route in the 1940s that became Business M-54 (Bus. M-54) as well in 1962. That business loop was decommissioned in 1974. Previously, two other highways in Michigan bore the M-54 designation: a roadway that is now part of M-37 and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> Bus. US2 in Ironwood.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperative}} mood is used {{to issue}} orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative {{is used to}} express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> considered rude and is usually used to address children.|$|E
5|$|Two-level utilitarianism is {{virtually}} {{a synthesis of}} the opposing doctrines of act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that in all cases the morally right action is the one which produces the most pleasure, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action is the <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of two-level utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, and rule utilitarianism to the 'intuitive' level.|$|E

5|$|A B {{movie or}} B {{film is a}} low-budget {{commercial}} movie, but <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not an arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased {{by the end of}} the 1950s, the term B movie continues to be used in its broader sense to this day. In its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E
5|$|Although Edward reigned {{for only}} {{six years and}} {{died at the age}} of 15, his reign made a lasting {{contribution}} to the English Reformation and the structure of the Church of England. The last decade of Henry VIII's reign had seen a partial stalling of the Reformation, a drifting back to more conservative values. By contrast, Edward's reign saw radical progress in the Reformation. In those six years, the Church transferred from an essentially Roman Catholic liturgy and structure to <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> usually identified as Protestant. In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's Forty-two Articles formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day. Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley, backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.|$|E

5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E
5|$|Following the Ottoman {{withdrawal}} from Niš in 1878, the tower was roofed over, and in 1892 a chapel was built around it. In 1937, the chapel was renovated. A bust of Sinđelić was added the following year. In 1948, Skull Tower and the chapel enclosing it were declared Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance and {{came under the}} protection of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Further renovation of the chapel occurred again in 1989. As of 2013, 54 skulls remain on the tower. The <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> said to belong to Sinđelić is enclosed in a glass container. Seen as a symbol of independence by Serbs, the tower is mentioned in the writings of French Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine and English travel writer Alexander William Kinglake. In the two centuries since its construction, it has become a popular tourist attraction, visited by between 30,000 and 50,000 people annually.|$|E
