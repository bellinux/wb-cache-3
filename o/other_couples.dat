5|$|Under Dick Stoeffler's management, Kona Lanes kept busy 24 hours a day, {{which made}} him one of the most {{successful}} proprietors in the country. Stoeffler met his future wife there, and <b>other</b> <b>couples</b> had similar experiences. Kona was often so busy that customers had to make reservations to get a lane during open (non-league) bowling hours. At its peak, Kona Lanes averaged more than 80 lines on each of its 40 lanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{perspective}} now hovers {{high above}} Tokyo and enters an airplane, where Oscar's mother breast-feeds {{a baby to}} whom she whispers Oscar's name. The view then drops to Linda and Alex, who take a taxi to a Tokyo love hotel and have sex. The perspective moves among hotel rooms and observes several <b>other</b> <b>couples</b> having sex in various positions. Each couple emanates a pulsating electric-like pink glow from their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's point of view. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's thrusting, then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilization of his sister's ovum. The final scene is shot {{from the perspective of}} a baby being born to Oscar's mother. (According to the director, this is a flashback to Oscar's own birth in the form of a false memory).|$|E

40|$|A {{coupling}} device has a transversely arranged, open-end groove in a flange {{attached to a}} pipe end. The groove in the flange receives a circumferentially arranged locking flange element on the <b>other</b> <b>coupling</b> member and permits alignment of the bores of the coupling members when the locking flange element is in the open end groove. Upon alignment of the bores of the coupling members, a trigger member is activated to automatically release a spring biased tubular member {{in one of the}} coupling members. The tubular member has a conical end which is displaced into the <b>other</b> <b>coupling</b> member to lock the coupling members to one another. A tensioning nut is threadedly movable on a coupling member so as to be moved into tightening engagement with the <b>other</b> <b>coupling</b> member...|$|R

25|$|News of the Stone-Blackwell {{marriage}} sped {{across the}} country after Higginson sent an announcement and copy of their protest to the Worcester Spy.

Fertilised eggs are donated from married couples to other married couples, while unfertilised eggs are donated {{in the context of}} mut'ah or temporary marriage to the father.|$|E

She left memories with her husband and with Charlotte, the oldest surviving sibling, of a very vivacious woman at the parsonage. The younger ones, particularly Emily and Anne, admitted to retaining only vague images of their mother, especially of her suffering in her sickbed.|$|E
25|$|Social lindy hop {{not only}} {{involves}} partners dancing unchoreographed dances, {{but also a}} range of other traditions and activities. Jam circles, are a tradition {{dating back to the}} 1930s and earlier in African American vernacular dance culture, and have much in common with musical cutting contests in jazz. Malcolm X describes 'jam circles' in his autobiography as a loose circle forming around a couple or individual whose dancing was so impressive it captured the attention of dancers around them, who would stop and watch, cheering and clapping. This tradition continues in most lindy hop communities today, with <b>other</b> <b>couples</b> interrupting, joining, or replacing the original couple in the cleared 'circle'. Dancers usually leave or enter {{at the end of a}} musical phrase.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Harry {{inherited}} {{his uncle}} Walter Berry's considerable collection of over 8,000 mostly rare books, a collection he prized but which he also scaled back by giving away hundreds of volumes. He {{was known to}} slip rare first editions into the bookstalls that lined the Seine. Caresse took on lovers of her own, including Ortiz Manolo, Lord Lymington, Jacques Porel, Cord Meier, and in May, 1928, the Count Armand de La Rochefoucauld, son of the duke de Doudeauville, President of the Jockey Club. But behind closed doors, Harry applied a double standard, quarreling violently with Caresse about her affairs. Occasionally they strayed together, as when they met two <b>other</b> <b>couples</b> {{and drove to the}} country near Bois de Boulogne, drew the cars into a circle with their headlights on, and changed partners.|$|E

25|$|The European {{influence}} on Cuba's later musical development {{is represented by}} danzón, an elegant musical form that was once more popular than the Son in Cuba. It is a descendent of the creollized Cuban contradanza. The danzón marks the change from the communal sequence dance style of the late 18th century to the couple dances of later times. The stimulus for this was {{the success of the}} once-scandalous walz, where couples danced facing each other, independently from <b>other</b> <b>couples</b> and not as part of a pre-set structure. The danzón was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods, though {{there is a difference between}} the two dances. The walz is a progressive ballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an anti-clockwise direction; the danzón is a 'pocket-handkerchief' dance where a couple stays within a small area of the floor.|$|E
25|$|On a {{less intense}} scale, other {{relationships}} have been doted upon in the fandom from suggestive hints or explicit statements throughout canon, {{such as those}} between Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson, Harry Potter's parents James Potter and Lily Evans, Rubeus Hagrid and Olympe Maxime, or Percy Weasley and Penelope Clearwater, or Rose Granger-Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy. A potential relationship between Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood was originally dispelled by Rowling, though she later retracted this and said she noticed a slight attraction between them in Deathly Hallows. Some couples, besides Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione, have been explicitly stated in the series: Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are married in Deathly Hallows after dating throughout Half-Blood Prince. In Half-Blood Prince, Nymphadora Tonks keeps her feelings for Remus Lupin to herself, but remains depressed when he refuses her advances; he feels that his being a werewolf would not create a safe relationship. Tonks professes her love {{for him at the}} end of the book, and she and Lupin have been married by the beginning of Deathly Hallows and have a son 'Teddy' later in the book. <b>Other</b> <b>couples,</b> such as Harry and Draco or Lupin and Sirius Black, are favorites among fans who read fan fiction about them. There is also debate about Lily and Severus vs. James.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. <b>Other</b> <b>couples</b> lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E
