5000|$|For German wine, 110 to 128 <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle,</b> {{depending}} on the region (wine growing zone) and grape variety.|$|R
5000|$|In German wine, 76 to 90 <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle,</b> {{depending}} on the region, 1g of moist cloyster (wine growing zone) and grape variety.|$|R
5000|$|For German Eiswein, 110 to 128 <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle,</b> {{the same}} as for Beerenauslese, {{depending}} on the region (wine growing zone) and grape variety.|$|R
5000|$|The wine {{must have}} a must density of between 67 to 82 <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle,</b> {{depending}} on the region (wine growing zone) and grape variety.|$|R
50|$|The mass {{difference}} between equivalent volumes of must and water {{is almost entirely}} due to the dissolved sugar in the must. Since the alcohol in wine is produced by fermentation of the sugar, the Oechsle scale is used to predict the maximal possible alcohol content of the finished wine. This measure is commonly used to select when to harvest grapes. In the vineyard, the must density is usually measured by using a refractometer by crushing a few grapes between the fingers and letting the must drip onto the glass prism of the refractometer. In countries using the Oechsle scale, the refractometer will be calibrated in <b>Oechsle</b> <b>degrees,</b> {{but this is an}} indirect reading, as the refractometer actually measures the refractive index of the grape must, and translates it into Oechsle or different wine must scales, based on their correlation to refractive index.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{requirements}} {{with regard}} to must weight is different for the three categories and depends on the grape variety, but falls in the range 95 to 130 <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Oechsle Scale is a {{hydrometer}} scale {{measuring the}} density of grape must, which {{is an indication of}} grape ripeness and sugar content used in wine-making. It is named for Ferdinand Oechsle (1774-1852) and it is widely used in the German, Swiss and Luxembourgish wine-making industries. On the <b>Oechsle</b> scale, one <b>degree</b> <b>Oechsle</b> (° Oe) corresponds to one gram of the difference between the mass of one litre of must at 20 °C and 1 kg (the mass of 1 litre of water). For example, must with a specific mass of 1084 grams per litre has 84° Oe.|$|R
50|$|He is most {{noted for}} {{developing}} a method for measuring the must weight of the grape must in winemaking. The Oechsle scale, named after him and divided into <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle</b> (°Oe), is still used for official classification of German wine, Swiss wine and Luxembourg wine.|$|R
50|$|Ortega ripens early, is not {{sensitive}} to frost and reaches quite high must weights, typically 20 <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle</b> higher than Müller-Thurgau. It is therefore {{often used for}} sweet wines, which are considered to improve with cellaring. Ortega wines have aromas of Muscat and peach and are high in extract.|$|R
50|$|In Germany and Switzerland it is {{measured}} in <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle</b> (°Oe) and {{is an important part}} of the German wine classification. In Italy, France and Canada the measurement is in degrees Brix, and in the United States it {{is measured}} as specific gravity. In Austria the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (KMW) scale is used. The scale is divided into Klosterneuburger Zuckergrade (°KMW). However, the KMW measures the exact sugar content of the must. The Baumé scale is occasionally used in France and by U.S. brewers. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, must weight {{is measured in}} degrees Normalizovaný moštoměr (°NM).|$|R
2500|$|Since {{more than}} 90% {{of all the}} {{dissolved}} solids in grape juice are sugars, measuring the must weight is a good indicator {{of the amount of}} sugars in the wine. Rather than measure the actual [...] "weight" [...] of the must, the density or specific gravity of the juice is measured in relation to the specific gravity of distilled water. Viticulturists and winemakers can use a refractometer which uses a refractive index to indirectly measure the must weight from the juice of a single grape or they can use a hydrometer in the winery with the juice from several dozen or hundreds of grape berries. Different countries around the world use various scales to measure the must weight of grape juice. In the United States, New Zealand, and parts of Australia it is measured in degrees brix (symbol °Bx); in Germany (wine) it is <b>degrees</b> <b>Oechsle</b> (°Oe); in France and most of Europe the Baumé scale is used and in Austria the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (°KMW) scale is used.|$|R
