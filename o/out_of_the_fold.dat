[...] "On the next Thursday I exhort the family, and will, with God's blessing, so {{wrestle with the}} demon of wrath and violence, which hath entered into my little flock, that I trust to hound the wolf <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold,</b> {{as if he were}} chased away with bandogs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{laugh at}} you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not: my prize is not certain. This is you, {{who have been}} as {{slippery}} as an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> to seek your shepherd, did you, Jane?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is the Good Shepherd, papa. Do you see {{the poor}} sheep, who wandered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold,</b> away into the {{wilderness}} among the rocks and deserts--that is doing wrong, you know, papa. And it lost its way, and the wolf was watching to tear it to pieces, that is Satan; but the Good Shepherd,' and the child bent his head reverently, 'He went after it. Mamma said that means that He touches our hearts and makes us sorry, and it looked up and was ready--as we pray to be made good again. So then He laid it on His shoulders, and carried it safe home to be happy in the fold again. Is He not very good, papa? And only think! There is joy among the Holy Angels in Heaven when one sinner grieves and comes back.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It is {{that bright}} stone which fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> your turban {{a few days}} ago,' she answered, playing with his finger; 'the little stone with all those funny marks upon it. I never saw any stone like it before.' ...|$|R
60|$|He passed <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{night on}} <b>the</b> steps <b>of</b> a mosque, and with <b>the</b> first streaks <b>of</b> dawn {{he took his}} picture <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> his turban. Then, remembering Zelida's words, he inquired {{the way to the}} bazaar, and went {{straight}} to the shop she had described.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not long}} before Linda had told her mother everything. Either by words, or tears, or little signs of mute confession, she made her mother understand, with all but exactness, what had passed between Alaric and herself, and quite exactly what had been the state of her own heart. She sobbed, and wept, and looked up to her mother for {{forgiveness}} as though she had been guilty of a great sin; and when her mother caressed her with all a mother's tenderness, and told her that she was absolved from all fault, free of all blame, she was to a certain degree comforted. Whatever might now happen, her mother would be on her side. But Mrs. Woodward, when she looked into the matter, found that it was she that should have demanded pardon of her daughter, not her daughter of her! Why had this tender lamb been allowed to wander <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold,</b> while a wolf in sheep's clothing was invited into the pasture-ground? ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} the {{shepherd}} went as usual to let the sheep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold,</b> and found one of them missing. He thought directly of the puma, and ran to accuse him of having eaten the sheep. 'I, my good man? What had put it into your head to think of such a thing? Have I got any blood about me? If anyone has eaten a sheep it must be my friend the stag.' Then the shepherd went to examine the sleeping stag, {{and of course he}} saw the blood. 'Ah! I will teach you how to steal!' cried he, and he hit the stag such a blow on his skull that he died in a moment. The noise awakened the comrade above, and he came downstairs. The puma greeted him with joy, and begged he might have some of the famous milk as soon as possible, for he was very thirsty. A large bucket was set before the puma directly. He drank it to the last drop, and then took leave.|$|E
60|$|Finally, he {{lost his}} temper, for be it acknowledged, that this girl was persistent, far from humble, {{and in a way}} as dogmatic as himself. He told her that she was not a Christian, and in her wrath she agreed with him. He said that she had no right to be in church. She replied that if this were so she would not come and, her father being {{indifferent}} upon the point (Lady Jane did not count in such matters), ceased her attendance. It was the old story of a strait-minded bigot forcing a large-minded doubter <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> that ought to have been wide enough for both of them. Moreover, this difference of opinion on matters of public and spiritual interest ended in a private and mundane animosity. Mr. Knight could never forgive a pupil of his own, whose ability he recognized, who dared to question his pontifical announcements. To him the matter was personal rather than one of religious truth, for there are certain minds in whose crucibles everything is resolved individually, and his was one of them. He was the largest matters through his own special and highly-magnifying spectacles. So, to be brief, they quarrelled once and for all, and thenceforward never attempted to conceal their cordial dislike of each other.|$|E

I do so want to get all <b>the</b> dust <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lady's ruff: I wish they'd lock me into the church, and I'd soon get out when I was tired.' ...|$|R
60|$|Gobind lifted an arm {{under his}} vast tattered quilt of many colours, {{and made an}} {{inviting}} little nest by his side. The child crept in, and Gobind filled his brass-studded leather waterpipe with the new tobacco. When I came to the Chubara the shaven head with the tuft atop, and the beady black eyes looked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quilt as a squirrel looks out from his nest, and Gobind was smiling while the child played with his beard.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In {{the first}} place, sir,' said Mr Tappertit, {{producing}} a small pocket-handkerchief and shaking it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds,</b> 'as I have not a card about me (for <b>the</b> envy <b>of</b> masters debases us below that level) {{allow me to}} offer the best substitute that circumstances will admit of. If you will take that in your own hand, sir, and cast {{your eye on the}} right-hand corner,' said Mr Tappertit, offering it with a graceful air, 'you will meet with my credentials.' ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{there are}} {{practices}} against which congregations {{have a right}} to protest, not only as Christians, but as free Englishmen. Congregations {{have a right to}} protest against any minister who introduces obsolete ceremonies which empty his church and drive away his people. Those ceremonies may be quite harmless in themselves, as I really believe most of them are; many of them may be beautiful, and, if properly understood, useful, as I think they are; but a thing may be good in itself, and yet become bad by being used at a wrong time, and in a way which produces harm. And it is shocking, to say the least, to see churches emptied and parishes thrown into war for the sake of such matters. The lightest word which can be used for such conduct is, pedantry; but I fear at times lest the Lord in heaven should be using a far more awful word, and when He sees weak brethren driven from the fold of the Church by the self- will and obstinacy of the very men who profess to desire to bring all into the Church, as the only place where salvation is to be found,--I fear, I say, when I see such deeds, lest the Lord should repeat against them His own awful words: 'If any man scandalize one of these little ones who believeth on Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned {{in the depths of the}} sea.' What sadder mistake? Those who have sworn to seek out Christ's lambs scattered up and down this wicked world, shall they be the very ones to frighten those lambs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold,</b> instead of alluring them back into it? Shall the shepherd play the part, not even of the hireling who flees and leaves the sheep to themselves, but of the very wolf who scatters the flock? God forbid! The Church, like the Sabbath, was made for man, my friends: not man for the Church; and the Son of Man, as He is Lord of the Sabbath, is Lord of the Church, and will have mercy in its dealings rather than sacrifice. The minister, my friends, was made for the people: and not the people for the minister. What else does the very name 'minister' mean? Not a lord who has dominion, but a servant, a servant to all, who must give up again and again his private notions of what he thinks best in itself for the sake of what will be best for his flock; who must be, like St. Paul, a Jew to the Jews; under the law to those who are still under the law; and yet again without law to those who are without law (though not without law to God, but under the law to Christ); weak with the weak; strong with the strong; that he may gain men of all sorts of opinions and characters by agreeing with them as far as he honestly can, and showing his sympathy with each as much as he can; and so become all things to all men, that he may by all means save some. Oh, my friends, who can read honestly that glorious First Epistle to the Corinthians and not see how a man may have the most intense earnestness, the strongest doctrinal certainty, and yet at the same time the greatest freedom, and charity, and liberality about minor matters of ceremonies and Church arrangements, and practical methods of usefulness; glad even that Christ be preached by his enemies, and out of spite to him, because any way Christ is preached? ...|$|E

50|$|In 1998, {{they were}} signed to Punk Core Records {{for the release}} of their debut EP, which sold in excess of 5,000 copies, a {{surprisingly}} high number for a band's debut EP, especially on vinyl format. After the release of their second EP, Annihilation, in 1999 singer Stephanie left the band to be replaced by JJ. JJ sang on their 2001 full-length album Live Fast, Die Young. At that point, with original singer Stephanie <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold,</b> the band decided to change their name to the 99's.

He was only half reassured by this assumption of superior detachment. He trusted to the man's self-interest more; for Daman no doubt looked to the reconquered kingdom for <b>the</b> reward <b>of</b> dignity and ease. His father and grandfather (<b>the</b> men <b>of</b> whom Jorgenson had written as having been hanged for an example twelve years before) had been friends of Sultans, advisers of Rulers, wealthy financiers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great raiding expeditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past.

50|$|The Slovak {{social democrats}} had decided {{at their first}} {{congress}} in Pressburg in June 1905 to form a party of their own, breaking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party. However the Slovak social democrats were unable to wrest control over trade unions, {{the main source of}} financial means for the social democratic parties, from the Hungarian Social Democratic Party. Thus the following year the Second Slovak Social Democratic Congress, held in March 1906, resolved to reunite with the Hungarian party as the Slovak Executive Committee. The Slovak Executive Committee rallied Slovak workers in Hungary for the social democratic cause. The organization had a high degree of political autonomy. It sent its own delegations to the congresses of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party. There was however criticism within the Hungarian Social Democratic Party that the Slovak Executive Committee espoused separatism and were funded by the Czechoslav party leadership in Prague.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{compression}} {{dominated by}} hinge migration, yields tightening of folds and space accommodation issues within the anticlinal core; leading to <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> disharmonic <b>folds</b> [...] [...] Epard and Groshong, (1994) recognize {{a similar pattern}} to disharmonic folding they label it second-order shortening. [...] Basic models and experiments [...] as well as concentric fold models fail to recognize disharmonic folds as they focus on single layer detachment <b>folding,</b> lack <b>the</b> resolution in experimental methods or, though <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> multiple units is made, restrict unit parameters which may cause disharmony through deformation.
