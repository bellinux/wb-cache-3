Our approach identifies the <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> {{over the sound}} as a fundamental element in the synthesis process. We developed our synthesis model as a cooperative system of two sub-models, <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> parameters providing the interface between them. The two sub-parts are the instrument model, which takes sources of <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> signals as input and produces an audio output, and the performance model, which takes some symbolic representation of music as an input, and produces control signals. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new control algorithm for obtaining <b>continuous</b> sliding mode <b>control,</b> based on integral sliding-mode control (ISMC), where the discontinuous {{part of the}} ISMC is replaced with a <b>continuous</b> <b>control.</b> It is shown that the well-known super twisting control (STC), which replaces the discontinuous part of the ISMC acts as a disturbance observer, and hence, cancels the matched disturbance. As the <b>overall</b> controller is <b>continuous</b> the proposed method is advantageous over the existing ISMC, which has a discontinuous term. Also from the practical implementation point of view, in particular for mechanical systems, discontinuous term will result in chattering, which is undesirable. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on a practical system and its superiority has been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{paradigm}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> using inter-nal models has advanced {{understanding of human}} motor control. However, this paradigm ignores some aspects of human control, including intermittent feedback, serial bal-listic control, triggered responses and refractory periods. It is shown that event-driven intermittent control provides a framework to explain the behaviour of the human oper-ator under {{a wider range of}} conditions than <b>continuous</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Continuous</b> <b>control</b> is included as a special case, but sampling, system matched hold, an intermittent pre-dictor and an event trigger allow serial open-loop trajecto-ries using intermittent feedback. The implementation here may be described as “continuous observation, intermittent action”. Beyond explaining unimodal regulation distribu-tions in common with <b>continuous</b> <b>control,</b> these features naturally explain refractoriness and bimodal stabilisation distributions observed in double stimulus tracking experi-ments and quiet standing, respectively.

A <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> algorithm with no velocity information will be presented, for which strong stability properties can be proved even under non-vanishing disturbances. As propulsion systems of spacecraft usually do not provide continuous actuation, such results, reported numerous times in the literature, might have limited practical importance. We will therefore show that due to the strong stability properties, similar stability results can also be achieved under certain quantization schemes of the <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> signal, which may extend the area of application of <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> schemes for spacecraft...|$|R

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> using internal models has advanced {{understanding of human}} motor control. However, this paradigm ignores some aspects of human control, including intermittent feedback, serial ballistic control, triggered responses and refractory periods. It is shown that event-driven intermittent control provides a framework to explain the behaviour of the human operator under {{a wider range of}} conditions than <b>continuous</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Continuous</b> <b>control</b> is included as a special case, but sampling, system matched hold, an intermittent predictor and an event trigger allow serial open-loop trajectories using intermittent feedback. The implementation here may be described as "continuous observation, intermittent action". Beyond explaining unimodal regulation distributions in common with <b>continuous</b> <b>control,</b> these features naturally explain refractoriness and bimodal stabilisation distributions observed in double stimulus tracking experiments and quiet standing, respectively. Moreover, given that human control systems contain significant time delays, a biological-cybernetic rationale favours intermittent over continuous control: intermittent predictive control is computationally less demanding than <b>continuous</b> predictive <b>control.</b> A standard continuous-time predictive control model of the human operator is used as the underlying design method for an event-driven intermittent controller. It is shown that when event thresholds are small and sampling is regular, the intermittent controller can masquerade as the underlying continuous-time controller and thus, under these conditions, the continuous-time and intermittent controller cannot be distinguished. This explains why the intermittent control hypothesis is consistent with the <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> hypothesis for certain experimental conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{semi-active}} (SA) control techniques appear {{a realistic}} way to adopt active control in structural engineering. This paper reports an exploratory study on SA <b>continuous</b> <b>control,</b> where the mechanical {{parameters of the}} devices may continuously assume any value between the given limits. First, a Lyapounov-based control strategy for SA <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> is proposed and studied for base-excited structures. The obtained <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> process is initially applied to a seismic-excited single-DOF structure with a variable stiffness device, in order to study {{the dynamics of the}} controlled system and the optimal configuration of the algorithm. Successively, the optimized control strategy is applied to single-DOF structures with more realistic SA elasto-plastic devices, and the performances of SA <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> are compared with the ones of passive and SA ON–OFF control cases. Finally, the obtained results are verified and confirmed in the application to a 4 -storey Multi-DOF-framed structure, equipped with continuously variable SA magnetorheological dampers. The study shows the applicability and the possible advantages of the proposed control case, also in comparison with passive and SA ON–OFF cases. Generally it may be stated that the best performances in terms of structural displacements may be obtained by using ON–OFF SA <b>control.</b> Differently, <b>continuous</b> SA <b>control</b> significantly reduces the absolute accelerations and the total forces transmitted to the structures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Regulation {{based on}} <b>Continuous</b> <b>Control</b> Monitoring {{could reduce the}} {{administrative}} burden for companies. Often, companies already have elaborate internal control and quality management systems. Instead of periodic physical inspections, regulatory supervision can partly be automated and performed on a continuous basis. The regulator gets access to a validated copy of key data elements from the company‟s internal information systems, which serve as indicator of compliance to specific control objectives. In this paper we describe an information architecture for <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> monitoring, and show {{how it can be}} applied to supervision of regulatory compliance. The approach is illustrated by a pilot project in the Netherlands of applying <b>continuous</b> <b>control</b> monitoring to food safety regulations in the meat processing industry.
