5|$|In late 1962, US16 was {{decommissioned}} in {{the state}} of Michigan as Interstate 96 (I-96) was completed. With the removal of US16, several highways were rerouted through Lansing.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of {{terminating}} in {{the park}} at the outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed to follow US16 to the car ferry docks. The last section of gravel highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US131 freeway was opened north <b>of</b> <b>Cedar</b> Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was restored to the Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway it used in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US131 again.|$|E

5|$|Named for mid-19thcentury settler, Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon, Sr., {{the creek}} ran through forests <b>of</b> <b>cedar</b> and fir that were later logged by the Oregon Iron Company and others through the mid-20thcentury. Efforts to {{establish}} a large park in the watershed began in the 1950s and succeeded in 1975 when the state park was formally established. As of 2005, about 37percent of the watershed was wooded and supported more than 60species of birds as well as small mammals, amphibians, and fish. At the same time, the human population was about 18,000.|$|E
5|$|North <b>of</b> <b>Cedar</b> Brook, {{the route}} {{traverses}} CR 536, becoming Cedarbrook Road.

Past this intersection, Route 73 becomes an unnamed road and encounters CR 710 at a four-way intersection. A short distance later, the route enters Waterford Township and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 30 (White Horse Pike) and County Route 536 Spur.|$|E

5|$|On the Reinanzaka House, the labourers were {{skilled in}} the use of wood, and helped Raymond engrain the texture <b>of</b> <b>cedar</b> onto the concrete. This was further {{explored}} on the Tetsuma Akaboshi and the Morinosuke Kawasaki houses, where the concrete walls of the luxurious interiors were imprinted with cypress textures. On the Karuizawa Studio, workmen polished the concrete with sand and straw to reveal the texture of the aggregate. Whilst at Nanzan University, the south facing facades were cast with checkerboard patterns, with applied metalwork casting abstract shadows on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Originally themed {{around the}} Middle Ages, Medieval Faire is {{a section of}} Canada's Wonderland, a theme park in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. As such, early attractions created under Kings Entertainment Company were named after knights, Don Quixote, Vikings, dragons, bats, and beasts.

The introduction of the Leviathan roller coaster to Medieval Faire in 2012 {{was the first major}} investment in the section since 2000; the park is now under ownership <b>of</b> <b>Cedar</b> Fair. The section includes four roller coasters (The Bat, Dragon Fire, Leviathan, and Wild Beast) and six other rides.|$|E

Marked as Old US27 on maps, the business route follows Cedar Street northeasterly and transitions onto East Street. The highway runs through residential areas on the north side of Lansing.

5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Cedar Point {{was in need of}} {{financial}} help. The wood of the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president <b>of</b> <b>Cedar</b> Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Point {{has had a}} {{cultural}} influence on American society as evidenced in many forms of media such as books, television, and film. In the 1940 biographical film Knute Rockne, All American documenting the life of famous Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, Cedar Point is featured at a pivotal point in the story. In 1913, Knute works as a lifeguard on a beach at Cedar Point, {{where he and his}} college roommate Gus Dorais worked on the forward pass. The concept, which was first used in a scrimmage game at Cedar Point, would revolutionize the sport and the film would later be preserved in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 2004, an independently-produced film, Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Infestation From Mars, was shot at several historic locations around Sandusky including Cedar Point. Dick Kinzel, CEO <b>of</b> <b>Cedar</b> Fair at the time, had a brief speaking role in the film.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of partisans under Lieutenant Elijah Clarke. This unit was pursued by British Major Patrick Ferguson. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering peaches from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson's men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and drove back the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach them. Now safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Cedar</b> Springs.|$|E
