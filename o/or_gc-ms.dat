25|$|A common {{combination}} is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS <b>or</b> <b>GC-MS).</b> In this technique, a gas chromatograph {{is used to}} separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the ion source, a metallic filament to which voltage is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds.

50|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an analytical chemistry technique that measures {{the absorption of}} radiofrequency radiation of specific nuclei when molecules containing those nuclei are placed in strong magnetic fields. The frequency (i.e. the chemical shift) at which a given atom or nucleus absorbs is highly dependent on the chemical environment (bonding, chemical structure nearest neighbours, solvent) of that atom in a given molecule. The NMR absorption patterns produce “resonance” peaks at different frequencies or different chemical shifts - this collection of peaks is called a NMR spectrum. Because each chemical compound has a different chemical structure, each compound will have a unique (or almost unique) NMR spectrum. As a result, NMR is particularly useful for the characterization, identification and quantification of small molecules, such as metabolites. The widespread use of NMR for “classical” metabolic studies, along with its exceptional capacity to handle complex metabolite mixtures is likely the reason why NMR {{was one of the}} first technologies to be widely adopted for routine metabolome measurements. As an analytical technique, NMR is non-destructive, non-biased, easily quantifiable, requires little or no separation, permits the identification of novel compounds and it needs no chemical derivatization. NMR is particularly amenable to detecting compounds that are less tractable to LC-MS analysis, such as sugars, amines or volatile liquids <b>or</b> <b>GC-MS</b> analysis, such as large molecules (>500 Da) or relatively non-reactive compounds. NMR is not a very sensitive technique with a lower limit of detection of about 5 µM. Typically 50-150 compounds can be identified by NMR-based metabolomic studies.|$|E

One non-targeted metabolomics approach attempts to identify and interrogate all small molecules in a sample using GC or LC separation followed by MS or MS n detection.

This method accounts for all ions in a sample spectrum, performs library matches, and allows review of the data to quality check library entries. The QUICS method identifies ions related to any given metabolite by correlating ion data across the complete set of experimental samples, thus revealing subtle spectral trends that may not be evident when viewing individual samples and are likely to be indicative of the presence of one or more otherwise obscured metabolites.

The presence of DHCEO in SLOS samples was supported by chemical derivatization {{in the presence of}} d 7 -DHCEO standard followed by HPLC-MS <b>or</b> <b>GC-MS</b> analysis. Quantification of cholesterol, 7 -DHC, and DHCEO was carried out by isotope dilution MS with the d 7 -standards. The level of DHCEO was high and correlated well with the level of 7 -DHC in all samples examined (R = 0. 9851). Based on our in vitro studies in two different cell lines, the mechanism of formation of DHCEO that involves 5 α, 6 α-epoxycholest- 7 -en- 3 β-ol, a primary free radical oxidation product of 7 -DHC, and 7 -cholesten- 3 β, 5 α, 6 β-triol is proposed. In a preliminary test, a pyrimidinol antioxidant was found to effectively suppress the formation of DHCEO in SLOS fibroblasts...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Since 2007 the Dutch Association for Quality Assessment in Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (KKGT) has {{organized}} an international interlaboratory proficiency testing (PT) programme for measurement of antifungal drugs in plasma. We describe the 5 year {{results of the}} laboratories' performance. METHODS: Twice a year, laboratories received a set of blind plasma samples containing low or high concentrations of fluconazole, itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole and flucytosine. Participating laboratories were asked to report their results within 6 weeks after dispatch and provide details of their analytical methods. Results deviating > 20 % from the weighed-in concentration were considered inaccurate. Four-way ANOVA was performed to assess the effect of antifungal drug measured, concentration, analytical method and performing laboratory on the absolute inaccuracy. In 2012, a questionnaire based on the CLSI guidelines was dispatched with the request to provide input on sources of error. RESULTS: Fifty-seven laboratories (13 countries) reported 2251 results (287 fluconazole, 451 itraconazole, 348 hydroxyitraconazole, 402 posaconazole, 652 voriconazole and 111 flucytosine) in 5 years. Analyses were performed using HPLC (55. 0 %), LC-MS(/MS) (43. 4 %), UPLC (1. 4 %) <b>or</b> <b>GC-MS</b> (0. 2 %). Overall, 432 (19. 2 %) analyses were inaccurate. The performing laboratory was the only factor clearly associated with inaccuracies. The questionnaire results indicated that laboratories encounter significant problems analysing low concentrations (15. 4 % of all inaccuracies). CONCLUSIONS: Results of the PT programme suggest {{that one out of}} five measurements is inaccurate. The performing laboratory is the main determinant of inaccuracy, suggesting that internal quality assurance is pivotal in preventing inaccuracies, irrespective of the antifungal drug measured, concentration and analytical equipment...|$|E
40|$|Polynitro organic {{explosives}} [hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX), octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine (HMX) and 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) ] {{are typical}} labile environmental pollutants that can biotransform with soil indigenous microorganisms, photodegrade by sunlight and migrate through subsurface soil to cause groundwater contamination. To {{be able to}} determine the type and concentration of explosives and their (bio) transformation products in different soil environments, a comprehensive analytical methodology of sample preparation, separation and detection is thus required. The present paper describes the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2), acetonitrile (MeCN) (US Environmental Protection Agency Method 8330) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for the extraction of explosives and their degradation products from various water, soil and plant tissue samples for subsequent analysis by either HPLC-UV, capillary electrophoresis (CE-UV) <b>or</b> <b>GC-MS.</b> Contaminated surface and subsurface soil and groundwater were collected from either a TNT manufacturing facility or an anti-tank firing range. Plant tissue samples were taken fromplants grown in anti-tank firing range soil in a greenhouse experiment. All tested soil and groundwater samples from the former TNT manufacturing plant were found to contain TNT and some of its amino reduced and partially denitrated products. Their concentrations as determined by SPME-GC-MS and LC-UV depended on the location of sampling at the site. In the case of plant tissues, SC-CO 2 extraction followed by CE-UV analysis showed only the presence of HMX. The concentrations of HMX (300 mg/kg). Modifiers such as MeCN and water enhanced the SC-CO 2 extractability of HMX from plant tissues. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Crude Sardinella longiceps oil was refined in {{different}} stages such as degumming, neutralization, bleaching, and deodorization. The efficiency {{of these processes}} was evaluated {{on the basis of}} free fatty acid (FFA), peroxide (PV), p-anisidine (pAV), total oxidation (TOTOX), thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) values, Lovibond CIE-L*a*b* color analyses, and (1) H NMR <b>or</b> <b>GC-MS</b> experiments. The utilities of NMR-based proton signal characteristics as new analytical tools to understand the signature peaks and relative abundance of different fatty acids and monitoring the refining process of fish oil have been demonstrated. Phosphoric acid (1 %) was found to be an effective degumming reagent to obtain oil with the lowest FFA, PV, pAV, TOTOX, and TBARS values and highest color reduction. Significant reduction in the contents of hydrocarbon functionalities as shown by the decrease in proton integral in the characteristic (1) H NMR region was demonstrated by using 1 % H 3 PO 4 {{during the course of the}} degumming process. A combination (1. 25 : 3. 75 %) of activated charcoal and Fuller's earth at 3 % concentration for a stirring time of 40 min was found to be effective in bleaching the sardine oil. This study demonstrated that unfavorable odor-causing components, particularly low molecular weight carbonyl compounds, could successfully be removed by the refining process. The alkane-dienals/alkanes, which cause unfavorable fishy odors, were successfully removed by distillation (100 °C) under vacuum with aqueous acetic acid solution (0. 25 N) to obtain greater quality of refined sardine oil, a rich source of essential fatty acids and improved oxidative stability. The present study demonstrated that the four-stage refinement process of sardine oil resulted in a significant improvement in quality characteristics and nutritional values, particularly n- 3 PUFAs, with improved fish oil characteristics for use in the pharmaceutical and functional food industries...|$|E
40|$|Texto completo. Acesso restrito. p. 314 – 320 The {{assessment}} of damage to indoor cultural heritage, in particular by pollutants, is nowadays a major and growing concern for curators and conservators. Nevertheless, although many museums have been widely investigated in Europe, the effects of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants in museums under tropical and subtropical climates and with different economic realities are still unclear. An important portion of the world's cultural heritage is currently in tropical countries where both human and financial resources for preserving museum collections are limited. Hence, our aim is to assess the damage that can be caused to the artwork by pollution in hot and humid environments, where air quality and microclimatic condition differences can cause deterioration. As a case study, particulate matter as well as gases were collected at the Oscar Niemeyer Museum (MON) in Curitiba, Brazil, where large modern and contemporary works of art are displayed. NO 2, SO 2, O 3, Acetic Acid, Formic Acids and BTEX, in the ambient air, were sampled by means of passive diffusive sampling and their concentrations were determined by IC <b>or</b> <b>GC–MS.</b> The particulate matter was collected in bulk form and analyzed {{with the use of}} energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and aethalometer. The chemical compositions of individual particles were quantitatively elucidated, including low-Z components like C, N and O, as well as higher-Z elements, using automated electron probe microanalysis. The gaseous and particulate matter levels were then compared with the concentrations obtained for the same pollutants in other museums, located in places with different climates, and with some reference values provided by international cultural heritage conservation centers. Results are interpreted separately and as a whole with the specific aim of identifying compounds that could contribute to the chemical reactions taking place on the surfaces of artifacts and which could potentially cause irreversible damage to the artworks...|$|E
