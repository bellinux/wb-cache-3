5|$|After Varus' {{defeat in}} Germania in the 1st century, Rome had adopted a largely {{defensive}} strategy {{along the border}} with Germania, constructing a line of defences known as limes along the Rhine. Although the exact historicity is unclear, since the Romans often assigned <b>one</b> <b>name</b> to several distinct tribal groups, or conversely applied several names to a single group at different times, some mix of Germanic peoples, Celts, and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands of Germania from the 1st century onwards. The Cherusci, Bructeri, Tencteri, Usipi, Marsi, and Chatti of Varus' time had by the 3rd century either evolved into or been displaced by a confederacy or alliance of Germanic tribes collectively known as the Alamanni, first mentioned by Cassius Dio describing the campaign of Caracalla in 213 AD.|$|E
5|$|At the 22nd {{hurricane}} {{committee in}} 2000 {{it was decided}} that tropical cyclones that moved from the Atlantic to the Eastern Pacific basin and vice versa would no longer be renamed. Ahead of the 2000–01 season it was decided to start using male names, as well as female names for tropical cyclones developing in the South-West Indian Ocean. RSMC La Reunion subsequently proposed to the fifteenth session of the RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South-West Indian Ocean during September 2001, that the basin adopt a single circular list of names. Along with the RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee, RSMC La Reunion also proposed to the session that a tropical cyclone have only <b>one</b> <b>name</b> during its lifetime. However, both of these proposals were rejected in favour of continuing an annual list of names and to rename systems when they moved across 90°E into the South-West Indian Ocean. During the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season the naming of subtropical cyclones restarted, with names assigned to systems from the main list of names drawn up for that year.|$|E
5|$|Construction of I-496 {{started in}} 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of {{downtown}} Lansing {{were built in}} the location of a historically black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved <b>one</b> <b>name</b> in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy XIV {{takes place}} in a high fantasy setting. The main {{location}} is Eorzea, a continent on the larger planet Hydaelyn: this contrasts Final Fantasy XI which uses <b>one</b> <b>name</b> to refer to the entire world and its regions. Eorzea is broken up among three main powers: the forest nation of Gridania; the desert-based Ul'dah sultanate; and the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa, Eorzea's dominant maritime power. Other important locations include the scholarly city-state of Sharlayan and the Garlean Empire, a hostile northern power with highly developed technology. Five years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Garlean Empire invaded the land of Ala Migho, but were prevented from conquering Eorzea by the attacks of the ancient dragon Midgardsomr and his dragon hordes. In response to the Empire's threat, the three nations of Eorzea reform the Grand Companies, comprehensive centers of command which combine the cities' military and economic assets. The Grand Companies attracted people from all walks of life, who take up the mantle of Adventurers.|$|E

50|$|A {{combination}} of a Dutch title with an international title is not allowed, except for some limited number of international professional titles. Thus, one should choose either one's classical Dutch title, or use the shortcut provided by the law following <b>one's</b> <b>name</b> (since September 1, 2002 it is the other way around: those who hold Dutch degrees as MSc, LLM or MA may optionally use the old-style shortcuts before their names). Hence, formal use of the Anglo-Saxon PhD following <b>one's</b> <b>name</b> is not legal, as {{it is not a}} Dutch degree. However, its use is commonly used for clarity towards international readers, for example English publications. The law provides the option of using the shortcut D following <b>one's</b> <b>name</b> instead of dr. before <b>one's</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R

This reflects an anomalous coincidental situation wherein 10counties begin with B, seven with C and four with L, which is 21 of the 44counties.|$|E
25|$|After the {{rejection}} from Madruzzo, Cardinal Montalto offered the Spanish five names: Aldobrandini, Lauro, Valiero, Salviati and Medici, {{and asked them}} to pick <b>one</b> <b>name.</b> King rejected all five of them therefore none of them was elected. As a result of prolonged sede vacante, more and more chaos reigned on the streets. During November, disagreements amongst Cardinals increased instead of decreasing. The main opponent of the Spanish faction was Cardinal Montalto.|$|E

25|$|Beginning with Denmark in 1989, {{civil unions}} under <b>one</b> <b>name</b> or another have been {{established}} by law in several, mostly developed, countries {{in order to provide}} legal recognition of relationships formed by unmarried same-sex couples and to afford them rights, benefits, tax breaks, and responsibilities similar or identical to those of legally married couples. In Brazil, civil unions were first created for opposite-sex couples in 2002, and then expanded to include same-sex unions through judicial decision nine years later.|$|E
