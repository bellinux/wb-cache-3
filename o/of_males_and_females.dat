5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} paternity seen in V. acadica {{leads to}} a lower relatedness between worker and their sisters, but not between workers and their brothers.

Estimates of sex ratios indicate that near equal numbers <b>of</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> are produced. However, the queens are much larger in size than males which suggests sex allocation is biased towards females in a significant ratio.|$|E
