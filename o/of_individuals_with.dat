5|$|Abuse during {{childhood}} is {{accepted as a}} primary social factor increasing the incidence of self-harm, as is bereavement, and troubled parental or partner relationships. Factors such as war, poverty, and unemployment may also contribute. Self-harm is frequently described as an experience of depersonalisation or a dissociative state. As many as 70% <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> borderline personality disorder engage in self-harm. An estimated 30% <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorders engage in self-harm at some point, including eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting, and head-banging.|$|E

A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen. These common signs are supportive of the diagnosis, but are non-specific findings.|$|E

40|$|SETTING: Thyolo district, Malawi. OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} in HIV-positive individuals aged over 13 years CD 4 {{lymphocyte counts}} in patients classified as WHO Clinical Stage III and IV and patients with active and previous tuberculosis (TB). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: CD 4 lymphocyte counts were determined in all consecutive HIV-positive individuals presenting to the antiretroviral clinic in WHO Stage III and IV. RESULTS: A CD 4 lymphocyte count of < or = 350 cells/microl {{was found in}} 413 (90 %) <b>of</b> 457 <b>individuals</b> in WHO Stage III and IV, 96 % <b>of</b> 77 <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> active TB, 92 % <b>of</b> 65 <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> a history <b>of</b> pulmonary TB (PTB) in the last year, 91 % <b>of</b> 89 <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> a previous history of PTB beyond 1 year, 81 % <b>of</b> 32 <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> a previous history of extra-pulmonary TB, 93 % <b>of</b> 107 <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> active or past TB with another HIV-related disease and 89 % <b>of</b> 158 <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> active or past TB without another HIV-related disease. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, nine <b>of</b> 10 HIV-positive <b>individuals</b> presenting in WHO Stage III and IV and with active or previous TB have CD 4 counts of < or = 350 cells/microl. It would thus be reasonable, in this or similar settings where CD 4 counts are unavailable for clinical management, for all such patients to be considered eligible for antiretroviral therapy...|$|R

40|$|Background: Available {{literature}} {{shows that}} studies with careful analysis of result were less in number, especially on impact of social network among caregivers <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>with</b> alcohol dependence syndrome. Aim: To study {{the influence of}} social network among caregivers <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>with</b> alcohol dependence syndrome. Material and methods: A pre and post with control group design was adopted {{for the present study}} sampling design. Samples were selected by using the purposive sampling method, from the Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry & Allied Sciences. Ten caregivers in experimental and ten in control group were recruited. The researchers administered socio-demographic interview schedule and clinical data sheet, General Health Questionnaire- 12 (GHQ- 12), and Social Support Questionnaire. Results: Result shows comparison of scores obtained after intervention in experimental group and control group. Social support mean was 45. 60 ± 4. 14 and 41. 60 ± 3. 56 in experimental and control group respectively. It shows there was significant difference between both groups, social support (Z= 2. 05, p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The finding indicates social network among caregivers <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> <b>with</b> alcohol dependence plays pivotal role in improving the social support system of caregivers, protecting them from becoming prey of loneliness and aloofness...|$|R
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E

5|$|Azelaic acid {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide5%, isotretinoin0.05%, and erythromycin2%. Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{medical records}} show that {{epilepsy}} has been affecting people {{at least since the}} beginning of recorded history.

The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a Moon god, and underwent an exorcism.

5|$|There is no {{cure for}} psoriasis; however, various {{treatments}} can help control the symptoms. These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light and immune system suppressing medications, such as methotrexate. About 75 percent of cases can be managed with creams alone. The disease affects two to four percent of the population. Men and women are affected with equal frequency. The disease may begin at any age, but typically starts in adulthood.

5|$|About a {{third to}} a half <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily {{communication}} needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ASD show unusual abilities, {{ranging from}} splinter {{skills such as}} the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, {{although there is no}} good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.|$|E
