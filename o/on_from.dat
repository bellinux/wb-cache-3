5|$|A badly wounded Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) {{returns to}} camp {{and tells the}} others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides the plane {{survivors}}. Locke looks <b>on</b> <b>from</b> the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously.|$|E
5|$|As {{production}} began, Callaghan, Andrew Goldberg, Mark Hentemann, Patrick Meighan, Brian Scully, Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, John Viener and Wellesley Wild all stayed <b>on</b> <b>from</b> {{the previous}} season. Spencer Porter received his first writing {{credit for the}} series. Former recurring writers Kirker Butler and Gary Janetti returned to the series, with Butler leaving immediately afterward to work on The Cleveland Show. Matt Fleckenstein, who wrote two episodes for the show, left the series {{before the beginning of}} the eighth season.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired <b>on</b> <b>from</b> the compound {{and from a}} nearby position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US {{troops on the ground}} with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E

Moore made a connected work in 1961, also inspired by bone, Standing Figure (Knife Edge) (LH 482).|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1990s, {{the debt}} markets were {{improving}} and KKR had moved <b>on</b> <b>from</b> the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR {{was able to}} complete the bulk of fundraising for {{what was then a}} record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund. However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media. KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the process}} that was {{to lead to the}} 1996 Doctor Who film, Universal Television had Amblin Entertainment produce a writers' bible which {{detailed}} John Leekley's proposed pilot and episodes of a new series. The new series would have established a new continuity rather than following <b>on</b> <b>from</b> the classic series, and the bible reused many elements from the classic series. It is unclear whether clearance could have been obtained for all the episodes detailed, as the costs would likely have fallen to the BBC.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>on</b> <b>from</b> Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>on</b> <b>from</b> those performances, Key {{joined the}} England Under-17 squad for the International Youth Tournament, which {{was being held}} in Bermuda.

Key's performances helped England win the tournament by a single point from Ireland's Under-17s.|$|E

5|$|Gripen NG: {{improved}} version following <b>on</b> <b>from</b> the Gripen Demo technology demonstrator. Changes {{from the}} JAS 39C/D include {{the more powerful}} F414G engine, Raven ES-05 AESA radar, increased fuel capacity and payload, two additional hardpoints, and other improvements. These improvements have reportedly increased the Gripen NG costs to an estimated 24,000 Swiss Francs (US$27,000) per hour, and increased the flyaway cost to 100 million Swiss Francs (US$113M).|$|E
5|$|He {{registered}} his {{century in}} 115 minutes, clouting another five balls over the boundary {{in the morning}} session. One of Miller's sixes travelled over 170m {{in the air to}} Block Q next to the pavilion. He then aimed a lofted shot over long <b>on</b> <b>from</b> the bowling of Hollies, directly at the pavilion. It was still rising when it narrowly went over the press box and clipped the top of the roof. Test spinner James Langridge was brought on and Miller deposited two drives over the fence in his first over.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Pegasus Books {{published}} The Tragedy of Macbeth Part II: The Seed of Banquo, a play by American {{author and}} playwright Noah Lukeman that endeavoured {{to pick up}} where the original Macbeth left off, and to resolve its many loose ends, particularly the prophesied ascension of the seed of Banquo. Written in blank verse, the play was published to critical acclaim. Another book published in 2009 by Penguin Books, Banquo's Son, is the first in a trilogy that follows <b>on</b> <b>from</b> the Shakespearean story. The novels are written by New Zealand author and English teacher, T.K. Roxborogh.|$|E

5|$|No other {{spacecraft}} {{has ever}} visited the Uranian system or Titania, and no mission is currently planned.

Uranus was also examined {{as part of}} one trajectory for a precursor interstellar probe concept, Innovative Interstellar Explorer.|$|E
5|$|On Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, {{units of}} the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army seized several {{prominent}} buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the General Post Office (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings nearest the Pillar. They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government. One of the first recorded actions of the Easter Rising occurred near the Pillar when lancers from the nearby Marlborough Street barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired <b>on</b> <b>from</b> the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead.|$|E
