In particular we show that up till the phase transition {{the complexity of the}} <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> is almost linear in n, and that after the phase transition, the complexity of the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> is roughly proportional to √ n.

500|$|The book {{thickness}} {{of a given}} graph [...] is at most one {{if and only if}} [...] is an outerplanar graph. An outerplanar graph is a graph that has a planar embedding in which all vertices belong to the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of the embedding. For such a graph, placing the vertices in the same order along the spine as they appear in the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> provides a one-page book embedding of the given graph. (An articulation point of the graph will necessarily appear more than once in the cyclic ordering of vertices around the <b>outer</b> <b>face,</b> but only one of those copies {{should be included in the}} book embedding.) Conversely, a one-page book embedding is automatically an outerplanar embedding. For, if a graph is embedded on a single page, and another half-plane is attached to the spine to extend its page to a complete plane, then the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> of the embedding includes the entire added half-plane, and all vertices lie on this <b>outer</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: A graph is a {{collection}} of vertices and of the unordered pairs of adjacent vertices, or edges. A graph is called matchstick if there exists an embedding in the plane, such that every pair of adjacent vertices are unit distant and edges do notoverlap. If every vertex has r edges emanating from it, then the graph is called r-regular. The regions bounded by s-gons in a graph are called faces. The region exterior to the graph is also a <b>face,</b> called the <b>outer</b> <b>face.</b> Any vertex not on the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> is called an inner vertex. An r-regular matchstick graph is called incomplete if the inner vertices all have degree r, but the vertices on the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> have degree at most r. If every vertex on the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> also has degree r, then the graph is called complete. To measure how incomplete a graph is, we consider: Where K is the set of all vertices on the <b>outer</b> <b>face,</b> k is the cardinality of K, and δ(v) is the degree of the vertex, v.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show several results about {{monotone}} planar circuits. We show that monotone planar circuits of bounded width, {{with access to}} negated input variables, compute exactly the functions in non-uniform AC 0.

We show that the circuit value problem for monotone planar circuits, with inputs on the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> only, can be solved in LOGDCFL ` SC, improving a LOGCFL upper bound due to Dymond and Cook. We show that for monotone planar circuits, with inputs on the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> only, excessive depth compared to width is useless; any function computed by a monotone planar circuit of width w with inputs on the <b>outer</b> <b>face</b> can be computed by a monotone planar circuit of width O(w) and depth w O(1).
