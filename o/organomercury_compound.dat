5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an <b>organomercury</b> <b>compound</b> used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from vaccines {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines. It is still used in all multi-dose vials of flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E

It took 9 more years until the government officially acknowledged mercury-containing effluent from local acetaldehyde chemical plants to be the cause of Minamata disease. Since then, victims of the Minamata disease have been compensated by Chisso and both local and national governments thanks to won lawsuits and official relief programmes.|$|E

40|$|Type IA topoisomerase {{activities}} {{are essential for}} resolving DNA topological barriers via an enzyme-mediated transient single strand DNA break. Accumulation of topoisomerase DNA cleavage product can lead to cell death or genomic rearrangement. Many antibacterial and anticancer drugs act as topoisomerase poison inhibitors that form stabilized ternary complexes with the topoisomerase covalent intermediate, so it is desirable to identify such inhibitors for type IA topoisomerases. Here we report that <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> were identified during a fluorescence based screening of the NIH diversity set of small molecules for topoisomerase inhibitors that can increase the DNA cleavage product of Yersinia pestis topoisomerase I. Inhibition of relaxation activity and accumulation of DNA cleavage product were confirmed for these <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> in gel based assays of Escherichia coli topoisomerase I. Hg(II), but not As(III), could also target the cysteines that form the multiple Zn(II) binding tetra-cysteine motifs found in the C-terminal domains of these bacterial topoisomerase I for relaxation activity inhibition. Mycobacterium tuberculosis topoisomerase I activity is not sensitive to Hg(II) or the <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> due {{to the absence of}} the Zn(II) binding cysteines. It is significant that the type IA topoisomerases with Zn(II) binding domains can still cleave DNA when interfered by Hg(II) or <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds.</b> The Zn(II) binding domains found in human Top 3 α and Top 3 β may be potential targets of toxic metals and organometallic complexes, with potential consequence on genomic stability and development...|$|R

50|$|Rosefuran was {{synthesized}} in 1968 by George Büchi via the <b>organomercury</b> <b>compound</b> bis(3-methyl-2-furyl)mercury. Rosefuran {{has been}} synthesized in many steps from common starting materials starting with prenyl chloride (3-methyl-but-2-en-1-yl chloride).

Rosefuran has also been prepared via palladium catalyzed cross coupling of the methyl ester of 4-bromo-5-methyl-2-furancarboxylic acid followed by decarboxylation.|$|E
50|$|Mercury(II) reductase cannot {{completely}} reduce <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> such as methyl mercury. Thus, MerB cleaves the carbon-mercury bonds via protonolysis {{and forms}} a mercury dithiolate complex, upon which MerB transports the mercury directly to MerA for reduction.|$|R

5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. <b>Organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc <b>compounds,</b> <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|R
50|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> presents both dangers and benefits. Dimethylmercury in particular, is notoriously toxic, but has found {{use as an}} antifungal agent and insecticide. Merbromin and phenylmercuric borate are used as topical antiseptics, while Nitromersol {{is used as a}} preservative for vaccines and antitoxins.|$|R
25|$|All of these, except {{elemental}} liquid mercury produce toxicity {{or death}} {{with less than}} a gram. Mercury's zero oxidation state (Hg0) exists as vapor or as liquid metal, its mercurous state (Hg+) exists as inorganic salts, and its mercuric state (Hg2+) may form either inorganic salts or <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thiomersal (INN), {{commonly}} {{known in the}} US as thimerosal, is an <b>organomercury</b> <b>compound</b> used as a preservative in certain vaccines.

Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997, the FDA conducted {{a comprehensive review of}} the use of thimerosal in childhood vaccines. Conducted in 1999, this review found no evidence of harm from the use of thimerosal as a vaccine preservative, other than local hypersensitivity reactions. The CDC and the AAP followed the precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unwarranted, but their 1999 action sparked confusion and controversy that has diverted attention and resources away from efforts to determine the causes of autism. Since 2000, the thiomersal in child vaccines has been alleged to contribute to autism, and thousands of parents in the United States have pursued legal compensation from a federal fund. A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee favored rejecting any causal relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism. Autism incidence rates increased steadily even after thiomersal was removed from childhood vaccines. Currently there is no accepted scientific evidence that exposure to thiomersal is a factor in causing autism.|$|E
40|$|Sodium tetra(n-propyl) borate (NaBPr 4) was {{introduced}} as derivatization reagent {{to extend the}} possibility for determining ethyl-mercury compounds. This study investigated the artifact formation of methyl- and ethyl-mercury compounds during NaBPr 4 derivatization, together with the influence of this artifact on organomercury analysis in environmental samples. The artifact methyl- and ethyl-mercury compounds during NaBPr 4 derivatization were evident and depended strongly {{on the amount of}} Hg(II) present in the solution for derivatization. Some unidentified <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> were found when the amount of Hg(II) in the derivatization solution was over 1 mu g. The amounts of NaBPr 4 and acetate buffer and the presence of organometallic <b>compounds</b> other than <b>organomercury</b> showed little influence on the artifact effect. The artifact monoethylmercury encompasses 0. 99 - 2. 9 % of the amount of Hg(II) present and interferes strongly with the monoethylmercury analysis. The formation rate of artifact monomethylmercury is much lower and ca. 0. 03 - 0. 28 % of the Hg(II) present. The artifact affects remarkably the monomethylmercury analysis for solid samples when these have a low ratio of monomethylmercury-to-total Hg concentrations (< 0. 003) and the recovery of Hg from the samples is high. Mathematical correction seems to be difficult due to the low reproducibility of this artifact effect. Formation of artifact <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds</b> caused during NaBPr 4 derivatization may lead to false Hg speciation and overestimate concentrations of <b>organomercury</b> <b>compounds...</b>|$|R
