While the Republican Congress did not support a federally-mandated {{increase in the minimum wage}}, 18 states did increase their minimum wages, benefiting an estimated 7 million workers, following the President's 2013 State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> calling for an increase. During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request.

500|$|Prior to June 2014, Obama offered {{substantial}} {{support for a}} broadly-based [...] "All of the above" [...] approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry {{and its impact on}} the domestic economy. Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.|$|E
500|$|R.A., {{writing on}} The Economists Free Exchange blog, {{concluded}} that Cowen's analysis of education {{suggested that the}} rich world would do better by aiding mass education programs in developing countries rather than pursuing the diminishing returns in domestic education and research, in contrary [...] to President Obama's State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech</b> in 2011. Looser immigration law would also allow rich and poor countries to exploit this source of growth. Secondly, it proposed to harvest [...] "policy low-hanging fruit" [...] i.e. reforming or abolishing foolish and costly policies. It proposed taxing [...] "bads" [...] such as traffic congestion and pollution rather than [...] "goods" [...] such as income, reducing spending on medical treatments with no clear benefits, and removing agricultural subsidies and mortgage interest reduction. In The Economist, two different sets of policy responses were considered {{depending on whether the}} true cause is ailing technological innovation or a decline in workers' bargaining power in the face of emerging-market industrialization. Progressive taxation and redistribution would offset labor's position of weakness whilst a limited state would reduce commitments it cannot expect to fulfill in a stagnating economy.|$|E

He explicitly told his followers not to be lured into violent confrontations, declaring, [...] "We aren't going to fall into any trap. We aren't going to be provoked".

25|$|State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speeches</b> usually last {{a little}} over an hour, partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large amounts <b>of</b> applause that occur from the {{audience}} throughout.

2500|$|Although the United States {{declared}} war on Germany on April 6, 1917, it did not initially declare war on the other Central Powers, a state of affairs that Woodrow Wilson described as an [...] "embarrassing obstacle" [...] in his State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speech.</b> Congress {{declared war}} on the Austro-Hungarian Empire on December 7, 1917, but never made declarations of war against the other Central Powers, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire or the various co-belligerents allied with the Central Powers.

40|$|State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> {{addresses}} {{have always}} allowed presents to argue {{their views on}} policy issues. Arguments, however, even those in presidential speeches, can rely on fallacies as well as valid statements. This investigation sought to find a correlation between the validity/fallacy ratio in each speech and the president’s average approval rating over the two months prior to <b>the</b> address. State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speeches</b> were selected from Franklin Roosevelt to George W.

A high approval rating had a weak positive association with a high validity/fallacy ratio (few fallacies per validity), yet the correlation was obscured by outliers. When validity/fallacy ratios were calculated for various policy issues, the issues generally considered the most urgent had a low validity/fallacy ratio (many fallacies per validity), while the more distant issues had higher validity/fallacy ratios. The difference between <b>the</b> two types <b>of</b> issues {{was found to be}} statistically significant (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Through a {{discourse}} analysis of American foreign policy, this rapport examines the development in American identity reproduction from George W. Bush to Barack Obama. 	Historically, American self-narrative, influenced by Wilsonianism, has reproduced America as a ‘crusader nation’. Along with a poststructuralist perspective, adopted from David Campbell, and employing <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{war on terror}} to exemplify <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> ‘danger’, this rapport seeks to support the thesis that American identity reproduction has changed into a self-narrative of a less crusading nation. 	In methodological terms, as suggested by Lene Hansen, this rapport entails a comparative discourse analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> <b>speeches</b> made by <b>the</b> two presidents, where <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Self and the Others and the relation between them, which constitutes <b>the</b> reproduction <b>of</b> identity, are considered along with <b>the</b> securitization theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Copenhagen School. Upon this analytical base <b>the</b> different aspects <b>of</b> Wilsonianism, adopted by the respective presidents, are sought pointed out, and the analysis concludes upon American identity reproduction in support to the thesis; The presidents differ in several aspects; Their constructions of Self and Others and the relation between them; On <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> securitization against <b>the</b> articulated radical ‘danger’; And in their adoption of Wilsonian aspects; All of which shows a discursive development towards reproducing, to a lesser degree, American identity as a ‘crusader nation’...|$|R

This research examines whether or not propaganda influences support for war and the effect propaganda has on multiple outcomes.

For that reason social scientists rely on hand-coding.
