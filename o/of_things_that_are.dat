500|$|Anna's costumes in {{the film}} were {{informed}} {{by the research of}} Norwegian clothing styles. Based on these findings, art director Brittney Lee and her team later found out what materials should be used for the costumes. Co-director Jennifer Lee created a cheerful wardrobe featuring [...] "playful" [...] floral patterns and saturated colors in order to accurately reflect Anna's personality. The animators also took into account the climate that Anna is living in, costuming her in heavy wools and velvets, reflecting traditional winter clothing of the Scandinavian area. The animators added structures to the costumes in a way, such as pleated dresses, that allows movements, giving the character a free range of [...] "twirl all she wants" [...] throughout the film. In order to deepen the cultural context of the film, rosemaling, a traditional form of Norwegian decorative folk art, was added to almost every character's costumes. Anna and her sister, Elsa, also enjoyed a large number of types of costumes and the layers of costuming that have never been done before. As these characters are running around in the snow, they have to have petticoats, undergarments, capes, [...] "and they have all these layers and layers <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> all meticulously designed," [...] Brittney explained.|$|E

500|$|The Food Album has {{received}} mixed reviews from most critics; many felt {{that while the}} album was amusing {{it was not an}} essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote that, [...] "The Food Album is an enjoyable bag of treats. Just don't eat too much, or you'll probably get sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: those who love Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why I flipped out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs are the kinds <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> sort of funny in concept, less funny when you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E

[...] He also suggested that AIDS patients should be [...] "isolated from the general population." [...] He stuck by those comments in December 2007 when asked if homosexuality is sinful. He replied, [...] "Well I believe it would be—just like lying is sinful and stealing is sinful. There are a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> sinful. It doesn't mean {{that a person is}} a horrible person. It means that they engage in behavior that is outside the norms of those boundaries of our traditional view of what's right and what's wrong.

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, in 1562, Marroquin left in {{his will}} some funds to set up a school, the Santo Tomás de Aquino, where [...] Grammar, Arts, Philosophy and Theology would be taught. The {{beneficiaries}} of this pious enterprise would be the children of poor Spaniards, given that they could not travel to cities (like Mexico) where the Royal Universities were. This will has been also interpreted by scholars as the origin of the University of San Carlos. However, the late priest had a clear idea of the difference between a school (i.e., a home for students, with or without classes) and a university (or General Study) where the students earned degrees. About this, historian John Tate Lanning tells that [...] "his will is so well known that there are some scholars that have not even seen it and have already read a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not there at all. Nowhere in his will Marroquín talks about any university, much less talk about his intentions to establish one..." [...] On the other hand, what is documented is that major Pedro Crespo Suárez left in his will twenty thousand pesos to set up the classes for the university that is [...] "in the works with the authorities".|$|E
