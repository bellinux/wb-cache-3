5|$|On 29 March 2008, Zimbabwe held {{a presidential}} {{election}} along with a parliamentary election. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> were withheld for two weeks, after which it was generally acknowledged that the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai (MDC-T) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament.|$|E
5|$|As the 15th Lok Sabha {{was due to}} {{complete}} its constitutional term on 31 May 2014, a general election was called by the Election Commission for {{the constitution of the}} 16th Lok Sabha. The election was held in nine phases from 7 April to 12 May 2014. The Congress party had won the previous two elections in 2004 and 2009, and so was campaigning to win the election for the third consecutive time. The result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> were declared on 16 May, before the 15th Lok Sabha completed its constitutional mandate on 31 May 2014.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} other {{elections}} in the electorate happening afterwards within the year <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election,</b> one later that year and another the next year.|$|E

25|$|As {{a direct}} result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election,</b> both the campaigns for Thomas Lukaszuk and Chris Kibermanis filed an {{application}} to the Court of Appeal to reimburse the legal costs of contesting the results. No provisions existed under the Election Act and the appeals were denied. In October 2005 the Standing Legislative Offices Committee reviewed the matter and changes were recommended to allow candidates to be reimbursed for their legal costs.|$|E
25|$|According to one analysis, RJD was {{the biggest}} {{beneficiary}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election.</b> RJD increased its seats tally by 58 compared with previous election. RJD had the best strike rate by winning 80 of the 101 seats contested. RJD became the single largest party in Bihar Assembly. RJD defeated BJP in 36 seats BJP had won in the last election, similarly it took 24 seats JD (U) had won in the last election.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> {{was that}} it led to several reforms in how the Democratic Party chose its presidential nominees. In 1969, the McGovern–Fraser Commission adopted {{a set of rules}} for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for minorities, women, and youth. The reforms led most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections, instead of party leaders, to choose delegates.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{there was}} a {{by-election}} caused {{by the death of}} the Labour Councillor. The seat was then won by the Conservatives. <b>This</b> <b>election</b> confirmed the previous year's re-emergence of the Conservatives, although <b>of</b> course <b>this</b> <b>election</b> took place on a lower turnout than the other elections.|$|R

25|$|Captain Blackwell was also, at this time, {{one of the}} Irish ‘rebel’ {{students}} who personally presented the petition denouncing his superiors at a sitting of the Convention on 2 December 1792. On 29 October, during the month between the two above engagements, Blackwell was present at Collège des Irlandais committed to the student election there. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> was to appoint a new administrator {{in the place of}} Kearney against whom the commissioners of the Commune made a report and the municipality dismissed.|$|E
25|$|In the Constituent Assembly {{elections}} of 1946, the Muslim League won 425 out of 496 seats reserved for Muslims (polling 89.2% of total votes). The Congress had hitherto {{refused to acknowledge}} the Muslim League's claim of being the representative of Indian Muslims but finally acquiesced to the League's claim after the results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election.</b> The Muslim League's demand for Pakistan had received overwhelming popular support from India's Muslims, especially those Muslims who were living in provinces such as UP where they were a minority.|$|E

25|$|In the November 2012 U.S. election, Puerto Rico {{voted to}} become a U.S. state. However, the {{legitimacy}} of the result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> was disputed. On June 11, 2017, another referendum was held, this time with the result that 97% of voters in Puerto Rico voted for statehood, but it had a turnout of only 23%. Similarly in November 2016, a statehood referendum was held in the District of Columbia where 86% of voters approved the proposal. If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design on the flag to accommodate the additional star.|$|E
25|$|Operating {{under a new}} {{electoral law}} written {{unilaterally}} by the governing parties with strong criticism from the parliamentary opposition, the April 2006 general election was held. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> handed Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition, known as The Union, (Berlusconi's opposition) a very thin majority: 49.8% against 49.7% for the centre-right coalition House of Freedoms in the Lower House, and a two-senator lead in the Senate (158 senators for The Union and 156 for the House of Freedoms). The Court of Cassation subsequently validated the voting procedures and determined that the election process was constitutional.|$|E
25|$|Phase 2B saw polling in 12 {{states for}} 140 {{constituencies}} – {{the most in}} any phase <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election.</b> This phase was largely peaceful and saw about 55% turnout. There were stray incidents of violence in areas with active Naxalite groups in Jharkhand and Bihar. The poor turnout in this phase was blamed on a heat wave sweeping the country that took the noon-time temperature on election day up to between 42 and 46degrees Celsius {{in various parts of}} the country. Two polling officials even died due to sun stroke in Orissa with two also falling ill.|$|E

25|$|With FREDEMO {{dissolved}} and APRA leader Alan García exiled to Colombia, Fujimori {{sought to}} legitimize his position. He called elections for a Democratic Constitutional Congress, {{to serve as}} a legislature and a constituent assembly. The APRA and Popular Action attempted a boycott <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election,</b> but the Popular Christian Party (PPC, {{not to be confused with}} PCP, Partido Comunista del Peru) and many left-leaning parties participated in this election. Fujimori supporters won a majority of the seats in this body, and drafted a new constitution in 1993. In a referendum, the coup and the Constitution of 1993 were approved by a narrow margin of between four and five percent.|$|E
25|$|Although the McGovern {{campaign}} {{believed that}} its candidate {{had a better}} chance of defeating Nixon because of the new Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution that lowered the national voting age to 18 from 21, the plan backfired when most of the youth vote went to Nixon. This was the first election in American history in which a Republican candidate carried every single Southern state, continuing the region’s transformation from a Democratic bastion into a Republican one as Arkansas was carried by a Republican presidential candidate {{for the first time in}} a century. By this time, all the Southern states, except Arkansas and Texas, had been carried by a Republican in either the previous election or the one in 1964 (although Republican candidates carried Texas in 1928, 1952 and 1956). As a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election,</b> Massachusetts was the only state that Nixon did not carry in any of his three presidential campaigns.|$|E
25|$|As the {{incumbent}} was ineligible for re-election, many candidates {{took the opportunity}} to vie for position of the head of state (the highest political office in the country, although in Croatia, a parliamentary republic, the role of president is largely ceremonial and the Prime Minister - Head of Government - wields most power). Most mainstream Croatian political parties participated in the election either by nominating a candidate or endorsing one, but major party official candidates alone did not dominate the campaign. The relatively low nomination threshold (ten thousand signatures in a country of four million voters), turmoil in the largest political party (Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ) due to the departure of long-time leader Ivo Sanader and the ongoing economic crisis, as well as a significant one-man revolt in the second-largest party (Social Democratic Party of Croatia, SDP), caused the first round <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> to field the largest number of candidates so far.|$|E

50|$|The 1889 Mississippi gubernatorial {{election}} {{took place}} on November 1, 1889, in order to elect the Governor <b>of</b> Mississippi. <b>This</b> <b>election</b> was the last held under the Constitution of 1868.

25|$|For the 1992 general election, the Daily Mirror {{continued}} to support Labour, still led by Neil Kinnock. By this stage Margaret Thatcher had stepped {{down and the}} Tory government was now led by John Major. The election was won by the Tories, although Labour managed to significantly cut the Tory majority to 21 seats compared to the triple-digit figure of the previous two elections, {{which led to a}} difficult term for Major. The outcome <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> had been far less predictable than any of the previous three elections, as opinion polls over the previous three years had shown both parties in the lead, although any Labour lead in the polls had been relatively narrow since the Conservative government's change of leader from Thatcher to Major in November 1990, in spite of the onset of a recession in 1990 which had pushed unemployment up again after several years of decline. Labour's credibility was helped by plans including extra NHS funding and moving away from firm commitments on re-nationalisation to reverse the Conservative policy of privatisation, but its decision to be up-front about tax increases was seen as a key factor in its failure to win.|$|E
25|$|A {{coalition}} government had been widely {{considered as a}} potential outcome <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election</b> {{and the first to}} be formed since 1999. Foreign embassies in Turkey have expressed their expectation for a coalition while speculation in the media has centred over the possible make-up of the incoming government. In April, the CHP announced that it could form a coalition with any party that supports judicial independence and the separation of powers and hinted at a possible CHP-MHP-HDP coalition, since all three parties are fiercely critical of the governing AKP. It was perceived to be unlikely that the MHP and HDP, which are right-wing Turkish nationalist and left-wing Kurdish nationalist parties respectively, would join a coalition together. This was confirmed when MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli recommended that those who suggested such a coalition to 'see a doctor'. However, the MHP formed a coalition with the centre-left Democratic Left Party in 1999 and fielded a joint presidential candidate with the centre-left CHP in 2014, making a potential coalition with the CHP a possibility. The HDP have also signalled a potential coalition with the CHP, though co-leader Selahattin Demirtaş staunchly rejected any electoral alliance between them. On 2 June, Demirtaş stated that they would never form a coalition with the AKP but would consider a coalition deal with the CHP.|$|E
25|$|When the {{guardianship}} of Sigismund {{ended on}} 25 July 1443 and Friedrich, now King Friedrich III of the Holy Roman Empire, decided to prolong it for another six years, the Landstände of Tyrol organized an open revolt. Oswald {{became one of}} five military commanders and was tasked with the defence {{of the most important}} of all positions, the Mühlbacher Klause (Mühlbach fortress), which blocked the most likely invasion route from Styria, where King Friedrich had taken up residence. The cities of Merano and Bolzano provided funds and troops to reinforce the fortress, and all other passes and entrances into Tyrol were blocked by troops. As the city of Trento backed the King, an army of 3,000 men was sent south to besiege the city. On 10 December, a Tyrolean delegation arrived in Graz to demand the release of Sigismund and the return of the county's treasures, taken by Friedrich in 1440. Friedrich refused and threatened war. The Tyroleans responded by sacking Trento and electing Johann Röttel as the new bishop on 4 January 1440. Röttel's first declaration was to fully support the Landstände against the King. Oswald was one of the electors and the main instigator <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>election.</b> The next session by the Landstände began in Merano on 16 May 1445, and as it was now clear that King Friedrich was not planning an attack, options were discussed on how to bring Sigismund to Tyrol.|$|E
