40|$|Rationale Long-term {{observational}} {{studies are}} essential {{in assessing the}} effect of interventions for chronic diseases on long-term safety and tolerability, as well as informing on efficacy in a non-clinical trial setting. Concerns over the scientific validity of <b>open</b> <b>label</b> extension <b>studies</b> to randomized controlled trials have recently been raised. Patients experiencing adverse events will be withdrawn before the follow-on period of the study, and those experiencing milder side-effects will {{be less likely to}} opt to continue into the <b>open</b> <b>label</b> extension. Methods The usual method of analysis of the <b>open</b> <b>label</b> extension <b>study,</b> which ignores any patients not continuing into the follow-on period of the study, is outlined. It is shown that ignoring patients who exit the trial is equivalent to assuming the outcome data are missing completely at random. Where this assumption is not met, treatment effect estimates will be biased. An alternative method of analysis is proposed, which does not rely on the often unjustifiable assumption of outcomes being missing completely at random.

30|$|Reduction of {{sympathetic}} nerve activity by catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) has raised considerable attention {{as a new}} treatment modality for resistant hypertension (RHT). This interest was fueled by the promising results of RDN in the initial <b>open</b> <b>label</b> <b>studies</b> Symplicity HTN- 1 and HTN- 2 [1 – 3]. However, the recent randomized sham-controlled Symplicity HTN- 3 trial did not show a difference in blood pressure (BP) lowering efficacy between RDN and sham treatment [4]. One of the potential causes {{for the lack of}} efficacy might be the failure of the RDN procedure to sufficiently ablate renal {{sympathetic nerve}}s. Yet, a routine technique to measure the extent of renal denervation is lacking and potential causes of insufficient denervation remain hypothetical.|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is {{a systemic}} rheumatic disease with poor prognosis since therapeutic options are limited.

In humans, B-cell infiltration is a prominent finding in most lung biopsies obtained from patients with SSc-associated interstitial lung disease. Several <b>open</b> <b>label</b> <b>studies</b> have assessed the clinical efficacy of RTX in SSc. In most patients skin fibrosis improved; lung function either improved or remained stable.

5000|$|A 30-patient Phase IIa <b>open</b> <b>label</b> <b>study</b> in HER2-negative metastatic {{breast cancer}} (ClinicalTrials.gov {{identifier}} NCT00349934, Immutep code name P005) {{has suggested that}} IMP321 works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic in breast cancer, where chemotherapy creates tumor debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. This trial arose {{in part from the}} findings of a June 2005 online paper in the journal Cancer Letters by two researchers at the Centre René Huguenin in Saint-Cloud near Paris who had collaborated with Frédéric Triebel. That paper demonstrated that soluble LAG3 correlated with improved survival in breast cancer patients whose tumors were estrogen or progesterone receptor positive. The Phase IIa study which partly confirmed this finding was initiated by Immutep around August 2006 and was conducted at the René Huguenin as well as two other Paris hospitals - the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou (15th arrondissement) and the Hôpital Tenon (20th arrondissement). In the study, patients on paclitaxel were administered ascending subcutaneous doses of IMP321 on days 2 and 16 of a 28-day cycle of paclitaxel over six cycles. The maximum IMP321 dose was 6.25 mg. Paclitaxel was given on days 1, 8 and 15, meaning patients got IMP321 the day after paclitaxel had created tumor debris. There were two notable outcomes to this study: ...|$|E

40|$|Chronic daily {{headache}} (CDH) is a multi-faceted, often complex pain syndrome {{in children}} and adolescents. Chronic daily headache may be primary or secondary. Chronic migraine and chronic tension-type are the most frequent subtypes. Chronic daily headache is co-morbid with adverse life events, anxiety and depressive disorders, possibly with other psychiatric disorders, other pain syndromes and sleep disorders; these conditions contribute to initiating and maintaining CDH. Hence, early management of episodic headache and treatment of associated conditions are crucial to prevention. There is evidence {{for the benefit of}} psychological therapies, principally relaxation and cognitive behavioral, and promising information on acupuncture for CDH. Data on drug treatment are based primarily on <b>open</b> <b>label</b> <b>studies.</b> The controversies surrounding CDH are discussed and proposals for improvement presented.

40|$|Background: Many {{people suffer}} from {{alcoholism}} {{which can be}} a debilitating disease. With only three medications on the market to treat alcoholism, research to find new pharmaceuticals is important. The recent publication of a book promoting baclofen, a GABA agonist normally used to treat spasticity, as a treatment for alcoholism, has brought public attention to the topic. For potential patients who have read the book and clinicians who treat alcoholism, this systematic review examines claims that baclofen decreases alcohol cravings and has a possible clinical use in the treatment of alcoholism. Methods: An exhaustive search of available medical literature, published in English, was conducted using MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews Multifile, and CINAHL with the keywords “baclofen” and “alcoholism. ” A bibliographical search of the literature was done to find further articles and information. Each study needed to evaluate both abstinence and craving for alcohol. Due {{to the fact that there}} is limited research available on the topic, all available articles were included. Results: The search yielded 2 random controlled trials, 2 <b>open</b> <b>label</b> <b>studies,</b> and 3 case reports. Both random controlled trials (RCT) showed statistically significant results in increased abstinence and decreased craving in baclofen versus placebo group. Both <b>open</b> <b>label</b> <b>studies</b> showed decreased craving with baclofen use, and one showed increased abstinence, while the other showed a decrease in alcohol consumption. All three case reports described accounts of severe alcoholics whose alcoholism was successfully treated with higher doses of baclofen. Minimal to no side effects were seen in all trials and no patients described craving or euphoric effects from taking baclofen. Conclusion: Even with the need for more research on the topic, baclofen should be considered as another medication to try in the treatment of alcoholism. Patients with intense cravings for alcohol may have greater benefit in cessation of alcohol use as baclofen significantly and quickly decreases cravings. Both the high safety and low side effect profile make baclofen a reasonable option to try. Since the amount of research on the topic is minimal, clinicians need to use their judgment and may want to try baclofen only after first attempting other treatment options. The duration and dosage of baclofen is uncertain and will need to be adjusted on a patient by patient basis...|$|R
