Indicators that a <b>waste</b> is <b>industrial</b> include the following: Waste type. Certain types of waste are known to be classified as <b>industrial</b> <b>waste,</b> such as treated wood; soils contaminated with non-hazardous or low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and petroleum hydrocarbons; non-friable asbestos waste; and oil filters. In many cases, these wastes result from construction-related projects under the purview of the Facilities Division. Such operations include excavations, the removal of fencing or cooling towers, and building demolition. Waste generation history.

In this complex, production process is hot rolling steel and the product is rebar. Material and Method: The preset study was conducted in Kavir Steel Complex. Following survey of production process and sources of waste, the type and volume of produced waste were identified and measured during 3 months. Then, the classification of wastes was done according to the Bazel Convention and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and finally new industrial & health solid waste management program was presented. Result: Considering the volume, <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> of production process in Kavir Steel Complex was between 130 to 180 grams per each ton of rebar. Main <b>industrial</b> <b>waste</b> included oxide of steel billet, industrial sludge, used oil and lubricant which were classified according to the RCRA: 8 materials with T code, 1 with C code, 5 with I code and 3 materials with C code.
