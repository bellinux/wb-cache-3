5|$|Each {{flag of the}} National Olympic Committees {{represented}} {{was brought}} on stage by an athlete representative. Following Olympic tradition, the flag of Greece entered first as the originator of the games, and the flag of Singapore entered last as the host nation. The flag ceremony {{was followed by the}} singing of the Games theme song and remarks by Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, and Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee. The Singapore Games were then officially declared opened by S.R. Nathan, the President of Singapore. The Olympic flag was brought on stage by eight Olympians—Tan Howe Liang, Yelena Isinbayeva, Yang Yang, Tan Eng Liang, Frankie Fredericks, Patricia Chan, Tao Li and Sergey Bubka—and handed to eight Singaporean youth athletes before it was raised with the singing of the Olympic Hymn in Greek by the Singaporean singers. The Olympic Oath was taken <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> athletes by Caroline Pei Jia Chew, <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> judges by Syed Abdul Kadir, and <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> coaches by David Lim Fong Jock. Finally, a boat {{in the shape of a}} phoenix carried the Youth Olympic Flame across Marina Bay and was passed between six Singaporean youth athletes in a relay. Sailor Darren Choy was the final torchbearer and lit the cauldron.|$|E

Valori died on September 2, 1427, by which time Guadagni was also deceased and Uzzano had long lost interest, leaving the remaining work of commissioning entirely to Giovanni, or—more likely—Cosimo de' Medici.|$|E

5|$|The NFA {{claimed that}} the {{diversion}} to the parent company violated the beverage contracts between various parties.

In the filing, the NFA claimed the three defendants were in violation of a 1999 beverage contract that set specific beverage syrup usage goals. The four parties settled shortly after the filing when Burger King agreed to seek advertising funds from other sources.|$|E
5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
5|$|The {{chairman}} of the Pageantry Committee was Walt Disney, {{who was responsible for}} producing both the opening and closing ceremonies. He organized an opening that included 5,000 entertainers, the release of 2,000 pigeons, and a military gun salute of eight shots, one for each of the previous Winter Olympic Games. The opening ceremonies were held on February 18, 1960, at Blyth Arena {{in the midst of a}} blizzard. The heavy snow fall caused traffic problems that delayed the ceremony by an hour. The festivities began with a sustained drum roll as the flags of each participating nation were raised on specially designed flag poles. Vice President Richard Nixon represented the United States government and declared the Games open. The Olympic cauldron was lit by Kenneth Henry, Olympic champion of the 500meter speed skating race at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. The Olympic oath was taken by Carol Heiss <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the athletes. As the national delegations left the stadium fireworks concluded the ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Lezica {{informed}} Cisneros of {{the request}} for an open cabildo and the Viceroy consulted Leiva, who spoke in favor of it. The Viceroy summoned military commanders {{to come to the}} fort at 7pm, to demand military support. There were rumors that it could be a trap to capture them and take control of the barracks. To prevent this, they took command of the grenadiers that guarded the Fort and seized the keys of all entrances while meeting with the Viceroy. Colonel Cornelio Saavedra, head of the Regiment of Patricios, responded <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the criollo regiments. He compared the current international situation with that prevailing {{at the time of the}} mutiny of Álzaga over a year earlier, pointed out that Spain was now almost entirely under Napoleonic control and that the undefeated Spanish provinces were very small in comparison with the Americas. He rejected the claim of sovereignty of Cadiz over the Americas, and concluded that the local armies wanted to look after themselves, rather than following the fate of Spain. Finally, he pointed out that the Supreme Central Junta that appointed Cisneros as Viceroy no longer existed, so he rejected Cisneros' legitimacy as Viceroy and denied him the protection of the troops under his command.|$|E
5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a {{jury trial}} on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases {{and the threat of}} a class action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they all}} share the forest, {{relationships}} between different Clans are tense. They often come {{into conflict with}} one another, becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border. This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation, such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving. An attempt for one Clan to steal all of or part of another Clan's territory is not unusual. To prepare for this, cats in all Clans are taught battle moves {{in order to protect}} their territory. Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age (6 months/moons old). Border fights are the most common source of battle (a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan's territory), and are often short-lived and cause no real damage to either side. However, bigger and more brutal battles can occur; at this point, casualties are to be expected. Despite this rivalry, the Clans can also show concern for another's well being; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress, and will prompt urgent action <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> four Clans. On the night of every full moon, the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace. This is known as a 'Gathering', and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited.|$|E
