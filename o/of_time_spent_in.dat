5|$|Meltzer {{began the}} Hall of Fame by {{choosing}} {{a list of}} 122 inaugural inductees in 1996. Since then, wrestlers from past and present, others employed in the professional wrestling industry, and wrestling journalists and historians have been selected by Meltzer to cast secret ballots to determine annual groups of inductees. Voting criteria include the length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> wrestling, historical significance, ability to attract viewers, and wrestling ability. Inductees must have at least 15 {{years of experience in}} the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years of experience. To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on the ballots from their geographic region. Any person that gets less than 10% of the vote is eliminated from the ballot. If a person fails to get inducted 15 years after being put on the ballot, they must get 50% of the vote or be eliminated. There are 211 inductees, including the seven tag teams.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are {{to be replaced by}} the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E

40|$|Kathleen Biard, 1, 2 Alan B Douglass, 2, 3 Rébecca Robillard, 2 Joseph De Koninck 1, 2 1 School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, 2 University of Ottawa Institute for Mental Health Research, 3 Royal Ottawa Mental Health Center, University of Ottawa Institute for Mental Health Research, Ottawa, ON, Canada Rationale: The serotonergic and {{cholinergic}} {{systems are}} jointly involved in regulating sleep but {{this system is}} theorized to be disturbed in depressed individuals. We previously reported that cholinergic and serotonergic agents induce sleep changes partially consistent with monoamine models of sleep disturbances in depression. One potential cause of disturbed neurotransmission is genetic predisposition. The G(- 1019) allele of the serotonin- 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) receptor promoter region predicts an increased risk for depression compared to the wild-type C(- 1019) allele. Objective: The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate how serotonin- 1 A receptor genotypes mediate sleep sensitivity to pharmacological probes modeling the serotonergic/cholinergic imbalance of depression. Methods: Seventeen healthy female participants homozygous for either C (n= 11) or G (n= 6) alleles aged 18 – 27 years were tested on four nonconsecutive nights. Participants were given galantamine (an anti-acetylcholinesterase), buspirone (a serotonergic agonist), both drugs together, or placebos before sleeping. Results: As reported previously, buspirone significantly increased rapid eye movement (REM) latency (P< 0. 001), as well as awakenings, percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> awake, and percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> asleep <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> stage N 1 (P< 0. 019). Galantamine increased awakenings, percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> awake, percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> asleep <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> stage N 1, and percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> asleep <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> REM, and decreased REM latency and percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> asleep <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> stage N 3 (P< 0. 019). Galantamine plus buspirone given together disrupted sleep more than either drug alone, lowering sleep efficiency and percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> asleep <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> stage N 3 and increasing awakenings, percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> awake, and percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> asleep <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> stage N 1 (P< 0. 019). There was no main effect of genotype nor was there a significant multivariate interaction between genotype and drug condition. Conclusion: These findings are partially consistent with the literature about sleep in depression, notably short REM latency, higher percentage <b>of</b> total sleep <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> REM, lower percentage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> asleep <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> stage N 3, and increased sleep fragmentation. The C/G mutation in the serotonin- 1 A receptor promoter region does not appear to cause noticeable differences in the sleep patterns of a relatively small sample of healthy young females. Future studies with larger sample sizes are required. Keywords: depression, sleep, serotonin, acetylcholine, buspirone, galantamin...|$|R

25|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs, zopiclone causes {{a decrease in}} the core body temperature and is effective in decreasing sleep latency. It causes similar alterations on EEG readings and sleep architecture as benzodiazepines and causes disturbances in sleep architecture on withdrawal as part of its rebound effect. Zopiclone reduces both delta waves and the number of high-amplitude delta waves whilst increasing low-amplitude waves. Zopiclone reduces the total amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> REM sleep as well as delaying its onset. Cognitive behavioral therapy {{has been found to be}} superior to zopiclone in the treatment of insomnia and has been found to have lasting effects on sleep quality for at least a year after therapy.|$|E

Eventually the Catholic Counter-Reformation curbed the excesses, but indulgences continue to play a role in modern Catholic religious life. Reforms in the 20th century largely abolished the quantification of indulgences, which had been expressed in terms of days or years. These days or years were meant to represent the equivalent <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> penance, although it was widely taken to mean time spent in Purgatory.

25|$|In 2010, {{there were}} 408,425 {{children}} in foster care in the United States. 48% were in nonrelative foster homes, 26% were in relative foster homes, 9% in institutions, 6% in group homes, 5% on trial home visits (where the child returns home while under state supervision), 4% in preadoptive homes, 2% had run away, and 1% in supervised independent living. Of 254,114 who exited foster care in 2010, 51% were reunited with parents or caretakers, 21% were adopted, 11% were emancipated (as minors or by aging out), 8% went to live with another relative, 6% went to live with a guardian, and 3% had other outcomes. Of these children, the median length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> foster care was 13.5 months. 13% were in care for less than 1 month, 33% for 1 to 11 months, 24% for 12 to 23 months, 12% for 24 to 35 months, 10% for 3 to 4 years, and 7% for 5 years or more.|$|E
25|$|The general {{life cycle}} of clerids {{has been known to}} last {{anywhere}} from 35 days to more than 3 years, and is strongly dependent on the {{life cycle of}} their prey.

The warmer the temperature is, the quicker the lifecycle, and the cooler the temperature is the slower the lifecycle. If temperatures dip below a threshold temperature {{for an extended period of}} time clerids and most other insects will have growth and developmental progress arrested. Like all beetles, Cleridae follow a holometabolous life cycle: the egg hatches into a larva, which grows and feeds, changing its skin to form a pupa, and the pupa shedding its skin to emerge as an adult. The larvae of the majority of the known species of Cleridae feed upon the eggs and young of wood-boring beetles, while the adults feed on the adult bark beetles.|$|E

25|$|For initial fluid {{replacement}} colloids or albumin {{is preferred}} {{in people with}} cirrhosis. Medications typically include octreotide or, if not available, vasopressin and nitroglycerin to reduce portal venous pressures. Terlipressin {{appears to be more}} effective than octreotide, but it is not available {{in many areas of the}} world. It is the only medication that has been shown to reduce mortality in acute variceal bleeding. This is in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varices. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varices. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In those with cirrhosis, antibiotics decrease the chance of bleeding again, shorten the length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> hospital, and decrease mortality.
