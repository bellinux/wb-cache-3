25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

A few days later Johnson changed his mind and retired permanently, saying, [...] "I am going <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> terms, something I couldn't say when I aborted a comeback in 1992." ...|$|E

I'm going to once again go <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> prophetic limb and predict that Art will soon become a fan favorite. He has a dynamic style that grabs your {{attention}} and won't let go. To be sure, he exhibits some of the weaknesses of any young artist, the occasional awkward pose or crude drawing--but as a first effort this is incredibly impressive. In fact, this limited series should be worth buying simply to watch the progress Adams makes from issue to issue.|$|E

500|$|Many {{songs from}} the album are {{inspired}} by Cuomo's past personal experiences. [...] "My Name is Jonas", deals with Cuomo's brother Leaves who had been seriously injured {{in a car accident}} while a student at Oberlin College and was having problem with his insurance. Jason Cropper earned co-writing credit for coming up with the intro to the song. Both [...] "No One Else" [...] and [...] "The World Has Turned and Left Me Here" [...] are lyrically connected, with Cuomo describing the narrator of [...] "No One Else" [...] as [...] "the jealous-obsessive asshole in me freaking <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend" [...] and claiming that [...] "'The World has Turned and Left Me Here' is the same asshole wondering why she's gone." [...] The second single from the Blue Album was [...] "Buddy Holly", whose music video was also directed by Spike Jonze. It portrayed the band performing at the original Arnold's Drive-In diner from the popular 1970s television show, Happy Days. The video combined contemporary footage of the band with clips from the show. Happy Days cast member Al Molinaro made a cameo appearance in the video. The video was met with great popularity and heavy rotation on MTV. The music video was also featured as an extra in the Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade CD, along with Edie Brickell's [...] "Good Times" [...] music video and the movie trailer for Rob Roy. The video won four awards at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, including prizes for Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Video.|$|E
500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E

A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
