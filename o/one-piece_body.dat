2500|$|The Deluxe {{was among}} the [...] "new" [...] 1968 Les Pauls.

The mini-humbucker pickup fit into the pre-carved P-90 pickup cavity using an adaptor ring developed by Gibson {{in order to use}} a surplus supply of Epiphone mini-humbuckers. The Deluxe was introduced in late 1968 and helped to standardize production among Gibson's U.S.-built Les Pauls. The first incarnation of the Deluxe featured a <b>one-piece</b> <b>body</b> and slim three-piece neck. The multipiece body (a thin layer of maple on top of two layers of Honduran mahogany) arrived in 1969. In late 1969, a reinforcing neck volute was added. 1969 Deluxes feature the Gibson logo devoid of the dot over the [...] "i" [...] in Gibson.

By 1975, the neck construction was changed from mahogany to maple, until the early 1980s, when the construction was returned to mahogany. The body changed back to solid mahogany from the pancake design in late 1976 or early 1977. Interest in this particular Les Paul model was so low that in 1985, Gibson canceled it. In 2005, the Deluxe was re-introduced.|$|E

The driver and passenger enter the vehicle over bulkheads on each side. The Hurricane features a Chrysler designed and patented four-wheel steering system, which was outsourced to MillenWorks that allows the Hurricane to move sideways.

50|$|The Chepeko was Carlton's first {{project to}} produce a kit car that was easy to build, and {{reasonably}} practical for everyday use. To this end, {{it was based on}} the floorpan (chassis) of a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle coupled with the available range of engines that would mate with the drivetrain. It was a two-seater, with gull-wing doors. The kit comprised a <b>one-piece</b> <b>body</b> shell, built from separate glass-fibre mouldings bonded together. Other parts included mouldings for the two doors and bonnet, plus door gas struts, hinges and catches, and four side windows in moulded acrylic sheet. The front and rear screens were not in the kit, but could be sourced as the rear screens of 1970s Vauxhall estate cars. The kit was produced from 1975 to 1976. The design changed several times throughout the production run of less than 20, including restyling of the rear end, and the provision of separate engine cover, headlight covers, instrument box, and sunroof panels. Length 166 in, width 66 in, height 45 in, wheelbase 94.5 in.|$|E
5000|$|Sometime {{after that}} event, Kane then {{approached}} future Dolls singer David Johansen. As Johansen explains it:Killer Kane {{was known for}} his outrageous outfits such as <b>one-piece</b> <b>body</b> stockings, large bow-ties, and thigh-high, neon-colored platform boots. Kane created many original and infamous looks by scouring shops in London, [...] "combing through Amsterdam's Waterlooplein flea market during all of 1970", and [...] "various Brooklyn thrift shops". Mixing pop art with music, the Dolls sought to create a persona as [...] "larger-than-life rock-and-roll comic book superheroes", or as if they were a band from outer space - concepts that were expanded upon {{in one form or another}} not much later by other bands such as KISS. In addition to his signature bass sound, Kane had a unique way of performing on stage. As rock photographer Bob Gruen explained, while playing bass Kane [...] "moved a bit robotically, kind of like a giant Frankenstein." [...] Throughout his tenure with the Dolls, Kane dated a succession of atypically tall women, including Stacia of Hawkwind.|$|E
5000|$|The X-Mag was {{basically}} the same marker as the E-Mag electronically, except it also included the ACE(Anti-Chop Eye). The components included the original introduction of the X-Valve, originally engraved with an XMag symbol, and now just an X. It wasn't always called the X-Mag. It originally was called the Emag Extreem which later became X-Mag for short. The body of the X-Mag was a single piece instead of the body-rail combo that all previous AGD mags used. The main feature of the X-Mag, besides the <b>one-piece</b> <b>body,</b> was the removable breeches, which allowed users to change the feed port from center feed to warpfeed left or warpfeed right. There were some rare colors produced just as in every previous run. Magma and Placenta {{were two of the}} colors that had runs of 3 or less. The original X-Mag was considered somewhat [...] "blocky-looking," [...] so AGD ran the body through a computer controlled CNC milling machine. The result was a lighter, more attractive marker named the C&C X-Mag.|$|E

5000|$|From the mid-1950s, Pyro {{manufactured}} model kits {{covering a}} wide range of subjects. These included automobiles, aircraft, ships, replica historic firearms, animals, dinosaurs, anatomical and educational models. Innovative when first introduced, Pyro kits featured two-part mirror-molded sectional bodies, hulls, gun-barrels or fuselages which would be assembled horizontally. This design allowed mold-makers to offer multiple variations of some subjects, requiring only minor modification to the master mold. However, by the mid-to-late 1960s, this type of tooling had been rendered obsolete by the side slide molding process innovated by George Toteff, first at AMT and later at MPC which allowed manufacturers to produce <b>one-piece</b> car <b>bodies</b> with crisply detailed engraving.|$|R
