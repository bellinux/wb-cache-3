5|$|Connal, Cline's boss, was {{available}} in case of trouble, watching {{from his home in}} Connecticut. His superior, NBC Sports vice president Chet Simmons, who alternated weekends with Connal as <b>on-call</b> in the event of difficulties, was also watching from his Manhattan home. NBC president Goodman and NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann also turned on the game, which was expected to be exciting, in their New York area homes. The Buffalo Bills–San Diego Chargers game, shown as the first of a network doubleheader, was running long in its 2½-hour time slot, and NBC unhesitatingly cut its ending to go to the Jets and Raiders.|$|E
5|$|Health: Brown said {{he wanted}} doctors' {{surgeries}} to open at weekends, and GPs to be <b>on-call</b> in the evenings. Doctors {{had been given the}} right to opt out of out-of-hours care two years before under a controversial pay deal signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, that awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006. Lord Ara Darzi was appointed to review NHS service delivery, especially in London. Proposed policies included the induction of polyclinics, which would be open to tender and possibly run by private companies.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or <b>on-call,</b> who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as an excuse to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{his time}} in the U.S. Senate, Brown served {{as a member of the}} Massachusetts General Court, first in the State House of Representatives (1998–2004) and then in the State Senate (2004–2010). Brown served 35 years in the Army National Guard, {{retiring}} in 2014 with the rank of colonel. Brown went on to work as a political contributor for Fox News Channel and as an <b>on-call</b> host for select Fox News Channel shows, including Fox & Friends.|$|E
5|$|Brown had {{stated that}} {{win or lose}} in his 2014 New Hampshire Senatorial bid, he planned to remain a New Hampshire {{resident}} {{for the rest of}} his life. In January 2015, it was revealed that shortly after losing to Shaheen, Brown, age 55, filed an application to the Massachusetts State Retirement Board to claim a state pension. Brown has not ruled out running for office again in the future. Brown is also working as a contributor for Fox News Channel and as an <b>on-call</b> host for Fox & Friends. Brown served as a featured speaker at the 2015 Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua, New Hampshire. Brown continues to play an active role in politics, campaigning and fundraising with senatorial and congressional candidates and meeting with Republican candidates for President in New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{home care}} {{is the most}} common level of care provided. In spite of its title, routine home care does not {{indicate}} a location of care, but a level (or intensity) of care provided. Routine care may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home. Interdisciplinary team members supply a variety of services during routine home care, including offering necessary supplies, such as durable medical equipment, medications related to the hospice diagnosis and incidentals like diapers, bed pads, gloves, and skin protectants. Twenty-four-hour <b>on-call</b> services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after normal business hours by a registered nurse prepared to address urgent patient concerns.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to the bus}} {{and rail}} changes on October 6, 2003, DART has {{launched}} its premium <b>on-call</b> shuttle service to replace many low-productive DART bus routes. It was first opened in some North Dallas and Plano neighborhoods and, in late 2005, it expanded to Glenn Heights in Northern Ellis County. DART <b>On-Call</b> operates on weekdays only (except on holidays).|$|E
25|$|The <b>On-Call</b> service serves {{north central}} Plano, eastern Rowlett, Farmers Branch, North Dallas, Lakewood, Richardson, Lake Highlands, and Glenn Heights.|$|E
25|$|The {{other means}} of road {{transport}} in the city include vans, regionally known as Maxi Cabs, auto rickshaws, <b>on-call</b> metered taxis and tourist taxis.|$|E
25|$|Cotton {{defended the}} heroism of {{emergency}} service workers who themselves {{were affected by}} Psychological trauma. An <b>on-call</b> counsellor has been made available. Around 80 firefighters and Met Police officers are reported to be suffering from their experiences.|$|E

25|$|The SFSG also act as {{the hunter}} force during the SERE phase of the UKSF Selection; in addition, the SFSG also have a {{rotating}} company group trained in Counter Terrorism (CT) to support the <b>on-call</b> SAS or SBS squadrons on CT rotation.|$|E
25|$|For many {{specialties}} {{an increasing}} {{proportion of the}} training time is spent in outpatient clinics rather than on inpatient care. Since in-house call is usually reduced on these outpatient rotations, this also contributes to the overall decrease in {{the total number of}} <b>on-call</b> hours.|$|E
25|$|Within the Metropolitan Police Service, {{a number}} of {{specials}} work within SO1, 6, 14 and 18, providing operational support to their armed colleagues. Special Constables at Wiltshire Police have established a drone unit offering a 24/7 <b>on-call</b> service, {{the only one of}} its kind in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|FSM {{services}} {{can be provided}} as demand based (often called on-request, <b>on-call,</b> on-demand, ad-hoc or non-scheduled) or scheduled (also known as regular) desludging, {{or a combination of}} both. Under either mechanism, OSSFs are desludged on a periodic basis or when the household requests it or due to inspection by a competent authority indicates desludging is needed.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 {{during the}} Yugoslavian civil wars, the RDAF C-130 Hercules {{aircraft}} {{were used for}} transport of the 900 Danish troops participating in the UN-led mission to the Balkans. In 1996, a C-130 joined the NATO <b>On-Call</b> International Airlift Pool along with a Gulfstream aircraft. The Gulfstreams were replaced by Challenger planes the following year, when the Danish government ordered the three Challengers in current use.|$|E
25|$|On October 2012, DART {{introduced}} a new fleet of 14 to 17-passenger buses for its <b>on-call</b> & Flex services, and beginning on October 22, some select bus routes that are less-traveled. Beginning in 2013, DART would replace most of bus fleet with NABI 40LFW buses running off CNG fuel. Voted unanimously, by state government to rapidly revise to a clean-air fleet over their existing diesel buses.|$|E
25|$|Taxis {{are mostly}} {{informal}} and unmetered; they are cheap but feature poor driving habits. Fares are agreed upon before the passenger enters the taxi. Taxis vary {{in size from}} small four-door compacts to large vans. They account for {{a large part of}} the car stock. In many cases they are just a private car with a taxi sticker on the windshield. Additionally, several companies provide <b>on-call</b> taxi service.|$|E
25|$|Chang met {{his wife}} Ann Simmons in 1966. He was the <b>on-call</b> {{emergency}} physician at St. Anthony's Hospital in North Cheam, London, where Ann took herself after being taken unwell at a party. They had three children: Vanessa, Matthew, and Marcus. Chang had two younger siblings: sister Frances and brother Anthony. He was irreligious but was known to ask Sister Bernie to say a prayer for his patients and {{was known for his}} compassion.|$|E
25|$|In smaller centres, EMTs may be part-time, or even <b>on-call</b> {{from home}} in some cases. All {{ambulance}} personnel are either {{the equivalent of}} EMT-B or EMT-I. Staffing of ambulances is normally 2 people, with two EMT-Bs, or, where available, an EMT-B and an EMT-I. Paramedics are usually found only in Reykjavík, which operates a single, Advanced Life Support ambulance with a crew of three. Ambulances are organized according to the country's multiple Health Service Districts, but are centrally dispatched. At 2014 the ambulances were converted Mercedes vans.|$|E
25|$|The Sea Kings fly a {{combined}} 4,500 hours per year. Half {{of these are}} used for missions, the remainder for training. Because the unit operates under military rules, it has a stricter training regime than civilian operators. It can also operate under more severe weather conditions. The bases have <b>on-call</b> rooms and a crew on duty at all times. The squadron aims as an average scrambling time of 15 minutes; this varies between 10 and 25 minutes depending {{on the time of}} day, the layout of the base and preparations.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September 1951, UN {{offensive}} {{operations in}} the vicinity of the Punchbowl kicked off. Despite his parent X Corps being supported by two-thirds of the CAS sorties flown, Marine General Gerald C. Thomas believed his 1st Division was shortchanged. On 2 October, he complained and claimed his division needed 40 of the 96 sorties of CAS allocated every day. It was pointed out to him that when Marine pilots checked in with the JOC that they were forwarded to support Marine ground units as much as possible, and that he received <b>on-call</b> support from Air Force sorties.|$|E
25|$|Female police {{officers}} were initially given six-day, 48-hour work weeks, and {{were not allowed to}} work night shifts apart from when <b>on-call</b> duties until 1973. Female officers did in fact do a week of nights at least from 1965. Female officers were usually seconded to the Criminal Investigation Department, but in 1921 Lilian Wyles was appointed the first female Inspector to the Criminal Intelligence Department. A policy in place from 1927 until 1946 forced women to leave the Metropolitan Police if they got married. Female {{police officers}} were not authorised to take fingerprints until 1937. The Police Federation, the rank-and-file staff association, let women join in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Liberty University's Campus East {{housing complex}} {{consists}} of 30 multi-story apartment style dormitories, {{the last six}} of which were completed in 2007. Rooms in these dormitories have their own kitchens, living room and private baths. A clubhouse offers a swimming pool, billiards room, and a private theater. A tunnel connecting {{the east and west}} ends of the campus was completed in 2004. A second tunnel was completed in May 2014, and provides pedestrian passage under the Norfolk Southern Railway and access to nearby shopping opportunities. In addition, a campus bus/shuttle system was added in the fall of 2006, providing transportation both on and off campus until midnight most evenings, along with an <b>on-call</b> late night shuttle bus until 2:30am.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1980s, fire {{protection}} operated through three fire companies. In 1980, the Borough completed {{the construction of}} the Central Fire Station on 6th street from which all personnel and equipment are currently dispatched. The staff is composed of paid <b>on-call</b> volunteers who respond, on average, 375-400 calls per year. Calls include {{fire protection}}, rescue/extrication, and HAZMAT response, and are dispatched via Lehigh County's 911 Communications Center. It's vehicles include two 1988 Central States 1250 GPM Pumpers, One 110' Simon LTI 1989 Aerial, Central States 2002 Heavy Rescue Unit, 1989 Chevrolet Fire Police Vehicle, 1985 Chevrolet and a 1983 Ford Special response units, 1969 Ford bucket utility truck, 2001 GMC Yukon (Fire Chief's vehicle), and a 2011 HME 109' aerial ladder truck.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft {{commonly}} flew <b>on-call</b> support missions for allied ground forces, F-15Es usually carried MK-82 and GBU-12 {{bombs in}} this role, other weapons were sometimes carried, during one mission a GBU-28, two GBU-24s and six GBU-12s were released. Frequent targets {{during the rest}} of the war were individual insurgents, light vehicles and supply convoys; cannon fire was often expended as well as bombs from F-15Es. It was during combat over Afghanistan that four 391st crews conducted the longest fighter mission in history; lasting a total of 15.5hours, nine of those hours spent flying over the target area. Two F-15Es attacked two Taliban command and control facilities, two buildings suspected of being used by Taliban fighters, and a road block; the F-15Es refueled 12 times during the mission.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Plymouth on 12 March, the 11th BAC {{establishment}} was {{to include}} dedicated General Service (GS) ammunition wagons (with limber), one wagon per howitzer, and one GS wagon for stores, {{with at least}} 132 horses (both riding and draft, using six per wagon). The Column’s 'operational' task was to have available (carry) a constant supply, and bring forward (<b>on-call),</b> forty-eight rounds per howitzer, to a Firing Battery’s entrenched position, or to supply it to the Battery’s own ammunition wagon lines. Working mostly at night, moving forward, the BAC ammunition wagons were interchangeable with a Firing Batteries own ammunition wagons (one per gun), so full wagons could be easily 'dropped-off', being unhooked and taken away for reloading, a howitzer battery looking to 'always have' available 108 rounds.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of pre-bombardment {{concerns}} by ground commanders, all planned long-range shots on seaward batteries were cancelled and {{it was decided that}} only call fires would be delivered. Inter-service negotiations made three batteries dedicated navy targets and added any batteries firing on the ships. The ships were to have spotter planes over Cherbourg targets. During ship approaches from 09:40 until 12:00 they were to fire only if fired on. Infantry fire-coordination was provided in the air and on the ground. P-38 Lightnings of the IX Army Air Force flew from southern England for naval combat air patrol, fighter-bomber strikes and <b>on-call</b> close support of the infantry. Collins, commanding VII Corps, arranged for shore fire control parties to join infantry units as they approached German fortified objectives.|$|E
25|$|From 2002 the anaesthesiologist {{became the}} {{responsibility}} of the respective health trust. From 2004 the funding was changed and the 330 Sqn is paid for through the Ministry of Justice and the Police. From the start the service had a reaction time, from alarm to airborne, of 60 minutes. Sola was the first base to receive an <b>on-call</b> room, allowing the response time to be lowered to 15 minutes. This proved successful and was introduced at Banak in 2006, Bodø in 2007, and Ørland and Rygge in 2008. A sixth base was opened at Florø Airport in 2009. The 330 Squadron was featured in an eight-episode television documentary series of the same name, broadcast by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation in 2009.|$|E
25|$|RIT Public Safety is {{the primary}} agency {{responsible}} for protection of students, staff and property as well as enforcement of both college policies and state laws. Officers are NYS Licensed Security Guards who possess an expanded scope of authority under NYS Education Law, and many Officers have prior law enforcement backgrounds. Rumor has also circulated that the department is pushing for Peace Officer authority, however no official action has been made at this time. Public Safety Officers operate both a dispatch center and various types of patrol units on campus and at off campus holdings (such as The Inn and Conference Center) and also manage the Call Box System. Activating a call box will automatically place the user in touch with an Officer in the dispatch center who will direct Patrol Officers {{to respond to the}} location; if necessary, Officers will summon the Monroe County Sheriff's to respond as well. As the college does not have 24/7 on campus crisis intervention counselors, {{in the event of a}} mental or behavioral health incident during hours where a counselor is not available, Public Safety Officers are also trained to act as mediators until an <b>on-call</b> counselor can be summoned.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} week of February the group {{provided}} <b>on-call</b> close air support to US ground forces, directed by P-40 Warhawks of the 71st Reconnaissance Group acting as forward air controllers. On 2 February, it coordinated with SBD dive bombers of Marine Aircraft Group 24 in bombing Japanese positions defending Umingan against attacks by the U.S. 25th Division, then supported the 1st Cavalry Division as it moved into Manila. The mediums then began a campaign against industries and airfields on Formosa, and attacked shipping along the southeast China coast. Tactics evolved in which formations of 36 aircraft bombed from medium altitudes, while low altitude strafing attacks featured four waves of B-25Js flying nine abreast, such as the attack on the Imperial Japanese Navy airfield at Taichū (台中), Formosa, on 2 March. The raid of 2 March illustrates the scope of medium bomber operations in the Western Pacific in 1945: attacks in bombardment wing strength using two groups, each group with its own target, employing a mission force of 72 B-25 bombers, 24 P-51 Mustang fighter escorts, and two OA-10 Catalinas on station for rescue operations. On 20 March, the group attacked a small convoy of warships escorting a large freighter near Amoy, China. Flying abreast in four attack waves totaling 22 Mitchells, each squadron lost a bomber in the brief but vicious combat, with two going down in the target area and two others crash-landing at Fourteenth Air Force fields on the Chinese mainland.|$|E
500|$|Martin Harlinghausen {{commanded}} Fliegerkorps II (Air Corps II), which controlled Luftwaffe {{operations in}} Africa, {{as part of}} Luftflotte 2 (Air Fleet 2). Subordinate to Fliegerkorps II were seven different Kampfgeschwader (Bomber Wings), under direct command. Several Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) were also <b>on-call</b> for support.

500|$|The X Air Corps ( [...] X) {{was based}} in Sicily, and {{consisted}} of four bomber groups, one heavy fighter group and one fighter squadron {{with a total of}} 168 aircraft. It was available to provide <b>on-call</b> support to the 4th Air Fleet as required, but only a few units played any part in supporting the invasion because the primary task of X Air Corps was interdicting Allied supply convoys to Malta. Units earmarked for support to the invasion included 7th Squadron of 26th Fighter Wing (JG 26) equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters, and III Group of ZG 26, flying Messerschmitt Bf 110C/D heavy fighters.|$|E
500|$|For {{the moment}} it was safer ashore. The cavalrymen overran the airstrip. Sporadic {{opposition}} allowed them {{to set up the}} antiaircraft machine guns on the beach, unload supplies, and patrol inland. Two soldiers were killed and three wounded. At 16:00, General MacArthur and Admiral Kinkaid came ashore. The general inspected the position. A lieutenant warned him a Japanese sniper had been killed in the vicinity just a few minutes before. [...] "That's {{the best thing to do}} with them," [...] the General replied. He decided to stay, ordering Chase to hold his position until the follow-up force arrived, then returned to Phoenix. Fechteler's force departed at 17:29, the transports having unloaded and most of the bombardment force having exhausted its ammunition. Bush and Stockton remained to provide <b>on-call</b> naval fire support.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) {{returns home}} after {{being on a}} hiatus, due to her being fired from the hospital, to rekindle her {{relationship}} with Karev. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) are being intimate in the hospital's <b>on-call</b> room, until Torres discovers that she has the chicken pox. Robbins places her in isolation, because she wants a [...] "sexy" [...] relationship, and does not think the chicken pox can account to that. Meredith is set to perform a Pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure with Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), {{under the supervision of}} Webber, but under the influence of alcohol, he falls asleep, and Bailey performs the surgery. In an effort to reason with Meredith, Shepherd offers her a proposition. Shepherd is aware that he will receive Webber's job if he is reported, and therefore will be in charge of hiring. He explains to Meredith that if she lets him report the chief, he will let Stevens re-obtain her job.|$|E
