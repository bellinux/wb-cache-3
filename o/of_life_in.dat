40|$|Is weather {{a factor}} that determines the {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> public <b>life</b> <b>in</b> European cities? It {{can be said that}} every six months public <b>life</b> changes radically <b>in</b> European cities in response to changes in the weather, such as, the type of activities that take place. Furthermore, in these European cities, culture is another important characteristic <b>of</b> public <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> the first stages the results of this research, identified the following characteristics as factors of efficiency <b>of</b> public <b>life</b> <b>in</b> these cities: climate, the mobility system, the historic area, vitality, materials, vegetation and buildings. These variables define the quality <b>of</b> public <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the cities studied. Weather conditions determine many of the patterns of urban organization. All these features would require the analysis of multiple variables which would be impossible to carry out manually. Thus, this article suggests the design of a software application that could enable the analysis <b>of</b> public <b>life</b> <b>in</b> light <b>of</b> these efficiency factors, to guide the city to sustainability...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to answer the question: Is there {{evidence}} that the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> residents <b>in</b> a community that has had community development intervention is different as compared to the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> residents <b>in</b> a nearby community that did not have community development initiatives? This was done by administering community development initiatives in a local area and comparing it to a similar community that did not receive this intervention. The residents of these communities rated the quality of their lives and communities in two purposively selected suburbs in Perth, Western Australia using the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index to measure individual and neighbourhood well-being. The quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> residents <b>in</b> both communities is then compared to national averages for quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> or well-being. Answering this question provides empirical evidence of variation between ratings <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> residents <b>in</b> different communities and highlights the utility of the Wellbeing Index for the evaluation of interdisciplinary community development<br /...|$|R

5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the same way that the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>in</b> Carl Woese's three-domain system.

5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry.

Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and {{play a vital role in}} ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the damage}} and loss of life caused by the storm, the name Bess was retired and {{replaced}} with Bonnie.
