5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} the function <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> a sports team in {{both individual and}} group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, with the defense of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Darwaza {{supported}} the Ottoman Empire {{based on his}} feelings <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> Islam and {{of belonging to the}} larger Ottoman Muslim ummah ("nation"). In 1906, he served in the local Ottoman administration as a clerk in the Department of Telegraphic and Postal Services (DTPS) in Nablus. His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the Galilee and northern Samaria). He was also an Arabist and was enthusiastic about the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman government would institute reforms and grant the Arabs autonomy {{within the framework of the}} empire.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{writings}} of Herodotus in the 5th century BC, Getae/Dacians are acknowledged as belonging to the Thracian sphere of influence. Despite this, they are distinguished from other Thracians by particularities of religion and custom. Geto-Dacians and Thracians were kin people {{but they were not}} the same. The differences from the southern Thracians or from the neighboring Scythians were probably faint, as several ancient authors make confusions <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> both groups.|$|E
25|$|The true Church {{is made of}} {{all true}} Christians. There are two ordinances: water baptism, and the Lord's Supper. Water baptism is by {{immersion}} and is for believers only.

The PCG only uses unfermented grape juice. Though not an ordinance, divine healing {{is believed to be}} provided for in the atonement of Christ and available to all believers. Members practice tithing.|$|E
25|$|With time, {{the kibbutz}} members' sense <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> the kibbutz and its goals decreased. This process {{originated}} both from personal frustrations among the kibbutz members {{as a result}} of internal processes and from the growing stratification and inequality due to the growth of capitalistic practices. Over the years, some kibbutz members established professional careers outside the kibbutz, accumulating power, privileges and prestige. The balance between individual values and values of the kibbutz began to tip, and work motivation was affected. An emphasis was placed on social compensation to encourage productivity. These processes occurred in parallel with a severe economic crisis.|$|E

25|$|The Nashashibi {{family had}} {{particularly}} strong influence in Palestine during the British Mandate Period from 1920 until 1948. Throughout this period, they competed with the Husaynis, for {{dominance of the}} Palestinian Arab political scene. As with other A’ayan their lack <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> the Palestinian Arab population allowed them to rise as leaders but not as representatives of the Palestinian Arab community. The Nashashibi family was led by Raghib Nashashibi, who was appointed as Mayor of Jerusalem in 1920. Raghib was an influential political figure throughout the British Mandate period, and helped form the National Defence Party in 1934. He {{also served as a}} minister in the Jordanian government, governor of the West Bank, member of the Jordanian Senate, and the first military governor in Palestine.|$|E
25|$|The Jivamukti Yoga {{method of}} {{meditation}} is a mantra form of meditation, and follows a three-step procedure: choose a seat, be still, and focus. The mantra “Let-Go” is taught to all Jivamukti students, {{and provides the}} focus. The practitioner is instructed to align the silent repetition of the mantra with the incoming and outgoing breath. By witnessing the continuous movement of breath through the body and thought through the mind, Jivamukti teaches that the practitioner can eventually let go <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> the body and mind and come to realize the supreme Self. The Jivamukti method holds realization of the supreme self or enlightenment {{to be the ultimate}} goal of yoga. The class usually begins with Sanskrit chanting; this is followed by detailed meditation instruction and then about 20 minutes of actual sitting practice. Afterwards there is a Q session with the teacher, and a final closing.|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, Kuti {{began to}} {{emphasize}} his identification with Africa and its culture in his music and opposed the colonial mentality <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> Western powers {{such as the}} United States and the United Kingdom. His albums during this period expressed aspects of his ideology such as his African heritage and nationalism. On his 1973 song [...] "Eko lie", Kuti declared that Lagos was his home rather than London or New York City, where he had performed earlier in his career. Lagos and its landmark events became common themes in his songs. He revisited the theme on Confusion in 1974 to acknowledge that he identifies with the city despite its problems.|$|E

500|$|In the 1830s, few {{sought the}} {{immediate}} eradication of slavery. [...] The abolitionist movement {{was young and}} only recently had figures such as William Lloyd Garrison taken on the fight. Stevens's reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers. Richard Current in 1942, suggested {{it was out of}} ambition; Fawn Brodie, in her controversial 1959 psychobiography of Stevens, suggested it was out <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> the downtrodden, based on his handicap. Trefousse, in his 1997 work, also suggested that Stevens's feelings towards the downtrodden were a factor, combined with remorse over the Butler case, but that ambition was unlikely to have been a major motivator, as Stevens's fervor in the anti-slavery cause inhibited his career.|$|E
500|$|Despite Bernstein's own musical antipathies, Adams {{claims the}} {{conductor}} generally remained open-minded and curious enough [...] "to try something at least once." [...] Among the world premieres of [...] "difficult" [...] works he led were Olivier Messiaen's Turangalîla-Symphonie in Boston in 1949 and Carter's Concerto for Orchestra in New York in 1970; {{and despite his}} apparent lack <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> Carter's music, he described the composer in 1975 as [...] "a brilliant mind and a supremely intelligent musician." [...] Bernstein conducted Connotations again {{during the first week}} of regular Philharmonic concerts in 1963 and included it among the pieces the orchestra played on its European tour in February 1963. He would also commission a subsequent orchestral work from Copland, which became Inscape, and conduct Connotations again in an all-Copland concert with the New York Philharmonic in 1989. Even with this advocacy and the chance to familiarize himself at length, Connotations apparently remained a work that Bernstein did not conduct well. Critic Peter Davis, in his review of the 1989 performance, writes that while Connotations remained [...] "admittedly not a very lovable piece," [...] in Bernstein's hands it [...] "sounded more fulsome than portentous." ...|$|E
