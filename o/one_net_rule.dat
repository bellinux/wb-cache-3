40|$|Neural Logic Network or Neulonet is {{a hybrid}} of neural network expert systems. Its {{strength}} lies {{in its ability to}} learn and to represent human logic in decision making using component <b>net</b> <b>rules.</b> The technique originally employed in neulonet learning is backpropagation. However, the resulting weight adjustments will lead to a loss in the logic of the <b>net</b> <b>rules.</b> A new technique is now developed that allows the neulonet to learn by composing <b>net</b> <b>rules</b> using genetic programming. This paper presents experimental results to demonstrate this new and exciting capability in capturing human decision logic from examples. Comparisons will also be made between the use of <b>net</b> <b>rules,</b> and the use of standard boolean logic of negation, disjunction and conjunction in evolutionary computation. ...|$|R

The SEC had maintained a <b>net</b> capital <b>rule</b> since 1944, but had exempted broker-dealers subject to [...] "more comprehensive" [...] capital requirements imposed by identified exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Web service {{personalization}} is {{an important}} research topic {{in the area of}} service-oriented computing which has the potential to bring more service value to end users that are fit for individual user’s particular needs. In this paper, we propose <b>Rule</b> <b>nets,</b> which is based on PrT (Predicate/Transition) <b>nets.</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>nets</b> has the capability to model a wide spectrum of rules for expressing personalization needs. There rules then can be woven to a business process to bring flexible personalization features to this process. The woven process can be expressed as a PrT net suitable for formal analysis and simulation using existing Petri net tools...|$|R

The {{inductive}} hypothesis on the premise of rule (S-Res) ensures that there exist a transition t = (m, σ, m') and a process p"_ 1 ≡ p'_ 1 such that dec(p_ 1)[t〉dec(p"_ 1) with l(t) = σ. Note that dec((ν a) p_ 1) = dec(p_ 1){a'/a} for a' restricted. Note also that, by Lemma 5, if t is derivable by the <b>net</b> <b>rules,</b> then also transition t' = (m{a'/a}, σ,m'{a'/a}) is derivable by the <b>net</b> <b>rules.</b> Therefore, since m{a'/a}⊆dec(p_ 1){a'/a}, we have that dec((ν a) p_ 1) = dec(p_ 1){a'/a} [...] [t'〉 dec(p"_ 1){a'/a} = dec((ν a) p"_ 1), with (ν a)p"_ 1 ≡(ν a)p'_ 1.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{contribution}} {{provides a}} thorough survey {{of our work}} on rule-based refinement. Rule-based refinement comprises the transforma-tion of Petri <b>nets</b> using <b>rules</b> while preserving certain system properties. Petri <b>net</b> <b>rules</b> and transformations are expressed by morphisms and pushouts. This allows an abstract formulation of our notions indepen-dent of a specific Petri net class, as place/transition nets, elementary nets, predicate/transition nets etc. Hence, it is adequate to consider our approach as rule-based refinement of Petri nets in general. We have pre-sented various results in recent years at different conferences. So this contribution gives an overview of our work in a compact form leaving out the technical details...|$|R

Our model also features debt-financed purchases of goods, debt cleared through third parties, and debt settlement requiring final payment using fiat money. We then evaluate the relative merits of three alternative settlement rules in this environment: a strict <b>net</b> settlement <b>rule,</b> a <b>net</b> settlement <b>rule</b> with debt forgiveness and a gross settlement rule. We find that net settlement is superior to gross settlement and that only a <b>net</b> settlement <b>rule</b> with debt forgiveness [...] reducing obligations of those who repay debt when others are defaulting [...] produces a unique, stable and optimal stationary equilibrium.
