50|$|At the University of Pennsylvania, Burk rowed in {{the varsity}} boats. After graduating in 1934, he began racing {{in the single}} scull (1x), a <b>one-man</b> <b>boat.</b> Burk won 46 {{consecutive}} races in the single scull from 1937 to 1940, inclusive. He was the U.S. and Canadian champion for those four years. In 1938, he won the Diamond Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta when he set a Henley course record of 8:02, which was to stand for 27 years. He won Diamonds again in 1939, beating Roger Verey in the final. He {{became known as the}} “world’s greatest oarsman”, {{and at the end of}} the 1939 season, Burk was voted the James E. Sullivan Award as the country's outstanding amateur athlete.|$|E
5000|$|Lieutenant Peter Halkett, {{an officer}} in the Royal Navy {{designed}} the Halkett boat in 1845 as the first successful inflatable boat. His first design was made of rubber-impregnated [...] "Mackintosh cloth." [...] The [...] "boat cloak" [...] served as a waterproof poncho or cloak until inflated, when it became a <b>one-man</b> <b>boat.</b> A special pocket held bellows for inflation, and a blade to turn a walking stick into a paddle. A special umbrella could double as a sail. Halkett later developed a two-man boat which was carried in a knapsack; when inflated, it could carry two men operating a paddle on each side, and when deflated it served as a waterproof blanket to allow the users to camp on wet ground. The Admiralty was skeptical about potential uses for Halkett's designs; on 8 May 1845, Lord Herbert, First Secretary to the Admiralty, wrote to Halkett that [...] "My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service".|$|E

50|$|Varying in length, the 24-28 ft <b>one-man</b> <b>boats</b> {{usually had}} one sail, while the larger two-man boats which were around 35 ft were rigged with two sails, as cat-ketches. They had leg-o-mutton sails with sprit booms on un-stayed masts. The larger boats had three mast-steps; {{one at the}} bow, one {{amidships}} and one in between. Typically, in the summer, two masts would be stepped: one at the bow and amidships. In the winter, when heavier winds were expected, a single mast would be stepped in between. Their hulls were narrow with a large sheer and low freeboard. At the ends {{you will find a}} plumb bow with the heel of the stem sitting just {{out of the water and}} a round stern. The centerboard was long and shallow as was the balanced rudder.|$|R
