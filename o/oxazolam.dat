50|$|<b>Oxazolam</b> is a {{drug that}} is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. It has anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is a prodrug for desmethyldiazepam.|$|E
50|$|Monkey studies {{looking at}} the {{dependence}} liability of several sedative drugs showed that benzoctamine was a dependence-free drug, while pentobarbital, alcohol, chloroform, meprobamate, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and <b>oxazolam</b> were not.|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{actions of}} benzodiazepines at the GABAA receptor {{are similar to}} those of neurosteroids. Neuroactive steroids are positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, enhancing GABA function and in turn have effects on mood and other functions. Many benzodiazepines (diazepam, medazepam, estazolam, temazepam, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam) potently inhibit the enzymes involved in the metabolism of neurosteroids. The tetrahydroxazole ring that cloxazolam and <b>oxazolam</b> have decreases the inhibitory potency of benzodiazepines on neurosteroids. Thus there could be subtle differences between cloxazolam and other benzodiazepines. However, because the parent prodrugs of cloxazolam and <b>oxazolam</b> were tested rather than the active metabolites, this is purely speculative.|$|E
