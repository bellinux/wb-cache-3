5|$|After {{winning the}} coin toss, Alabama elected {{to receive the}} ball to open the first half. Marquis Maze fielded the James Hairston kickoff and {{returned}} it to the Alabama 30-yard line where the offense began its first series. Alabama <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pair of gains by Trent Richardson on an 18-yard run and on a 22-yard pass reception from AJ McCarron to reach the LSU 30-yard line. However, the drive stalled on the next three plays, and on fourth down Cade Foster missed a 44-yard field goal wide right and the game remained tied at zero. The Tigers began their first offensive series with Jarrett Lee at quarterback from their own 27-yard line. After LSU gained a pair of first downs on runs by Spencer Ware and short passes from Lee, the drive faltered, and Brad Wing punted the ball out-of-bounds at the Alabama five.|$|E
5|$|At the trial, Archibald Macdonald, {{representing}} the prosecution, argued that Paine's work served only to inflame the populace and distribute radical ideas to those without {{the experience to}} understand them in context. Erskine's reply <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> defence {{of the freedom of}} lawyers to represent whichever clients came to them, and followed with an exposition of his views {{on the nature of the}} freedom of the press—arguing that the publication of radical tracts served only to improve the government by highlighting its weaknesses, and could not be seditious if published in good faith. Despite Erskine's speech later receiving a rapturous response, Paine was found guilty before Macdonald replied. The verdict was seen by the government as legitimising their repression of radicalism, and paved the way for the 1794 Treason Trials, in which Erskine played a prominent role.|$|E
5|$|City's season <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 0–0 draw {{at home to}} Liverpool. City {{were awarded}} a penalty, but new captain Tony Book hit it wide. Two defeats followed, at Southampton and Stoke. The Stoke defeat led to a {{tactical}} switch. Mike Summerbee, who played wide on the right {{at the start of}} the season, was moved to centre-forward. The change reaped immediate dividends, with Summerbee playing a leading role in a 4–2 win against Southampton. This was the first in a run of five straight wins, after which Manchester City had caught up with the league leaders. During this run of wins young winger Stan Bowles made his league debut, scoring twice in a 5–2 win against Sheffield United.|$|E

5|$|During the Georgian era Bath became fashionable, and {{the architects}} John Wood, the Elder, and his son, John Wood the Younger, laid out new areas of housing for {{residents}} and visitors. Assembly rooms {{had been built}} early in the 18th century, but a new venue for balls, concerts and gambling was envisaged in the area between Queen Square, The Circus and the Royal Crescent. Robert Adam submitted a proposal that was rejected as too expensive. John Wood, the Younger raised funding through a Tontine and construction started in 1769. The New or Upper Assembly Rooms <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grand ball in 1771 and became the hub of fashionable society, being frequented by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, along with the nobility of the time.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, the Golden Age of Trucking Museum was a {{non-profit}} organization dedicated to trucking. The Guerreras owned and operated R.J. Guerrera, a liquid transportation trucking company. Originally, a collection of trucks were restored and stored in barns and garages throughout Connecticut. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum was opened to bring the collection under a single roof. After the property for the museum was purchased in July 1998, Richard Guerrera was diagnosed with cancer. In June 1999, he was transported to the site for an unofficial groundbreaking event. Richard Guerrera died a month later and the facility was completed in 2002. The museum was designed by Francis Guerrera's son-in-law, a general contractor. On September 23, 2002, the museum was formally <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ribbon-cutting ceremony in the complete 32,000 square foot building.|$|E
5|$|North Philadelphia {{continued}} to grow during the early 20th century as a popular residential area for the nouveau riche rejected by old money society. Two ballparks (the Baker Bowl and Shibe Park) were located nearby, as were new cultural institutions and automotive industry buildings. In 1928, the Broad Street Subway was <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> station at North Philadelphia, offering more frequent service to Center City. Its northern entrances were located {{at the intersection of}} Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street, with an underground passage offering an easy connection to the PRR station. The Reading Company replaced Huntingdon Avenue station with North Broad Street station, a massive Classical Revival structure rivaling the PRR station in grandeur. 30th Street Station opened in 1933, reducing North Philadelphia's importance for north-south services. However, North Philadelphia {{continued to}} serve heavy commuter traffic and east-west long-distance trains.|$|E

5|$|Rangers {{first moved}} to the Ibrox area later in 1887, playing on a site {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} the current stadium. The first match at this stadium was an 8–1 defeat to English side Preston North End on 20 August 1887, watched by a capacity crowd of over 15,000. This inaugural match had to be abandoned after 70 minutes due to a pitch invasion. The first Ibrox Park was a success in the short term, as three Scotland international matches and the 1890 Scottish Cup Final were played at the ground. Celtic Park, built in 1892, was more advanced, however. Rangers opted to construct a new stadium, raising funds by forming a limited company. The last match at the old ground was played on 9 December 1899. The new Ibrox Park was formally <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3–1 victory over Hearts on 30 December.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the start}} of the 2012–13 season The Royal Opera has {{continued}} to mount around 20 productions and around seven new productions each season. The 2012–13 season <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> revival of Der Ring des Nibelungen, directed by Keith Warner; new productions that season included Robert le diable, directed by Laurent Pelly, Eugene Onegin, directed by Holten, La donna del lago, directed by Fulljames, and the UK premiere of Written on Skin, composed by George Benjamin and directed by Katie Mitchell. Productions by the Studio Programme included the world premiere of David Bruce's The Firework-Maker's Daughter (inspired by Philip Pullman's novel of the same name), directed by Fulljames, and the UK stage premiere of Gerald Barry's The Importance of Being Earnest, directed by Ramin Gray.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{competed in}} the 1899 Open Championship at Royal St George's Golf Club located in Sandwich, England. He played as an amateur, scored 89 and 90 and missed the cut by 8 strokes. By 1902 he had become the {{professional}} at the Gog Magog Golf Club near Cambridge. In a friendly match against Tom Vardon at Sandwich on 27 May 1903, Strong made a hole-in-one (likely wind assisted) on a par 4 hole. He entered the 1903 Open Championship held at Prestwick Golf Club, South Ayrshire, Scotland, but failed to advance past the half-way cut. In the 1904 Open Championship, again held on his home course at Sandwich, Strong <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first round 93—in windy and cold conditions—but could only improve to 88 in round two when the weather improved. He ended up missing the cut, by 13 strokes, which came at 168.|$|E

5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special key. This key is locked {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.|$|E
5|$|The event <b>opened</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Shop of Horrors {{match between}} Abyss and Black Reign, which lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds. In a Shop of Horrors match, all weapons are legal to use, a wrestler {{can not be}} counted out, and {{it can only be}} won by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell {{interfered}} on Reign's behalf during the encounter. Abyss won the contest by pinfall after slamming Reign into the mat with his maneuver, the Black Hole Slam. After the encounter, Abyss grabbed a key that hung around Reign's neck and used it to open a locked building on the stage, which unknowingly was occupied by an unknown wrestler. Reign and the unknown wrestler then proceeded to lock Abyss in the building and push it off the stage.|$|E
