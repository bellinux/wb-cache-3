5|$|By mid-March, a {{provision}} in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the stimulus package was necessary for job creation.|$|E
5|$|The {{service is}} also used {{as a form of}} civil disobedience: in 2010, users {{expressed}} <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.|$|E

5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about {{remaining in the}} United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which spoke in favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{brought to}} the club his {{political}} awareness of Chinese matters. In 1928, following a public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> a massacre at Jinan (known as the Jinan Incident) in Shandong {{in which more than}} 5,000Chinese soldiers and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese, the club set up the Shandong Relief Fund. Its purpose was to raise funds for China, to create awareness amongst the Chinese about the Japanese invasion of China, and to encourage the Chinese to boycott Japanese goods and services. The Chinese community contributed a total of S$1.34 million within a year of its inception.|$|E
5|$|The press did {{not cover}} the battle at first, and one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's {{dispatch}} to Eustis to {{mean he was}} defeated. By December, as most major American papers carried stories on the battle, public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the Shawnee attack grew. At a time of high tensions with the United Kingdom, many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. In response, Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in American domestic affairs. A few months later, on June 18, 1812, the U.S. government declared war against United Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, Harrison left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.|$|E
25|$|The {{teachers}} of the Engadine in particular were <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> the decision, but those in the Surmeir were mostly satisfied. Few opinions were heard from the Surselva, which was interpreted either as support or resignation, depending {{in the viewpoint of}} the observer.|$|R
2500|$|... Prime Minister John Key was <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> the attack. He {{called it}} a [...] "despicable {{terrorist}} act" [...] while condemning the attack.

50|$|Despite Long's {{promises}} of increased social programs, voters were still <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> the recent corruption scandals and {{were unwilling to}} believe Earl Long's claims {{that he had had}} nothing to do with the scandals. Jones's victory ended twelve years of Longite governors in Louisiana.|$|R
5|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then on out. In 1965, {{it was decided to}} expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. In February 1966, the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Oakland and St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|Japan was a {{signatory}} of the Treaty of Versailles, which stipulated harsh repercussions for Germany. In the Pacific, Japan gained Germany's islands {{north of}} the equator (the Marshall Islands, the Carolines, the Marianas, the Palau Islands) and Kiautschou/Tsingtao in China. Article 156 of the Treaty also transferred German concessions in Shandong to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China, an issue soon {{to be known as}} Shandong Problem. Chinese <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> this provision led to demonstrations, and a cultural movement known as the May Fourth Movement influenced China not to sign the treaty. China declared the end of its war against Germany in September 1919 and signed a separate treaty with Germany in 1921. This fact greatly contributed to Germany relying on China, and not Japan, as its strategic partner in East Asia for the coming years.|$|E

5|$|The Polish {{settlement}} emboldened the Hungarians, {{who decided}} that Moscow could be defied. A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October {{turned into a}} popular uprising. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy. Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and even fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance. Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, on 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, {{and the next morning}} that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact. On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions {{for the rest of his}} life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.|$|E

25|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that Hellmuth Reinhard took the initiative {{to put an end}} to all Jews in Norway. This may have been motivated by his own ambition, and it's possible he was encouraged by the lack of <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the initial measures targeting Jews.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Rickhoff awarded $310,000 in {{insurance}} funds to Frances A. Hall, who {{is accused of}} having in 2013 killed her 50-year-old husband, trucking executive Bill Hall, Jr., with her vehicle while he was riding his motorcycle near his place of work. The woman was <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> Hall's alleged extramarital affair. Rickhoff made the decision based on the wishes of Hall's adult children.|$|R
5000|$|One week later, motorists in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex were <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> a {{billboard}} promoting the station that was entitled [...] "Highway to Hell", {{a reference to}} the AC/DC song of the same name. The billboard, which was erected on a major Dallas thoroughfare, featured Satan giving a lethal injection to Oklahoma City bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh, who was executed just days before the billboard went up.|$|R

25|$|In {{the wake}} of Le's {{disappearance}} and the discovery of her body, and the sympathy and <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the crime going worldwide, there was a backlash in some circles to the extensive media coverage, and while most acknowledged the crime was especially heart breaking, some questioned whether the level of interest was warranted.|$|E
25|$|The <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> {{this event}} caused another peak in strike {{activity}} in 1919 with 397 strikes involving over 300,000 workers in Buenos Aires alone. While the FORA IX {{claimed to have}} learned its lesson from the Tragic Week and the failed railworkers' strike in 1917, the FORA V experienced a short revival in strength during this year.|$|E
25|$|Incessant {{fighting}} {{followed the}} Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the January 28 Incident battle. This {{resulted in the}} demilitarisation of Shanghai, which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an ongoing campaign to defeat the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies that arose from widespread <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the policy of non-resistance to Japan.|$|E
5000|$|Werder Bremen {{presented}} Wiesenhof as its new shirt sponsor on 13 August 2012. Supporters of {{the club}} were <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> Wiesenhof's sponsorship {{of the club}} that several supporters have cancelled their membership in the club.

5|$|Kīnaʻu died on September 9, 1859 in Kapaʻau, Kohala {{district}} on {{the island}} of Hawaiʻi. The cause of his death was said to be an accident, although the details are unknown.

While his obituary in the Hawaiian newspapers The Polynesian and The Pacific Commercial Advertiser claimed it was consumption.|$|R
25|$|After the {{ceremony}} on live television, NBC's Jim Gray repeatedly asked Rose {{if he was}} ready to admit to betting on baseball and apologize. Many people were <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> Gray's aggressive questioning, feeling that it detracted from {{the ceremony}}. In protest, Yankees outfielder Chad Curtis refused to speak with Gray after his game-winning home run in Game 3. Earlier that season, Rose had been ranked at number 25 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.|$|R
25|$|There was <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> {{the closure}} plan: critics {{pointed out that}} this was a main line, not a small branch railway. The {{campaign}} uncovered evidence that British Rail had mounted a dirty tricks campaign against the line, exaggerating the cost of repairs (£6million for Ribblehead Viaduct alone) and diverting traffic away from the line in order to justify its closure plans, a process referred to as closure by stealth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of public <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact, Browder was indicted for {{passport}} fraud. He was convicted of two counts early in 1940 and sentenced to four years in prison, remaining free for a time on appeal. In the spring of 1942 the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the sentence and Browder began what {{proved to be a}} 14-month stint in federal prison. Browder was subsequently released in 1943 as a gesture towards wartime unity.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, <b>outrage</b> <b>over</b> a {{manslaughter}} {{verdict in}} what many observers {{thought was a}} clear case of murder triggered the Courthouse riots, {{one of the most}} destructive riots in American history. Over the course of three days, 56 people were killed and over 300 were injured. The riots ended the regime of political bosses John Roll McLean and Thomas C. Campbell in Cincinnati. In 1889, the Cincinnati streetcar system began converting its horse-drawn cars to electric streetcars.|$|E
50|$|NICE {{has been}} criticised {{for being too}} slow to reach {{decision}}s. On one occasion, the Royal National Institute of Blind People said it was <b>outraged</b> <b>over</b> its delayed decision for further guidance regarding two drugs for macular degeneration that are already approved {{for use in the}} NHS. However the Department of Health said that it had 'made it clear to PCTs that funding for treatments should not be withheld simply because guidance from NICE is unavailable'.|$|R
