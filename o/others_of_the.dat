5|$|Many birds {{actively}} {{defend a}} territory from <b>others</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that {{are unable to}} defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.|$|E

5|$|Public {{perception}} of the anthem is mixed among Russians.

A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 25% liked it.|$|E
5|$|A {{cattle egret}} will weakly defend {{the area around}} a grazing animal against <b>others</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} Gov. Belcher left {{instructions}} {{that he be}} buried with his ardent friend and cousin, Judge Jonathan Remington (1667-1745, father-in-law of William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence). The body of Judge Jonathan Remington was disinterred and placed by his side. The monument which the governor had directed to be raised over his resting-place was never erected. The tomb became the family vault of Jennisons (Gov. Belcher's granddaughter married Dr. Timothy Lindall Jennison). The site of their grave was forgotten and long search has been made for it. In the late 1800s, local historians found that Gov. Jonathan Belcher and Judge Jonathan Remington were buried in one grave in Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Ma. Their tomb is contiguous to that of Judge Edmund Trowbridge and Edmund Trowbridge Dana. In that of Judge Trowbridge rest the remains of Washington Allston; of Chief Justice Francis Dana; of the poet Richard Henry Dana and <b>others</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family.|$|E

San Francisco Ballet, ABT and New York City Ballet are regarded as the three preeminent classical ballet companies in the US. During the six-week workshop at San Francisco, Copeland {{was placed in the}} most advanced classes and was under a full tuition plus expenses scholarship. At the end of the workshop, she received one of the few offers to continue as a full-time student at the school. She declined the offer because of the encouragement from her mother to return home, the prospect of continuing personal training from the Bradley family and dreams of a subsequent summer with ABT.|$|E

In 1989, he retired from Far West Labs and returned {{to live on the}} Monterey Peninsula. He continued to serve as Professor Emeritus for the Saybrook Graduate School, counseling Ph.D. students. He also continued his work with the annual ISI international systems design conversations, and authored a number of articles and books about systems, design, and evolutionary research. He served two terms as president of the International Federation of Systems Research during 1994-98.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>others</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! {{explores the}} actions of a small insular group facing and {{overcoming}} a more powerful opponent. It was filmed on the island of Barra; the weather was so poor that the production over-ran its 10-week schedule by five weeks, and the film went £20,000 over budget. The initial cut of the film was considered poor by Michael Balcon, the head of the studio, so one of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage and re-edited the film prior to its release.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting <b>others</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E

Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E
5|$|Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also {{explored}} {{this issue}} in Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation (2010). He said that segregated black schools had featured teachers, counselors, and <b>others</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of many public schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as trying to leave the minority group.|$|E

5|$|Thief was {{developed}} with the Dark Engine, a proprietary game engine. It was written during the game's development, {{rather than as}} a separately budgeted project, which led to time constraint issues. An emphasis was placed on simulating real life physics; arrows would arc through the air rather than fly straight. The engine features alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques. Motion capture technology was integrated to allow for realistic character animation. The engine's renderer—which draws the graphics—was largely written by Looking Glass Studios programmer Sean Barrett in fall 1995. While the renderer was expected to be finished before the game's release date, Barrett left the company in 1996. He later performed contract work for the company, and assisted in writing features like hardware support. However, the renderer was never fully addressed, and was less advanced than <b>others</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
