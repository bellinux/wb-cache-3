He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that.

5|$|In 2009, {{with the}} {{production}} beginning to coalesce, Scorsese and a production crew went to Nagasaki, Japan, visiting the original sites {{that served as the}} setting for Endō's novel. Additional location scouting was conducted in Canada. However, Silence entered a state of development hell soon afterwards, and Scorsese decided to work on Shutter Island and Hugo instead. In December 2011, Scorsese stated that Silence would be his next film. By March, although he originally put it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner</b> and consequently dropped out, Scorsese signed back on to The Wolf of Wall Street and opted to direct it ahead of Silence. However, at the time, Scorsese's publicist stated that Silence would come first. In May, the film picked up another producer in the recently revived Cecchi Gori Pictures, which placed the project first on its slate of upcoming films. Cecchi Gori was involved in pre-production for Silence, but years of unrelated legal disputes had interrupted its association to the film.|$|E
5|$|Negro {{became one}} of the driving forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top técnicos of AAA such as La Parka, Jr., Octagón and Latin Lover. Negro's {{position}} as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual Rey de Reyes tournament. In the opening round, he defeated Dos Caras, Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated El Alebrije, Charly Manson and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo (2000). When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes (2000), the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b> In 2001, Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again, but La Parka, Jr. defeated him in the finals. His string of losses continued at Triplemanía IX, where the LLL team of Abismo Negro, Cibernético, Electroshock and Mascara Maligna lost to Mascara Sagrada, El Alebrije, Octagón and La Parka, Jr. when Negro was forced to submit.|$|E

According to Michaels' autobiography, he was {{nursing a}} severe {{hangover}} {{in the hours}} before this match. In spring 1989, The Rockers started a storyline with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers that kicked off with an underhanded attack on Michaels during a match. The Rougeaus assaulted Michaels with manager Jimmy Hart’s megaphone and drew blood. This storyline put The Rockers' issues with <b>The</b> Brain Busters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burners</b> while <b>The</b> Rockers and the Rougeaus fought. The issue between The Rockers and Rougeaus was the storyline reason for introducing the “Iron Man match” to the WWF. Despite wrestling 5 Iron Man matches against each other none of the matches were ever televised or released on a commercial tape. On August 28, 1989, the Rockers/Rougeau feud made it to PPV as the Rougeaus teamed with Rick Martel to defeat The Rockers and Tito Santana at SummerSlam.|$|R

25|$|The {{debate on}} {{amending}} the Crown's succession law {{came to the}} forefront on 31 October 2005, when Infanta Leonor was born to the current King and Queen of Spain. Amending the law to absolute primogeniture, known in French as aînesse intégrale would allow the first-born to inherit the throne, whether the heir be male or female. The Zapatero administration of the day proclaimed its intention to amend the succession law, however {{with the birth of}} the king's second daughter the issue was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b> Paving the way, in 2006 King Juan Carlos issued a decree reforming the succession to noble titles from male preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture. Since the order of succession to the Crown is codified in the Constitution, its reform mandates a complicated process that involves a dissolution of parliament, a constitutional election, and a referendum.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{reorganisation}} {{of states}} in India on linguistic basis removed Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam speaking regions from the Madras Presidency {{leaving behind a}} predominantly Tamil Madras State. Giving in to realities, Annadurai and his DMK changed the call of independent Dravida Nadu for Dravidians to independent Tamil Nadu for Tamils. Annadurai felt that remaining in the Indian Union meant accepting linguistic domination and economic backwardness. Nevertheless, the Sino-Indian war brought about changes in the Indian constitution. The Sixteenth Amendment (most popularly known as the Anti-Secessionist Amendment) banned any party with sectarian principles from participating in elections. When this amendment was presented in the Parliament of India, Annadurai was one of its members. He vehemently debated against the amendment, but eventually could not stop it from being passed. Faced with the new constitutional changes, Annadurai and his DMK left the call for an independent Tamil homeland <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{demands for}} {{political}} {{change in the}} way in which Scotland was run changed dramatically in the 1920s when Scottish nationalists started to form various organisations. The Scots National League was formed in 1920 in favour of Scottish independence, and this movement was superseded in 1928 by the formation of the National Party of Scotland, which became the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934. At first the SNP sought only the establishment of a devolved Scottish assembly, but in 1942 they changed this to support all-out independence. This caused the resignation of John MacCormick from the SNP and he formed the Scottish Covenant Association.

40|$|International audienceOver a {{long period}} of time labour law in Africa was kept <b>on</b> <b>the</b> « <b>back</b> <b>burner</b> » as far as {{regionalisation}} was concerned. This is no longer the case since the Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) has put into operation a Uniform Act on labour law project. Difficulties have arisen however with regard to its adoption. In fact, a «Uniform Act of OHADA » must be unanimously agreed by seventeen Member States. In addition, this legal instrument corresponds more to « hard law » than the « soft law ». Its contents have a compulsory effect on all concerned. Furthermore, in sub-Saharan Africa, although of minimal effect, labour law remains « politically sensitive » for the State. Paradoxically, the text of the project constitutes an immediate reference for national reforms. Albeit, it will be interesting to analyse the main issues. The project witnesses international tendencies with regard to labour law while inscribing itself into a particular normative tradition. Officially it aims at attracting investors in the region. Its priority is not to take into account the dominant socio-economic realities, even less to fight against the increasing informalisation of labour relations in Africa...|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1999 Cibernético formed another rudo faction, a {{group called}} Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was {{inspired}} by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Abismo Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers after Cibernético. Cibernético looked like he could repeat as Rey de Reyes winner at the 2000 Event, but was defeated by Abismo Negro in the final. A few months later Cibernético teamed up with LLL members Abismo Negro, Electroshock and Pro Wrestling Noah wrestler Shiima Nobunaga in the main event of Triplemanía VIII, only to lose to Octagón, Jushin Thunder Liger, Latin Lover and El Alebrije. While Cibernético was leading LLL Abismo Negro was rising {{through the ranks of}} AAA, bolstered by his leadership of Los Vipers. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead and who should follow. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo 2000. When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerrera de Titanes 2000, the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b> On June 30, 2001 Cibernético's almost three-year-long reign as Campeon de Campeones was ended when Heavy Metal won the title from him. Cibernético regained the title less than two months later, becoming the only three time Campeon de Campeones {{in the history of the}} title. Cibernético would retain the title until AAA quietly stopped promoting the belt some time in 2005. Cibernético's LLL was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of AAA founder and owner Antonio Peña and led to a match between Cibernético and Peña, who had been a wrestler before retiring in the 1980s. The two wrestled at the 2001 Guerrera de Titanes which Cibernético easily won in under three minutes. On January 20, 2002 Cibernético finally managed to defeat his longtime rival El Canek to win the UWA World Heavyweight Championship, a title he would retain for almost 10 months before El Canek regained the title on November 15, 2002.|$|E
500|$|The album That's the Way It Is, {{produced}} {{to accompany}} the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson notes, [...] "The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise {{the fact that the}} album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner,</b> and soul and R left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop—perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis." [...] After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in November.|$|E
500|$|In October 1963, Macmillan {{was taken}} ill and {{resigned}} as Prime Minister. Lord Home {{was chosen to}} succeed him. By the 1960s it was unacceptable for a Prime Minister {{to sit in the}} House of Lords, and Home renounced his earldom and successfully stood for election to the House of Commons as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The manner of his appointment was controversial, and two of Macmillan's cabinet ministers refused to take office under him. He was criticised by the Labour Party as an aristocrat, {{out of touch with the}} problems of ordinary families, and he came over stiffly in television interviews, by contrast with the Labour leader, Harold Wilson. As Prime Minister, Douglas-Home's demeanor and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his Chancellor, [...] Reginald Maudling, free rein to handle financial affairs. Douglas-Home enjoyed dealing with foreign policy, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. His Foreign Minister, Rab Butler, was not especially energetic. Britain's application to join Europe had already been vetoed by De Gaulle, the Cuban missile crisis had been resolved, and Berlin was again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b> Decolonisation issues were largely routine, and the Rhodesia and South African crises lay in the future.|$|E

Conceptually the work is simple yet the meaning is meant to question the lack of authenticity that Native American art collectors find in conceptual art by contemporary artists.
