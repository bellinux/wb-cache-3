500|$|In December 1950, a dozen RAAF {{personnel}} were posted to Britain for {{training in the}} maintenance of Gloster Meteor jet fighters, which were shortly to replace No.77 Squadron's Mustangs; the newly trained staff arrived in Japan two months later. As the war progressed, No.491 Squadron had to concentrate {{more and more of}} its efforts on No.77 Squadron's Meteors, requiring it to hand over some of its assigned Dakota maintenance tasks to ground crew at No.30 Transport Unit. The official historian of Australia in the Korean War described the RAAF's technical support as [...] "outstanding", resulting in an almost perfect serviceability record for No.77 Squadron's fighters. The squadron was equipped with twenty-two Meteors, sixteen of which were ready for combat at any one time, giving it a strength considerably greater than its counterparts in the United States Air Force. As well as servicing No.91 Wing's aircraft, Nos.491 Squadron was responsible for testing and packing parachutes, [...] "Mae Wests", dinghies and <b>other</b> <b>safety</b> <b>equipment</b> for aircrew. Its staff numbered around 120. Like No.391 Squadron, it employed Japanese technicians as well as Australian, which was unusual for the time; during the occupation of Japan following its surrender in World WarII, the RAAF had only employed Japanese workers for menial tasks.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{to other}} BSA high {{adventure}} bases, an incoming crew will be assigned a staff member, {{known as an}} Interpreter, {{to help them get}} ready for their expedition. Upon arrival at the base camp, the crew will meet their interpreter while their leaders check in. After that, the crew will be issued their food and gear. Personal gear is carried in two or three Granite Gear three person packs. Food and cooking equipment are carried in boxes in specially made packs by [...] in Ely. Tents, paddles, PFDs, and <b>other</b> <b>safety</b> <b>equipment</b> are also issued, and their use is explained by the interpreter or the outfitting staff. Included in the gear is a radio or satellite phone used for emergency communication with base while on the trek. With the help of their interpreter, the crew plans the itinerary for their trip. Unlike treks at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico, there are no pre-assigned routes except for groups staying in the Crown Lands. Crews are then assigned a cabin in which to spend their first night. The crew has dinner, participates in an orientation program, and can visit the trading post.|$|E
