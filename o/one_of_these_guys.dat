Honest, Hank, a smart codger like me ought to be ashamed of himself if he didn't milk cattle like them, when they come around mooing for it!

40|$|Abstract- Stereotypes about women’s {{place among}} creators of {{technology}} still exist. As a result, women engineers and computer scientists must {{find ways to}} manage the conflict between their identities as women and as creators of technology. Many women manage the conflict by hiding or denying their feminine identity. We found that this strategy becomes particularly evident when discussing experiences of sexism. Focus groups with women graduate students identified many instances of sexism, but found that women tended to deny or ignore the sexism. Because sexism communicates the view that women do not fit {{in the culture of}} computing, it increases the difficulty of combining a feminine gender identity with a technical identity. Many women try to meet this challenge by minimizing their femininity, or acting like <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the <b>guys.</b> <b>These</b> coping strategies may be effective for enabling individual persistence, but they permit persistence of an inhospitable environment. Adopting practices known to reduce the incidence of sexism and mitigate its negative impact could help retain women graduate students in computing.

5000|$|Far less {{favorable}} views of Anarky {{have also been}} offered. Newsarama contributor George Marston was especially scathing of the character's politics and costume, placing Anarky at No.8 {{on a list of}} the [...] "Top 10 Worst Batman villains of all time." [...] Deriding the character as a [...] "living embodiment of an Avril Lavigne t-shirt", he pointed out the pointlessness of being inspired to super heroics by radical philosophy, and the contradictory nature of fighting crime as an anarchist. He concluded by referring to the unsuccessful Anarky series as proof that [...] "bad decisions are timeless". Similarly, Cracked contributor Henrik Magnusson listed Anarky's debut at No.3 on a list of [...] "5 Disastrous Attempts at Political Commentary in Comic Books." [...] Magnusson's scorn focused on Anarky's poorly written speeches, which he derided as [...] "pedantic" [...] and laden with [...] "pseudo-philosophical catchphrases." [...] Referring to the original identity of Lonnie Machin as a [...] "naive pre-teen", Magnusson considered this fine satire of [...] "base-level philosophy" [...] and teen rebellion. However, the understanding that Grant had intended Anarky to be a vehicle for his personal views, and that the [...] "Anarky in Gotham City" [...] narrative describes Batman as sympathetic to his goals, if not his methods, upset Magnusson. [...] "I think Anarky's age is right now. He looks like a street protester. He looks like Anonymous. He's like <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> who wants {{to go out there and}} change the world to what he believes is the better, and I think of all the Batman enemies, and one of the reasons I'm most excited about Anarky, is he feels relevant today." [...] —Eric Holmes, 2013. Several global events of the early 2010s included the rise of hacktivist groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec; large scale protest movements, including the Arab Spring, Occupy movement, and Quebec student protests; the crypto-anarchist activity on the part of Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson; and the various information leaks to WikiLeaks by Chelsea Manning, the Stratfor email leak by Anonymous and Jeremy Hammond, and the global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden. The rapid succession of these events led some media commentators to insist that Anarky's relevance as a character had dramatically increased, and recommended that the character receive a higher profile in media. This sentiment led the creative team that developed Batman: Arkham Origins to include Anarky in the game. Describing Anarky's anti-government and anti-corporate agenda, Holmes acknowledged the relevance of anarchism in the contemporary protest movements of the time as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game, and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement. Holmes stressed in one interview, [...] "In the real world, this is Anarky's moment. Right now. Today." [...] Even as early as 2005, James Peaty recommended that Anarky should be included in more publications in the midst of the ongoing War on Terror, stating [...] "Anarky is a terrorist! How can that not be interesting in the modern climate?" ...|$|E
40|$|In the 1990 s, when I was an {{undergraduate}} student, {{in front of}} the main building of the University of Turin there was a big parking lot, which was always completely full. Two guys were looking after the parking lot every day from early in the morning till very late in the afternoon. They were neither authorized, nor paid by the town council, but they received tips from the students to optimize the space in the parking lot and monitor their cars. The guys did not look very reliable, they wore poor and dirty clothes and they were covered by self-made aggressive-looking tattoos. However, it was not unusual to see <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> sitting in a very expensive sports car, smoking stinky cigarettes and listening to loud music from the car-stereo. In fact, when the parking lot was completely full, students used to leave their car to the guys who parked it as soon as a place was available. Imagine a first-year student, who goes to the university by car for the first time, enters the parking-lot and finds out that there is no place available to park her car. Then, one of the unauthorized “attendants” offers her to take the car, park it as soon as a place is available, and then leave the key on it. Judging from the appearance, the guy certainly does not look trustworthy. However, it seems that many other students indeed trust him, since there is a long queue of cars waiting to be parked, including some expensive ones. Would the student leave her car to the attendant? Would she take the number of other cars waiting to be parked as a signal that the attendant is trustworthy? [ [...] . ...|$|E
