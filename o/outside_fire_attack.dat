The purpose of this research project was to determine if gasoline powered smoke blowers could reduce carbon monoxide levels inside a structure during post <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> operations to an acceptable level. The evaluative research method was used. The research questions to be answered were: 1. What is the acceptable level of carbon monoxide in a structure for a firefighter to work in without self contained breathing apparatus? 2. Does a gasoline powered smoke blower introduce a significant amount of carbon monoxide into a structure? 3. Can a gas powered smoke blower reduce the carbon monoxide within a structure to an acceptable level during post <b>fire</b> <b>attack</b> operations...|$|R
