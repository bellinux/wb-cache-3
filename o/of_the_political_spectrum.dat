5|$|According to Oswald Spengler, the {{characteristic}} mistake of the Gracchan age was {{to believe in}} the possibility of the reversibility of history – a form of idealism which according to Spengler was at that time shared by both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> – Cato had sought to turn back the clock to the time of Cincinnatus, and restore virtue by returning to austerity.|$|E
5|$|Ideologically, Poedjangga Baroe {{supported}} a modern, united nation with one language, Indonesian. However, the different {{cultural and political}} views of its contributors led the publication to have undefined leanings. To maintain a neutral political position, the magazine published writings that covered numerous aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In cultural discourse, the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization and tradition necessary for the country's development.|$|E

5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high {{unemployment}} and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum</b> fault her economic policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment {{as well as her}} monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E
5|$|The two Danubian Principalities, Wallachia and Moldavia, {{came under}} direct Russian {{supervision}} upon {{the close of}} the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, being subsequently administered on the basis of common documents, known as Regulamentul Organic. After a period of Russian military occupation, Wallachia returned to Ottoman suzerainty while Russian oversight was preserved, and the throne was awarded to Alexandru II Ghica in 1834—this measure was controversial from the onset, given that, despite the popular provisions of the Akkerman Convention, Ghica had been appointed by Russia and the Ottomans, instead of being elected by the Wallachian Assembly. As a consequence, the Prince was faced with opposition from both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum,</b> while also attempting to quell the peasantry's discontent by legislating against the abuse of estate lessors. The first liberal movement, taking inspiration from the French Revolution and having for its stated purpose the encouragement of culture, was Societatea Filarmonică (the Philharmonic Society), established in 1833.|$|E
5|$|The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} parties in the {{political}} system of Republic of India, the other being the Indian National Congress (INC). , it is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament. Established in 1980, the BJP's platform is generally considered as the right-wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>spectrum.</b> , 40 BJP leaders have held the position of a chief minister, out of which thirteen are incumbent. A chief minister is the head of government of each of the twenty-nine states and two union territories (UTs) (Delhi and Puducherry). According to the Constitution of India, at the state-level, the governor is de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given he/she has the assembly's confidence, the chief minister's term is usually for a maximum of five years; there are no limits to the number of terms he/she can serve.|$|E
