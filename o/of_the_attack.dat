25|$|The MPLA always officially {{claimed to}} be <b>the</b> {{originator}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> However, <b>the</b> MPLA origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> is contested. Several sources indicate the Angolan nationalist mixed race priest Manuel das Neves as <b>the</b> perpetrator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> Apparently {{this was also the}} PIDE theory, which arrested and sent him to the Metropole, where he was interned in religious houses.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{responses}} to <b>the</b> mediation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>of</b> 11 September 2001 among diasporic audiences in the UK. Based on an a collaborative media ethnography that interlinked analysis of news images and discourses {{in an array of}} transnational television news channels, it explores <b>the</b> comparativist frames <b>of</b> references deployed by audiences to make sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> - captured in the phrase 'our ground zeros'. It is argued that while a comparative stance does not morally relativise <b>the</b> tragedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> it does provoke a challenge to westernised conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> causes, consequences and meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the Port Authority was sued by {{survivors}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> for negligence in {{not making}} security upgrades to known flaws {{that could have}} prevented the attack. The Port Authority was ruled to be negligent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack,</b> but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
50|$|In an {{audiotape}} released in November 2007, Bin Laden {{claimed responsibility for}} <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> and denied <b>the</b> Taliban and the Afghan government or people had any prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> In an interview with al-Jazeera, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, two of al-Qaeda's alleged masterminds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> also confessed their involvement in <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
