30|$|The methods here {{described}} and evaluated {{are aimed at}} improving {{the process of building}} the local certificate repository associated to each node in the self-organized model, which leads to a significant improvement in the efficiency of the whole model. Particularly, a considerable decrease in resource consumption while undertaking the verification process associated to authentication is obtained from the experiments. In order to achieve such improvement, we face the problem by combining typical <b>authentication</b> <b>elements</b> with common ideas used in routing protocols in MANETs. In particular, the Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol from which some ideas regarding the use of the MultiPoint Relay (MPR) technique have been borrowed to design the proposed algorithm for updating repositories.|$|R

The interface was enhanced by {{cooperating with the}} hosting computer where the terminal is connected to: the hosting computer shows a detailed image of the filled ballot. The displayed image does not convey any personal information, namely the voter's choices, to the hosting computer; voter's choices are solely presented at the terminal. Furthermore, the image contains visual <b>authentication</b> <b>elements</b> that can be validated by the voter using information presented at the terminal. This way, hosting computers {{are not able to}} gather voters' choices or to deceive voters, by presenting tampered ballots, without being noticed...|$|R

So, this node receives the PaC’s credentials by the PAA and sends a packet with the result of credential checking process. Moreover, if the result is OK, this packet contains some information about the access parameters as bandwidth allowed or IP configuration. Now, a session between PAA and PaC has been established. This session has a session time. When it expires, it needs a re-authentication process {{in order to get}} the network access again by the PaC.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — an {{application}} for assuring the authenticity of audio-video information is developed. The application is implemented in Java by using Java Media Framework to send audio and video information over RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol). In order to guarantee that information is not altered during transmission over public networks by malicious adversaries some cryptographic functions and protocols are used for achieving information authenticity. More concrete, a cryptographic protocol which uses Message <b>Authentication</b> Codes and <b>elements</b> of a one-way chain as keys is implemented. The solution proves to be efficient and the computational costs are kept to a minimum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Today {{security}} concerns {{are on the}} rise in all areas industries such as banks, governmental applications, healthcare industry, militaryorganization, educational institutions etc, with one common weak link being “passwords”. Several proper strategies for using passwords have been proposed. Some of which are very difficult to use and others might not meet the company’s {{security concerns}}. The usage of passwords for authentication is no longer sufficient and stronger authentication schemes are necessary. Two factor <b>authentication</b> uses <b>elements</b> or devices such as tokens and ATM cards. We have proposed to resolve the password problem, which could be inconvenient for the user and costly for the service providers to combat otherwise. To avoid the usage of additional device, the mobile phone is adopted as security token. In this paper several different authentication solutions using the mobile as authentication token are discussed, where these solutions vary in complexity, strength, security and user friendliness. One of the authentication schemes (OTP solution) is implemented to verify their usability. Hence, a classification and evaluation of the different solutions is provided according to defined criteria...|$|R
40|$|Our {{agenda is}} two-fold. First, we {{introduce}} {{and give a}} technical description of gridWord, a novel knowledge-based <b>authentication</b> mechanism involving <b>elements</b> of both text and graphical passwords. It is intended to address a new research challenge arising from the evolution of Internet access devices, and which may arguably be viewed as motivating a new paradigm: remote access password schemes which accommodate users who alternately login from devices with, and without, full physical keyboards (e. g., users alternating between desktops with easy text input, and mobile devices with tiny or touch-screen virtual keyboards). While the core ideas behind gridWord are well-formed, and {{may be viewed as}} a new variation of old (text-based) ideas of building passwords from multiple words, many aspects including recommended parameterization and configuration details, preferred platforms, and primary targets of application remain to be explored in detail. We nonetheless solicit early feedback from the community for several reasons, related to our second agenda item: we use gridWord as a concrete target to focus exploration of a number of questions involving (a) the evaluation of usable security proposals, (b) the often conflicting objectives of various parties involved in the publication of academic research, and (c) the relationship between the design and publication of new security mechanisms and the pursuit of scientific knowledge through experimentation. We believe the second agenda item is important to pursue, given our observation that experts in usability and security have widely varying expectations, and lack consensus on what is important for the evaluation, comparison, and publication of usable security proposals.
