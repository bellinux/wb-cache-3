Heat bursts typically occur during night-time and are associated with decaying thunderstorms. In association with wake lows, heat bursts are caused when rain evaporates (virga) into a parcel of cold dry air high in the atmosphere making the air denser than its surroundings. The parcel descends rapidly, warming due to compression, <b>overshoots</b> its equilibrium level and reaches the surface, similar to a downburst.|$|E

We further classified <b>overshoot</b> into two types, named as simple <b>overshoot</b> and oscillating <b>overshoot.</b> We showed that except for extreme cases, oscillating <b>overshoot</b> will occur if the system is far from equilibrium.

40|$|The term <b>overshooting</b> {{is used to}} {{describe}} two situations: the chemical mixing induced by the convective elements crossing the boundary given by Schwarzschild’s criterion (<b>overshooting),</b> or, {{in addition to that}} mixing, the change in the temperature gradient in the <b>overshoot</b> region when convection is efficient enough (penetration; Zahn 1991). We show that for models with the same mass of the mixed central region the oscillation frequencies are sensitive to the kind of <b>overshoot</b> treatment adopted. This effect is especially obvious for SPB stars and is high enough to be detected by CoRoT long run observations. That would imply the possibility of disentangling penetration from <b>overshooting.</b> HR diagram and internal structure For a given value of the <b>overshooting</b> parameter, different <b>overshooting</b> treatments yield different convective and mixed core mass fractions.

25|$|The {{generation}} of standard SSB modulation results in large envelope <b>overshoots</b> {{well above the}} average envelope level for a sinusoidal tone (even when the audio signal is peak-limited). The standard SSB envelope peaks are due to truncation of the spectrum and nonlinear phase distortion from the approximation errors of the practical implementation of the required Hilbert transform. It was recently shown that suitable overshoot compensation (so-called controlled-envelope single-sideband modulation or CESSB) achieves about 3.8dB of peak reduction for speech transmission. This results in an effective average power increase of about 140%.|$|E
25|$|On 6 May 1997, {{following}} the 1997 general election which brought a Labour government to {{power for the}} first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy. Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998 (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%. The target has changed to 2% since the Consumer Price Index (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the Treasury's inflation index.

25|$|Some {{of these}} mutant {{channels}} have been expressed in {{dorsal root ganglion}} (DRG) or sympathetic neurons. In DRG neurons expressing the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold is required for action potential creation (93.1 ± 12.0 pA) than those expressing wild-type channels (124.1 ± 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons expressing wild-type channels only respond with a few action potentials, those expressing F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials. There is a similar effect in DRG neurons expressing the L858H and A863P mutants. Here, {{there is also a}} notable change in resting membrane potential, being depolarized by 4-7 mV versus wild-type channel expressing cells. The situation is different, however, in sympathetic neurons expressing the L858H mutation. While L858H expressing sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to wild-type expressing neurons, their threshold for action potential initiation is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons expressing wild-type channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced <b>overshoots</b> in sympathetic neurons expressing L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of NaV1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of NaV1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also expressing L858H mutant NaV1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action potential threshold and overshoot.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{presence of}} a second RCL team sited in mutual support forced the cavalry to halt once again. Concerned {{about the consequences of}} bypassing an anti-armour weapon only to be engaged from the rear, Roberts ordered the troop to scan the area. Frustrated by the delay, Mollison demanded Roberts continue the advance, and an argument broke out between the two. However, as the commander of the APCs Roberts ignored Mollison despite his more senior rank, refusing to continue until he either located the weapon or was confident the threat did not exist. Finally, following a five-minute delay the Australians moved off again after no weapon was located. A machine-gun then engaged three of the APCs in the left hand section, none of which had gun shields. One of the crew commanders was fatally wounded and the vehicle forced to a halt, but not before the Viet Cong machine-gunner was crushed to death by the driver. The troop sergeant ran between the carriers under heavy fire to take command of the APC after Roberts ordered him to return to Nui Dat due to the mistaken belief some of the infantry on board had also been wounded. Despite Mollison's objections the vehicle departed, taking the headquarters of one of the infantry platoons with it. Still uncertain of the location of D Company, Roberts was forced to closely control the fire of the troop due to the concern any survivors might be hit by <b>overshoots</b> from the armoured vehicle's heavy machine-guns. At the same time the infantry continued to engage {{from the rear of the}} vehicles. A further 45 Viet Cong were estimated to have been killed during this action.|$|E

If a player <b>overshoots</b> that benchmark, known as a [...] "burst" [...] in the game's terminology, the amount of points 31 is overshot by becomes the player's new score.
