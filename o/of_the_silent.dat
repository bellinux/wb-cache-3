5|$|Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), {{also known}} as FBO Pictures Corporation, was an American film studio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silent</b> era, a {{producer}} and distributor of mostly low-budget films. The business began in 1918 as Robertson-Cole (U.S.), the American division of a British import–export company and Robertson-Cole was formed by the English-born Harry F. Robertson and the American Rufus Sidman Cole. Robertson-Cole bought the Hallmark Exchanges (formerly the Mutual Exchanges that became known as Exhibitors-Mutual Exchanges) from Frank J. Hall in 1920. Exhibitors-Mutual/Hallmark had distributed Robertson-Cole product, and acquiring the exchanges gave {{them the right to}} distribute their own films plus Hall's product, with the exception of Charlie Chaplin reissues which he had the rights to.|$|E

5|$|A Free Ride, {{also known}} as A Grass Sandwich, is a stag film <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silent</b> era that is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A Free Ride a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were people with low social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A Free Ride was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.|$|E
5|$|Although for a {{few decades}} (since the times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Silent</b> Sejm) Russia had seen a weak Poland as its own protectorate, Poland had also been devastated by a civil war in which {{the forces of the}} Bar Confederation {{attempted}} to disrupt Russian control over Poland. The recent Koliyivschyna peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Poland's position. Further, the Russian-supported Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was seen as both weak and too independent-minded; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of Poland as a protectorate had diminished. The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order in Poland through military intervention (the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E

50|$|Akira Yamaoka {{played a}} major role in <b>the</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill film {{adaptation}} by overseeing and approving specific aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie throughout its production.

5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Pyramid Head has been favorable {{because of his}} distinctive appearance and role as an element of James' psyche. Critics cite him as an iconic villain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Silent</b> Hill series, a favorite among fans, {{and part of the}} appeal of Silent Hill 2. GameSpot compared Pyramid Head's appearance to Leatherface, the main antagonist of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series of slasher films, and found him the most terrifying monster in Silent Hill 2. Computerworld named Pyramid Head {{as one of the most}} terrifying villains in computer and video games. GamesRadar felt that the scene in which he rapes the two other monsters was unsettling, since the subject of rape is not often tackled in video games, and disliked the final battle with him because of how anti-climactic it was, in comparison with his role throughout the rest of the game.|$|E
5|$|Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor {{known for}} his natural, authentic, and {{understated}} acting style and screen performances. His career spanned thirty-five years, from 1925 to 1960, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films. He was a major movie star from the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silent</b> film era {{through to the end}} of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and authentic on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>silent</b> film era, from the 1890s, films were {{generally}} accompanied by live music, often improvised, provided by piano or pump organ. In the early 20th century, larger cinemas began to use orchestras, which would accompany the film with out-of-copyright classical pieces or, increasingly, with original compositions. The score for the 1916 classic The Birth of a Nation, compiled by Joseph Carl Breil from various classical works and some original writing, was a landmark in film music, and inspired notable composers {{of the day to}} provide scores for silent films. Among these were the Americans Victor Herbert and Mortimer Wilson, from France Darius Milhaud and Arthur Honegger, and the Germans Gottfried Huppertz and Edmund Meisel.|$|E
50|$|Countess Elisabeth of Nassau-Dillenburg (born 25 September 1542 in Dillenburg - died: 18 November 1603 in Dillenburg) was a {{daughter}} of William I, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg and Juliana of Stolberg and was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sisters <b>of</b> William <b>the</b> <b>Silent.</b>|$|R
