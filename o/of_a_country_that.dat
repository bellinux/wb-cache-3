5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E
5|$|This list of {{autonomous}} areas arranged by country gives an overview {{of autonomous}} areas of the world. An autonomous area is defined as an area <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> has a degree of autonomy, or has freedom from an external authority. It is typical {{for it to be}} geographically distant from the country, or to be populated by a national minority. Countries that include autonomous areas are often federacies. The autonomous areas differ from federal units and independent states in the sense that they, in relation to the majority of other sub-national territories in the same country, enjoy a special status including some legislative powers, within the state (for a detailed list of federated units, see Federated state#List of federal units by federation).|$|E

The FAO credited growth in agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability for the rapid economic growth in the 1990s that resulted in an increase in food security.

25|$|By construction, {{each point}} on the curve shows {{productive}} efficiency in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point inside the curve (as at A), is feasible but represents production inefficiency (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of one or both goods could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a {{point on the}} curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business-cycle recession or economic organization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency (also called Pareto efficiency) {{if it does not}} produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.|$|E

25|$|The Glorious Revolution of 1868 overthrew Isabella II, but the Cortes, the Spanish {{parliament}} revived by {{the elections}} of 1869, {{voted in favor of}} a monarchy. A search for a new king was made from amongst several European royal courts. Their selection was the Italian prince Amadeo I de Saboya, but in the midst <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> was profoundly instable, enveloped in diverse wars (the Third Carlist War, due to the aspirations to the throne of the Bourbon branch of carlists, and the Ten Years' War in Cuba, among others) and including the opposition of republicans and {{a large part of the}} aristocracy, the Catholic Church, and the Spanish people, King Amadeo abdicated on February 11, 1873.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} Portuguese managed to gain {{permission}} from the Ming mandarins to establish a permanent settlement and trade base in Macau in 1557, the port of Macau benefited greatly from being the intermediary of the lucrative China-Japan trade, since the direct routes were banned by the Ming court due to fears of the wokou pirates. Portugal's success in Macau drew the envy of other European maritime powers who were slower to gain a foothold in East Asia. When Philip II of Spain became King of Portugal after the 1580 Portuguese succession crisis, Portuguese colonies came under attack from Spain's enemies, especially the Dutch and the English, who were also hoping to expand their overseas empires at the expense <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> had largely ceased to exist. Macau had already sustained Dutch raids in 1601, 1603, and 1607, but the Dutch invasion of 1622 represented the first real attempt to capture the city. The Hollanders, frustrated that their trading post at Hirado was unable {{to compete with the}} Portuguese traders at Nagasaki {{as a result of the}} latter's easy access to China, hoped that the capture of Macau would grant them a commercial base in China while at the same time deprive the Portuguese of the profitable Macau-Nagasaki route. The fall of Macau would also leave the Spaniards in the Philippines without means of support and make it easier for the Dutch to mount an attack on Manila.|$|E

Burton published an appraisal in an 1887 article: [...] "I have seen no better work {{in the way of}} coloured photographs anywhere than some of Farsari's productions". In the same year, an admiring review of Farsari's work appeared in the journal Photographic Times and American Photographer, describing it as [...] "technically almost perfect" [...] and showing [...] "artistic proportion" [...] in the selection of subjects, depicting Japanese life and providing images of the natural beauty <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> was admittedly unfamiliar to Americans.|$|E

The tour was arduous, but a triumph. The New York Press said, [...] "The great British band played with a vigor, force and temperamental impetuousness that almost lifted the listener out of his seat." [...] The New York Times praised all departments of the orchestra, though, like The Manchester Guardian, it found the strings [...] "brilliant rather than mellow". The paper had a little fun at the LSO's expense: from the viewpoint <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> had long enjoyed permanent, salaried orchestras such as the Boston Symphony, it gently mocked the LSO's [...] "bold stand for the sacred right of sending substitutes" ...|$|E

2500|$|This outlook {{needs to}} be seen within the {{historical}} context of eighteenth century Scotland. Here, the legacy of religious civil war, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, fostered in a historian such as Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> was deeply politically and religiously divided. Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, {{so long as it}} does so fairly.
