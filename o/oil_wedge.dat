50|$|As {{for other}} {{bearings}} that reciprocate, rather than rotating continuously, lubrication can be difficult. The <b>oil</b> <b>wedge</b> {{built up in}} a continuously rotating bearing is disrupted by the stop start motion of slewing. Instead, a hydrostatic bearing with pumped oil flow may be used.|$|E
50|$|Kingsburyâ€™s {{research}} at the University of New Hampshire led him to conceive an early Kingsbury bearing that consisted of several stationary arc segments facing a thrust collar on the rotating shaft. Each segment would have a boss on the side away from the thrust collar, allowing it to tilt and form an <b>oil</b> <b>wedge</b> that would carry the thrust. Kingsbury tested this new bearing with {{a modified version of}} his earlier screw thread testing machine. The bearing was successful with pressures of up to 4,000 psi at speeds of 285 rpm. This pressure exceeded that for common collar-type bearings by a factor of 80 to 100, thus proving the promise of the Kingsbury bearing.|$|E
50|$|Lubrication of {{piston rings}} is {{difficult}} {{and has been a}} driving force to improvements in the quality of motor oil. The oil must survive high temperatures and harsh conditions with a high-speed sliding contact. Lubrication is particularly difficult as the rings have an oscillating motion rather than continuous rotation, as for a bearing journal. At the limits of piston movement, the ring stops and reverses direction. This disrupts the normal <b>oil</b> <b>wedge</b> effect of a hydrodynamic bearing, leading to pronounced wear and the formation of a 'step' in the cylinder bore around the height of the upper ring. Noting that some sleeve valve engines suffered far less from such wear, complex designs such as a rotating cylinder liner have been considered, just to address this problem.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{portion of}} the total power loss in a modern automotive engine is due to piston ring/cylinder bore friction. This paper introduces the results of simulations about the interaction of a SI engine piston ring {{taking into account the}} mixed lubrication regime, the ring flexibility in presence of piston approaching motion to the cylinder liner. The friction force calculations show a visible difference between the ring portion interacting with the two cylinder sides (Thrust and Anti-Thrust) due to specific <b>oil</b> film <b>wedges</b> caused by flexibility and piston lateral motion. The effects of engine speed, radial tension, surface roughness and ring shape are also investigable...|$|R
40|$|A 36 {{steel is}} a {{commonly}} used material in civil engineering structures where fatigue damage {{can lead to}} catastrophic failure. In this research, nonlinear Rayleigh surface waves are used to characterize damage in A 36 steel specimens caused by monotonic tension and low cycle fatigue. Fatigue damage produces the increased acoustic nonlinearity {{that leads to the}} generation of measurable higher harmonics in an initially monochromatic Rayleigh wave signal. One specimen is subjected to static tension and four specimens are used for low cycle fatigue tests in the tension-tension mode with a constant stress amplitude. The fatigue tests are interrupted at different numbers of cycles for the nonlinear ultrasonic measurements. Tone burst Rayleigh wave signals are generated and detected using a pair of <b>oil</b> coupled <b>wedge</b> transducers. The amplitudes of the first and second harmonic are measured at varying propagation distances to obtain the nonlinearity parameter for a given damage state. The experimental results show an increase of acoustic nonlinearity {{in the early stages of}} fatigue life. Furthermore, a close relationship between plastic deformation and the acoustic nonlinearity is found, which indicates that the acoustic nonlinearity is indeed a measure of microplasticity in this material.

40|$|Cold rolled {{carbon steel}} 1018 C {{is widely used}} in {{pressurized}} fuel pipelines. For those structures, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) can pose a significant problem because cracks initiate late in the lifetime and often unexpectedly, but grow fast once they get started. To ensure a safe operation, {{it is crucial that}} any damage can be detected before the structural stability is reduced by large cracks. In the early stages of SCC, microstructural changes occur which increase the acoustic nonlinearity of the material. Therefore, an initially monochromatic Rayleigh wave is distorted and measurable higher harmonics are generated. Different levels of stress corrosion cracking is induced in five specimens. For each specimen, nonlinear ultrasonic measurements are performed before and after inducing the damage. For the measurements, <b>oil</b> coupled <b>wedge</b> transducers are used to generate and detect tone burst Rayleigh wave signals. The amplitudes of the received fundamental and second harmonic waves are measured at varying propagation distances to obtain a measure for the acoustic nonlinearity of the material. The results show a damage-dependent increase in nonlinearity for early stages of damage, indicating the suitability for this nonlinear ultrasonic method to detect stress corrosion cracking before structural failure.

40|$|The flowing {{lubricant}} in the <b>oil</b> <b>wedge</b> {{between the}} slide and guide rail creates hydrodynamic pressure {{that leads to}} a displacement of the carriage, which depends on the sliding surface geometry and the slides velocity. This paper describes an approach to calculate the resulting complex displacement. Therefore, two methods were combined. The simulation of the floating by using the finite difference method was integrated in the numerical calculation of the balance of the whole carriage. Considering a real sliding surface geometry of a test bench, the experiment verification of the approach for velocities up to 40 m/min showed a good conformity...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that hydrodynamic journal bearings are responsible for self-excited vibrations and {{have the effect of}} lowering the critical speeds of rotor systems. The forces within the <b>oil</b> film <b>wedge,</b> generated by the vibrating journal, may be represented by displacement and velocity coefficient~ thus allowing the dynamical behaviour of the rotor to be analysed both for stability purposes and for anticipating the response to unbalance. However, information describing these coefficients is sparse, misleading, and very often not applicable to industrial type bearings. Results of a combined analytical and experimental investigation into the hydrodynamic oil film coefficients operating in the laminar region are therefore presented, the analysis being applied to a 120 degree partial journal bearing having a 5. 0 in diameter journal and a LID ratio of 1. 0. The theoretical analysis shows that for this type of popular bearing, the eight linearized coefficients do not accurately describe the behaviour of the vibrating journal based on the theory of small perturbations, due to them being masked by the presence of nonlinearity. A method is developed using the second order terms of Taylor expansion whereby design charts are provided which predict the twentyeight force coefficients for both aligned, and for varying amounts of journal misalignment. The resulting non-linear equations of motion are solved using a modified Newton-Raphson method whereby the whirl trajectories are obtained, thus providing a physical appreciation of the bearing characteristics under dynamically loaded conditions...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies [Refs. 1, 2] {{revealed}} {{the formation of}} a uniform <b>oil</b> <b>wedge</b> at the periphery of the thrust plate, caused by the elastic deformation of the orbiting thrust plate due to the pressure difference across the orbiting thrust plate, is a significant factor in the high lubrication performance in thrust slide-bearings. In addition to the uniform wedge formation, the high oil film pressure also induces a local elastic deformation of the fixed thrust plate normal to its surface. The normal thrust plate deformation and the <b>oil</b> <b>wedge</b> effectively form an elasto-hydrodynamic-lubrication (EHL) pocket, even more effectively increasing the oil film pressure between the sliding surfaces, due to the envelopment of the oil, as confirmed in our companion paper [3], and an earlier, less-detailed contribution [4]. The present study focuses on aspects of EHL that have both positive and negative effects on the lubrication performance of the thrust slide-bearings in scroll compressors. Theoretical calculations using the average Reynolds equation and Patier-Chen solid contact theory, for the boundary of the local elastic deformation of the thrust slide-bearing, were conducted for a small cooling capacity scroll compressor driven at 3600 rpm with 0. 1 kW. An approximate method was developed using characteristic curves to determine the oil film axial force, the average oil film thickness, the frictional force and the frictional coefficient. The calculations considered a variety of pressure differences due to the operation pressure and the thickness of thrust plate. Also cases with a fixed uniform wedge angle at the periphery were calculated. The calculated results suggest a possible maximum reduction in frictional coefficient of about 55...|$|E
