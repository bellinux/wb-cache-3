5|$|The {{characteristics}} of boulder problems depend {{largely on the}} type of rock being climbed. Granite, for example, often features long cracks and slabs. Sandstone rocks are known for their steep <b>overhangs</b> and frequent horizontal breaks. Other common bouldering rocks include limestone and volcanic rock.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow for}} {{removal of the}} moulded part from the mould, the mould {{features}} must not overhang {{one another in the}} direction that the mould opens, unless parts of the mould are designed to move from between such <b>overhangs</b> when the mould opens (using components called Lifters).|$|E
40|$|This paper focusses on the {{relation}} between external imbalances and domestic money and credit growth in the euro area. We compute money and credit <b>overhang</b> both for the euro area {{as a whole and}} for individual member countries. Our results show that both aggregate money and credit <b>overhang</b> have trend-like increased since the early 2000 s. The increase in money <b>overhang</b> has been rather evenly spread over the member states but the increase in credit <b>overhang</b> has been unevenly spread and has mainly occurred in the GIIP countries. We apply panel analysis to detect temporal patterns between the developments in money <b>overhang,</b> credit <b>overhang</b> and external indebtedness. Looking at the groups of GIPS countries in isolation, net debt flows do play a significant role to explain money and credit <b>overhang...</b>|$|R

40|$|Enhancing the {{ventilation}} performance of energy-efficient buildings with single-sided openings {{is important because}} their ventilation performance is poor and strongly depends on the wind conditions. We considered an <b>overhang</b> as a potential building façade for improving the single-sided ventilation performance. We performed numerical simulations of three-dimensional unsteady turbulent flows over an idealized building with an <b>overhang</b> in order to investigate {{the effect of the}} <b>overhang</b> on {{the ventilation}} performance. Parametric studies were systematically carried out where the <b>overhang</b> length, wind speed, and wind direction were varied. The numerical results showed that the <b>overhang</b> drastically enhanced the ventilation rate in the windward direction regardless of the wind speed. This is because, for windward cases, the <b>overhang</b> produces a vortex with strong flow separation near the tip of the <b>overhang,</b> which promotes a net airflow exchange at the entrance and increases the ventilation rate. However, the ventilation rates for the leeward and side cases are slightly decreased with the <b>overhang.</b> Using an <b>overhang</b> with single-sided ventilation greatly reduces the local mean age of air (LMA) in the windward direction but increases it in the leeward direction...|$|R
5|$|The {{stadium is}} divided into five all-seater stands, the JCT600 Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands are covered except for {{a small part of}} the main stand, and all but the Midland Road Stand being two-tiered. Most of the stands are {{cantilever}} structures, and because of the ground's location on the hillside, the Midland Road Stand <b>overhangs</b> the road.|$|E
5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under <b>overhangs</b> has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour. It has an inbuilt biological clock and, even when kept in total darkness, turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock <b>overhangs</b> along the canyon walls. The {{structures}} contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the incidence and severity of tibial component <b>overhang</b> in total knee replacement and find any relationship between <b>overhang</b> and functional outcome. 532 anteroposteri-or radiographs of total knee replacements were reviewed retrospectively to identify medial or lateral <b>overhang</b> of the tibial component. Patients completed an Oxford knee score (OKS) questionnaire at mean follow-up of 36 months. <b>Overhang</b> of the tibial com-ponent was noted in 13. 4 % of patients with a mean OKS of 35. 3. Severity of <b>overhang</b> did not correlate with OKS. <b>Overhang</b> of the tibial component is common.

50|$|In contrast, the {{excellent}} {{handling of the}} Mini, with its wheels pushed far out at each corner, can be partly credited to its small <b>overhang.</b> The classic Mini and New MINI are automobiles with very little <b>overhang</b> and thus handle very well under extreme conditions. The minimal <b>overhang</b> gives the Mini its bulldog-like stance.|$|R
5|$|The Fuller Houses are {{originally}} {{believed to}} have been constructed as identical -story Queen Anne-styled homes with both having their gable-ends facing the street. The southern flank of the building is visually broken up by a two-story bay window with a gabled peak. A semi-octagonal bay on the northern corner of the houses indicates the position of the front staircase. A single-story porch with a shed-roof <b>overhangs</b> the front doorways. A striking feature of the Fuller Houses is the two-story circular porch on the southwest side. The porches are almost removed from the building and topped with a conical roof and ornamented with Queen Anne-style spindle. The exterior walls of the houses are clapboarded and the tops of the gables have simple metal finials.|$|E
5|$|The Railway Stand, on {{the west}} side of the stadium nearest to Birmingham city centre, is also free-standing. It was opened in 1999 and holds some 8,000 spectators in two tiers; the upper tier, a small area known as the Olympic Gallery, <b>overhangs</b> the lower, at the back of which is a row of {{executive}} boxes. From the 2009–10 season, the Railway Stand was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager. Visiting supporters are housed in the lower Railway Stand, segregated from home fans by plastic netting over the seats.|$|E
5|$|The common {{features}} of passive solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (<b>overhangs)</b> and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{exposure}} from past business transactions – risk <b>overhang</b> – can reduce activity in related business lines, sometimes {{to the point}} where no new trade occurs. We focus primarily on the role of <b>overhang</b> in nonlife insurance market disruptions. Our model predicts that the relative impact, duration, and character of supply disruptions are related to the extent of <b>overhang.</b> These predictions are consistent with differences between the mid- 1980 s liability insurance crisis and the early- 1990 s catastrophe reinsurance crisis. The <b>overhang</b> model predicts attributes of these crises that prior explanations relying on adverse selection do not. We also discuss applications of the <b>overhang</b> model to disruptions in lending and securities markets...|$|R

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the porcupine ray is evenly oval, almost {{as wide as}} long, and very thick at the center, giving it a domed appearance. The {{tip of the snout}} is rounded and barely protruding. The small eyes are closely followed by much larger spiracles. Between the narrow nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin; the posterior margin of the curtain is strongly fringed and <b>overhangs</b> the mouth. The mouth bears 3–5 papillae on the floor and prominent furrows at the corners. The area around the mouth, including the curtain, are heavily covered by more papillae. There are around 48 tooth rows in either jaw. The teeth are small and flattened. Five pairs of gill slits are located {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff <b>overhangs</b> or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|E
5|$|Unusually {{for winter}} sports, {{bobsleigh}} {{has never been}} popular in Norway. The country had not sent an Olympic team until the 1948 Winter Olympics {{and there were no}} previous bobsleigh tracks in Norway when Oslo was awarded the 1952 Winter Olympics. Two Swiss civil engineers, Heinz Cattani and Emil Ingold, were the main technical consultants {{for the development of the}} venue. The steep terrain made construction excessively expensive, resulting in the organizing committee deciding to build a temporary track, without permanent concrete and stone curves. Instead, a new track was constructed each year using snow: the <b>overhangs</b> were built by hand, the tracks were leveled and the structure sprayed with ice until it was hard.|$|E
50|$|Rear <b>overhang</b> {{may present}} {{a problem in}} large {{vehicles}} such as buses. Long rear <b>overhang</b> would require the driver {{to pay attention to}} nearby vehicles when turning at 90 degrees.

On election night it appeared that the party which had won four electorate seats would get two <b>overhang</b> seats in Parliament. However with their party vote above 2% the party got an extra seat and hence needed only one <b>overhang</b> seat. National got one less list seat in the final count, so then conceded defeat (the result was close between the two largest parties, National and Labour).|$|R
5|$|This martin {{builds a}} deep bowl nest on a {{sheltered}} horizontal surface, or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, {{and may be}} built on natural sites under cliff <b>overhangs</b> or on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is often a solitary breeder, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16–19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 22–24 days, although the young birds {{will return to the}} nest to roost for {{a few days after the}} first flight.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short <b>overhangs</b> and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The African rock martin {{and the south}} Asian dusky crag martin are resident, but the Eurasian crag martin is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north Africa or India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff <b>overhangs</b> or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the breeding site with a slow hunting flight as they seek their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

40|$|One way {{in which}} {{corporate}} financial structure affects macroeconomic performance is by creating debt <b>overhang.</b> Debt <b>overhang</b> occurs when existing debt deters new investment because the benefits from new investment {{will go to the}} existing creditors, not to the new investors.

If the economy is stagnant, debt <b>overhang</b> will bind because the returns to investing are low. As a result, high levels of debt can create multiple expectational equilibria in which 'animal spirits' determine economy activity. Copyright 1995 by American Economic Association. ...|$|R
