500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E

"here is {{the music}} I listen to when I'm at my saddest, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel a moment is special, the songs I used to sing {{as a young girl}} when I first started performing, and above all those which taught me to love music, and how music can move you so deeply, {{regardless}} of its genre or style".|$|E
2500|$|Where Renzi {{lived and}} what he did {{throughout}} the 1986–1997 period is unclear. In a letter to the Arizona Daily Sun in July 2002, Renzi said [...] "The only time I have not lived in Arizona is when I served our nation overseas on a Defense Department program, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> entered law school at age 39" [...] But according to an August 2002 Associated Press article, Renzi said that between college, starting in the late 1970s, and his return some 20 years later, he had lived in Flagstaff for only a total of seven years. The AP article also said [...] "Renzi made much of his money while living in Burke, Virginia, about 20 minutes from downtown Washington. He has owned a $765,000 two-story, six-bedroom home on five acres there since 1991, according to Fairfax County, Virginia, property records." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} fishing an hour <b>or</b> more <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw Euphemia running toward me.|$|R
60|$|Had {{anything}} happened while Rachel and I were finishing the painted door? <b>or,</b> later, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> rode over to Frizinghall? <b>or</b> afterwards, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went back with Godfrey Ablewhite and his sisters? <b>or,</b> later again, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> put the Moonstone into Rachel's hands? <b>or,</b> later still, <b>when</b> the company came, {{and we all}} assembled round the dinner-table? My memory disposed of that string of questions readily enough, until I came to the last. Looking back at the social event of the birthday dinner, I found myself brought to a standstill {{at the outset of}} the inquiry. I was not even capable of accurately remembering the number of the guests who had sat at the same table with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you; you {{are very}} good. I am often thirsty <b>when</b> <b>I</b> waken, <b>or</b> rather <b>when</b> <b>I</b> leave off dreaming. I seem to dream, rather than sleep, just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet seem'd the {{pressure}} thrice as sweet [...] As woodbine's fragile hold, [...] <b>Or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel about my feet [...] The berried briony fold." ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel considered. [...] "I think you're right; {{but there}} are some things I can't help minding: for {{instance}} when my friend's attacked <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> myself am praised." ...|$|E
60|$|For a month I rarely smiled, <b>or,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did, it {{was with}} a weary, bitter smile, concealing a broken heart--at least that was the intention. Shallow-minded {{observers}} misunderstood.|$|E
6000|$|YANK--[Shaking {{his fist}} upward--contemptuously.] Take it easy dere, you! Who d'yuh tinks runnin' dis game, me <b>or</b> you? <b>When</b> <b>I</b> git ready, we move. Not before! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> git ready, get me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you {{joined in}} {{with all those}} people in my absence, without knowing whether I should approve <b>or</b> disapprove. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> came I couldn't help myself at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Unthank," [...] he said sternly, [...] "return to your duties at once, and {{understand}} that this house is mine, to enter <b>or</b> leave <b>when</b> <b>I</b> choose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Willie, how comes it {{that you}} know? I'm sure I {{did not mean to}} tell you. I promised I never would. I must have let it out inadvertently, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was asleep." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} {{get away from this}} man's cigar; <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did, I came within range of the perfume from the engine-room, and felt I {{wanted to go back to}} the cigar. There seemed to be no neutral ground between the two.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{not always}} called thus," [...] {{answered}} Caleb, flushing, [...] "when I rescued you from the house at Tyre for instance, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> risked my life, Miriam, to throw you food upon the gate Nicanor. Nay, I come to save you from Domitian----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I drink {{very little}} as a rule," [...] said Little Chandler modestly. [...] "An odd half-one <b>or</b> so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> meet any of the old crowd: that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Count Eulenfurst is sorely wounded, sire, but I cannot {{say whether}} mortally <b>or</b> not. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> came away, {{he was still}} lying insensible. His wife and {{daughter}} are, happily, uninjured." ...|$|R
30|$|Participants {{indicated}} which statement {{out of a}} {{group of}} 3 – 4 statements best describes their eating patterns. For instance, one group included the following numbered statements: “I don’t feel any guilt <b>or</b> self-hate <b>when</b> <b>I</b> overeat”; “After I overeat, I occasionally feel guilt or self-hate”; “Almost all the time I experience strong guilt <b>or</b> self-hate <b>when</b> <b>I</b> overeat.” This process was repeated across 16 groups of statements, and the score across all 16 groups were weighted (see Gormally et al. 1982, for details) and summed to indicate participants’ BES score. Higher BES scores indicate more binge-eating symptomology.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure {{he likes}} me," [...] {{declared}} Myrtle, simply. [...] "He wasn't a bit cross when I ran in and took away his pistol, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> preached to him. I really {{gave him a}} good talking to, and he didn't object a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{very last}} time I ever was here," [...] he said, [...] "I saw {{much less of}} the quick than I saw of the dead." [...] - He was a man I had met with somewhere before, But how <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> now could recall no more.|$|E
6000|$|Others {{because you}} did not keep [...] That deep-sworn vow have been friends of mine; [...] Yet always when I look death in the face, [...] When I clamber to the heights of sleep, [...] <b>Or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> grow excited with wine, [...] Suddenly I meet your face.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Esmond laughed, [...] "You {{might have}} {{expressed}} it more happily, {{though it is}} perhaps only natural {{that there was a}} day <b>or</b> two <b>when</b> <b>I</b> would not have found fault with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not Mrs. Lyddell's daughter, {{and though}} I do expect a battle <b>or</b> two <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come out, {{it will not}} be a matter of {{obedience}} with me, as it is with Caroline." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} you mean that?" [...] she asked, looking at him curiously. [...] "I have watched you once <b>or</b> twice <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have been singing to you. Do you really care for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{there such}} things as {{accident}}s?" [...] she queried. [...] "Was it an accident when twenty years ago I found you sleeping in the schoolroom at the Abbey and kissed you on the forehead, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found you sleeping {{a few minutes ago}} twenty whole years later--?" [...] and she paused.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have seen, sir,' {{returned}} the locksmith with evident reluctance, 'I {{have seen in}} connection with her, something that has filled me with distrust and uneasiness. She has made bad friends, how, <b>or</b> <b>when,</b> <b>I</b> don't know; but that her house is a refuge for one robber and cut-throat at least, I am certain. There, sir! Now it's out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I understand," [...] {{he hesitated}} to {{retrieve}} himself. [...] "But I have had floating illusions, just before I fell asleep, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was sensible {{of not being}} quite awake, which seemed to differ from dreams. They were not so dramatic, but they were more pictorial; they were more visual than the things in dreams." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, do as I tell you; and don't {{forget to}} have a half-crown in your hand, <b>or</b> so, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> bring the plate round. Come, Pat, where are you? you've to give her away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a rum thing," [...] Nat {{thought to}} himself, [...] "that I {{should always be}} getting into some scrape <b>or</b> other <b>when</b> <b>I</b> go ashore. This is {{the worst of all}} by a long way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied his companion; [...] "I'm quite glad I don't; guess I'd use up {{two horses}} if I did. It saves me a league <b>or</b> two <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can cut {{out some of}} my visits." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{all this}} time I never ceased {{wondering}} at my own mental state; I thought of it when, quickly tired, my trembling fingers dropped the pencil; <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> woke from uneasy sleep to find the vision still before me, inviting, insistently calling to me, to resume my childish rambles and adventures of long ago in that strange world where I first saw the light.|$|E
60|$|I thought any Englishman had {{the liberty}} to speak his opinion in such things, for this {{had nothing to}} do with the public. The press was open to me as well as to others; and how <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> lost my English liberty of {{speaking}} my mind, I know not; neither how my speaking my opinion without fee or reward, could authorise them to call me villain, rascal, traitor, and such opprobrious names.|$|E
6000|$|Thus {{in a sea}} of folly toss'd, My choicest {{hours of}} life are lost; Yet always wishing to retreat, Oh, could I see my country-seat! There, leaning near a gentle brook, Sleep, or peruse some ancient book, [...] 130 And there in sweet {{oblivion}} drown Those cares that haunt the court and town. O charming noons! and nights divine! <b>Or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> sup, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> dine, My friends above, my folks below, Chatting and laughing all a-row; The beans and bacon set before 'em, The grace-cup served with all decorum: Each willing to be pleased, and please, And even the very dogs at ease! [...] 140 Here no man prates of idle things, How this or that Italian sings, A neighbour's madness, or his spouse's, Or what's in either of the Houses: But something much more our concern, And quite a scandal not to learn: Which is the happier or the wiser, A man of merit, or a miser? Whether we ought to choose our friends, For their own worth, or our own ends? [...] 150 What good, or better, we may call, And what, the very best of all? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} Mr. Deane before," [...] she said hesitatingly. [...] "I have {{talked with him}} once or twice. Somehow <b>or</b> other, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think that it may come to be a {{struggle}} between you and him--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have heard, indeed, {{that she}} is uncommonly {{improved}} within this year <b>or</b> two. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well." ...|$|R
60|$|HENRY. Ay, ay, no doubt; {{and were}} I humpt behind, Thou'dst say as much--the goodly way of women Who love, for which I love them. May God grant No ill befall or him <b>or</b> thee <b>when</b> <b>I</b> Am gone.|$|R
