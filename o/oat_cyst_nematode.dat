40|$|When {{nematodes}} invade {{and subsequently}} migrate within plant roots, they generate cell wall fragments (in {{the form of}} oligogalacturonides; OGs) that can act as damage-associated molecular patterns and activate host defence responses. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating damage responses in plant–nematode interactions remain unexplored. Here, we characterized {{the role of a}} group of cell wall receptor proteins in Arabidopsis, designated as polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs), during infection with the <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> Heterodera schachtii and the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. PGIPs are encoded by a family of two genes in Arabidopsis, and are involved in the formation of active OG elicitors. Our results show that PGIP gene expression is strongly induced in response to <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> invasion of roots. Analyses of loss-of-function mutants and overexpression lines revealed that PGIP 1 expression attenuates infection of host roots by <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes,</b> but not root-knot nematodes. The PGIP 1 -mediated attenuation of <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> infection involves the activation of plant camalexin and indole-glucosinolate pathways. These combined results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant damage perception and response pathways during infection by <b>cyst</b> and root-knot <b>nematodes,</b> and establishes the function of PGIP in plant resistance to <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes...</b>|$|R

40|$|In-vitro {{methods were}} {{developed}} to test fungi for production of metabolites affecting nematode egg hatch and mobility of second-stage juveniles. Separate assays were developed for two nematodes: root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) and soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> (Heterodera glycines). For egg hatch to be successfully assayed, eggs must first be surface-disinfested to avoid the confounding effects of incidental microbial growth facilitated by the fungal culture medium. Sodium hypochlorite was more effective than chlorhexidine diacetate or formaldehyde solutions at surface-disinfesting soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> eggs from greenhouse cultures. Subsequent rinsing with sodium thiosulfate to remove residual chlorine from disinfested eggs did not improve either soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> hatch or juvenile mobility. Soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> hatch in all culture media was lower than in water. Sodium hypochlorite was also used to surface-disinfest root-knot nematode eggs. In contrast to soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> hatch, root-knot nematode hatch was higher in potato dextrose broth medium than in water.

40|$|The first {{internally}} transcribed {{spacer region}} (ITS 1) from <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> species (Heteroderidae) was compared by nuc. leotide sequencing and PCR-RFLP. European, Asian, and North American isolates of five heterodefid species were examined to assess intraspecific variation. PCR-RFLP patterns of amplified ITS 1 DNA from pea <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode,</b> Heterodera goettingiana, from Northern Ireland were identical with patterns from Washington State. Sequencing demonstrated that ITS 1 heterogeneity existed within individuals and between isolates, {{but did not}} result in different restriction patterns. Three Indian and two U.

Sequencing detected variation among ITS 1 clones from the same individual, between individuals, and between isolates. PCR-RFLP detected several restriction site differences between Indian and U.

40|$|Short-term {{greenhouse}} {{studies with}} soybean (Glycine max cv.

Numbers of <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> juveniles in roots and numbers of cysts in soil and roots were reduced on plants with stem cankers. Defoliation by soybean looper larvae had the opposite effect; defoliation levels of 22 and 64 % caused stepwise increases in numbers of juveniles and cysts in both roots and soil, whereas numbers of females in roots decreased. In two experiments, stem canker length was reduced 40 and 45 % when root systems were colonized by the soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode.</b> The absence of significant interactions among these pests indicates {{that the effects of}} soybean <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode,</b> stem canker, and soybean looper on plant growth and each other primarily were additive...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cyst</b> <b>{{nematodes}}</b> and root-knot nematodes elaborately transform cells {{within the}} vascular cylinders of plant roots into enlarged, multinucleate, and metabolically active feeding cells. The giant cells of root-knot nematodes are formed by repeated karyokinesis uncoupled from cytokinesis, whereas the syncytia formed by <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> arise from coordinated cell wall dissolution and the coalescing of cell cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Both giant cells and syncytia undergo extensive cell wall architectural modifications, including thickening {{and the formation}} of numerous ingrowths that increase the plasmalemma surface area for solute uptake. The origin of enzymes involved in these cell wall modifications {{has been the subject of}} debate for several decades. Immunolocalization of endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanases (EGases) secreted from <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> was observed in root cortical tissue during the intracellular migration of the nematodes, but secretion of <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> EGases into developing syncytia was not detected. We have identified five EGase genes from tobacco that are upregulated within plant roots upon infection by both root-knot and <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes.</b> In situ localization of tobacco EGase transcripts demonstrated that their expression was specifically and developmentally upregulated within giant cells, syncytia, root tips, and lateral root primordia.
