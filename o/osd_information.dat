In this study, we aimed to determine the predictive and prognostic roles of oxidative stress-related genetic polymorphisms in metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) patients treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we genotyped nine oxidative stress-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NQO 1, SOD 2, SOD 3, PON 1, GSTP 1, GSTT 1, and NOS 3 (rs 1800566, rs 10517, rs 4880, rs 1799895, rs 662, rs 854560, rs 1695, rs 2266637, rs 1799983, respectively) in 108 consecutive MGC patients treated with epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and 5 -fluorouracil (EOF) regimen as the first-line chemotherapy and analyzed the association between the genotypes and the disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: We found that, {{in addition to a}} lower pathological grade (p =  0. 017), NQO 1 rs 1800566 CT/TT genotype was an independent predictive factor of poor PFS (hazard ratio [HR] =  1. 97, 95 % confidence interval [CI] =  1. 23 - 3. 16; p =  0. 005). PON 1 rs 662 AA/AG genotype was significantly associated with poor OS (HR =  1. 95, 95 % CI =  1. 07 - 3. 54; p =  0. 029). No associations were detected between the nine SNPs and DCR.

The {{aim of this}} investigation was to identify prognostic biomarkers for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by using the gene expression profile dataset from public database. Methods: The gene expression profile dataset and corresponding overall survival (<b>OS)</b> <b>information</b> of three cohorts of AML patients from GSE 12417 and The Cancer Genome Atlas AML project (TCGA-LAML) were included in the present study. Prognostic gene screening was performed by using a survival package, whereas time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using the survivalROC package. Results: In the three cohorts, 11 genes were identified that were significantly associated with AML OS. A linear prognostic model of the 11 genes was constructed and weighted by regression coefficient (β) from the multivariate Cox regression analyses of GSE 12417 HG-U 133 A cohort to divide patients into high- and low-risk groups. GSE 12417 HG-U 133 plus 2. 0 and TCGA-LAML were validation cohorts. Patients assigned to the high-risk group exhibited poor OS compared to patients in the low-risk group. The 11 -gene signature is a prognostic marker of AML and demonstrates good performance for predicting 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year OS as evaluated by survivalROC in the three cohorts.

Hence, in order to sustain future growth and improve their business model, {{there is a need}} for the stakeholders to understand the ever evolving Mobile Internet user behaviour. This thesis analysed data collected from a mobile cellular network in Finland during a week in 2010 using a modified version of the Tstat traffc classifier tool to capture HTTP header and network flow data. Since this was the first time this tool was used for the network measurements, the main aim of the thesis was to test the reliability of the data and then to create an analysis process to build in-depth understanding of the traffic usage patterns. Another goal was also to identify mobile handset devices using the new dataset available. First, a study of the traffic symmetry and diurnal pattern of the traffic flow was done, which showed downlink dominating the traffic with periods of high traffic during the evening hours. Comparison with the port-based classification showed that the Tstat traffic classifier was more capable in identifying modern Internet applications correctly. The results also found HTTP to be the dominant protocol in Mobile Internet. These information rich HTTP headers enabled detailed study of the HTTP traffic. The Operating System (<b>OS)</b> <b>information</b> available in the User-Agent (UA) header validated the fact that most traffic is indeed from PC based devices and thus enabled separate study for mobile handset based traffic. For identifying the handsets, the UA headers were mapped to the WURFL database.

However, there were lot of malformed and non-standard UAs, which means there is a need to further refine the handset identification methodology...|$|R

CRC is the second most common cause of cancer death not only in Sweden but also worldwide. In a large (n= 567) multicentre, phase III study, the Nordic VI study, two different ways of giving 5 -FU, bolus (FLv) and protracted infusion (Lv 5 FU 2), together with irinotecan, in patients with metastatic (m) CRC was tested without any differences in progression-free survival (PFS) [9 months] or overall survival (OS) [19 months]. Fewer objective responses were seen in the FLIRI group (35 % versus 49 %, p = 0. 001), but the metastatic resection rate did not differ (4 % versus 6 %, p = 0. 3). In the same study a subset (n= 51) of the population was evaluated for early metabolic treatment response with [18 F]- 2 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). The mean baseline standard uptake value (SUV) for all tumor lesions per patient was higher in non-responders than in responders (mean 7. 4 versus 5. 6, p = 0. 02). There was a strong correlation between metabolic response (changes in SUV) and objective response (p = 0. 00001), with a sensitivity of 77 % and a specificity of 76 %. There was no significant correlation between metabolic response and PFS (P = 0. 5) or OS (p = 0. 1). In the Nordic VI study, selected tumor markers at baseline and during treatment were evaluated for their ability to predict response rate (RR), PFS and OS in two sub-studies. In the first one (n= 90), low levels of tissue inhibitor of metallo-protease 1 (TIMP- 1) levels at baseline were correlated to a higher probability of obtaining an objective response (P = 0. 007). Plasma TIMP- 1 scored as a continuous variable on a log scale (loge) was significantly associated with OS (P < 0. 0001) and PFS (p = 0. 048). In the second sub-study (n= 106) a significant correlation to OS was seen for baseline levels of all selected markers. In multivariate analyses with clinical parameters, TPA, CRP, SAA and TIMP- 1 provided independent information. Changes during treatment, recorded as the slope gave with the exception of CA 19 - 9 for <b>OS</b> less <b>information</b> about outcomes. The best correlation to response was seen for CEA, CA 19 - 9 and TPA with AUC values of 0. 78, 0. 83 and 0. 79, respectively, using a combined model based upon an interaction between the slope and the baseline value. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) was also evaluated in a subset of the Nordic VI population (n= 220). There were no differences in HRQoL between the two treatment groups at any time point. Emotional functioning and pain improved, and diarrhea worsened with time. Most baseline QoL subscales correlated with <b>OS.</b> Independent <b>information</b> on <b>OS,</b> but not PFS or RR was seen for physical functioning (p=. 000), appetite (p=. 028) and constipation (p=. 041) together with hemoglobin level.

From a social sustainability perspective, better sharing and dissemination of production information supports operators cognitively to manage and understand their work tasks, which in turn improves quality of work. So, the focus {{of this paper is to}} study how production planning meetings can be improved. Previous research suggests that the MEET model can be used as a framework for improving meetings and information sharing by studying 10 different areas within a company’s Organisation System (<b>OS)</b> and <b>Information</b> System (IS) whilst considering the time and place prerequisites and aims for these meetings. In this paper, the applicability of the MEET model and its 10 areas are tested at a small production company by applying two different approaches. First, a questionnaire was presented to and filled out by a manager, the results of the questionnaire identifies the improvement potential of each of the 10 areas. Second, a comprehensive current-state analysis based on observations on the shop-floor and interviews with operators were carried out with regards to the 10 areas. The results from these two approaches were compared and the comparison showed that both approaches point towards similar areas for potential improvements. This paper concludes that the MEET model can be used as a general framework to inspire change by suggesting areas with potential improvement in information sharing. While the selfassessment questionnaire can identify a direction, additional information and involvement of other stakeholders are recommended for actual implementations of change. For future research, the methods based on the MEET model will be further developed to improve accuracy and the suggestions provided to the case company in this paper will be tested as a validation of the model...|$|R

Located on the Betic Ranges geological framework, the study area shows a wide variety of geological and geomorphological elements, mainly consisting in spectacular exo- and endokarstic landforms. The identification, interpretation and appropriate representation of the major exokarstic forms have been carried out through photointerpretation and spatial analysis functions of <b>OS</b> Geographical <b>Information</b> System (GIS) and Digital Terrain Model analitic tools. Furthermore, the field detection allowed a better understanding of these karst morphologies and their correct positioning in the stratigraphical and geological regional framework. Due to the large proportions of the Park surface (53. 411 ha), the smaller scale zone of Sierra de Libar (85 km²) was chosen as pilot study area, in order to check the feasibility and to improve the design of the main research. As a result, the large amount of these preliminary data collected for the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park will be inserted into the PostgreSQL Database (DB) where spatial data are managed by PostGIS DB.

However, there is little research reported in the literature that describes the information seeking behavior of open source (OS) programmers, even though OS contexts would seem to exacerbate information seeking problems for maintenance programmers. In the OS setting, team members are typically delocalized from each other {{and are more likely to}} use asynchronous communication. In addition, the information seeking behavior of OS system maintainers is an increasingly important research topic, due to the increasing body of OS software needing to be maintained and users’ increasing reliance on OS software systems. Such an increased reliance and prevalence means that there is increased demand for software maintenance of OS systems and it is this area that this thesis will strive to address. This thesis reports on a series of empirical studies that classify <b>OS</b> programmers’ <b>information</b> needs during maintenance. In these studies, types of information needs are identified through a Grounded Theory based analysis of the questions that appear in their developer mailing lists. Then the prevalence of these information needs, on different mailing lists, are quantified and the responses obtained are characterized. In doing so, several interesting observations are made about the types of information these programmers seek, the likelihood that they will receive responses and the number of responses they are likely to get.

Optical attenuation spectroscopy (OS) is a non-imaging method of evaluating breast tissue composition by red and near-infrared light transmitted through the breast that, unlike mammography, does not involve radiation. <b>OS</b> provides <b>information</b> on wavelength dependent light scattering of tissue and on absorption by water, lipid, oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin. We propose that OS could be an alternative marker of breast cancer risk and that OS breast tissue measures will be {{associated with}} MD. In the present analysis, we developed an algorithm to estimate breast tissue composition and light scattering parameters using a spectrally constrained global fitting procedure employing a diffuse light transport model. OS measurements were obtained from 202 pre- and post-menopausal women with normal mammograms. Percent density (PD) and dense area (DA) were measured using Cumulus. The association between OS tissue composition and PD and DA was analyzed using linear regression adjusted for body mass index. Among pre-menopausal women, lipid content was significantly inversely associated with square root transformed PD (β = - 0. 05, p = 0. 0002) and DA (β = - 0. 05, p = 0. 019); water content was significantly positively associated with PD (β = 0. 06, p = 0. 008). Tissue oxygen saturation was marginally inversely associated with PD (β = - 0. 03, p = 0. 057) but significantly inversely associated with DA (β = - 0. 10, p = 0. 002). Among post-menopausal women lipid and water content were significantly associated (negatively and positively, respectively) with PD (β lipid = - 0. 08, β water = 0. 14, both p< 0. 0001) and DA (β lipid = - 0. 10, p< 0. 0001; β water = 0. 11, p = 0. 001). The association between OS breast content and PD and DA is consistent with more proliferation in dense tissue of younger women, greater lipid content in low density tissue and higher water content in high density tissue. OS may be useful for assessing physiologic tissue differences related to breast cancer risk, particularly when mammography is not feasible or easily accessible...|$|R

Using this architecture, our method detects sophisticated and realistic anomalies, which are missed by other existing methods monitoring the CAN bus only.

40|$|In Ottaviani and Sørensen, {{henceforth}} OS, (2004 b), we have formulated a {{model of}} strategic communication by an expert concerned about being perceived to be well informed. In that model, the expert observes a private signal informative {{about the state of}} the world. The amount of information about the state contained in this signal is parametrized by the expert’s ability, assumed for simplicity to be unknown to the expert. The expert then sends a message to an evaluator, who uses it in conjunction with the ex-post realization of the state to update the belief about the expert’s ability. Under general conditions on the distribution of the expert’s private signal, we have shown that the expert does not wish to truthfully reveal the signal observed. In equilibrium, professional experts can credibly communicate only part of their <b>information.</b> <b>OS</b> (2004 a) have provided a further characterization of the equilibrium when the expert’s signal is assumed to be multiplicative linear, a natural generalization of the binary signal experiment that allows for continuously varying intensity. In that setting, OS (2004 a) have shown that no more than two messages can be effectively reported in equilibrium. In addition, when the prior distribution on the state is concentrated enough on a particular state, there exists no informative equilibrium. As a result, when experts speak in sequence, learning of the fixed state stops after a finite number of rounds. Reputational herding then obtains. This note collects some supplementary material on the analysis of reputational cheap talk games. Section 1 provides an illustration of the direction of the incentives, studied more generally in Section 4 of OS (2004 b). We then perform two robustness checks of th...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{that the oil}} sector in developing countries is facing challenges from a dynamic environment characterised by rapid technological change and increased demand. As innovation becomes critical {{to the survival of}} organisations, organisational context including organisational culture (OC), structure (<b>OS)</b> and <b>information</b> technology (IT) has been found to have an important influence on innovation, leading to increase social relationships among employees and flow knowledge within organisation through face to face employees interaction and information system. Social capital and knowledge sharing are recognised as the most significant resources for competitive advantage and the key to enhancing innovation. It has long been argued that social capital, a concept represented by the value embedded in the social relationships of individuals and collectives constitute strategic resources for individuals and organisations. Social networks perceived by individuals are a key issue in generating and facilitating knowledge sharing among employees to enhance innovation within organizations. It has also been shown that knowledge management and the promotion of knowledge sharing among the members of an organisation {{are an important part of}} the learning process as they help to convert the tacit knowledge embedded in individuals into explicit knowledge through interaction. Prior literature has pointed out that organisational context is one of the most important factors affecting social capital and knowledge sharing and enhanced innovation in an organisation. However, there is a lack of models linking organisational context, social capital and knowledge sharing, and innovation within oil sectors in general within developing countries, particularly Libya. Against this background, the thesis investigates the impact of organisational context on innovation. Using social capital and knowledge sharing, the integrative and comprehensive conceptual model are developed in order to reveal the direct and indirect impacts of organisational context on innovation. The model is then tested with a sample of 418 employees from two sectors; namely, public and the private. These were analysed through a IV multivariate analysis using a variance-based statistical technique known as Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling. The findings of this thesis are three-fold. First, with respect to the direct effect of organisational context on innovation, the study finds that both public and private sectors’ innovation are positively affected by organisational context. Second, regarding the indirect impact of organisational context on innovation, the study confirms its indirect nature through the social capital and knowledge sharing in both sectors. Third, the results show that there are significant differences between the public and private oil sectors in terms of the effect of organisational context on social capital, knowledge sharing and innovation, product and process. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications in that the results have provided empirical evidence on the direct and indirect impact of organisational context and can serve as an indication in practice for both firm managers and policy makers who are looking to establish strategies for achieving innovation. These would benefit from expending their efforts on promoting social capital and knowledge-sharing practices among their employees...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al XVI Scientific Meeting of the Spanish Society of Chromatography and Related Techniques, celebrado en Sevilla (España) del 2 al 4 de noviembre de 2016. Goat milk {{is known}} to contain {{oligosaccharides}} (OS) structurally similar to those present in human milk and in higher concentrations than milks from other mammals. Different beneficial properties, such as prebiotic and anti-inflammatory effects or modulation {{of the immune system}} have been attributed to these carbohydrates. It is know that goat milk oligosaccharides (GMO) are complex structures with different glycosidic linkages, degrees of polymerization and monomeric composition. Since bioactive properties are directly related to the chemical structure, there is a high interest in the study of these <b>OS.</b> However, little <b>information</b> about their detailed structures, concentrations and evolution during different lactation stages is available. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is a powerful technique for the analysis of OS, providing an appropriate resolution and good peak shapes. Also, in recent years, the use of nano-liquid chip-based technologies mainly coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) or tandem MS (MS/MS) techniques have demonstrated to be extremely helpful for OS identification and it has been applied to milk characterization due to its high sensitivity and ability for compositional verification. In this work, a methodology for the comprehensive characterization of GMO was developed. Goat colostrum samples were initially selected for methodoptimization since they are expected to have higher OS amounts than mature goat milk. Defatted and deproteinized milk samples, previously treated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to remove lactose, were analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (Nano-LC-Chip Q-TOF MS). Up to 78 oligosaccharides were identified. As a second step, a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) methodology was developed for the separation and quantitation of the main OS, both acidic and neutral carbohydrates. The developed methodology was used for a detailed study of the evolution of GMO at different stages of lactation and different trends were observed depending on the type OS (acidic or neutral). To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that a comprehensive characterization of GMO has been carried out. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
