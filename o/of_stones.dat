5|$|The brewing giant Bass {{acquired}} William Stones in the 1960s, {{and began}} to heavily promote the keg variant <b>of</b> <b>Stones</b> Bitter, which eventually became the highest selling bitter in the country. However the keg version was promoted {{at the expense of}} the traditional unpasteurised and unfiltered cask conditioned version. In the 1990s, the ABV <b>of</b> <b>Stones</b> was gradually reduced, and, as ale sales declined, Stones reverted from a national into a regional brand. Following the closure of the Cannon Brewery, Stones has been brewed at a number of different breweries. When Bass exited its brewing business, Stones became a Coors brand (later Molson Coors).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} stone circles {{were built in}} the area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Hampton Down ring was erected on an open downland ridge overlooking the coast. It originally contained either eight or nine sarsen stones and had a diameter of 20 feet (6.5 metres) across with a track leading to it from the north. By 1908 the circle had been shifted east of its original position, with a hedge built across the site, and the number <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> increased to sixteen. By 1964 the number <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> had further increased to twenty-eight. In 1965, Geoffrey J. Wainwright oversaw an archaeological excavation which revealed the circle's original location and dimensions, after which it was reconstructed in its original location with the extraneous stones removed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} online {{measurement}} system <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> slab based on Sobel operator improvement is {{proposed in the}} paper {{in order to improve}} accuracy and productivity <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> slab measurement.

40|$|This {{resource}} {{provides an}} overview of the distribution and occurrence <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> walls in New England. Topics include what constitutes a stone wall province and three critical factors in the occurence <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> walls: bedrock geology, glacial history, and land use history. Users can determine the type <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> wall in any given area by using the maps to determine its location, determine the type of bedrock, type of surficial materials, and type of settlement history for that spot. Referring to the text <b>of</b> 'Exploring <b>Stone</b> Walls', they can determine which type <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> wall province contains those types of rock and surface process and read the description of what the most common type <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> walls should be in that area.

5|$|The Marcellus {{is easily}} eroded, {{and is also}} found {{underlying}} low areas between some Appalachian ridges, forming linear valleys of moderate relief.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} investigation {{on the strength}} <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> and stone masonry. Granitoid-gneiss is commonly used for masonry construction in India. The compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> has been determined through 80 mm size cubes. It {{has been found that}} the compressive strength of granitoid-gneiss is greater when the load is parallel to the mineral bands. The compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> masonry was studied through masonry prisms using 1 : 4 and 1 : 8 cement mortars. These tests have revealed that masonry strength is higher when the load applied is parallel to the mineral bands. The flexural bond strength <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> masonry walls was studied through full-scale tests. Flexural bond strength appears {{to play a major role}} in the failure <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> masonry walls...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being smaller than those found elsewhere. Most of these Dorset circles are made of sarsen stone, although the Rempstone circle is unique in being made from local sandstone. The southern half of the circle has been destroyed, with five upright and three recumbent stones remaining extant. Having been damaged by eighteenth century clay workings, the monument is at present situated within dense woodland. In 1957, a possible avenue <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> leading to the circle was discovered by ploughing but subsequently removed. Local folklore holds that the stones arrived in their position after being thrown at Corfe Castle by the Devil.|$|E
5|$|After {{the casting}} <b>of</b> <b>stones,</b> animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael. Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal themselves, or oversaw the slaughtering. Today many pilgrims buy a sacrifice voucher in Mecca before the greater Hajj begins, which allows an animal to be slaughtered {{in the name of}} God (Allah) on the 10th, without the pilgrim being physically present. Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world. At {{the same time as the}} sacrifices occur at Mecca, Muslims worldwide perform similar sacrifices, in a three-day global festival called Eid al-Adha.|$|E

The only group <b>of</b> <b>stones</b> comparable in number to the Greece runestones are those that mention England, followed by the c. 26 Ingvar runestones raised {{in the wake of the}} fateful Ingvar expedition to Persia.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the contribution of}} interdisciplinary material culture studies to the study <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> tools. It argues for a new approach which foregrounds the role <b>of</b> the <b>stone</b> artefact after discard, suggesting {{that it is impossible}} to understand the meaning or efficacy <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> tools without understanding their afterlife in the social world <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> artefact makers and others after abandonment. Employing case studies derived from the fields of museum studies and heritage studies, it contends that the meaning and social role <b>of</b> a <b>stone</b> artefact changes throughout the course of its life history with each transformation in its use cycle, and most importantly, that stone artefacts continue to have social and material agency and do social ‘work’ even after they have been discarded. Although much of this chapter focuses on the materiality and meaning <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> artefacts in the modern world, these ideas also provide opportunities for a reconsideration of the materiality and meaning <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> artefacts in the past...|$|R
