5000|$|The cooking {{technique}} of jerking, {{as well as}} the results it produces, has evolved over time from using pit fires to old <b>oil</b> <b>barrel</b> halves as the container of choice. Around the 1960s, Caribbean entrepreneurs seeking to recreate the smoked pit flavor in an easier, more portable method came up with a solution to cut <b>oil</b> <b>barrels</b> lengthwise and attach hinges, drilling several ventilation holes for the smoke. [...] These barrels are fired with charcoal, which enhances the spicy, smoky taste. Alternatively, when these cooking methods are unavailable, other methods of meat smoking, including wood burning ovens, can be used to jerk meat. However, <b>oil</b> <b>barrels</b> are arguably {{one of the most popular}} cooking methods for making jerk in Jamaica. Most jerk in Jamaica is no longer cooked in the traditional method and is grilled over hardwood charcoal in a steel drum jerk pan.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States and {{throughout}} the oil industry world-wide, an <b>oil</b> <b>barrel</b> is defined as 42 US gallons, which is about [...] litres or 35 imperial gallons. In Canada, oil companies measure oil in cubic metres but convert to barrels on export, since most of Canada's oil production is exported to the US. The nominal conversion factor is 1 cubic metre = 6.2898 <b>oil</b> <b>barrels,</b> but conversion is generally done by custody transfer meters on the border since the exact conversion factor depends on oil density and temperature.|$|R

In the sailing period from 1855 to 1880 a number of American sealers spent a year or more on the island, living in appalling {{conditions}} in dark smelly huts, also at <b>Oil</b> <b>Barrel</b> Point. At its peak the community consisted of 200 people. By 1880 sealers had wiped out most of the seal population and then left the island.

Unmoved, the attacker killed 45-year-old Birajabala Debnath {{in front of}} her five minor children, who started shivering in terror. Her body was then cut into pieces and stuffed them into an <b>oil</b> <b>barrel</b> packed with salt and lime. After that, they cut the eldest daughter, 17-year-old Niyati, as the other children repeated begged for their lives. One by one they cut youngest daughter, 13-year-old Pranati, followed by Subhas 13, Suman 7, and Sujan, the youngest son who was just 23 months old. Their bodies too were similarly stuffed in <b>oil</b> <b>barrels</b> packed with lime and salt and dumped in the water body.|$|R
