40|$|The Carrier/Cask Handling System {{receives}} casks on railcars and legal-weight trucks (LWTs) (transporters) that transport loaded casks {{and empty}} <b>overpacks</b> to the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) from the Carrier/Cask Transport System. Casks {{that come to}} the MGR on heavy-haul trucks (HHTs) are transferred onto railcars before being brought into the Carrier/Cask Handling System. The system is the interfacing system between the railcars and LWTs and the Assembly Transfer System (ATS) and Canister Transfer System (CTS). The Carrier/Cask Handling System removes loaded casks from the cask transporters and transfers the casks to a transfer cart for either the ATS or CTS, as appropriate, based on cask contents. The Carrier/Cask Handling System receives the returned empty casks from the ATS and CTS and mounts the casks back onto the transporters for reshipment. If necessary, the Carrier/Cask Handling System can also mount loaded casks back onto the transporters and remove empty casks from the transporters. The Carrier/Cask Handling System receives <b>overpacks</b> from the ATS loaded with canisters that have been cut open and emptied and mounts the <b>overpacks</b> back onto the transporters for disposal. If necessary, the Carrier/Cask Handling System can also mount empty <b>overpacks</b> back onto the transporters and remove loaded <b>overpacks</b> from them. The Carrier/Cask Handling System is located within the Carrier Bay of the Waste Handling Building System. The system consists of cranes, hoists, manipulators, and supporting equipment. The Carrier/Cask Handling System is designed with the tooling and fixtures necessary for handling a variety of casks. The Carrier/Cask Handling System performance and reliability are sufficient to support the shipping and emplacement schedules for the MGR. The Carrier/Cask Handling System interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Transport System, ATS, and CTS as noted above.

40|$|Small-angle X-ray {{scattering}} (SAXS) {{studies and}} polarized optical microscopy were undertaken to explore possible morphological {{explanations for the}} poor mechanical strength in the petaloid bases of poly(ethylene terephthalate) bottles. With a standard commercial production line, one set of injection-molded preforms was over-packed by 1. 1 wt % to investigate {{the effect on the}} molecular morphology with respect to a set of control samples. Both sets of preforms showed highly crystalline and oriented areas corresponding to the injection gate region. The main body of the control preform was amorphous, and although the <b>overpacked</b> preform was essentially amorphous, there was some evidence for weak crystallinity. The SAXS patterns of the bottle petaloid base blown from the corresponding preforms produced similar SAXS patterns for <b>overpacked</b> and control bottle bases, indicating that the commercial process is robust at least to this degree of <b>overpacking.</b> Optical microscopy showed detailed crystalline features around the gate region and thin crystalline layers sandwiched between a quenched skin layer in direct contact with the cold mold walls and the main flow of material into the mold.

40|$|Acid-induced {{unfolding}} of apomyoglobin (apoMb) proceeds in a multistate process involving {{at least one}} equilibrium intermediate (I) at pH 4. 2. The structure of the I form has been investigated thoroughly, with significant effort devoted to identifying potentially stabilizing native contacts. Here, we test whether rigid side-chain packing interactions like those in holomyoglobin persist at a buried position, Met- 131, within the low-pH apoMb intermediate. We have measured the urea-induced unfolding transitions of <b>overpacking,</b> underpacking, and polar substitutions of Met- 131 {{to determine the effect}} on the stability of the native and intermediate states of apoMb. Whereas underpacking substitutions should destabilize the I form irrespective of the degree of native side-chain-packing interactions, we anticipate that <b>overpacking</b> replacements might show opposite effects in a tightly packed environment, compared with a region lacking native side-chain packing interactions. We observe that, whereas underpacking and polar substitutions destabilize the I form, <b>overpacking</b> substitutions are stabilizing, implying that I is structurally plastic. We also report a strong correlation between the I state unfolding free energies and side-chain transfer free energies from water to octanol. Our results suggest that, whereas side-chain hydrophobicity is important for the stability of the I form, specific side-chain packing interactions are not...|$|R

5000|$|When <b>Overpack</b> {{exhibited}} his Michigan {{logging wheels}} at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, {{they were a}} sensation and quickly caught on in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. They [...] "received first premium and medal" [...] at this World's Fair. <b>Overpack</b> solicited {{the support of the}} Redding Iron Works Company to aid in supplying his product to the western United States. He needed their aid to help overcome shipping issues, which they were able to do with their proximity to the West Coast timber industry. They became then another builder of Overpack's Michigan logging wheels. He then began manufacturing on a large scale and ultimately made thousands of logging wheels. He sold them worldwide and shipped via railroad to other states and Canada. The U.S. Army Forestry Department even took several to France during World War I. They were discontinued by 1930.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} in Michigan, <b>Overpack</b> entered into apprenticeship of learning the wagon-making trade. In 1868 he moved to Manistee {{and set up a}} blacksmith and wagon making business downtown. There he made wagons and sleighs for the thriving lumber industry of northern Michigan. He also sold salt, mill carts, blankets, harnesses, whips, and ropes. He usually employed anywhere from twelve to fifteen people at any one time.|$|E
5000|$|In 1871 <b>Overpack</b> married Manistee native Millie Magoon (1858-1932). They {{had three}} children: Roy M. (1879-1964), Nellie May (1885- [...] ), and Stella Rae (1891-1962). Roy M. {{graduated}} from University of Michigan of Ann Arbor in 1903 in Liberal Arts {{and received a}} law degree in 1905. He worked at his father's business. In 1940 Roy was the Secretary for Chamber of Commerce, in Manistee. Nellie May went to Benton Harbor College - she is a music vocal teacher and a singer. Stella Rae attends Oakwood School where Nellie May teaches. They both became talented musicians.|$|E
50|$|From then on Overpack's big wheels {{were part}} of Michigan logging history. Many {{northern}} states used them, and Michigan alone had at least 65 different lumber companies that had them. Michigan's rough and wet forest terrain made logging strictly a winter industry in the nineteenth century. The loggers used frozen ground to skid the logs from the woods to the railheads of rails or to river banks for further transporting. In the spring they would slide the logs from the banking grounds into the rivers for the log drive to the sawmills. <b>Overpack</b> made logging possible in all four seasons when he began manufacturing Michigan logging wheels at his Manistee wagon business.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the French {{design for}} a High Level Waste (HLW) repository, {{compacted}} bentonite may be the main component for the engineered barrier system (EBS) in the spent fuel disposal cell. In such a barrier, the interactions between groundwater and bentonite, {{as well as between}} the corrosion products of steel <b>overpacks</b> and bentonite, may modify the chemical and physical properties of the selected swelling clay buffer. Bentonite material has a very low permeability, and consequently molecular diffusion is the main mechanism of mass transport. This study is focused on the possible feedback effects of geochemical reactions on the transport properties (porosity and diffusion) of a compacted bentonite. After 100, 000 years of simulated mass transport-reaction, the model predicts mineralogical modifications of the EBS in contact with the geological interacting fluid, and with Fe 2 + ions provided by the corrosion of the steel <b>overpacks.</b> This corresponds to a transformation of the initial montmorillonite by partial illitization, saponification and vermiculitization due to chemical diffusion from geological groundwater through the bentonite barrier. The aqueous corrosion of steel <b>overpacks</b> generates a chemical perturbation inside the EBS (low redox potential and high values of pH) which could possibly create locally a destabilization of the montmorillonite, while part of the released Fe 2 + ions is incorporated into precipitated chlorites and saponites. Formations of magnetite, laumontite, greenalite, chabazite, phillipsite, and chrysotile are also identified in the numerical simulations. Despite these modifications, the predicted evolution of porosity display decreasing values and are limited to the outer parts of the EBS. A mass transport law applied to this study predicts a decrease of the molecular diffusion correlated with the porosity clogging...|$|R
