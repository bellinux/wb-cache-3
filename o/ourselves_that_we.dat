In the article, Chopra expressed her views {{about the safety of}} women in cities. She wrote: [...] "The magnitude of this crime can perhaps only truly be understood by a woman. It has much larger ramifications. We can't allow this to happen. We have to, in whichever way we can, ensure that what happened with Pallavi does not happen again.

Stipe said that he hoped fans realized it [...] "wasn't an easy decision": [...] "All things must end, {{and we wanted to}} do it right, to do it our way." [...] Long-time associate and former Warner Bros. Senior Vice President of Emerging Technology Ethan Kaplan has speculated that shake-ups at the record label influenced the group's decision to disband. The group discussed breaking up for several years, but was encouraged to continue after the lackluster critical and commercial performance of Around the Sun; according to Mills, [...] "We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to <b>ourselves,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could still make great records." [...] They were also uninterested in the business end of recording as R.E.M. The band members finished their collaboration by assembling the compilation album Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011, which was released in November 2011. The album is the first to collect songs from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. and Warner Bros. tenures, as well as three songs from the group's final studio recordings from post-Collapse into Now sessions. In November, Mills and Stipe did a brief span of promotional appearances in British media, ruling out the option of the group ever reuniting.|$|E

2500|$|The Fault in Our Stars is {{the sixth}} novel by author John Green, {{published}} in January 2012. The title {{is inspired by}} Act 1, Scene 2 of Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, in which the nobleman Cassius says to Brutus: [...] "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, / But in <b>ourselves,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are underlings." [...] The story is narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old girl with cancer. Hazel is forced by her parents to attend a support group where she subsequently meets and {{falls in love with}} 17-year-old Augustus Waters, an ex-basketball player and amputee. A feature film adaptation of the novel directed by Josh Boone and starring Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort and Nat Wolff was released on June 6, 2014. Both the book and its film adaptation were met with strong critical and commercial success.|$|E
2500|$|Donovan Rawcliffe (1959) {{connected}} the OBE experience with psychosis and hysteria. Other researchers {{have discussed the}} phenomena of the OBE {{in terms of a}} distortion of the body image (Horowitz, 1970) and depersonalization (Whitlock, 1978). The psychologists Nandor Fodor (1959) and Jan Ehrenwald (1974) proposed that an OBE is a defense mechanism designed to deal with the threat of death. According to (Irin and Watt, 2007) Jan Ehrenwald had described the out-of-body experience (OBE) [...] "as an imaginal confirmation of the question for immortality, a delusory attempt to assure <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> possess a soul that exists independently of the physical body. The psychologists Donald Hebb (1960) and Cyril Burt (1968) wrote on the psychological interpretation of the OBE involving body image and visual imagery. Graham Reed (1974) suggested that the OBE is a stress reaction to a painful situation, such as the loss of love. John Palmer (1978) wrote that the OBE is a response to a body image change causing a threat to personal identity.|$|E
2500|$|What {{is going}} on? First, {{we have to}} remind <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have {{assigned}} a parameter (a natural number) to every variable xi. Second, we do see a successor-operator at work iterating y (i.e. the y'). And third, {{we see that the}} function μy yχ(y, x) is just producing instances of χ(y,x) i.e. χ(0,x), χ(1,x), ... until an instance yields 0. Fourth, when an instance χ(n,x) yields 0 it causes the middle term of τ, i.e. v = π( [...] x, y' [...] ) to yield 0. Finally, when the middle term v = 0, μy yχ(y) executes line (iii) and [...] "exits". Kleene's presentation of equations (ii) and (iii) have been exchanged to make this point that line (iii) represents [...] an exit—an exit taken only when the search successfully finds a y to satisfy χ(y) and the middle product-term π(x, y' [...] ) is 0; the operator then terminates its search with τ(z', 0, y) = y.|$|E
