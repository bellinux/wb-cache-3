25|$|Other surgeons' poor {{results of}} failed {{fracture}} union via sepsis were sometimes erroneously associated with Lane. British Medical Association appointed {{a committee to}} investigate Lane's practice—and ruled in Lane's favor. Whereas other surgeons would attempt asepsis but lapse, perhaps touching an unsterilized surface, Lane's utterly fastidious protocol was unrelenting. His 1905 book The <b>Operative</b> <b>Treatment</b> of Fractures reported good results. Lane introduced plates, made of steel, in 1907. (Stainless steel, discovered the next decade, was not widely used in medicine or surgery until much later.) Radiography's introduction vindicated Lane's assertion of frequent disunion via nonsurgical intervention. Lane's influence introducing internal fixation rivals and perhaps exceeds that of other, early pioneers like Albin Lambotte and later William O'Neill Sherman.|$|E

[...] That same year, Lane operated. The following year, Lane's book The <b>Operative</b> <b>Treatment</b> of Chronic Constipation {{was published in}} London.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} equinus gait treatments on the vertical displacement of the body's centre of mass (COM) in 21 patients with cerebral palsy (14 males, 7 females; mean age 8 y 9 mo [SD 2 y]; range 3 y 7 mo- 17 y) presenting different topographical types (quadriplegia, n = 1; diplegia, n = 6; right hemiplegia, n = 6; and left hemiplegia, n = 8). Vertical COM displacement was computed from ground reaction forces, and lower limb kinematics was recorded simultaneously. Equinus gait was treated with non-operative treatments (i. e. botulinum toxin injections and stretching casts) in 14 patients, and with <b>operative</b> <b>treatments</b> in seven patients. After non-operative treatments, the entire ankle displacement shifted towards dorsiflexion throughout the gait cycle, but the amplitude of the third foot rocker (TR) and vertical COM displacement remained unchanged. However, after <b>operative</b> <b>treatments,</b> the amplitude of TR increased and vertical COM displacement decreased. A negative linear correlation {{was found between the}} former variables in all the patients where 53 % of the changes in their vertical COM displacement, after equinus gait treatments, were explained by the changes in TR amplitude. In fact, TR remains a main gait determinant, reducing the vertical COM displacement after equinus gait treatment and influencing the general gait pattern...|$|R
