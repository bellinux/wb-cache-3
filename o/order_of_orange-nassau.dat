5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} very fond of and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange-Nassau</b> in 1955.|$|E

5|$|In December 1946, it was {{announced}} that Halsey, Spruance and Turner had been awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.

The medal was duly presented by General Courtney Hodges in a ceremony on Governors Island on 10 April 1947. The Australian government chose to honor Kinkaid with an honorary Companion of the Order of the Bath, which was presented by the ambassador at a ceremony at the embassy in Washington on Australia Day, 26 January 1948. Kinkaid had already been created Grand Officer of the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange-Nassau</b> by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1944. In March 1948, he was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Leopold and presented with the Croix de guerre with Palm in a ceremony at the Belgian embassy in Washington, D.C.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>Orange-Nassau</b> was {{bestowed}} upon both {{members of the}} Netherlands military and members of foreign services who had helped liberate the Netherlands from Nazi German occupation, and those who helped liberate the former Dutch colonies in the Pacific.

The Order is typically awarded each year on the Monarch's official birthday (currently April 27) with around 3500 appointments to the Order made public.

50|$|The male {{line of the}} House <b>of</b> <b>Orange-Nassau</b> {{ended with}} the death of William III on 23 November 1890. His only {{surviving}} child and successor, Wilhelmina, married Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on 7 February 1901 and, as customary, assumed the feminine form of her husband's title. The title of Duchess of Mecklenburg was thus added to her full style. The government did not want the House <b>of</b> <b>Orange-Nassau</b> to become extinct on Wilhelmina's death, and so in 1908 she issued a royal decree conferring the title of Prince or Princess <b>of</b> <b>Orange-Nassau</b> to her descendants. Her only child, Juliana, was therefore born not only Duchess of Mecklenburg but also Princess <b>of</b> <b>Orange-Nassau,</b> like previous members of the Dutch royal family.|$|R
