She is depicted mostly nude; however, she is so posed that her genitals are generally hidden or a multi-hooded cobra or jewellery around the waist covers them. She is depicted as being young and slim. She {{is described}} as a sixteen-year-old girl with full breasts, adorned with lotuses <b>or</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> single blue lotus near her heart. Sometimes, she is partially or fully clothed.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are mild and require no treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild, {{to the extent that}} casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job <b>or</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E

25|$|Saliva is very {{important}} in the sense of taste. It is the liquid medium in which chemicals are carried to taste receptor cells (mostly associated with lingual papillae).

25|$|The Turing test is {{concerned}} strictly {{with how the}} subject acts– the external behaviour of the machine. In this regard, it takes a behaviourist or functionalist approach {{to the study of}} the mind. The example of ELIZA suggests that a machine passing the test may be able to simulate human conversational behaviour by following a simple (but large) list of mechanical rules, without thinking <b>or</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> mind at all.|$|E

This forces the kicking team on punts and field goal attempts to land the ball in the field of play.|$|E
25|$|A balance {{disorder}} is a disturbance that causes {{an individual to}} feel unsteady, for example when standing or walking. It may be accompanied by feelings of giddiness, or wooziness, <b>or</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. Balance {{is the result of}} several body systems working together: the visual system (eyes), vestibular system (ears) and proprioception (the body's sense of where it is in space). Degeneration or loss of function in any of these systems can lead to balance deficits.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, at {{the peak}} of World War II, {{zinc-coated}} steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper. A few copper cents from 1943 were produced from the 1942 planchets remaining in the bins. Similarly, some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed. From 1944 through 1946, salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process, and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass <b>or</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> considerably darker finish than other issues.|$|E

25|$|Members who are {{not living}} in {{accordance}} with the doctrines taught in the INC are admonished. Those who continue in violation of INC doctrines after being admonished are excommunicated or expelled from the INC and thus lose salvation, and therefore, the church does not believe in the perseverance of the saints. Certain violations, such as eating blood, being absent from worship services too long without any solid reason, or marrying <b>or</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship with a non-member may result in mandatory excommunication.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{standard}} ethical theory, respecting dignity {{can also be}} aligned with having a respect for people and their autonomous choices. People are then enabled {{to make decisions about}} their own treatment. Amongst other things this grounds the practice of informed consent that should be respected by the nurse, although much of the debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable to make choices about their own treatment due to being incapacitated <b>or</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> mental illness that affects their judgement. A suggested way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an advance directive, outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of their inability to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted paternalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifications}} {{for women who}} wished to become members of the WR were quite stringent. The eligibility requirements for officer candidates and enlisted women were similar: United States citizenship; not married to a marine; either single or married but with no children under 18; height not less than 60inches; weight not less than 95pounds; good vision and good teeth. For enlisted members, the age limits were from 20 to 35, and an applicant was required {{to have at least}} two years of high school. For officer candidates, the age limits were from 20 to 49, either a college graduate, <b>or</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> combination of two years of college and two years of work experience. Later, the wives of enlisted marines were allowed to join, and enlisted women could marry after boot camp.|$|E
