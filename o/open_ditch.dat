5|$|The pyramid {{does not}} have {{internal}} chambers, the chambers being located underground. These were constructed in a deep <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> dug before the pyramid construction started and only later covered by the pyramid. The entrance to the underground chambers is located north of the pyramid from a pavement in the court {{in front of the}} pyramid face. This is different from the 4th dynasty pyramids for which the entrance to the internal chambers is located on the pyramid side itself. The entrance was hewn into the bedrock and floored and roofed with large slabs of white limestone, most of which have been removed in modern times.|$|E
25|$|The {{substructure}} of Sahure's pyramid {{was built}} in a shallow T-shaped <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> (see above). The ditch was so shallow that the corridor leading from the pyramid entrance to the grave chamber is horizontal overall and, in parts, slightly ascending into the pyramid core.|$|E
25|$|The {{substructures}} of {{the pyramid}} were built in a T-shaped <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> reaching to the foundation layer and left open to allow for simultaneous works on the pyramid foundation and core. The ditch comprised {{a gap in the}} pyramid side wall which was eventually filled with rubble and is still recognizable today. This construction technique is common to all pyramids of the 5th dynasty and can directly be seen {{in the case of the}} Pyramid of Neferefre, which was left unfinished.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundation}} of the pyramid was laid out in an <b>open</b> <b>ditch.</b> The ditch had an encircling wall, which extended to {{the first step of}} the pyramid and allowed simultaneous work on the foundation and the structure. The foundation was built in the same pattern as the Pyramid of Sahure. Access led from {{the north side of the}} pyramid downwards to the south direction and led to a slightly north-deviated horizontal passage. The lower area was faced with rose granite and had a portcullis slab barrier from the same material. Unusual and not verified in any other building was a further blocking device from jawlike, intertwined barriers in the centre of the horizontal passage. The burial chamber and the antechamber were as usual oriented east-to-west and faced with a pediment ceiling from fine limestone and a chamber cladding from the same material. Cladding as well as pediment ceiling were heavily damaged through stone robbery. Today, only single fragments of the foundation in the pit exist.|$|E
25|$|Water {{was brought}} to the mill in an <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> (zanja) from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea {{designed}} an unusual horizontal, direct impulse water wheel. There were three vaulted water chambers on the ground floor and a single horizontal water wheel. The water wheel was attached to a vertical shaft that went up to the second level (the current entrance room) where the grinding stones were located. One of the grinding stones was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the water wheel. A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the wheel turning with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.|$|E
60|$|A young Prince {{was riding}} one day through a meadow that {{stretched}} for miles {{in front of}} him, {{when he came to}} a deep <b>open</b> <b>ditch.</b> He was turning aside to avoid it, when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch. He dismounted from his horse, and stepped along in the direction the sound came from. To his astonishment he found an old woman, who begged him to help her out of the ditch. The Prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there.|$|E
50|$|Worse, {{the large}} <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> {{surrounding}} forts {{of this type}} were {{an integral part of}} the defensive scheme, as was the covered way at the edge of the counter scarp. The ditch was extremely vulnerable to bombardment with explosive shells.|$|R

50|$|Instead {{of having}} <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> {{at the side}} of highways, land drains can be installed. The {{excavated}} trenches are completely filled with gravel (i.e., no soil cover). This is far safer than open trenches if a vehicle should run off the highway.|$|R

50|$|To {{mount the}} main gun turret at the fortress, it was {{necessary}} to dig 17 metres vertically into the mountain. This was considered a time-consuming task, so the main entrance and gun emplacement were constructed as an <b>open</b> <b>ditch,</b> and later covered with concrete, instead of blasting a tunnel into and down in the solid rock. As a result, water entering the tunnel system has been a problem ever since the tunnel was constructed.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a land drain is to allow water in wet or swampy ground to rapidly drain away or to relieve {{hydrostatic}} pressure. They are subterranean linear structures which are laid to a fall which should be as steep as practicable. They are used in agriculture and in building construction sites. Modern land drains {{take the form of}} a perforated or discontinuous (i.e. open-jointed) pipe. Typically, the land drains conduct the surplus water to an <b>open</b> <b>ditch</b> or natural water source.|$|E
50|$|The Dyke Ditch {{today is}} 19 km long. 15.4 km {{of that are}} <b>open</b> <b>ditches</b> and 3.6 km are {{underground}} water tunnels.

5000|$|In agriculture, tile {{drainage}} {{is a type}} of drainage system that removes excess water from soil below the surface. Whereas irrigation is the practice of adding additional water when the soil is naturally too dry, drainage brings soil moisture levels down for optimal crop growth. While surface water can be drained via pumping and/or <b>open</b> <b>ditches,</b> {{tile drainage}} is often the best recourse for subsurface water.|$|R
