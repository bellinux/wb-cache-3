5|$|The {{primary unit}} of social {{organisation}} in Germanic and Celtic Europe {{of the early}} Middle Ages was the kin group and this was probably the case in early Medieval Scotland.

5|$|All the {{foregoing}} rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, {{on the view}} that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,...|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Latiolais {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} a cladogram (tree <b>of</b> <b>descent)</b> {{that attempts to}} show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 species in the genus Strombus (including Strombus canarium) and three species in the allied genus Lambis. The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I protein-coding gene regions. In this proposed phylogeny Strombus canarium, Strombus vittatus (a synonym for Doxander vittatus) and Strombus epidromis (Labiostrombus epidromis) are closely related, and appear to share a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have {{stemmed from a}} personal belief that his wife Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|E

In Section 5. 1 <b>of</b> Knuth [10], <b>descents</b> are connected with the theory of sorting and with the theory of runs in permutations. Diaconis, McGrath, and Pitman [1] study a model of card shuffling in which descents play a central role. Solomon [13] gives a definition <b>of</b> <b>descents</b> for any Coxeter group W and defines descent algebras which are subalgebras of the group algebra of W. Garsia and Gessel [7] find a generating function for the joint distribution <b>of</b> <b>descents,</b> major index, and inversions. Gessel and Reutena [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The exact line <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> between {{domestic}} sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear. The most common hypothesis states that Ovis aries is {{descended from the}} Asiatic (O. orientalis) species of mouflon. It has been proposed that the European mouflon (O. musimon) is an ancient breed of {{domestic sheep}} turned feral rather than an ancestor, despite its commonly being cited as ancestor in past literature. A few breeds of sheep, such as the Castlemilk Moorit from Scotland, were formed through crossbreeding with wild European mouflon.|$|E
5|$|The {{tetrapods}} {{have their}} {{root in the}} early Devonian tetrapodomorph fish. Primitive tetrapods developed from an osteolepid tetrapodomorph lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygian-crossopterygian), with a two-lobed brain in a flattened skull. The coelacanth group represents marine sarcopterygians that never acquired these shallow-water adaptations. The sarcopterygians apparently took two different lines <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> and are accordingly separated into two major groups: the Actinistia (including the coelacanths) and the Rhipidistia (which include extinct lines of lobe-finned fishes that evolved into the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs).|$|E

A particular conjugacy class that is of interest is the class of matchings (also known as fixed point free involutions). This paper provides a bijective proof of the symmetry <b>of</b> the <b>descents</b> and major indices of matchings and uses a generating function approach to prove an asymptotic normality theorem for the number <b>of</b> <b>descents</b> in matchings.

5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped balls {{of the same}} material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, {{in direct proportion to}} weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events <b>of</b> <b>Descent</b> II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last moment, the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E
5|$|Fates is {{primarily}} {{set in the}} territories of the kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Their royalty share a similar line <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> from ancient dragons, but each kingdom worships different dragon deities, and so exist {{in a state of}} war. Little do they know that there is also another dragon deity; the dragon Anankos, ruler of the kingdom of Valla. This realm is located under the Bottomless Canyon which separates Hoshido and Nohr. Anankos has usurped the throne of Valla and is intentionally provoking war between the two kingdoms. In the Hidden Truths DLC, it is revealed that Anankos was formerly a kind dragon who gave wisdom to humanity, but his growing power and inability to ascend to the spirit realm with the world's other dragons began corrupting him. After he killed Valla's king in an uncontrolled fit of bestial rage, he finally went mad: his remaining sanity and kindness took temporary shelter in a human form and fathered the Avatar before dying, while his dragon self began an insane crusade to destroy humanity.|$|E

5|$|In biology, {{homology}} is {{the existence}} of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different taxa. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats, the arms of primates, the front flippers of whales and the forelegs of dogs and horses are all derived from the same ancestral tetrapod structure. Evolutionary biology explains homologous structures adapted to different purposes as the result <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> with modification from a common ancestor. Homology was explained by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this, from Aristotle onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555. The term was applied to biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843.|$|E
5|$|Offa's ancestry {{is given}} in the Anglian collection, a set of genealogies that include lines <b>of</b> <b>descent</b> for four Mercian kings. All four lines descend from Pybba, who ruled Mercia early in the 7th century. Offa's line descends through Pybba's son Eowa and then through three more generations: Osmod, Eanwulf and Offa's father, Thingfrith. Æthelbald, who ruled Mercia {{for most of the}} forty years before Offa, was also descended from Eowa {{according}} to the genealogies: Offa's grandfather, Eanwulf, was Æthelbald's first cousin. Æthelbald granted land to Eanwulf in the territory of the Hwicce, and it is possible that Offa and Æthelbald were from the same branch of the family. In one charter Offa refers to Æthelbald as his kinsman, and Headbert, Æthelbald's brother, continued to witness charters after Offa rose to power.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{because of}} the {{relatively}} limited number of potential consorts, the gene pool of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines <b>of</b> <b>descent,</b> such as the numerous European royalty and nobility descended from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom or King Christian IX of Denmark. The House of Habsburg was infamous for inbreeding, with the Habsburg lip cited as an ill effect, although no genetic evidence has proved the allegation. The closely related houses of Habsburg, Bourbon, Braganza and Wittelsbach also engaged in first-cousin unions frequently and in double-cousin and uncle-niece marriages occasionally.|$|E
