He was the first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> great Springbok rugby players produced by the Blue Bulls. And after his playing days, he achieved fame as both coach and selector. He will also be remembered for his enthusiastic team talks and witty speeches.

25|$|You stand convicted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> evil {{abduction}} {{and murder}} of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what you have done... I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that you are already serving.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} the Ad Dahna curves westward following the arc of the Jabal Tuwayq. At its southern end, it merges with the Rub' al Khali, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> forbidding sand deserts in the world and, until the 1950s, {{one of the least}} explored. The topography of this huge area, covering more than 550,000 square kilometers, is varied. In the west, the elevation is about 600 meters, and the sand is fine and soft; in the east, the elevation drops to about 180 meters, and much of the surface is covered by relatively stable sand sheets and salt flats. In places, particularly in the east, longitudinal sand dunes prevail; elsewhere sand mountains as much as 300 meters in height form complex patterns. Most of the area is totally waterless and uninhabited except for the few wandering Bedouin tribes.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was back}} in time for {{what would be a}} memorable Finals series. In the Qualifying Final defeat to arch-rivals Carlton, Hart kicked five goals and was among Richmond's best players. He was again among {{the best players in the}} {{cut-throat}} Semi-final against St Kilda, but had to get his knee drained of fluid the following Monday and continued limping until the Wednesday. Desperate to have him play, the selectors put him on the bench (in this era a replacement could only be used once) for the Preliminary Final against and watched forlornly as the Tigers slipped to a six-goal deficit at half time. Coach Tom Hafey took a big risk by bringing Hart on at this point; Hart's inspirational performance in booting two goals lifted the Tigers to an amazing victory, thus underlining Hart's reputation as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> great leaders in the game. In the 1973 VFL Grand Final, Hart dominated against Carlton, winning 19 possessions, seven marks and kicking three goals, even though his knee had improved only marginally since the previous week.|$|E

Philips noted that {{for much of}} the project she found it difficult separating fact from fiction when it came to Montalban's life, but that she had been able to nevertheless put together a biographical account, albeit an incomplete one, of [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> great characters of English occultism." ...|$|E
500|$|Lansbury's {{choice of}} the SDF, from several socialist organisations, {{reflected}} [...] his admiration for [...] Hyndman, [...] whom he considered [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> great ones". [...] Lansbury quickly became the federation's most tireless propagandist, travelling throughout Britain to address meetings or to demonstrate solidarity with workers involved in industrial disputes. Around this time, Lansbury temporarily set aside his Christian beliefs and {{became a member of}} the East London Ethical Society. One factor in his disillusion with the Church was the local clergy's unsympathetic approach to poor relief, and their opposition to collective political action.|$|E

Alphonse Salamone similarly remarked that [...] "Claude Philippe brought an ingredient to this industry that I don't think has been surpassed".

He knew also when sat on the client side how to get the very best for the client".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{use of the}} Greek letter [...] {{alone to}} represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William Jones in his 1706 work Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos; or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics. The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase [...] "1/2 Periphery (...) [...] " [...] {{in the discussion of}} a circle with radius one. However, he writes that his equations for [...] are from the [...] "ready pen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> ingenious Mr. John Machin", leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones. Jones' notation was not immediately adopted by other mathematicians, with the fraction notation still being used as late as 1767.|$|E

Dogged by injuries and 34 years old, Motley quit before the season began, after Brown said he would otherwise be cut from the team. [...] "Marion realized that his knee was weak and {{did not feel that}} it was coming around," [...] Brown said at the time. [...] "He was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> fine fullbacks in his prime, the type that comes along once in a lifetime.

500|$|Critics remain {{split on}} their stances of Cannibal Holocaust. Supporters {{of the film}} cite it as a serious and well-made social {{commentary}} on the modern world. Sean Axmaker praised the structure and setup of the film, saying, [...] "It's a weird movie with an awkward narrative, which Deodato makes all the more effective with his grimy sheen of documentary realism, while Riz Ortolani's unsettlingly lovely, elegiac score provides a weird undercurrent." [...] Jason Buchanan of Allmovie said, [...] "While it's hard to defend the director for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> repugnant images with which he has chosen to convey his message, there is indeed an underlying point to the film, if one is able {{to look beyond the}} sometimes unwatchable images that assault the viewer." ...|$|E
500|$|Philippe is {{best remembered}} for {{founding}} the April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf Astoria in 1951, which he ran with Elsa Maxwell until his sacking {{from the hotel}} in 1959. The balls were major events in the US socialite calendar, and raised {{millions of dollars for}} American and French charities over the 28 years of its existence. His Lucullus Circle dinners also attracted some of the wealthiest businessmen of the day to feast on six to eight course meals. During his career at the Waldorf Astoria {{it has been estimated that}} Philippe was responsible for his clients spending $150 million alone on banquets, which led him to be referred to as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> great men this industry has ever produced" [...] by George Lang.|$|E

William Gibbs McAdoo, a former Democratic senator, stated [...] "You don't {{have to agree}} with every {{position}} taken to concede that he was an intellectual giant and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> great men of our times". Ernest K. Lindley deemed Borah the [...] "most effectively liberal voice in the Republican Party". Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' paper, Der Angriff, asserted, [...] "American life loses a personality valued by friend or foe on account of his courage, honesty, and decent method of fighting." [...] Borah's old classmate, Kansas editor William Allen White, called him [...] "a righteous man who was wise and unafraid, who followed his star, never lowered his flag, and never lost his self-respect... an honest man who dedicated his talents to his country's good". Columnist Raymond Clapper mourned, [...] "there are no fighters on the progressive side —no men like T.R.... Borah was the last".|$|E
500|$|Partly {{due to the}} melodic and {{structural}} intricacies involved in this accumulation and {{partly due to the}} composer's nature, Tchaikovsky's music became intensely expressive. This intensity was entirely new to Russian music and prompted some Russians to place Tchaikovsky's name alongside that of Dostoyevsky. German musicologist Hermann Kretzschmar credits Tchaikovsky in his later symphonies with offering [...] "full images of life, developed freely, sometimes even dramatically, around psychological contrasts ... This music has the mark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truly</b> lived and felt experience." [...] Botstein, in elaborating on this comment, suggests that listening to Tchaikovsky's music [...] "became a psychological mirror connected to everyday experience, one that reflected on the dynamic nature of the listener’s own emotional self." [...] This active engagement with the music [...] "opened for the listener a vista of emotional and psychological tension and an extremity of feeling that possessed relevance because it seemed reminiscent of one’s own 'truly lived and felt experience' or one’s search for intensity in a deeply personal sense." ...|$|E
