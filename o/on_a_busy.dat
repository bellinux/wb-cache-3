5|$|The memorial's {{location}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> {{street corner}} has {{caused it to}} deteriorate, resulting {{in at least two}} recent clean-up and restoration projects. The first involved a clean-up of the granite base, while the second involved more extensive restoration, and was completed in April, 2007 at a cost of $90,000.|$|E
5|$|Patient Zero (Clarence Williams III) {{tries to}} hail a taxi <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> street, but is {{continually}} ignored. He is eventually {{picked up by}} Gerome Knox (Ricky Harris), but suffers a seizure {{in the back of}} the taxi, raving about a threat against his life. Knox takes him to hospital, where he is diagnosed as a drug addict. Zero is sedated, but becomes agitated when two men enter the hospital lobby; Knox helps him escape, believing his life is in danger. The two men, Wright and Patterson, quarantine the area, as Zero is carrying a highly contagious disease.|$|E

He is getting {{married to the}} daughter {{of one of the}} richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington (Haviland Morris) is a selfish woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in the well-being of her fiancé. Loudon, on the other hand, has a number of duties entrusted to him by his boss (and future father-in-law), Mr. Worthington (John McMartin). First he has to pick up a cougar for an exotic animal activist named Montgomery Bell (John Mills), then to pick up Nikki, and lastly he has to make sure that Nikki catches the next bus to her hometown of Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|During a 1910s {{excavation}} for a sewer pipe, {{stones were}} unearthed that were suspected {{to be from}} the old van der Donck estate. During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers. Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person, and owing to the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year. By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> day. However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard could use the field.|$|E

50|$|The company {{operating}} {{the service is}} called Home Ride of Virginia, Inc. and is based in Blacksburg, Virginia. The company does not own its own vehicles, but instead contracts for charter service each weekend. This allows it to vary the level of service; for example, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> low-demand weekend, a single bus might start at Radford, then stop at Virginia Tech and JMU {{on its way to}} Northern Virginia, while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busier</b> weekend each route might receive its own vehicle and get direct service to its destination.|$|R

25|$|Road steam {{disappeared}} through {{restrictions and}} charges that drove up their operating costs. Through 1921, steam tractors had demonstrated clear economic advantages over horse power for heavy hauling and short journeys. However, petrol lorries {{were starting to}} show better efficiency and could be purchased cheaply as war surplus; <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> route a 3-ton petrol lorry could save about £100 per month compared to its steam equivalent, in spite of restrictive speed limits, and relatively high fuel prices and maintenance costs.|$|E

In a season in which he competed {{at the highest level}} {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, he added the German and European XC titles to his collection. In 1990, he joined Yeti Cycles' factory MTB team and the 7-11 road team, embarking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> program of events in Europe and the U.S. To facilitate his road racing career, Tomac based himself in Belgium, and regularly traveled between the two continents to compete in major road and mountain events. Although he failed to win any of the three individual NORBA series, he won the overall NORBA title for the third year in succession.|$|E

25|$|While {{the concept}} has been {{suggested}} {{in a number of}} cases, the only example in the world of a drop lock that has actually been constructed is at Dalmuir on the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland. This lock, of the single chamber type, was incorporated during the restoration of the canal, to allow the replacement of a swing bridge (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> A road) by a fixed bridge, and so answer criticisms that the restoration of the canal would cause frequent interruptions of the heavy road traffic. It can be emptied by pumping – but as this uses a lot of electricity the method used when water supplies are adequate is to drain the lock to a nearby burn. A series of pictures showing the operation of the lock can be seen here.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after the attack on Mody, another Indian was beaten into a coma; this time <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> street corner in Jersey City Heights. The victim, Kaushal Saran, was found {{unconscious}} at Central and Ferry Avenues, near a city park and firehouse, according to police reports. Saran, a licensed physician in India who was awaiting licensing in the United States, was discharged later from University Hospital in Newark. The unprovoked attack left Saran in a partial coma for over a week with severe damage to his skull and brain. In September 1992, Thomas Kozak, Martin Ricciardi, and Mark Evangelista were brought to trial on federal civil rights charges in connection with the attack on Saran. However, the three were acquitted of the charges in two separate trials in 1993. Saran testified at both trials that he could not remember the incident.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Letterkenny {{represented}} Ireland in the Entente Florale, having scooped Gold in the Large Urban Centre {{category of}} the 2007 National Tidy Town Awards. Locally there was a minor furore as all flags of competing nations were displayed in prominent areas of the town, with some difficulty encountered when locals discovered the controversial Union Jack flag hanging from a pole adjacent {{to the library and}} Paddy Delap's newsagent. The flag is still upsetting to many people angered by continuing British rule in Northern Ireland and as such led to an intensely heated debate on local radio station Highland Radio on the day the judges were in town. The flag was first mounted the previous day (7 August) and had to be taken down when some concerns were raised about its safety <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> Thursday night. It was remounted the following day. Nevertheless the town won gold in the competition.|$|E

25|$|The {{car bomb}} detonated at {{approximately}} 8:30a.m. local time on 7 July 2008. The Indian embassy, {{which is in}} the center of Kabul, is located {{across the street from the}} office of the Interior Ministry of the Government of Afghanistan and is close to several other government buildings. The bombing occurred <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy,</b> tree-lined street where people usually line up at the embassy gates to apply for visas to India. An explosive-packed Toyota Camry, driven by the suicide bomber, rammed into two Indian diplomatic vehicles entering the embassy and detonated. The gates to the embassy were blown off and the walls of some buildings in its compound were damaged. A plume of smoke and dust was seen rising from the center of Kabul city, and the explosion was heard several miles away. Several nearby shopkeepers also became immediate victims of the attack, and the nearby Indonesian embassy also suffered damage. Kabul Police immediately sealed off the area.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the crimes}} {{believed}} to have been associated with gang activity was a deadly shooting in May 2003, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>busy</b> street, which may have been in retaliation for a driver having backed his bus into a rival; as revenge, two buses were set on fire in 2004. There was a fatal stabbing in October 2003, as well as another, unrelated stabbing in 2004. In January 2004, the boyfriend of a bus worker was lethally shot {{in what appeared to be}} a bus feud, and in March 2004, a Chinatown bus operator was killed in another fatal shooting. In a June 2004 incident tied to criminal gangs, two people—a Chinatown bus driver and a bystander—were murdered in a bar in Flushing, Queens, and another was shot in the leg. The accused shooter was arrested in Toronto in 2011 and extradited to the United States. After the 2004 shootings, the New York City Police Department started enforcing Chinatown bus rules more strictly.|$|E
