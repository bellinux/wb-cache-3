25|$|Relocation of {{the branch}} line to {{facilitate}} {{the construction of the}} Seaview Road <b>overbridge.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s {{additional}} lifts for {{the mobility}} impaired were added from the District line platforms {{to a new}} <b>overbridge</b> which {{was connected to the}} high level walkway which joins the two station entrances.|$|E
25|$|North-west of {{the station}} {{building}} is a steel-framed pedestrian <b>overbridge</b> and a luggage lift, both replacements for the original items, which are not of cultural heritage significance. North-west of the luggage lift is a 2005 stone cairn memorial to {{the building of the}} Kuranda Range Railway. A series of large garden beds continue along the platform to the north-west. An old steel telephone pole is located near the <b>overbridge,</b> on the town side. The former station master's residence is located north-west {{of the station}} platform, {{on the west side of}} the line. It is a timber building, clad in chamferboard with enclosed front and side verandahs and a hipped metal roof. A railway turntable is located further north-west.|$|E
50|$|The {{section of}} {{line between the}} Birmingham New Road and Sedgley Road West <b>overbridges</b> on the Coseley-Tipton border was {{developed}} as a residential street called Oxford Way in 2002, after more than 20 years of plans for housing development on the site. The <b>overbridges</b> were demolished a year earlier.|$|R
50|$|One of Appleby’s few {{claims to}} fame {{is that it}} was located beside one of only two road <b>overbridges</b> on the entire Nelson Section which carried State Highway 60 over the railway line. These <b>overbridges</b> were built {{at the behest of the}} Highways Board, NZR, and the local council to improve the safety of traffic {{accident}} blackspots.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Overbridges</b> (tend to be unpopular with {{pedestrians}} and cyclists due {{to additional}} distance and effort) ...|$|R
25|$|Central Trains {{undertook}} internal modifications and refurbishment to {{the ticket}} office and booking hall {{towards the end of}} their franchise. Network Rail also invested £500,000 on refurbishment of the station building, modern lighting, <b>overbridge</b> and foot crossing to further update the station in late 2007.|$|E
25|$|Parts of the A21 {{follow the}} {{historic}} turnpike roads: {{for example the}} section from Sevenoaks to Tunbridge Wells, opened in 1710; other sections of the road were similarly dealt with later in the century. It is also {{the location of the}} first wildlife <b>overbridge</b> in the United Kingdom, near Lamberhurst.|$|E
25|$|Kaiwharawhara Station {{was closed}} {{suddenly}} in June 2013 {{as it was}} discovered how badly corroded the <b>overbridge</b> was. In November 2013, the GWRC voted to close it permanently as on health and safety grounds, it was too expensive and nearly impossible to upgrade the station to provide step free access via ramps for disabled passengers.|$|E
25|$|Road <b>overbridges</b> for Park Road and Seaview Road, both {{of which}} were {{expected}} to become arterial thoroughfares.|$|R
5000|$|On this section, {{all of the}} <b>overbridges</b> are intact, some {{of which}} still contain relics from their railway {{heritage}} ...|$|R
50|$|The {{electrification}} of the Herlasgrün-Plauen section {{took place}} between February and December 2012. This included the renewal of three road <b>overbridges.</b>|$|R
25|$|Serving {{the local}} villages of Quorn and Woodhouse, this station is built to the {{standards}} of Great Central, with an island platform and an <b>overbridge.</b> The station details were intended to make it reflect World War II and the remainder of the 1940s. This has allowed for several World War reenactments to be played out in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Traffic in {{the city}} of narrow lanes was growing by the day. Even though {{officials}} constructed an underbridge at Venkatraopet railway gate and a railway <b>overbridge</b> at old bus stand besides the foot bridge at Powerpet was replaced by another bridge but the traffic has also doubled, without giving any relief to citizens. There are 93 traffic centres identified {{in the city}}.|$|E
25|$|A new flyover {{just south}} of Joan Croft level {{crossing}} in South Yorkshire to allow freight trains from Immingham to pass over the line {{on their way to}} Eggborough and Drax power stations, was completed in very early 2014. The project, known as the North Doncaster Chord, also replaced the level crossing on a minor road with a new <b>overbridge</b> just {{to the north of the}} original crossing point.|$|E
5000|$|Three were NWNGR road <b>overbridges</b> {{requiring}} significant {{lowering of}} the trackbed (including two under the A4085 at Betws Garmon and Castell Cidwm).|$|R
5000|$|At 20 July 2013 {{the track}} between Oxcroft and Creswell had been lifted {{and piles of}} {{concrete}} sleepers had been placed beneath <b>overbridges</b> in Clowne and Woodthorpe Road (between Shuttlewood and Mastin Moor) to deter wheeled access. Structures such as <b>overbridges</b> had clearly been maintained. In 2016, the line was purchased from Network Rail by Derbyshire County Council and is planned for future development into a Greenway for walkers, cyclists and Horse Riders. It is currently kept clear and accessible by a network of local volunteers.|$|R
50|$|LGVs are fenced {{to prevent}} {{trespassing}} by animals and people. Level crossings {{are not permitted}} and <b>overbridges</b> have sensors to detect objects that fall onto the track.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, the Rotorua District Council {{demolished}} {{the former}} Lake Road <b>overbridge</b> at Koutu to enable a new four lane road {{to be built}} across the railway line at this locality. The new four lane road required {{the removal of the}} track on the northern and southern sides of the road, which now separates the former Koutu freight yard from the main line. KiwiRail still own the rail corridor across the road.|$|E
25|$|The {{suburb of}} Roslyn lies atop a crest which forms {{part of the}} inner ring of hills around Dunedin. Excellent views {{of the inner city}} can be gained from the Roslyn <b>overbridge,</b> which is 1,500 metres {{northwest}} of the city centre, and 150 metres above sea level. Several of the city's most prestigious schools are located close to this suburb and its northern neighbour, Maori Hill. Its southwestern end merges imperceptibly into Belleknowes. Roslyn's 2001 population was 3,957.|$|E
25|$|Corris Station and the {{original}} Machynlleth Station had overall roofs, features which were rare on a British narrow gauge railway. At Corris, the roof was over the main running line and trains for Aberllefenni passed under it; at Machynlleth {{the rear of the}} train rested under the station roof while the front was in the open air. The original Machynlleth station was demolished and replaced in 1905 with the building that still stands alongside the A487 trunk road north of the main-line railway <b>overbridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{embankment}} then {{gives way}} to a cutting as the land rises north-westwards. The route continues beneath <b>overbridges</b> carrying Mount Pleasant Villas, Mount View Road, and Crouch Hill.|$|R
50|$|Some {{official}} railway timetables {{described the}} station as Northenden for Wythenshawe because the station lay between and served the two districts. It was situated between the road <b>overbridges</b> at Sharston Road and Longley Lane.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} an island {{platform}} between two tracks, linked by pedestrian <b>overbridges</b> to Bathurst Street and Maadi Place in the south, and pedestrian level crossings to Marion Street and Somme Road in the north.|$|R
25|$|The main {{entrance}} to the station is on London Road. The ticket office and travel centre {{are located in the}} concourse; the lost property office and lockers were formerly located here also although East Midlands Trains took these facilities away in 2009 citing cost and the recession. This concourse gives access to the main station <b>overbridge</b> to all platforms, and via a corridor to the lifts. There is a footbridge at the northern end of the station giving access to the long-stay car park and Campbell Street.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} stations {{to be built in}} Australia using standard precast concrete units, Kuranda is the second oldest remaining example of its type in Queensland. Two earlier examples at Northgate (1911–12) and Chelmer (1913) in Brisbane have both been demolished, while another example opened at Ascot (Eagle Farm Racecourse) in February 1914 survives. A luggage lift from the <b>overbridge</b> to the platform, installed in 1915, was demolished after 1939, but a new lift with a shed at its base has been built since 1994.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{a project}} to {{regenerate}} Bletchley as a whole, Milton Keynes Council has proposed {{the creation of a}} new eastern pedestrian access to the station by extending the existing platform <b>overbridge</b> across the tracks to reach Saxon Street. The proposed eastern entrance is to open out into a new station square and a transport interchange where an at-grade pedestrian crossing across Saxon Street would give access to the town centre and bus station. In the longer term it is planned to construct an underground concourse to link the eastern and western station entrances.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the bridges}} which carried the railway {{have been taken}} down, {{including}} the substantial Cruden Bay viaduct, although three pillars of it remain standing. One large bridge remains, spanning the Water of Cruden at Bridgend. Numerous culverts are remaining, possibly five or more are over small burns between Pitlurg and Hatton, one is over the Water of Cruden at Nethermill, one is over the smaller burn at Cruden Bay, and another, which can be walked through, is at Bullers o' Buchan. A number of well built bridge buttresses are still standing for the railway and for <b>overbridges.</b> The photo has one of many similar looking <b>overbridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rewari {{is a major}} {{transit station}} for freight traffic from Bombay, Kandla and other ports in western India towards Delhi and {{northern}} states of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu-Kashmir. As the railway tracks from Kandla, Pipavav, Mundra and other ports in Saurashtra to Ahmedabad and Palanpur and then to Rewari via Ringas are not electrified, freight trains (goods trains) with containers double-stacked ply on this route to Rewari junction and then take the containers further north from Rewari. Infringements like low road <b>overbridges</b> and foot <b>overbridges</b> that fouled with double-stacked containers were either dismantled or raised in years 2004-06 for running these freight trains.|$|R
50|$|Signs of the four-track upgrade {{can still}} be seen from {{immediately}} north of the tunnel {{to the area of}} Hasbergen in the shape of widened embankments and track <b>overbridges.</b> Here the expansion of the line was relatively well advanced.|$|R
25|$|The Geyserland Express railcar service {{initially}} terminated in the Koutu {{freight yard}} until a small temporary passenger station {{operated by the}} Second Chance Train Trust opened on the northern side of the Lake Road <b>overbridge</b> in 1995. The new passenger station at Koutu was intended as temporary measure until the line could be relaid to a proposed new passenger station in the central city {{on the corner of}} Ranolf and Amohau Streets, which was being pursued by the Second Chance Train Trust and the Rotorua District Council. The new station never eventuated.|$|E
25|$|Hijli {{railway station}} {{as a result}} of this wall. The local {{community}} opposed the construction of a flyover from the railway station to the campus formerly, under the pretext that it would lead to substantial losses of opportunity for the shops along the roads. After the flyover construction had been completed and became operational, things ensued in a manner as the local community had anticipated, but the flyover has resulted in more convenience for transport. The construction of the 1052.69m long flyover was approved by the Indian Railways and West Bengal state government. It's called Hijli Road <b>overbridge,</b> and was constructed for estimated cost of Rs.237million ($5.3million).|$|E
25|$|Lofthouse Interchange {{was built}} between 1965 and 1967. Owen Williams and the Babtie Group were the engineers. Located where the M62 crosses above the M1 motorway, it {{is a complex}} three-level {{junction}} with eight bridges including a roundabout supported by four long curved bridges on 12-metre piers above both motorways. The roundabout's north and south bridges have spans of 28 metres and {{the east and west}} have spans of 21 metres. The M62 <b>overbridge</b> has a reinforced concrete multi-cellular deck of four spans. Two other pre-stressed reinforced concrete bridges carry slip roads over Longthorpe Lane, the B6135. Another bridge with no motorway access carries Longthorpe Lane over the M1.|$|E
50|$|The station {{site was}} {{developed}} in 2001/02 with new housing, which made use {{of most of the}} track bed been Sedgley Road West and Birmingham New Road. The <b>overbridges</b> at both ends of this section of the railway were demolished at this time.|$|R
50|$|A mobile {{speed camera}} is speed limit {{enforcement}} device {{used in the}} United Kingdom {{to refer to a}} road vehicle fitted with speed camera equipment which can park {{at the side of the}} road, or on <b>overbridges</b> to monitor the speed of passing traffic.|$|R
50|$|Originally planned as a trenched {{motorway}} with <b>overbridges,</b> it {{was subsequently}} {{designed as a}} ground-level road with traffic lights. This has resulted in complaints from pedestrian and cyclist traffic about crossing the bypass. Other objections related {{to the need to}} shift or demolish heritage buildings.|$|R
