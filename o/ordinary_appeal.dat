25|$|At {{times when}} a death {{sentence}} is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, {{the first step in}} collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state. Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review. Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an <b>ordinary</b> <b>appeal.</b> State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.|$|E

5000|$|Amovibility {{contrasts}} with arbitrary removal, which the Catholic Church has always condemned. It {{is opposed to}} the perpetual tenure of those benefices, for removal from which the canons require a cause expressly named in law and a formal canonical process or trial.

A removable rector is, therefore, one who may be removed without cause expressed in law, but not without a just cause; one who may be removed without canonical process, but not without certain prescribed formalities, which are really judicial, though [...] "extra-judicial" [...] as regards the canons. Since, however, removable ecclesiastics have no strict and perpetual right to their offices, any revocation made by the superior ad nutum is valid, though it might be gravely illicit and reversible. In such cases recourse may be had to a superior authority, although an <b>ordinary</b> <b>appeal</b> in the strict sense is barred.|$|E

5000|$|Appeal to the Court of Cassation is only {{possible}} against judgements against which no <b>ordinary</b> <b>appeal</b> is possible anymore. This {{will happen when}} all normal appeal procedures have been followed, usually before the Courts of Appeal or the Courts of Labour. The Court of Cassation can only confirm these judgements, or annul them ("cassation", from the French [...] "casser", to break). It can not examine the case and make a new judgement. The court can annul the entire judgement, or just part of it (D: gedeeltelijke cassatie, F: cassation partielle). If the court annuls a judgement, the case is remitted to a court {{at the same level}} as the one which judgement was overturned. The decision of the Court of Cassation is not (yet) binding, however (article 6 of the Judiciary Code Gerechtelijk Wetboek). The new court may decide the case as it pleases (but the decision of the Court of Cassation has a persuasive value). The decision of the new court may again be appealed to the Court of Cassation.

40|$|Remonstrance Proceedings The {{thesis is}} focused on the remonstrance and the {{following}} special administrative proceedings. The remosntrance represents an <b>ordinary</b> <b>appeal,</b> which can be used to challenge the first instance decision that has not already become enforceable and has been issued by the central administrative office, by the minister or by the director of other central administrative office eventually by the state secretary. Whereas there is no existence of the superior administrative authoritites in the organizational structure of the state administration, the same body that issued challenged decision decides on it. It is obvious, that appeal procedure contains a lot of variances and peculiarities, which the thesis points out, compared to the appeal procedure. The remostrance is limited to one paragraph and its five sections by the valid and effective legislation of the Administrative Code. The more this relatively brief provision often remains unkonwn to the general public, the more attention it attracts among the experts. The thesis aims to give a comprehensive explanation of the remonstrance and its proceedings and subsequent evaluation of the effectiveness of the applicable legislation and to suggest own creative solution of the examined subject.

5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's <b>ordinary</b> state <b>appeal</b> rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of {{the hair on the}} lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that the}} various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|R

40|$|When someone {{believes}} {{something that}} is justified for her, what part does the subject play in her state of being justified? I will answer this question by developing a strong internalist account of justification according to which the justification of a believing for a subject consists in her having grounds for her belief, and holding the belief in recognition of those grounds. But the internalist theory I defend incorporates key elements of reliabilism into its account. Using perception {{as a model for}} justification, I show how <b>ordinary</b> perceivers would <b>appeal</b> to external factors to support their perceptual beliefs, and normally suppose that their beliefs are reliably connected to the objects their beliefs are about. I find in this feature of our common justificatory practice a sufficient basis for positing an externalist condition on justification—namely that subjects are justified only if their beliefs are reliably connected to their objects...|$|R

2500|$|Event-causal {{accounts}} of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like {{those of the}} compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events {{are said to be}} caused by the agent.

The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. <b>Ordinary</b> randomness is <b>appealed</b> to as supplying the [...] "elbow room" [...] that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination).
