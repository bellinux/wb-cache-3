40|$|Abstract: This study aims at {{assessing}} nutritional {{and health}} quality {{aspects of a}} group of popular weightreducing diets in Jordan. Twenty two popular weight-reducing diets were collected from dieters and their essential nutrients were analyzed using Food Processor SQL software (2008). Dietary reference intakes were used as reference values for nutritional assessment. Characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> were compared with <b>the</b> criteria <b>of</b> healthy weight-reducing <b>diets.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that the daily energy contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> ranged between 352 - 1632 Kcal/day, with an average value of 985 ± 77. 6 Kcal/day. <b>The</b> percentages <b>of</b> <b>diets</b> provided <b>the</b> AMDR <b>of</b> carbohydrate, protein and fat, were 36, 82 and 73 %, respectively; none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> did meet all the AMDR values collectively. Fourteen percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> contained <b>the</b> AMDR <b>of</b> dietary fibers, while 50 % contained cholesterol more than 300 mg/day. <b>The</b> <b>diet</b> coverages <b>of</b> DRIs ranged from 5 - 50 % and from 5 - 77 % for minerals and vitamins, respectively. Half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> contained one or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criteria <b>of</b> unhealthy faulty weight-reducing diets. Furthermore, only 3 diets encouraged dieters to practice physical activity, whereas only two instructed <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> healthy eating behaviors. In conclusion, that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tested popular <b>diets</b> in Jordan were imbalanced with respect to macronutrient contribution in daily energy intake, insufficient in one or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essential micronutrients and contradicted with <b>the</b> criteria <b>of</b> healthy weight-reducing diets.

40|$|Background: Results {{of prior}} studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> {{viscosity}} reduction of high-energy-density, starch-containing diets on young children’s energy intakes are inconsistent, possibly because <b>of</b> dif-ferences in <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unmodified <b>diets</b> with which <b>the</b> low-viscosity <b>diets</b> were compared. Objective: Our {{objective was to}} determine <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> dietary viscosity and energy density on total daily energy consumption by young, non-breast-fed children. Design: We measured <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> food consumed and <b>the</b> dura-tion <b>of</b> meals during 3 substudies, in each of which 3 study diets were offered for 4 consecutive days each in random sequence: high energy density, high viscosity (HD-HV); high energy density, low viscosity (HD-LV); and low energy density, low viscosity (LD-LV). The viscosity and energy density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unmodified starch-containing HD-HV diet were varied across substudies to deter-mine whether <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> amylase liquefaction was related to <b>the</b> initial characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HD-HV <b>diet.</b> <b>The</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HV <b>diets</b> ranged from 79000 to 568000 mPa · s; energy density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HD <b>diets</b> ranged from < 4. 18 to 4. 93 kJ (1. 00 – 1. 18 kcal) /g. Vis-cosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LV <b>diets</b> was < 3000 mPa · s and <b>the</b> energy density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LD <b>diets</b> was < 2. 47 kJ (0. 6 kcal) /g. Results: In each substudy, children consumed more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LD-LV <b>diet</b> (g · kg body wt 21 · d 21) than <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>diets</b> and more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HD-LV <b>diet</b> than <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HD-HV <b>diet</b> (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract: An initial {{investigation}} into <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> high protein distillers dried grain with solubles (HPDDG) in juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss diets was conducted during a 36 -day feeding trial. Four experimental diets containing either 10 % or 20 % HPDDG with supplemental amino acids, and either {{with or without}} phytase, were compared to a fish-meal-based, non-HPDDG, diet. There {{was no significant difference}} among any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> in total weight gain, percent weight gain, feed conversion ratio, or percent mortality. There was also no significant difference in length, weight, condition factor, hepatosomatic index, viscerosomatic index, or any fish health parameter in fishes fed any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets.</b> Fillet composition, as determined by crude protein, crude lipid, water, and ash were also not significantly different from fish reared on any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets.</b> Estimated protein digestibility coefficients were significantly less in the fish receiving <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> void <b>of</b> HPDDG compared to any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>diets.</b> <b>The</b> addition <b>of</b> phytase had no effect on any rearing parameters.

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} the multiple dimensions and benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet</b> as a sustainable diet, {{in order to}} revitalize this intangible food heritage at the country level; {{and to develop a}} multidimensional framework – <b>the</b> Med <b>Diet</b> 4. 0 – in which four sustainability benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet</b> are presented in parallel: major health and nutrition benefits, low environmental impacts and richness in biodiversity, high sociocultural food values, and positive local economic returns. Design: A narrative review was applied at the country level to highlight the multiple sustainable benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet</b> into a single multidimensional framework: <b>the</b> Med <b>Diet</b> 4. 0. Setting/subjects: We included studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals that contained data on <b>the</b> characterization <b>of</b> sustainable <b>diets</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>diet.</b> <b>The</b> methodological framework approach was finalized through a series of meetings, workshops and conferences where the framework was presented, discussed and ultimately refined.

Approximately 2. 0 mg fluoride of this total intake is derived from <b>the</b> <b>diet,</b> whereas fluoridated drinking water accounts for the remainder (2). The total fluoride intake per day depends on <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> water consumed and on <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> water fluoridation in a given area. The present communication reports on the dietary fluoride content in several areas in the United States. Materials and methods Diets that were normal in composition and were calorically adequate. containing from 2, 400 to 2, 600 kcal/day, were obtained for fluoride analysis from hospitals in 16 different cities in the United States. Samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drinking water were also obtained from these same areas. All diets and all water samples were collected in specially acid-washed plastic containers and were sent packed in Dry Ice to the Metabolic Research Laboratory. Twelve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixteen <b>diets</b> were obtained from areas where the drinking water was fluoridated, and four diets were obtained from cities where the drinking water was not fluoridated. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diets</b> were collected as separate, individual meals, namely, as breakfast, lunch, and supper, although in some cases the food items which made up <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> for an entire day were obtained. <b>The</b> composition <b>of</b> each individual meal and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total <b>diet</b> was recorded and <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> each food item or <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total <b>diet</b> pen day was determined. <b>The</b> fluoride content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual meals, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total <b>diets,</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drinking water was analyzed by an adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> fluoride analysis of Singer and Armstrong (5).

5|$|Bee-eaters {{consume a}} wide range of insects; beyond a few distasteful {{butterflies}} they consume almost any insect from tiny Drosophila flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, mayflies, stoneflies, cicadas, termites, crickets and grasshoppers, mantises, true flies and moths. For many species the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely wasps and bees. In a survey of 20 studies the proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diet</b> made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these honeybees can comprise a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diet,</b> as much as 89% of the overall intake. The preference for bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The giant honeybee is a particularly commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably couldn't fit down its throat.|$|E
5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice.

In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item.
