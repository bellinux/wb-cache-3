5|$|Roosevelt's {{expedition}} reached Mongalla {{at the end}} of February, {{coming from}} the Belgian Congo via the Lado Enclave. He was impressed by the Egyptian and Sudanese troops, but when visiting a native dance he commented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> middle-aged men, a result of the Mahdist wars that had ended over ten years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} scholar Yōichi Katagiri concluded, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> surviving evidence, that, {{while it}} is possible that Narihira and Ono no Komachi knew each other and were lovers, there was no usable evidence to say conclusively either way.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's murder {{received}} {{considerable attention}} in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. The {{media coverage of the}} murder has been cited as an example of blaming the victim. Leigh's murder inspired a theatrical play entitled A Property of the Clan, which was later revised and renamed Blackrock, as well as a feature film of the same name.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church at {{the time}} faced {{difficulty}} retaining converts. Some Javanese, who had converted as students, returned to Islam after reentering society and facing social ostracism. In a 1935 meeting with other Jesuits, Soegijapranata blamed the problem <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a united Catholic identity, or sensus Catholicus, as well as few intermarriages between native Catholics. Soegijapranata opposed marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics. He counselled young Catholic couples before marriage, believing that these unions helped unite the Catholic families in the city, and continued to write for Swaratama, again serving as its editor in chief. In 1938, he was chosen to advise the Society of Jesus, coordinating Jesuit work in the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Benfica started November by hosting Beira-Mar on the 2nd in the {{official}} opening of their new stadium. Beira-Mar won 2–1, inflicting Benfica's second league defeat, which opened an 11-point gap to Porto. Camacho blamed the defeat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> goal opportunities. Four days later, Benfica received Molde for the UEFA Cup, beating them 3–1 and assuring a two-goal lead for the second leg. Camacho recognized the team was struggling to defend against corner-kicks, as both Beira-Mar and Molde had scored in corners. On 9 November, the team visited Alverca and won three-nil, with two goals from Tiago and one from Geovanni. Camacho {{was pleased with the}} performance, but said that Benfica should have scored more. On 12 November, Benfica played Marítimo, in a fixture transferred from October. Weakened by injuries in some of the regular players, Benfica could not do better than a one-all draw. Camacho attributed the result to the excessive number of games in short amount of time, something most of the players were not accustomed to. After a 10-day international break, Benfica opened the Portuguese Cup campaign against Estrela da Amadora on the 22nd. They won 3–1 with all of the goals arriving late in the game. Benfica closed the month with a 2–0 win to Molde, on the second leg of the UEFA Cup, with Tiago again scoring twice.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{communication with}} ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning {{changes in the}} ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that {{attracted the attention of}} the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, {{according to a report in}} Chicago Magazine.|$|E

5|$|The embryos {{probably}} represented near-hatchlings. While {{the skeletal}} features {{were similar to}} those of the adults, the body proportions were very dissimilar. The head was big with a short snout and very large orbits, whose diameter amounts 39% of the entire skull length. The neck was short, contrasting to the very long neck in the adults. Girdle bones and caudals were relatively tiny. The forelimbs were of equal length to the hindlimbs, indicating that newly hatched Massospondylus were quadrupedal, unlike the bipedal adults. The discovery of hatching footprints with manus impressions confirmed their quadrupedality. These impressions show that the hand was not pronated, with palm faces facing each other and the thumb facing forwards. The unpronated manus and the big head indicate that an effective locomotion was not possible for newly hatched Massospondylus. Notably, the near-hatchings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> teeth and the ineffective locomotion, scientists speculate that postnatal care might have been necessary. This is further supported by evidence that the hatchings remained at the nest sites until they had doubled in size.|$|E
5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> children {{in the community and}} states that he recognizes some of the faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims {{to be able to give}} her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E

25|$|The United States (under former President George W. Bush) and Australia (initially, under former Prime Minister John Howard) did not {{ratify the}} Kyoto treaty.

Australia, under former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, has since ratified the treaty, which took effect in March 2008.|$|E

Borré experienced this many times among many different members of the group and they all attributed their sickness to the lack of Inuit food.|$|E

25|$|There were {{additional}} {{concerns about}} the viability of a team based in South Australia, primarily based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a suitable stadium with lights {{to be able to}} play night games.

25|$|Critical {{response}} to the MCU's music has been mixed-to-negative, with focus placed on a lack of memorable, identifiable themes that are comparable to other large media franchises, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> continuity between works.
