This study {{was conducted on the}} partnership and value co-creation initiatives implemented by two OSCAs in the rice value chain in Luwero and Bugiri districts, Uganda. The methodology used involved use of semi structured interviews and check lists for focus group discussions as well as key informant interviews. Eight focus group interviews were conducted, with an average attendance of six members per group (48 members) in Bugiri and 48 members in Luwero district. Interviews were also conducted for 44 key informants. A total of 140 respondents were interviewed both in the focus group discussions and as key informants. The information was analyzed with NVIVO software. Findings indicate that partnership construction and value co-creation occurred in the OSCA value chains, but have not yet reached the ideal status, although they have advanced through the stages of development. There is an increased number of actors with vast interests interacting with the OSCAs for value co-creation. However, the cooperative co-creation of value along the chain requires a focus on achieving all actor value propositions as well as optimal outcomes for all. The study, therefore, recommends that in the process of constructing partnerships and co-creation, it is necessary to be aware of differences in each actor’s views, motivations, and ways of working. This will lead to complementing each other through realizing and accepting differences to make the partnerships work.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Rwanda, {{women who}} {{self-reported}} in household surveys ever experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) increased from 34 % in 2005 to 56 % in 2010. This {{coincided with a}} new constitution and majority-female elected parliament in 2003, and 2008 legislation protecting against gender-based violence. The increase in self-reported IPV may reflect improved social power for women, and/or disruptions to traditional gender roles that increased actual IPV. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of IPV in 4338 couples interviewed in the 2005 and 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Surveys (RDHSs). Factors associated with physical or sexual IPV in the last 12 months were modeled using manual backward stepwise logistic regression. Analyses were conducted in Stata v 13 adjusting for complex survey design. RESULTS: Risk factors for IPV in 2005 (p?<? 0. 05) were: experiencing emotional IPV (OR?=? 18. 1), beating husband/partner unprovoked (OR?=? 12. 3), witnessing IPV against mother (OR?=? 1. 82), husband/partner consumes alcohol often (OR?=? 3. 13), and polygynous marriage (OR?=? 1. 51), whereas having a husband/partner with secondary education (OR?=? 0. 43) was protective. Factors associated with increased IPV in 2010 (p?<? 0. 05) were husband/partner (OR?=? 1. 30) or woman (OR?=? 1. 36) believes IPV is justified, husband/partner has sex with non-marital partners (OR?=? 2. 52), bottom wealth quintile (OR?=? 1. 25), polygynous marriage (OR?=? 2. 29), having a son (OR?=? 2. 05) or only daughters (OR?=? 2. 58) versus no children, and having a husband/partner employed with in-kind versus cash compensation (OR?=? 1. 58). In 2010, woman being involved with her own health (OR?=? 0. 79) or earnings (OR?=? 0. 57) decision-making was protective against IPV. Several variables were not available in the 2010 RDHS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may provide evidence of both increased self-reporting of IPV and social power disruption. Rwanda's Isange <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Center</b> project, with medical, legal, and psychosocial services for domestic violence victims, is currently scaling to all 44 district hospitals, and police station gender desks reduce barriers to legal reporting of IPV.

40|$|The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) is federal {{legislation}} that significantly changed the federal government's approach to funding, overseeing, and providing workforce development services. The Act replaced its predecessor, the Job Training Partnership Act(JTPA), and brought together once separate laws governing services (Wagner-Peyser). Five goals emphasized: streamlining services through a One-Stop service delivery systemproviding universal {{access to all}} job seekers, workers and employerspromoting customer choices through use of vouchersstrengthening accountability by implementing strict performance measurespromoting leadership by the business sector on state and local Workforce Investment Board. This study is designed to review the WIA implementation {{in terms of the}} relationship of WIA programs and the federally funded employment and training program, WIA governance and funding, delivery system through One Stop centerproviding training services by vouchers, state-funded training program for incumbent workers and WIA reauthorization issues. This study presents the findings from reviewing WIA implementation and learns the lesson and develops its implications to Korea training policies. 1. Findings This study identifies 44 programs administrated by 9 federal agencies through providing a range of employment and training services. These programs service a total more than 30 million individuals and represent a combined $ 30 billion in fiscal year 2002. By WIA, the mandated 17 partner programs are provided together at One-Stop center in every area over the country. Although WIA brought together several federal programs, there is no single administrative agency in charge ofit. Instead it promotes linkage among them by reinforcing a governance structure of state and local boards. Because there are no incentives for partner organizations to contribute financially to the One-Stop center, WIA suffer a few fund with continued divestment of federal government. Local boards are required to establish at least one One-Stop center, a local point for the provision of all training and employment services and a new role under WIA. Also local boards are required to implement an Individual Training Account(ITA) system to allow customer to choose from Eligible Training Provider List(ETPL). Therefore local boards are prohibited from providing direct services, including the newly defined employment supports of core and intensive services, direct training, and one-stop operation. The Use of <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Center</b> {{is at the heart of}} WIA. Most states gives local boards flexibility on selecting the One Stop operators, and local areas usually use two different types of organizations and arrangement in the same area. Core Services are the first one of services available at <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Center.</b> Intensive services focuses on dislocated worker customer in particular and are the intermediate step between core services and training services. In an effort to provide more customer choice, WIA mandates that decisions on which training program and provider be left up to the customers for adults and dislocated worker programs. When customers are deemed appropriate for training in WIA, they are issued individual training accounts(ITAs). A customer driven system has the potential to substantially increase training choices for WIA customers. However the system had detrimental effects on the number of providers and adult receiving training. In this study the case of California State Workforce Investment Board, City of Los Angeles Local Workforce Investment Board, Sunvelley Work Source Center, Pierce Community College, Los Angeles Job Corps Center were reviewed. Almost half of states fund employment placement and training through employer taxes. After WIA allowed state and local governments to use federal funds for training employed workers, state and local workforce boards focuses their training initiatives for employed workers on training that addressed specific business needs and emphasized workplace skills. In this study the case of California Employment Training Panel(ETP) was reviewed. Initially passed in August 1998, the current law authorizes programs through September 30, 2003. Congress must decide whether to maintain or change funding requirement. Now it is likely to pass a new federal law.

The IMC is at the central importance of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and Asian monsoon that could influence directly on the Pacific and Indian oceans heat and water mass transport affecting on regional and even global climate changes. A small change in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) transmited from Pacific to Indian oceans through the current system so called Indonesian throughflow will affect the magnitude of monsoon and climate over the regions. In this critical perspective, the IMC in a whole system of earth, atmosphere, and ocean play important roles in regulating global climate changes. In this presentation, we will present all the near future programs related to monsoon that will be employed in the center, especially how intraseasonal variation interact with monsoon.

Youth re-offending involves breaking of the law and crime. Offending if repeated then develops to be re-offending which is the breaking of the law more than once and this is a dilemma in South Africa as the increase of crime is a challenging issue. A qualitative approach was utilized following an exploratory, descriptive research design as the researcher sought to understand the perspective of the managers at Nerina regarding causes of re-offending and the effectiveness of the intervention programmes aimed at addressing this phenomenon. The researcher conducted face to face interviews with the mangers at Nerina <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> Youth Justice Centre. For the purpose of this study the population was the total complement of the management staff at the <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> Youth Justice Centre, this included the personnel of the departments of Justice, Social Development, and South African Police Service who are all involved in rendering services at Nerina. The method of data collection was one on one semi structured interviews and data analysis undertaken according to the steps for qualitative data analysis as proposed by Tesch in Creswell (1994).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} pattern of sexual offence cases {{attended}} at the <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> Crisis <b>Center</b> (OSCC) of the Accident and Emergency Department, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM), Kelantan. A total of 439 reported sexual offence cases were examined {{over a period of}} 4 years from 2000 to 2003. Sexual offence constituted by male partner or boyfriend in 18. 9 %, by relatives in 27. 3 % and by “others” in 53. 8 % of cases. Only 0. 7 % of victims did not attempt to lodge a police report. There is a significant relationship between occupation and the risk of experiencing sexual violence. Students were mostly targeted by the perpetrator throughout the study period. Among the offences, rape cases were the highest in number, among those who attended at the OSCC, HUSM with a total of 72. 7 %; followed by 27. 3 % of incest; 26. 4 % of child sexual abuse; 4. 8 % of sodomy and lastly 1. 6 % of gerontophilia cases. Only 70 % of the specimens obtained from sexual offences victims were sent for laboratory analysis. The result remained negative in 82. 4 % specimens and thus the laboratory analysis result is merely functioning as a supportive evidence for sexual offence cases attended at OSCC. The studies showed that most of the sexual assault perpetrators were known to the victims. The place of crime was also known to the perpetrators. Health sectors of various levels should be working in conjunction to promote a societal changes to improve more of the women’s right and thus to reduce the violence crime...|$|R
