On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance.

5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in <b>oil</b> <b>exports.</b> In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse how <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> {{dependencies}} of Middle East and North African (MENA) oil producers have evolved over the past two decades and to identify the main driving factors from an energy policy perspective. The paper expresses the <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> dependency of each economy in terms of a multiplicative identity that captures effective export price, <b>export</b> to primary <b>oil</b> supply ratio, oil dependency and <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> intensity of the country. Using the data for 1980 - 2006, the evolution in these factors is investigated for seven MENA countries and the influence of the above factors is decomposed using the Laspeyres index. The analysis shows that energy price and increasing energy intensity in the MENA countries have influenced the overall <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> dependency. Reducing the energy intensity can improve <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> revenue share to GDP by 5 - 10 % in most of the countries while Iran can gain significantly by increasing its <b>export</b> volume. <b>Oil</b> <b>export</b> dependency MENA Decomposition analysis...|$|R

Hence, this paper compares the effects of real oil price shock on TOT in both <b>oil</b> importing and <b>exporting</b> countries, using Panel Data technique and during 1980 - 2010. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we applied the nonlinear approach in order to assess the asymmetric impact of the oil price shocks on TOT. The results show that the oil price shocks influenced the TOT in the <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> and importing countries, differently. So that, in <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries, positive (negative) oil price shocks have significantly positive (negative) effect on their TOT, while in oil importing countries, positive (negative) oil price shocks have significantly a negative (positive) effect on TOT. Furthermore, the findings reveal that in the <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries, the effect of negative oil price shocks on TOT is more than positive oil price shocks.

40|$|Interesting stylized {{models that}} discuss the {{implications}} of the oil boom or <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> price increase on an oil-rich economy must involve a tension between effects that tend to boost oil sector and harm non-oil sector and effects that vice versa tend to boost non-oil sector and harm oil sector. This paper explores such models and examines at large {{the implications of}} the <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> price increase through the prism of interaction between these two effects. This paper applies the 1 - 2 - 3 -model of Devarajan et al. (1990) and develops two stylized models that examine the effects of the world price increase and <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> price increase on the economy respectively. A central feature of the developed stylized models is that they can distinguish between the two effects generated by the <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> price increase, namely the balance-of-trade effect and the import-competing effect. The balance-of-trade effect shows the response of the economy to the <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> price increase, depending on whether the economy runs a trade surplus or a trade deficit in the benchmark equilibrium, with the import-competing effect set equal to one. It shows conditions that cause changes in the producers’ real costs and hence determines which sector grows and which sector shrinks {{in the wake of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> price increase. The import-competing effect, under the assumption that trade is balanced, shows the effect of the variation in the Armington elasticity of substitution between oil goods in the second model and non-oil goods in the third model. It shows how competition between imported and import-competing goods affects producers’ real costs and hence determines which sector grows and which sector shrinks in the wake of the <b>oil</b> <b>export</b> price increase. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{documented}} that oil price changes have nonlinear {{effects in the}} economy and in stock market returns.

While price soars seem to {{have a negative effect on}} the stock markets of oil energy dependent countries, they have a positive effect on the stock markets of <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries. Stock market returns are negatively affected by oil price volatility in energy dependent countries and positively in <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries. Moreover, we find bi-directional effects between oil price increases and some oil volatility measures that can be reinforced with volatility feedback. The asymmetric effects found in oil dependent and <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries seem to fit into the offset mechanism proposed in the literature where oil price shocks interact both with oil price volatility and the economy. The results are also consistent with the finding that <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries benefit economically from oil price hikes...|$|R

Using a new dataset including a large {{cross section of}} <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries, we show with a panel cointegration analysis that import demand in these countries depends positively on domestic demand and exports, the real exchange rate {{and the price of}} oil. Fiscal surpluses, on the other hand, tend to reduce the demand for imports. More specifically, our import elasticities estimated for <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries are not far from estimates found in the literature on industrial countries. In particular, we conclude that the import elasticity with respect to domestic activity is larger than one – a finding which is in contrast to standard theoretical predictions but in line with most empirical findings for other countries. These results are robust over a wide set of alternative specifications. JEL Classification: F 14, F 01, Q 43 Import Equation, <b>oil</b> <b>exporting</b> countries, Panel Cointegration...|$|R
