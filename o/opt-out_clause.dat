5|$|In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was {{concluded}} between the British Government {{and representatives of}} the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised as expected. Additionally, an oath of allegiance to the King was to be taken. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 2011, {{he signed}} a {{contract}} with Strasbourg IG of France's LNB Pro A. The contract included an <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> when the NBA settled its lockout, set to expire on January30,2012. Allen joined former Richmond foes Kevin Anderson and Justin Harper on Strasbourg IG. He made his debut on October 7, scoring 10 points and pulling down four rebounds in a 77–74 victory over Cholet Basket. The following game, against SLUC Nancy Basket, he grabbed a season-high 13 rebounds and also added 12 points. Allen's season-high 19 points came on November 10, when Strasbourg IG defeated Chorale Roanne Basket 93–80. In nine games, Allen averaged 10.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game.|$|E
5|$|Strasburg {{signed a}} 7-year, $175 million {{extension}} {{to remain with}} the Nationals. With the extension, Strasburg became the first National to receive an <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> in his contract, which allows him to elect free agency after the 2019 or 2020 seasons if he desires. On June 26, 2016, he {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list due to an upper back strain. He returned on July 3 against the Cincinnati Reds, where he took a no-hitter through 6.2 innings until being lifted from the game after throwing 109 pitches. The no-hitter was broken up in the 8th inning, but the Nationals still won 12-1. On July 8, Strasburg became the first pitcher since 1912 to start 12-0. His streak of consecutive wins ran to 16, including 13 decisions in the 2016 season, before it was snapped by the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 21. On August 22, Strasburg was again placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right elbow soreness.|$|E

3000|$|... 23 Jimeno and Thomas (2013) show that, {{disregarding}} externalities {{and other}} strategic {{issues associated with}} the level of bargaining, “efficient” firm-level bargaining can be reproduced with sectoral agreements provided that <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> are operative.|$|R
50|$|The set {{of rules}} around the <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> have been {{designed}} in such way that {{people who do not}} want to be insured can opt out but not engage in a free ride on the system.

5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism has been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E
5|$|Moore was {{selected}} with the 55th {{overall in the}} 2nd round of the 2011 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics. Due to the lockout, Moore signed a deal with Italy's Benetton Treviso that featured an <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> that let him return to the Celtics once the lockout ended. On December 9, 2011, Moore signed a guaranteed contract with the Celtics. He debuted briefly (for less than 1 minute) in the Celtics' season-opener against the New York Knicks on Christmas Day. He posted his first rebound and assist on December 28 against the Charlotte Bobcats. He scored his first points on January 4, 2012, against the New Jersey Nets. He got significant minutes {{for the first time}} in a game against the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in his home state, when he played 20 minutes. In the subsequent weeks with Keyon Dooling and Sasha Pavlović injured he often received a significant amount of playing time. He recorded 16 points on January 26, 2012, against the Orlando Magic, going 4–4 from distance. On April 24, Moore established a career high of 7 rebounds against the Miami Heat.|$|E
5|$|Rodriguez again won the AL MVP {{award in}} 2007, as his 54 {{home runs and}} 156 RBIs topped the AL; he scored 143 runs, the highest single-season number by a player since 1985. After {{starting}} the year 21–29, the Yankees rallied to win the AL's wild card berth; {{it was the first}} time in 10 seasons that they did not win the AL East. New York's season ended in the first round of the playoffs; the Indians won the opening two games of the ALDS and finished the series in four games. Manager Torre did not re-sign after the season, and Joe Girardi took his place. Rodriguez, who used an <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> in his contract to become a free agent, stayed with the Yankees by signing for $275million over 10 seasons, an MLB record. The 2008 season was the Yankees' last in which they played at the original Yankee Stadium. The club had sought a new stadium to increase revenues, following the example set by other MLB teams. It was also the first in which Hal and Hank Steinbrenner ran the team as general partners; though George Steinbrenner was still the principal owner on paper, he yielded operational responsibilities during the 2007 offseason. Yankee Stadium was the site of the 2008 All-Star Game, but for the first time in 14 years did not host playoff action. New York ended the year third in the AL East and failed to qualify for the postseason.|$|E
50|$|On 11 July 2014, Bogdanović officially {{signed a}} {{four-year}} contract, containing <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> {{after the second}} and third seasons, with the Turkish team Fenerbahçe. Over four years, Bogdanović is slated to make €3.5 million euros net income, while Partizan also received a €1.3 million euros buyout from Fenerbahçe, as the player was still under contract with the Belgrade club.|$|R
30|$|More {{flexible}} wage-setting allows {{firms and}} their workers to set wages to levels that reflect firm-level productivity and restore competitiveness.

50|$|Many players {{signed with}} teams from other leagues {{due to the}} 2011 NBA lockout. FIBA allows players under NBA {{contracts}} to sign and play for teams from other leagues if the contracts have <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> that allow the players {{to return to the}} NBA if the lockout ends. The Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allows its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season.|$|R

Employing a computable general equilibrium model, this paper sets out to quantitatively assess the agro-food and macroeconomic impacts of the Mid Term Review and Health Check proposals in Spain.

50|$|On February 13, 2015, Blanton {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the Kansas City Royals. Blanton would earn $1 million at the major league level with up to $3 million in incentives. The contract contained an invitation to spring training, and two <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> on April 1 and May 15. Blanton pitched on May 16 against the Yankees, pitching four innings of relief with one earned run in a 5-1 loss. On July 28, Blanton was designated for assignment {{to make room for}} Johnny Cueto. Despite {{the fact that he was}} traded before the Royals' World Series run that year, he still received a World Series ring, his second in his career.|$|R
30|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{decentralization}} is opening clauses, which are of especial interest as they permit {{the setting of}} less favorable wages and working conditions {{at the local level}} than were fixed under higher-level agreements—typically at the sectoral level. These include not only (one-time) hardship agreements which are exceptional and temporary and designed to avert impending insolvency or major job loss but also opening <b>clauses</b> or <b>opt-out</b> arrangements that, while also seeking to apply contracts in ways less favorable than what has been agreed to at a higher level, are more general {{in the sense that they}} are no longer tied to exceptional circumstances and not necessarily reversible in the next contract period. Such <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> have in practice been both conditional on approval by the collective bargaining parties or applied without such a condition.|$|R
25|$|Though his {{contract}} contained an <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> {{that allowed him}} to become a free agent after the 2011 season, Sabathia said {{he had no intention of}} exercising it as he loves playing for the New York Yankees and his family loves life in New York. On October 31, 2011, Sabathia announced via his Twitter account that he would not be exercising his <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> and had signed an extension with the Yankees. The extension was for an additional year on his original seven-year contract, worth $25 million, along with a $25 million vesting option with a $5 million buyout for the following year. He finished fourth in Cy Young voting after the season.|$|E
25|$|A new rookie salary {{system was}} {{implemented}} by the NFL to limit spending on first-round draft picks, but the savings were reallocated to veteran players. The 2011 CBA had no <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> and a ten-year term set to expire after the 2020 season.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{completion}} of the merger between NTL and Telewest, and the acquisition of Virgin Mobile, the company agreed a 30-year licensing agreement with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group to use the Virgin brand, with a ten-year <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause.</b> Branson accepted a mix of shares and cash, making him a 10.7% shareholder of the combined company at the time.|$|E
50|$|While initial {{recording}} deals usually yield {{a smaller}} percentage of royalties to the artists, subsequent (or renegotiated) deals {{can result in}} much greater profit, or profit potential. A few acts, such as Madonna, Michael Jackson, R.E.M., U2, and Janet Jackson, among others, have signed multimillion-dollar deals. Whitney Houston signed a $100 million deal with BMG to deliver just six albums, the largest recording deal at the time. Robbie Williams signed an £80m (US$125m) contract with EMI. For many other artists, though, for the millions to become tangible, hit albums meeting or exceeding their previous sales figures must follow. Recording contracts may include <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> for the label in the event an act's popularity dips or the act releases non-hit albums under the deal. For instance, Mariah Carey was dropped by Virgin Records and her $80 million recording deal cancelled after her first album released by the label sold poorly.|$|R
30|$|We have {{then looked}} at the labor market {{recommendations}} of the IMF {{since the beginning of}} the crisis, both in general and in program countries in the light of these conclusions. Given the assessment that much of the increase in unemployment is cyclical, IMF advice has been to maintain aggregate demand to the extent possible and to share the pain of lower demand through extension of unemployment insurance benefits. In countries that need to improve competitiveness, but also want to belong to a currency union or maintain a currency peg, the choices have been more difficult. Greater flexibility in wage-setting (for instance through <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> from collective agreements) and public sector wage cuts have been part of the adjustment process in IMF-supported programs in these countries. Some of these recommendations have been controversial, but we have done our best to explain their logic. A natural next step, which we leave for future work, is to assess whether IMF advice was followed and if so, proved helpful.|$|R
40|$|East German wages {{have been}} below the West German wage level since unification. Moreover, the East-West wage gap {{implied by the}} {{contractual}} wages specified in collective wage agreements is drifting ever further apart from the wage gap in terms of effective wages. This paper looks at the role of establishment-specific factors - such as sectoral affiliation {{and size of the}} labour force - in this process. A non-parametric decomposition that has played a prominent role in the gender wage-gap literature is applied to breakdown the East- West wage gap into its constituent components. Using establishment data from the German employment statistics, the paper demonstrates that the divergence between wage agreements and effective wages is probably not a consequence of a massive escape from collective wage agreements, or the intense use of <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> in such agreements in East Germany. Rather, the shift of East Germany's economic structure towards lower-paying types of companies has caused the lagging behind in the adjustment of wages...|$|R
25|$|On August 18, 2016, Rodríguez was {{suspended}} for thirty days for his first violation of WWE's wellness policy. On August 30, {{it was reported that}} Rodríguez would be exercising an <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> from his WWE contract, allowing his departure should he be unhappy with his position within the company. Reportedly, Rodríguez was unhappy with WWE, claiming he had been given empty promises, including a main event push, when he made his return in October 2015. On September 9, WWE officially announced that they had come to terms with his release from the company.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an MLS expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25million whenever he stopped playing in the league – an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.|$|E
25|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirements}} of European Union Community guidelines on state aid to maritime transport (note: a relevant <b>opt-out</b> <b>clause</b> for lifeline services known as the Teckal Exemption exists but was not exercised), the company's routes were put out to open tender. To enable competitive bidding on an equal basis, Caledonian MacBrayne was split into two separate companies on 1 October 2006. Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (CMAL) retained ownership of CalMac vessels and infrastructure, including harbours, while CalMac Ferries Ltd submitted tenders to be the ferry operator. Their bid for the main bundle, Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services, succeeded and on 1 October 2007 CalMac Ferries Ltd began operating these services on a six-year contract. The Gourock to Dunoon service {{was the subject of a}} separate tender, but no formal bids were made. In an interim arrangement CalMac Ferries Ltd continued to provide a subsidised service on this route, until 29 June 2011, when Argyll Ferries took over the service.|$|E
50|$|The rise of Douglas as {{the social}} and {{economic}} stronghold was recognised in 1869, when it became the home of the island's parliament, Tynwald, and therefore the capital, an honour previously held by Castletown, a smaller town in the south of the Island. Douglas's political landscape also changed significantly in the 19th century, in spite of the conservatism of some townsfolk: in 1844 for example, at a public meeting, the idea of a town council was rejected in favour of retaining the system of Town High Bailiffs; when the Town Bill Act was passed at Tynwald in 1852, the people of Douglas again rejected the idea. However, an Act passed later that decade, which did not include <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses,</b> was accepted, and in 1860, Douglas elected its first town council, which was predominantly middle class in its makeup. The Town Commissioners could tackle the town's problems with greater efficiency, and by 1869 the sewage problem had been largely resolved.|$|R
40|$|Decentralising wage {{setting in}} times of crisis? The {{regulation}} and use of wage-related derogation clauses in seven European countries The author addresses the issue of wage setting decentralisation from the inter-sectoral to company level {{through the use of}} derogation clauses. Sectoral and inter-sectoral level collective agreements are a key feature of industrial relations in most Western European countries. Traditionally inter-sectoral bargaining has had the function of homogenising wages and working conditions for entire sectors or countries, of bringing stability to the relations between workers and employers and of relieving company level actors from engaging in time consuming and possibly conflict-ridden bargaining processes. In recent decades, however, the rationale for such inter-sectoral agreements has been questioned for an advancing globalisation of competition and for a greater requirement from employers of decentralisation and flexibility in the setting of wages and working conditions. A specific form of decentralisation is the opening up of possibilities for companies, through various kinds of derogation clauses (opening <b>clauses,</b> hardship <b>clauses,</b> <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses,</b> inability-to-pay clauses, etc.), to deviate from pay norms set under inter-sectoral or sectoral agreements when they suffer from temporary economic hardship. The article provides a summary of the results of a comparative study on the regulations, practices and politics of wage derogation clauses in seven EU countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain. It provides a detailed and original contribution to the political and academic debate on labour law and industrial relations...|$|R
5|$|The players union {{encouraged}} {{players to}} find work overseas, hoping owners would offer better deals if they saw players having more options. Josh Childress, who played for Greek team Olympiacos {{before returning to the}} NBA in 2010, said he would not consider playing overseas during the lockout. He cited concerns with reliability of getting paid, differences in coaching styles, and lower standards of business travel compared to the NBA. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) announced on July 29 that it would allow players under NBA contracts to play overseas, provided that the contracts they signed had <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> that allowed players to return once the work stoppage ended. Stern said the league would allow players to play overseas, but he warned that it could divide the union and possibly jeopardize players' contracts if they were seriously injured. Most leagues permitted the signing of locked-out NBA players with the option of opting out; the Chinese Basketball Association, however, only allowed its clubs to sign foreign free agents who could play for at least the entire season. Chinese nationals were exempt from this rule; this allowed Yi Jianlian to return to the NBA upon the end of the lockout.|$|R

30|$|Two final {{considerations}} are, firstly, the general {{failure of the}} modern literature to address the endogeneity of collective bargaining (for an exception, see Boeri and Burda 2009) and, relatedly, the sparse consideration accorded wage moderation under decentralization vis-à-vis individual wage negotiations. In the latter context, and {{on the basis of}} German data, Ochel (2005) concludes that {{there is no indication that}} the growth of company-level collective agreements has led to more moderate settlements. He also argues that agreements based on contractual <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> have not resulted in more moderate wage contracts than at the branch level while achieving wage flexibility. However, as we have seen, it is all too easy to miss the wage cuts that result from the application as opposed to the existence of opening clauses and the nature of the insurance function. Moreover, research by Garloff and Guertzgen (2012) suggests that flexibility provisions under sectoral agreements do affect the sensitivity of wages to local firm conditions once account is taken of more poorly performing firms. The latter study also reminds us that rising wages are not destructive of the decentralization argument, a result that is underscored by emerging evidence on favorable productivity development under successor pacts.|$|R
40|$|Japan's {{response}} to the 'war on terror', {{in the form of}} the despatch of the JSDF to the Indian Ocean and Iraq, has given policy-makers and academic analysts grounds for believing that Japan is becoming a more assertive military power in support of its US ally. This article argues that JSDF despatch does not necessarily mark a divergence from Japan's previous security path over the short term. This is because its policy-makers have continued to hedge around commitments to the US through careful constitutional framing of JSDF missions and capabilities, allowing it <b>opt-out</b> <b>clauses</b> in future conflicts, and because it has also sought to pursue economic and alternative diplomatic policies in responding to terrorism and WMD proliferation in the Middle East. However, at the same this article argues that Japan has established important precedents for expanded JSDF missions in the 'war on terror', and that over the medium to longer terms these are likely to be applied to the bilateral context of the US-Japan security treaty in East Asia, and to push Japan towards becoming a more active military power through participation in US-led multinational 'coalitions of the willing' in East Asia and globally...|$|R
