2500|$|Woodlands in North Dorset are scarce, and Piddles Wood {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of such sites. Due to the heavy neutral and lighter acid soil types—caused by the {{underlying}} Kimmeridge Clay and Plateau Gravels—the site has a varying woodland flora, containing broadleaved, mixed and yew lowland. However, it is dominated by oak and [...] hazel—for which reason the site was listed as an SSSI—and its flora and fauna is typical of oak woodland in Dorset. Piddles Wood has an abundance of ground flora, including woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and <b>orpine</b> (Sedum telephium). The site is also very rich for insect fauna, and among the butterflies found on the site are the white admiral (Limenitis camilla), wood white (Leptidea sinapis) and silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia); it was previously home to the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), although this is now believed to be extinct in Dorset. Adjacent to the edge of the site is an extensive poultry farm, containing approximately 100,000 birds.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} seventeenth century Wateringbury’s {{population}} had doubled from its Domesday Book level {{and by the}} time of the first census in 1801 the population was 817; it continued to grow rapidly in the first half of the 19th century (to 1,448 in 1851) before falling in the second half (to 1,316 in 1901), reflecting the general national trend of urbanisation. Wateringbury was an early mover amongst the immediately surrounding parishes in subsidising emigration in the 1830s to help relieve poverty with financial assistance being given for emigration to Canada in 1832 and to Australia in 1838. During the 19th and early 20th centuries there were major temporary influxes of hoppers in September of each year. In 1900 the vicar, Greville Livett, estimated that there had been 3,300 such ‘immigrants’ including their children. Wateringbury benefited from the work in the period 1740 to 1747 of the Medway Navigation Company (MNC) in making the River Medway navigable above Maidstone, and so available for the transport of bulky cargos. The medieval stone bridge was replaced by a wooden one as part of the MNC's mid-18th century navigation improvements, which was in turn replaced in 1914. The Maidstone-Tonbridge turnpike, authorised by Act of Parliament in 1765/6, came through the village. In 1844 the Medway valley railway line gave it an alternative transport link for passengers and cargo. The tithe survey of 1839 provides a snapshot in time of the village and its economic activity at least as far as agriculture goes. Arable farming covered 26% of the parish and woods, mainly coppiced sweet chestnut, covered 20%. Hops covered 14% and fruit 10%. However, the acreage of hops subsequently expanded and, as a cash crop, it brought wealth to the village, although the annual influx of temporary labour also brought social problems. Two breweries, the Phoenix Brewery of the Leney family and the Kent Brewery of the Jude and Hanbury families, developed in the village in the 18th century and only closed in the late 20th. In the second half of the 19th century, Leney became internationally renowned as a breeder of shorthorn cattle with individual specimens reaching astronomical prices (2,000 guineas for a single animal in 1874) at auctions held in the village with exports to the US and New Zealand. In the 1820s Matthias Lucas, Lord Mayor of London in 1827, a self-made man who became extremely wealthy from commerce, acquired Wateringbury Place. During his residence he brought was very active in village affairs, building several substantial houses (The Red House, The Beck, The Thatched House, The Limes and The <b>Orpines)</b> on the Wateringbury Place estate for rent. He also represented the village's interests to Parliamentary inquiries about the navigation of the Medway and the fruit trade. He died in 1848, and his grandson split and sold the estate in 1876. In the nineteenth century, Wateringbury is recorded as having several small private boarding schools, and in 1843 a public National School. There was also an explosion of sports and other clubs and activities in the nineteenth century. The societies included: an Amicable Benefit Society; the Oddfellows; Boys Brigade and Scouts; horticultural and drama societies. A Working Men’s Club was established in 1887 with considerable support from the local gentry. A series of annual rowing regattas held on the Medway in the 1860s and 1870s attracted large numbers of people each year to Wateringbury to view, with special trains laid on; a silver Wateringbury regatta cup is still awarded each year at the National Schools regatta.|$|R

5000|$|Lenophyllum is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} <b>orpine</b> family, Crassulaceae. The roughly seven species it contains are distributed in Texas in the United States and northeastern Mexico. Some authorities place it in the genus Sedum. Plants in this genus are distinguished from Sedum species {{by the presence of}} terminal inflorescences, erect petals, and opposite leaves. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words ληνός (lenos), meaning [...] "trough", and φυλλον (phyllos), meaning [...] "leaf." ...|$|E
50|$|This plant {{occurs in}} subalpine climates at {{elevations}} between 2710 and 3160 meters, in meadows and coniferous forest and woodland habitat. It grows on soils derived from glacial till, sometimes in mats of Selaginella, such as Watson's spikemoss (Selaginella watsonii). Other {{plants in the}} habitat include fewseed draba (Draba oligosperma), alpine avens (Geum rossii), shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa), <b>orpine</b> stonecrop, mountain sorrel (Oxyria digyna), smooth prairie star (Lithophragma glabra), Pacific woodrush (Luzula comosa), bluebells (Mertensia ciliata), and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis).|$|E
50|$|The Crassulaceae, {{also known}} as the {{stonecrop}} family or the <b>orpine</b> family, are a family of dicotyledons with succulent leaves. They are generally herbaceous but there are some subshrubs, and relatively few treelike or aquatic plants. They are found worldwide, but mostly occur in the Northern Hemisphere and southern Africa, typically in dry and/or cold areas where water may be scarce. The family includes approximately 1400 species and 34 or 35 genera., although the number of genera is disputed and depends strongly on the circumscription of Sedum.|$|E

The flowers are held in dense heads and can be reddish or yellowish-white. A number of cultivars, often with purplish leaves, are grown in gardens as well as hybrids between this species and the related Hylotelephium spectabile (iceplant), especially the popular 'Herbstfreude' ('Autumn Joy'). Occasionally garden plants may escape and naturalise as has happened in parts of North America as wildflowers.|$|E

5000|$|Diamorpha is a genus {{of family}} Crassulaceae. It is {{sometimes}} included within the genus Sedum. It is monotypic, including only the species Diamorpha smallii (also known as elf <b>orpine</b> or Small's stonecrop [...] ), an endemic {{of the southeastern}} United States. It becomes active in late fall and winter, blooms in late March, then dies. It has red succulent leaves that act to reflect light and hold water. Diamorpha smallii is found primarily on solution pools, shallow basins on rocky outcrops that contain seasonal pools. The plant is mainly found in Georgia, though populations have also been noted in Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. It is listed as an endangered species by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.|$|E
