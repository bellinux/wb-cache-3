500|$|In a {{statement}} to The New York Times on August 21, 2015, Dre again addressed his abusive past, stating, [...] "Twenty-five years ago I {{was a young man}} drinking too much and in <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> with no real structure in my life. However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I've been married for 19 years and every day I'm working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I'm doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again." [...] He went on to apologize to all the women he abused, saying, [...] "I apologize to the women I've hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E
60|$|MABEL. [With {{her hand}} to her forehead] Oh! Mr Twisden, when will it be <b>over?</b> <b>My</b> <b>head's</b> getting awful sitting in that Court.|$|R
60|$|I placed {{my hands}} on the top rail and sprang up to vault <b>over.</b> As <b>my</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>over,</b> <b>my</b> eyes caught sight of an object lying in the hole of the fence post.|$|R
60|$|You must picture me {{all this}} time as sitting upon {{the side of the}} lugger and turning my {{prospects}} and <b>my</b> position <b>over</b> in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>My</b> reverie was interrupted by the heavy hand of the English skipper dropping abruptly upon my arm.|$|R
500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, that will do me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough. [...] I watched him play a few overs and I thought, [...] "This is good", and then they brought Laker on to bowl. [...] The third and the fifth balls of Laker's over disappeared <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> on the way up, and they both finished in the crowd for six[...] [...] [...] I can honestly thank Keith Miller for the confidence he gave me during our partnership [...] [...] [...] and it did so much for my future cricket career." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its success, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{had some}} detractors, {{including}} hip hop tastemakers who were unaccustomed to the album's style. At the 1995 Source Awards, OutKast {{won in the}} [...] "Best Newcomer" [...] category, but were booed upon taking the stage and delivering their acceptance speech; Big Boi managed to deliver his shout outs, while André 3000 was nervous and only said, [...] "The South got somethin' to say." [...] The latter recalled how the album was received by some listeners, [...] "People thought that the South basically only had bass music. At first people were looking at us like 'Um, I don't know.'" [...] Hip hop magnate Russell Simmons reacted negatively to the album at the time, but later expressed regret and said of the album in retrospect, [...] "At the time, I didn't understand their music—it sounds so different from what I was used to that I foolishly... claim that they 'weren't hip-hop.' The same way people didn't understand 'Sucker MCs' a decade earlier, I didn't understand that instead of operating outside of hip-hop, OutKast was actually expanding hip-hop. They were offering {{one of the most}} honest expressions, and expression so honest that it went completely <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> at first." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatum played chords with a {{relatively}} flat-fingered technique compared to the curvature taught in classical training. [...] Composer/pianist Mary Lou Williams told Whitney Balliett, [...] "Tatum {{taught me how to}} hit my notes, how to control them without using pedals. And he showed me how to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone." [...] Jimmy Rowles said, [...] "Most of the stuff he played was clear <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> [...] There was too much going on—both hands were impossible to believe. [...] You couldn't pick out what he was doing because his fingers were so smooth and soft, and the way he did it—it was like camouflage." [...] When his fastest tracks of [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] are slowed down, they still reveal a coherent, syncopated rhythm.|$|E
6000|$|The {{most welcome}} sight was Julius, who {{came down in}} dismay {{as soon as he}} could leave the Hall. [...] "I am so glad," [...] said the patient; [...] "I want to talk things <b>over</b> while <b>my</b> <b>head</b> is clearer than it ever may be again." ...|$|R
60|$|But the {{photographer}} {{had ceased to}} listen. He came <b>over</b> and took <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{in his hands and}} twisted it sideways. I thought he meant to kiss me, and I closed my eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{would not}} listen to reason or to the most {{elementary}} dictates of friendship. Having poured the vials of his bilious temper <b>over</b> <b>my</b> devoted <b>head,</b> he became as perverse and as obstinate as a mule. With the most consummate impudence I ever beheld in any human being, he flatly denied all knowledge of the bracelet.|$|R
2500|$|Hayakawa {{was known}} for his {{discipline}} and martial arts skills. While filming The Jaguar's Claws, in the Mojave Desert, Hayakawa played a Mexican bandit, with 500 cowboys as extras. On the first night of filming, the extras drank all night and well into the next day. No work was being done, so Hayakawa challenged the group to a fight. Two men stepped forward. Hayakawa said of the incident, [...] "The first one struck out at me. I seized his arm and sent him flying on his face along the rough ground. The second attempted to grapple and I was forced to flip him <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and let him fall on his neck. The fall knocked him unconscious." [...] Hayakawa then disarmed yet another cowboy. The extras returned to work, amused by the way the small man manhandled the big bruising cowboys.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, he {{teamed with}} Chicago-based {{producer}} Joe Thomas for the album Imagination. Following this, he received extensive vocal coaching {{to improve his}} voice, learned to cope with his stage fright, and started to consistently perform live {{for the first time}} in decades. This resulted in Wilson successfully performing the entire Pet Sounds album live throughout the US, UK and Europe. In 1999, Wilson filed a suit against Thomas, seeking damages and a declaration which freed him to work on his next album without involvement from Thomas. The suit was made after Thomas allegedly began to raise his industry profile and wrongfully enrich himself through his association with Wilson. Thomas reciprocated with a suit citing that Melinda Wilson [...] "schemed against and manipulated" [...] him and Wilson. The case was settled out of court. Wilson's third solo album Gettin' In <b>Over</b> <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> (2004) featured collaborations with Elton John, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton and brother Carl, who died of lung cancer in February 1998.|$|E
2500|$|... nerves are {{stretched}} like a wire; the simplest outing becomes a huge challenge – I {{have to have}} Angela's arm to support me most days... my balance {{or lack of it}} is probably my biggest problem. My blessings are my memories and we have a few very loyal friends who help us through the bad days... Financially all's well. Thank goodness my wife, who holds nothing of the past <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> is constantly at my side. Real love never dies. We share a sense of humour which at times is vital. If I have a philosophy it is that life doesn't put everything your way. It takes a little back. I strive to remember the ups rather than the downs. I {{have a lot of time}} with my thoughts these days and sometimes they hurt so much I can hardly bear it. However, my friends always associate me with the song: [...] "When You're Smiling..." [...] lt isn't always easy but I'm trying to live up to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Kneel," [...] he bade me. And {{realising}} what {{he would}} be about, I sank on to my knees whilst he murmured the Apostolic benediction <b>over</b> <b>my</b> bowed <b>head.</b> The rushes of the floor were the only witnesses of the smile that crept to my lips at this sudden assumption of his churchly office by that most worldly prince.|$|R
60|$|I {{went to the}} window. I {{opened it}} and let the cold wintry air blow <b>over</b> <b>my</b> burning <b>head.</b> I don't know how long I sat at the window. There came a time when I saw Rothsay on the house steps. He walked rapidly toward the park gate. His head was down; he never once {{looked back at the}} room in which he had left me.|$|R
5000|$|Most tracks {{from the}} album were not new material, {{but rather a}} {{collection}} of older, unreleased tracks and riffs from the past. The tracks [...] "Make a Wish", [...] "Fairy Tale", [...] "Rainbow Eyes" [...] and [...] "Dont Let Her Know Shes an Angel" [...] are re-recorded songs from Wilsons 1990/1991 sessions from the abandoned Sweet Insanity. The lyrics to [...] "Rainbow Eyes" [...] were slightly rewritten to change [...] "sweet insanity" [...] to [...] "sweet conspiracy". The track [...] "Desert Drive" [...] is based around riffs over 40 years old. Furthermore, with the concurrent live performances of the recently completed Smile album, and the announcement of its impending issue on CD, completely overshadowed Gettin in <b>Over</b> <b>My</b> <b>Heads</b> release, with most attention going to the former.There was a limited edition set of prints created by artist Sir Peter Blake in 2004.|$|R
60|$|I {{still held}} the ruler in my hand, and now brandished it <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|This {{statement}} was curiously slurred over. I dragged the shirt violently <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and emerged staring.|$|E
60|$|The cord which bound me was undone and {{the sack}} drawn from <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> With {{my eyes closed}} I lay {{motionless}} upon the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Baas. You {{are right}} as usual, Baas. I had a quarrel {{with a man}} about sixpence that he owed me, and knocked him <b>over</b> with <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> forgetting to take my hat off first. Therefore it is spoiled, for which I am sorry, as {{it was quite a}} new hat, not two years old. The Baas gave it me. He bought it in a store at Utrecht when we were coming back from Pongoland." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was turning}} this <b>over</b> in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and {{wondering}} what their boorish conduct could mean, when I saw, as I rode from the village, a great T new carved upon a tree. I had already seen {{more than one in}} my morning's ride, but I had given no thought to them until the words of the beer-drinker gave them an importance. It chanced that a respectable-looking person was riding past me at the moment, so I turned to him for information.|$|R
5000|$|Reddy {{credits the}} song as having supernatural inspiration. She said:"I {{remember}} {{lying in bed}} one night and the words, 'I am strong, I am invincible, I am woman', kept going over and <b>over</b> in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> That part I consider to be divinely inspired. I had been chosen to get a message across." [...] Pressed on who had chosen her, she replied: [...] "The universe."The next day she wrote the lyric {{and handed it to}} Australian guitarist Ray Burton to put it to music.|$|R
6000|$|Wondrously strange was {{earth to}} see, [...] Flowers white as milk did gleam; Spread to Heaven the Assyrian Tree, [...] <b>Over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> with Dream.|$|E
60|$|STRAMMFEST [rising in a fury]. Ah! the scoundrel you eloped with! You {{think you}} will shove this fellow into an army command, <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Never.|$|E
60|$|Then the bag {{was pulled}} <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and arms, and in five seconds I found myself a {{prisoner}} and hardly {{able to move}} hands or feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I hardly {{think that}} it would help me," [...] said he. [...] "I should prefer to go quietly down to your garden, and turn the whole matter <b>over</b> in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> There is {{something}} to be said for the theory of suicide which you have put forward. We must apologize for having intruded upon you, Professor Coram, and I promise that we won't disturb you until after lunch. At two o'clock we will come again, and report to you anything which may have happened in the interval." ...|$|R
6000|$|Since I {{wrote the}} {{foregoing}} sheet, I have seen {{something of the}} storm of mischief thickening <b>over</b> <b>my</b> folly-devoted <b>head.</b> Should you, <b>my</b> friends, my benefactors, be successful in your applications for me, perhaps {{it may not be}} in my power, in that way, to reap the fruit of your friendly efforts. What I have written in the preceding pages, is the settled tenor of my present resolution; but should inimical circumstances forbid me closing with your kind offer, or enjoying it only threaten to entail farther misery--- ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"I {{suppose you}} think I was going mad," [...] he {{began in a}} changed tone. [...] "And well you may, if you {{remember}} I had lost my cap. The sun crept {{all the way from}} east to west <b>over</b> <b>my</b> bare <b>head,</b> but that day I could not come to any harm, I suppose. The sun could not make me mad. [...] ." [...] His right arm put aside the idea of madness. [...] "Neither could it kill me. [...] ." [...] Again his arm repulsed a shadow. [...] "That rested with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{came with}} {{trembling}} steps, and knelt before his Majesty. Around his neck hung a beauteous chain of wrought gold. He took it, and cast it <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I {{came in and}} saw the pack-saddle <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> I {{thought how}} dreadful {{it would be if}} it fell and killed me,' and she cried louder than before.|$|E
60|$|I {{tied the}} girdle of my gown, and taking off my busby, I drew the cowl <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> My spurs I removed. Then in silence I {{followed}} my guide.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not {{surprise}} me, Dr. Ashleigh. My husband has so frequently asked me {{questions about the}} positions of the different rooms, and has so often said that he would try for it some day, that when you came and {{told me that he was}} killed by accident, and did not say how, or when, or where, I guessed that it was somehow in trying to get the will. If you please, we will not say any more about it now; I want to think it all <b>over,</b> and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> aches sadly. I am much obliged to you for all your kindness." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{opened my}} eyes the sun was shining. I had a queer, numb feeling all <b>over,</b> and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> hurt terribly. Everything about me was hazy. I {{did not know where}} I was. After a little I {{struggled}} to sit up, and with great difficulty managed it. My hands were tied. Then it all came back to me. Stockton stood before me holding a tin cup of water toward my lips. My throat was parched, and I drank. Stockton had a great bruise on his forehead; his nostrils were crusted with blood, and his shirt was half torn off.|$|R
6000|$|While {{this was}} going on, there was a Bible text repeating itself over and <b>over</b> again in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> whether I would or no:--"And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances." [...] To which text and some others, I shall ask your {{attention}} presently; but I must go to Paris first.|$|R
