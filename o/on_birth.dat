5|$|Kim {{solidified}} his {{break with}} cinematic realism by following The Housemaid {{with two more}} films exploring styles and mixing genres, radically new for Korean cinema at the time. The Sea Knows (1961) transcended {{its roots in the}} standard anti-Japanese World War II film to become a distinctive examination of humanity, sadism, greed, lust for power and sexuality. The box-office success of this film enabled Kim to buy his first house, in the Namsan district of Seoul. Goryeojang (1963), dealt with a similar subject matter as The Ballad of Narayama (1983), directed by Shohei Imamura, a filmmaker with whom Kim has often been compared. Kim's version of the story is marked by his mixing of genres. For example, he frames the storywhich deals with an ancient tradition in which elders were abandoned to diewithin a modern lecture <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> control.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

5|$|Socially, {{economic}} dynamism {{opened up}} one of the avenues of social mobility in the Roman Empire. Social advancement was thus not dependent solely <b>on</b> <b>birth,</b> patronage, good luck, or even extraordinary ability. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware, public entertainments, funerary monuments for family members or coworkers, and religious dedications such as altars. Guilds (collegia) and corporations (corpora) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking, sharing sound business practices, and a willingness to work.|$|E
5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their {{connection to the}} means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based <b>on</b> <b>birth</b> and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to explore}} whether choices in {{birthing}} positions contributes to women's {{sense of control}} during birth. Design: survey using a self-report questionnaire. Multiple regression analyses were used to investigate which factors associated with choices in birthing positions affected women's sense of control. Setting: midwifery practices in the Netherlands. Participants: 1030 women with a physiological pregnancy and birth from 54 midwifery practices. Findings: in the total group of women (n= 1030) significant predictors for sense of control were: influence <b>on</b> <b>birthing</b> positions (self or self together with others), attendance of antenatal classes, feelings towards birth in pregnancy and pain in second stage of labour. For women who preferred other than supine birthing positions (n= 204) significant predictors were: influence <b>on</b> <b>birthing</b> positions (self or self together with others), feelings towards birth in pregnancy, pain in second stage of labour and having a home birth. For these women, influence <b>on</b> <b>birthing</b> positions in combination with others had a greater effect on their sense of control than having an influence <b>on</b> their <b>birthing</b> positions just by themselves. Key conclusions: women felt more in control during birth if they experienced an influence <b>on</b> <b>birthing</b> positions. For women preferring other than supine positions, home birth and shared decision-making had added value. Implications for practice: midwives {{can play an important}} role in supporting women in their use of different birthing positions and help them find the positions they feel most comfortable in. Thus, contributing to women's positive experience of birth. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{maternal}} labour and birth outcomes between women who gave <b>birth</b> <b>on</b> a <b>birth</b> seat or in any other position for vaginal birth and further, to study the relationship between synthetic oxytocin augmentation and maternal blood loss, in a stratified sample. Methods A re-analysis of a randomized controlled trial in Sweden. An on-treatment analysis was used to study obstetrical outcomes for nulliparous women who gave <b>birth</b> <b>on</b> a <b>birth</b> seat (birth seat group) compared to birth in any other position for vaginal birth (control group). Data were collected between November 2006 and July 2009. The outcome measurements included perineal outcome, post partum blood loss, epidural analgesia, synthetic oxytocin augmentation and duration of labour. Results The major findings of this paper were that women giving <b>birth</b> <b>on</b> the <b>birth</b> seat had shorter duration of labour and were significantly less likely to receive synthetic oxytocin for augmentation in the second stage of labour. Significantly more women had an increased blood loss when giving <b>birth</b> <b>on</b> the <b>birth</b> seat, but had no difference in perineal outcomes. Blood loss was increased regardless of birth position if women had been exposed to synthetic oxytocin augmentation during the first stage of labour. Conclusions The results of this analysis imply that women with a straightforward birth process may well benefit from giving <b>birth</b> <b>on</b> a <b>birth</b> seat without risk for any adverse obstetrical outcomes. However it is important to bear in mind that, women who received synthetic oxytocin during the first stage of labour may have an increased risk for greater blood loss when giving <b>birth</b> <b>on</b> a <b>birth</b> seat. Finally it is of vital importance to scrutinize the influence of synthetic oxytocin administered during the first stage of labour on blood loss postpartum, since excessive blood loss is a well-documented cause of maternal mortality worldwide and may cause severe maternal morbidity in high-income countries.

25|$|In France, the 1920 Birth Law {{contained}} a clause that criminalized dissemination of birth-control literature.
