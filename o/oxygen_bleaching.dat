5000|$|TAED is an {{important}} component of laundry detergents that use [...] "active oxygen" [...] bleaching agents. Active <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> agents include sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, sodium perphosphate, sodium persulfate, and urea peroxide. These compounds release hydrogen peroxide during the wash cycle. Hydrogen peroxide is however an inefficient bleach below 60 C. TAED and hydrogen peroxide react to form peroxyacetic acid, a more efficient bleach, allowing lower temperature wash cycles, around 40 C. TAED was first used in a commercial laundry detergent in 1978 (Skip by Unilever). Currently, TAED is the main bleach activator used in European laundry detergents and has an estimated annual consumption of 75 kt.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{a type of}} non-silicon <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> {{stabilizer}} {{was used}} to cotton fabric in the hydrogen peroxide bleaching process. This type of novel non-silicon <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> stabilizer was prepared mainly with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and magnesium chloride. The results showed that adding the non-silicon <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> stabilizer into the bleaching solution obviously decreased the hydrogen peroxide decomposition rate and improved the fabric whiteness. Optimal conditions was found as follow: non-silicon <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> stabilizer 4. 5 g/l; bleaching temperature 75 - 85 ℃; pH of bleaching liquid 11; bleaching time 40 - 45 min. In summary, {{the results showed that}} the self-made non-silicon <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> stabilizer could make the cotton fabrics obtained great whiteness, capillary ability and breaking strength...|$|E

5000|$|Laundry {{detergents}} {{contain a}} mix of ingredients including surfactants, builders, optical brighteners, etc. Cleaning action arises primarily from {{the action of the}} surfactants and other ingredients, which are designed to maximise release and suspension of dirt and microbes into the wash liquid, together with enzymes and/or an activated oxygen-based bleach which digest and remove stains. Although activated <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleach</b> is included in many powder detergents to digest and remove stains, it also produces some chemical inactivation of bacteria, fungi and viruses. As a rule of thumb, powders and tablets normally contain an activated <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleach,</b> but liquids, and all products (liquid or powder) used for [...] "coloureds" [...] do not. Surfactants also exert some chemical inactivation action against certain species although the extent of their action is not known. [...] In 2013 the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene (IFH) reviewed some 30 studies of the hygiene effectiveness of laundering at various temperatures ranging from room temperature to 70 °C, under varying conditions. A key finding was the lack of standardisation and control within studies, and the variability in test conditions between studies such as wash cycle time, number of rinses etc. The consequent variability in the data (i.e. the reduction in contamination on fabrics) obtained, in turn makes it extremely difficult to propose guidelines for laundering with any confidence, based on currently available data. As a result, there is significant variability in the recommendations for hygienic laundering of clothing etc. given by different agencies.|$|R
40|$|Modified {{kraft pulp}} {{subjected}} to <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> following pretreatment with 2 % nitrogen dioxide for 140 min {{with the addition}} of oxygen resulted in low selectivity after subsequent <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching.</b> In contrast, pretreatment in the absence of oxygen removed more than 80 % of the lignin after <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> and still maintained high selectivity (kappa number less than 5 at viscosity 950 dm 3 /kg). Nitric acid which is produced and added during pretreatment is consumed in lignin reactions, which favor delignification and give rise to NO 2. The presence of hydrogen ions is a key-parameter for the extensive generation of NO 2, and also nitrate ions promote the generation of nitrogen dioxide. By applying a programmed temperature profile and decreasing the acidity level during pretreatment of kraft pulp with NO 2 it is possible to suppress the depolymerization of the polysaccharides and achieved higher selectivity under certain conditions after <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching.</b> Additional precaution against depolymerization of the cellulose is a stepwise dilution and a decreased temperature. Pulp with kappa number 3. 5 and intrinsic viscosity of 950 dm 3 /kg was produced from industrial kraft pulp, (softwood) by <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> following pretreatment with 2 % NO 2. After treatment with nitrogen dioxide at 12 % consistency without the addition of oxygen at modest temperature, (e. g. 40 °C), the pulp was diluted with acid sodium nitrate solution to 5 % consistency and kept at a high temperature, (e. g. 90 °C) for 90 - 180 min. in stage two (ripening stage). This process is denoted as S 3. The generation of NO 2 from HNO 3 is a very important reaction at ripening stage. Reactions between HNO 2 and the lignin explain the effects on the pulp of dilution, temperature and oxygen addition. Kraft pulp impregnated with different spent liquors and pretreated according to the S 3 -process resulted in high selectivity after <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching.</b> A kappa number of 3. 5 at viscosity 950 dm 3 /kg was obtained even when the pulp contained 43 kg of solids from the black liquor per 1000 kg pulp. Transition metal compounds like mangan and magnesium presence in the spent liquors affect the delignification and depolymerization of cellulose during <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching.</b> When no magnesium protector was applied before the <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching,</b> an addition of 300 ppm of manganese decreased the depolymerization rate of the cellulose. With 60 ppm Mn a net catalytic or retarded effect was found which depended on the bleaching conditions. An increased ration of Mg:Mn suppressed the depolymerization effectively during <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching...</b>|$|E
30|$|It has {{basically}} been considered that only phenolic lignin moieties are oxidized in an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> process, {{and on the}} other hand, non-phenolic analogues are inert. Several oxidation products were isolated and characterized in an oxygen-alkali treatment of simple phenolic lignin model compounds [5, 7]. The number of dioxygen can be calculated to be up to 1.5  molecules to afford 1.0  molecule of the oxidation products. On the other hand, Tong et al. [8]. and Imai et al. [9]. showed that about 3  mol of dioxygen are consumed by 1.0  molar equivalent aromatic nucleus in a prolonged oxygen oxidation of kraft and isolated residual lignin samples as well as various lignin model compounds although many of aromatic nuclei in these lignin samples are not phenolic but non-phenolic. These results were considered to suggest that not only phenolic but also non-phenolic lignin moieties are extensively oxidized in an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> process and general reaction products obtained from phenolic lignin moieties are further oxidized. Two possible mechanisms were considered to explain the extensive oxidation of non-phenolic lignin moieties in an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> process: hydroxylation of a non-phenolic aromatic nucleus to convert it to a new phenolic analogue, and cleavage of an aryl ether bond to liberate the aryl portion as the new phenolic aromatic nucleus. The latter mechanism seemed to be more plausible {{on the basis of the}} previous information on the reactivity of AOS [4, 6, 8, 10]. Therefore, the cleavage of an aryl ether bond should be a key in the extensive oxidation of non-phenolic lignin moieties in an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> process.|$|E
30|$|It is known, as {{described}} in “Introduction”, that phenolic lignin moiety without α-carbonyl group is degraded by dioxygen under <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> conditions. It {{has not yet been}} clarified, however, whether a non-phenolic aromatic unit in lignin consisting of β-O- 4 bond, which is represented by the B-ring of compound III, is converted into the new corresponding phenolic unit via the β-O- 4 bond cleavage when the neighboring phenolic unit, which is represented by the A-ring of compound III, is degraded by dioxygen in an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> process. On the basis of this consideration, a phenolic β-O- 4 type dimeric model compound III was applied to oxygen-alkali treatment and the liberation of compound V was examined.|$|E
30|$|The {{detergents}} we use {{in everyday}} life are complex mixtures of various compounds. A typical detergent consists of surfactants, builders, anti-redeposition agents, zeolite, alkaline agents, corrosion inhibitors, processing aids, colorants, fragrances, <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleach,</b> suds control agents, opacifiers, bleaching agents, enzymes and other minor constituents (Bajpai and Tyagi 2007). These components can interact either antagonistically, additively or synergistically to increase or diminish the toxicity of the detergent in the aquatic environment (Warne and Schifko 1999). Thus, evaluating the individual effects of surfactants or other ingredients does not reflect either the actual or net influence of a detergent on the aquatic environment, it is thus necessary to estimate the biological effects of detergent formulations as a whole (Markina and Aizdaicher 2007; Azizullah et al. 2011).|$|R

By using the concept of side reaction coefficients, an estimation of the chelating strength of EDTA at different pH can be made. Metal ion concentrations were determined by DCP-AES and ICP-MS techniques. Mn, Zn, and Cd were the metal ions that could almost completely be chelated with EDTA. Most of the metal ions were found to be desorbed from the pulps at low pH values by ion exchange with hydrogen ions. With EDTA chelation 50 to 70 % of the iron was desorbed.

However, the rapid liberation of compound V in the oxygen-alkali treatment of compound III may mainly be caused by alkaline-induced reactions and/or some oxidation reactions of the primary degradation product of compound III, a muconic acid derivative.|$|E

30|$|To {{examine the}} effect of the {{presence}} of benzylic hydroxyl group on the reaction of β-O- 4 type lignin moiety with active oxygen species (AOS) under <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> conditions, a specially designed β-O- 4 type model compound carrying the benzylic methoxyl group, 2 -(3, 5 -difluorophenoxy)- 3 -methoxy- 3 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl)propan- 1 -ol (IV), was treated together with a phenolic compound, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzyl alcohol (II), under <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> conditions. In this reaction system, AOS were generated by reactions of compound II with dioxygen and attacked compound IV. Compound IV was rather stable, while an analogous model compound carrying the benzylic hydroxyl group, 2 -(3, 5 -difluorophenoxy)- 1 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl)propane- 1, 3 -diol (I), was rather degraded. This result and the previous knowledge on the relatively high stability of 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol carrying only the hydroxymethyl group as side-chain under the identical reaction conditions suggested that the existence of benzylic hydroxymethylene group is essential in the extensive reaction of side-chain of β-O- 4 type lignin moiety with AOS.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the mechanisms involved in cellulosedegradation {{in general and}} Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleachingof pulp in particular. The thesis shows that the cellulosedegradation during high consistency ozone bleaching is explainedby free radical chain reactions. By simulation, {{it has been shown}} that the number, weight andviscosity average of liner polymer chain length can be used tocalculate the number of random scissions in a linear polymer ofany molecular weight distribution, provided that there is acalibrated Mark-Houwink equation. A model describing partialdegradation of molecular weight distributions of linear polymersmeasured with viscometry was developed and verifiedexperimentally. The model predicts viscometric measurement ofchemical cellulose degradation by a rapidly reacting reagent tobe strongly dependent on cellulose accessibility. The role of free radical reactions in cellulose degradationwas studied by varying the amount of ferrous ions and ozone addedto the cotton linters. The result was compared to the resultsobtained from cellulose of lower crystallinity (cellulose beads) by measuring average chain length. When a ferryl ion reacted withcotton linters in the presence of ozone, the very formation ofone glycosidic radical was more significant to degradation thanthe final step of forming one oxidised glycoside. The inefficientdegradation observed of the oxidation step is explainable by theamount of accessible glycosides being too small to influenceviscometry. The efficient degradation observed in associationwith the glycosidic radical formation is explained by initiationof free radical chain reactions that are propagated as long asthere is ozone in the system. As none of these phenomena werefound in the less crystalline cellulose, cellulose structureappears to be important for how free radical mediated cellulosedegradation develops. The theory of free radical chain reactions coupled withdiffusion suggests a concentric expansion of the chain reactionsoutwards from the initial site of radical formation duringozonation of carbohydrates. This was confirmed by demonstratingfree radical chain reactions spreading from a spot of initiationoutwards during ozonation of a filter paper, using a pH-indicatorto monitor acid formation. Furthermore, the interior and exteriorof cellulose fibres doped with initiator were shown to bepermeated by small holes after ozonation. Ethylene glycol was shown to improve the selectivity duringozone <b>bleaching</b> of <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleached</b> kraft pulp at pH 3. Optimalconditions were obtained at pH 3 for 25 wt% ethylene glycol. Theinfluence of ethylene glycol on selectivity is explained by aproportion of the free radical chain reactions being carried bythe ethylene glycol instead of the cellulose during ozonebleaching. The observations were summarised in the form of amodel where the observed degradations for pulp, bleached pulp andcotton fibres during both ozone bleaching and ethylene glycolassisted ozone bleaching were shown to agree with each other. From g-irradiation of ozonised aqueous solutions of alcohol,the rate constant of superoxide formation from the peroxylradical of methanol was estimated to be 10 s- 1. Rate constants of the reactions between ozone andalkylperoxyl radicals were determined to be around 104 M- 1 s- 1. The possibility of the reaction betweenalkylperoxyl radicals and ozone contributing significantly tofree radical chain reactions during ozonation of carbohydratesand alcohols could therefore be ruled out.

It controls or kills microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, sub-viral particles, and molds; and destroys objectionable non-living proteins and/or peptides. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A laundry and cleaning composition comprises metal complex (1 - 99. 9 pts. wt.), an <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> agent, and adjunct materials. The metal complex comprises a transition metal atom including manganese (Mn) (II), Mn (III), Mn (IV), Mn (V), iron (Fe) (II), Fe(III), Fe(IV), cobalt (Co) (I), Co(II), Co(III), chromium (Cr) (II), Cr (III), Cr(IV), Cr(V), Cr(VI), nickel (Ni) (II), Ni (III), copper (Cu) (I), Cu(II), Cu(III), vanadium (V) (III), V(IV), V(V), molybdenum (Mo) (IV), Mo(V), Mo(VI), tungsten (W) (IV), W(V), W(VI), palladium (Pd) (II), ruthenium (Ru) (II), Ru(III), or Ru(IV); and a cross-bridged macropolycyclic ligand comprising an organic macrocycle ring comprising {{greater than or equal to}} 4 donor atoms, where 2 of the donor atoms being non-adjacent donor atoms, and a moiety that comprises a 2 - 10 C cross-bridged chain that covalently connects greater than or equal to 2 non-adjacent donor atoms of the organic macrocycle ring, the covalently connected donor atoms being donor atoms that are coordinated to the transition metal...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{interesting}} discoloration patterns are clearly evident on MOOO 2 - 1 which resides {{on the three}} faces of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). Most interesting is the pattern of blue oxidation on polished single crystal silicon apparently produced by scattered or direct ram oxygen atoms along the earth face. A complete explanation for the patterns {{has not yet been}} obtained. All honeycomb outgassing holes have a small discoloration ring around them that varies in color. The shadow cast by a suspended wire on the earth face surface is not easily explained by either solar photons or by ram flux. The shadows and the dark/light regions cannot be explained consistently by the process of solar ultraviolet paint-darkening modulated by ram flux <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> of the paint...|$|E
30|$|There {{might be}} a {{possible}} mechanism other than the above-mentioned β-O- 4 bond cleavage for the conversion of non-phenolic lignin moiety into the corresponding phenolic counterpart. When a non-phenolic aromatic ring is hydroxylated by some oxidation reactions, a corresponding phenolic counterpart is produced. The addition of hydroxyl radical, one of the AOS working in <b>oxygen</b> <b>bleaching</b> process, to a non-phenolic aromatic ring is an instance of this hydroxylation. Because our previous results indicated that a common non-phenolic lignin model compound, 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzyl alcohol (VII in Fig.  3), is fairly stable under conditions similar to those employed in this study even when AOS are operative [4, 6, 8], non-phenolic aromatic ring of lignin model compounds {{are estimated to be}} resistant toward this hydroxylation reaction. Therefore, the conversion of non-phenolic lignin moiety into the corresponding phenolic counterpart by β-O- 4 bond cleavage is focused on in this study.|$|E
40|$|Chemical pulp mills {{have a need}} {{to diversify}} their {{end-product}} portfolio due to the current changing bio-economy. In this study, the methane potential of brown, <b>oxygen</b> delignified and <b>bleached</b> pulp were evaluated {{in order to assess}} the potential of converting traditional fibers; as well as microcrystalline cellulose and filtrates; to energy. Results showed that high yields (380 mL CH 4 /gVS) were achieved with bleached fibers which correlates with the lower presence of lignin. Filtrates from the hydrolysis process on the other hand, had the lowest yields (253 mL CH 4 /gVS) due to the high amount of acid and lignin compounds that cause inhibition. Overall, substrates had a biodegradability above 50 % which demonstrates that they can be subjected to efficient anaerobic digestion. An energy and cost estimation showed that the energy produced can be translated into a significant profit and that methane production can be a promising new alternative option for chemical pulp mills.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{production}} of dissolving pulp from fast growing 30 -year-old local plantation aspen was investigated. The mill-made chips of aspen (Populus deltoides) after being pre-hydrolyzed with water at 170 ºC, were pulped with a soda-AQ pulping process at a kappa number of 15. It was further delignified to a kappa number of 9. 2 using a single stage <b>oxygen</b> delignification and <b>bleached</b> with a D 0 ED 1 bleaching sequence at different kappa factor. The pulp viscosity was increased at higher brightness and similar α-cellulose when the kappa factor was increased from 0. 30 to 0. 45 in the D 0 stage of the D 0 ED 1 bleaching sequence, due to higher lignin dissolution and more fiber purification. The results showed that pre-hydrolyzed soda-AQ dissolving pulp {{can be made from}} Populus deltoides at a high level of alpha-cellulose content and acceptable levels of brightness and viscosity by means of proper control and optimization of pre-hydrolysis, pulping, and oxygen pretreatment conditions, and an optimized DED bleaching sequence...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{industry}} {{is the main}} global consumer of kaolin. It is mostly used as paper filler, due to its lower cost as compared to pulp cost. Color removal process from pulp - chemical bleaching - determines final pulp's characteristics. Effort {{has been made to}} make possible to obtain less toxic bleaching processes. This study aims to evaluate the influence of three bleaching sequences, on kaolin retention and paper properties. Industrial eucalyptus kraft pulp, <b>oxygen</b> pre-delignified, was <b>bleached</b> by the sequences D(E+P) DP (reference), AHT(E+P) DP (ECF-A) and AHTD(E+P) P (ECF-Light). Kaolin was added to the pulps after its refining in PFI mill to 40 °SR, corresponding to an amount of 20 % weighted kaolin for each handsheet. The results showed the addition of 20 % kaolin significantly presented lower retention for ECF-Light sample, remaining reference sequence equal to A-ECF sequence; the higher the fines content, the greater the retention load; the ECF-Light sequence showed higher cost, lower tear resistance and low internal resistance of fibers; smoothness and compression were not influenced by bleaching sequence or by adding kaolin...|$|R
