25|$|Turner's {{college career}} {{was a rather}} {{turbulent}} one. He first played with Orange County Community College but his brash, flash style didn't enamour him to his coach. On one road trip, Turner and a teammate got into a scuffle after that player knocked Turner's tray in a fast-food joint. The coach told Turner to cool it but <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> back on campus, Turner exacted retribution. The next day when the coach saw that teammate sporting a black eye, he summoned Turner to his office and kicked him off the team.|$|E
25|$|Another {{test was}} electronic; {{they were asked}} to {{influence}} the burnout point of a common fuse. After they were given a chance to work it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the fuse until it blew. The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> used to it. In fact, they were simply palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down {{on one end of the}} fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as psi effects.|$|E
25|$|At this time, John Canan and Ralph Kilbourne {{went back}} to Joseph Gale and {{reminded}} him of his promise to assist on the project and serve as captain <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> further along in the building. Gale then went and inspected the ship to determine if it would be seaworthy, and after determining it was, he went home and sold his farm and farming equipment. After moving his family to Champoeg, Oregon, Gale then devoted much of the next year to completing the vessel. On May 19, 1841 the partially completed vessel was launched and moved up the Willamette River to near Oregon City. In the fall of 1841, George Davis and Henry Woods dropped out of the project, which reduced the number of partners to five. Kilbourne and Gale did most of the remaining work, while Thomas J. Hubbard did the blacksmithing.|$|E

25|$|A sequel {{was planned}} but was later cancelled. Zack Snyder {{stated that he}} would only be {{producing}} the sequel instead of reprising {{his role as the}} director due to working on Watchmen when he announced the film. The script of Army of the Dead was written by Zack Snyder and Joby Harold. Filming for Army of the Dead was to start <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> a director as the producing studios had approved the script. Also according to Deborah Snyder, the film was set in Las Vegas, and the town had to be contained to stop the outbreak of zombies. The film's producing studios were Universal Studios (who released the first) and Warner Bros. Entertainment (who released most of Snyder's films since 300) and the film was set to be directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., director of The Thing, the 2011 prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 cult classic of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Ashley C. Williams as Lindsay, an American tourist and {{the central}} section of the centipede. Auditioning for the roles of Jenny and Lindsay took place in New York City. Six said during the auditioning process, many actresses walked out of {{readings}} in disgust after hearing the full nature of the role. Others {{thought they would be}} able to take on the role, but found it was [...] "too much" [...] for them <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> onto their hands and knees behind another actor. Williams expressed concerns about the nudity expected of her in the film, but took the role when she was assured it would be modest and of a non-sexual nature.|$|E
500|$|In May 1969, U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird began {{publicly}} questioning North Vietnamese {{treatment of}} U.S. prisoners. [...] On June 5, 1969, a United Press International report described a Radio Hanoi broadcast that denied any such mistreatment. The broadcast used excerpts from McCain's forced [...] "confession" [...] {{of a year}} before, including a statement where {{he said he had}} bombed [...] "cities, towns and villages" [...] and had received [...] "very good medical treatment" [...] as a prisoner. [...] In late 1969, treatment of McCain and the other POWs suddenly improved. [...] North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had died the previous month, possibly causing a change in policy towards POWs. [...] Also, a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected, and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, which included McCain's brother Joe, heightened awareness of the POWs' plight. [...] In December 1969, McCain was transferred back to the Hoa Lo [...] "Hanoi Hilton"; his solitary confinement ended in March 1970. [...] When the prisoners talked about {{what they wanted to do}} <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> out, McCain said he wanted to become President. [...] McCain consented to a January 1970 interview outside Hoa Lo with Spanish-born, Cuban psychologist , that was published in the official Cuban newspaper Granma. McCain talked about his life and expressed no remorse for his bombing North Vietnam, and Barral proclaimed him [...] "an insensitive individual without human depth." [...] The POWs issued an edict forbidding any further such interviews, and despite pressure from his captors, McCain subsequently refused to see any anti-war groups or journalists sympathetic to the North Vietnamese regime.|$|E

Relations who had not been on speaking terms for years forgot their quarrels and strolled about the grounds in perfect harmony, abusing Baxter. The general verdict was that he was insane.|$|R
2500|$|In the 2007 Federal election, Garrett was re-elected to {{his seat}} with a 4.56% swing towards him. However, his {{campaign}} was fraught {{with a number of}} tactical errors, including journalist Steve Price claiming that Garrett had said to him that Labor would simply change all their policies <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> into power.

2500|$|The {{independent}} settlers of the Willamette Valley {{were left}} {{in the same situation}} as before, so they met {{and came up with a}} plan to alleviate their need for cattle.

During his time there, several employees sought medical attention with complaints of persistent and increasing stomach pains. Around this time, he met Kristin Kinney, a nurse at Riverside Hospital.

2500|$|Qualifying at Imola during Round 2 of {{the season}} {{highlighted}} both the problems and advantage that the lowline Brabham BT55 had during 1986. Acceleration out of the Variante Bassa chicane before the start-finish line showed the Brabhams as among the slowest cars when they crossed the line. However, {{by the time they}} reached the speed trap just before the braking area at Tosa, they were among the quickest. The cars were slow out of the corners, but <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> up to speed the lowline aerodynamics and the [...] BMW turbo did their job and with the reduced drag, from the high speed Tamburello curve both Patrese and de Angelis accelerated quicker than any other cars. At Imola, the Brabhams were almost 4 seconds off pole with Patrese qualifying 16th and de Angelis 19th. The Brabham-BMWs were in fact slower than both the Benettons and Arrows which used the conventional upright BMW engine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Music" [...] {{was directed by}} Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund, who previously directed Madonna's [...] "Ray of Light" [...] video in 1998. The video was shot in Los Angeles, California, in April 2000, and stars Madonna and her longtime backup singer Niki Haris and actress Debi Mazar as well as comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, as his famous character Ali G. Madonna's manager, Caresse Norman, said about Baron Cohen's collaboration: [...] "We {{came up with the}} video idea, and she thought he would be great in it." [...] Jonas Åkerlund has stated that originally they were planning on having Chris Rock be in the music video, but he wanted Sacha Baron Cohen instead. He said that at that time Baron Cohen was not known in the US, and he had to get people tapes of the Da Ali G Show so they could see the Ali G character.

2500|$|However, Lu did {{not remain}} {{chancellor}} long on this occasion. [...] His elevation to chancellorship {{was intended to}} replace Cui Yin, and was carried out {{at a time when}} Emperor Zhaozong and the imperial officials had fled Chang'an and gone to Zhenguo Circuit (鎮國, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) to flee an attack that Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit was carrying out against Chang'an; <b>once</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to Zhenguo, Zhenguo's military governor Han Jian, with the emperor under his physical control, instigated Cui's removal and exile (to be the military governor of Wu'an Circuit (武安, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan). [...] However, soon thereafter, Cui elicited the aid of the powerful warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), and Zheng submitted a petition protesting Cui's removal and further suggesting that Emperor Zhaozong move the capital to the eastern capital Luoyang (i.e., out of Han's reach and in Zhu's territory). [...] Han, in fear, cancelled Cui's removal and had him made chancellor again. [...] Thereafter, Cui, resenting Lu for replacing him, falsely accused Lu of being an ally of Li Maozhen's and had Lu demoted to be the prefect of Xia Prefecture (硤州, in modern Yichang, Hubei). [...] (Both Lu's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang blamed Lu's demotion on, according to them, Lu's opposition to the launching of a campaign against Li Maozhen that led to Li Maozhen's attack on Chang'an; however, as Lu's elevation to the chancellorship came after Li Maozhen's attack, that appears to be unlikely.) ...|$|E
