40|$|In {{the context}} of an {{infinitely}} repeated oligopoly game, we study (optimal) collusion among firms that have both price and quantity as a strategic choice variable. We consider two modes of production: production in advance and production to order. For both types of industry, we comparea price cartel with a price-quota cartel and analyze if and under what conditions firms prefer the latter to the former. We find three main results. First, when production is in advance <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>market</b> demand is relatively elastic, an additional agreement on outputs may be required to solve coordination and incentive problems. Second, if production is in advance <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>market</b> demand is relatively inelastic, then a price-quota cartel is always more profitable than a price cartel. Finally, with production to order, collusion may not be sustainable without a quota agreement...|$|R

The commercial success was expected, as Peter Main, the executive vice president <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> stated [...] "There's no question about it; kids love to play Pokemon.

500|$|Yoshizawa placed greater {{emphasis}} on story {{as opposed to the}} arcade version, and he wrote and designed the plot that included over 20 minutes of cinematic cutscenes – the first time an NES game contained such sequences. Tecmo called the cutscene system [...] "Tecmo Theater", in which the game reveals the storyline between Acts through the usage of animated sequences. These sequences are used {{at the beginning of each}} Act to introduce new characters such as Irene Lew, Walter Smith, and the Jaquio. This feature uses techniques such as close-ups, alternate camera angles, differing background music, and sound effects. It was used to make the game more enjoyable for players. Unlike earlier titles such as Final Fantasy, the cutscenes consisted of large anime art on the top half of the screen with dialogue on the bottom half. This made the artistic style more reminiscent of other manga titles such as LupinIII and Golgo13. Dimitri Criona, TecmoUSA's director <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>and</b> <b>marketing,</b> said that the advantages of console games over arcade games allowed the creation of a longer game and the inclusion of cutscenes, which Tecmo trademarked as [...] "cinema screens"; he noted the lack of motivation to drop quarters that has allowed this on home consoles, which required a different reward structure than in arcade games. The game contains a feature that was originally a glitch but left in the final game intentionally, according to Masato Kato. When losing to any of the final three bosses in the game, the player is sent back to the beginning of the sixth act.|$|E
