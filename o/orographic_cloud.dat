During the 2014 winter field campaign, between 20  January and 28  February, the model simulations regularly underpredicted the observed ice number concentration by 10 3  L − 1. Previous literature has proposed several processes for the high ice number concentrations in <b>orographic</b> <b>clouds,</b> including an increased ice nucleating particle (INP) concentration, secondary ice multiplication and the advection of surface ice crystals into <b>orographic</b> <b>clouds.</b> We find that increasing INP concentrations in the model prevents the simulation of the mixed-phase clouds that were witnessed during the INUPIAQ campaign at Jungfraujoch. Additionally, the inclusion of secondary ice production upwind of Jungfraujoch into the WRF simulations cannot consistently produce enough ice splinters to match the observed concentrations. A flux of surface hoar crystals {{was included in the}} WRF model, which simulated ice concentrations comparable to the measured ice number concentrations, without depleting the liquid water content (LWC) simulated in the model. Our simulations therefore suggest that high ice concentrations observed in mixed-phase clouds at Jungfraujoch are caused by a flux of surface hoar crystals into the <b>orographic</b> <b>clouds...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Orographic</b> <b>cloud</b> is {{investigated}} {{in a global}} context using both observations and a global climate model. Climatological cloud amounts from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) are {{used in conjunction with}} wind reanalyses to study orographic cirrus amounts over the globe. Significant increases in cirrus are seen over many land areas, with respect to any surrounding oceans. To aid in interpretation of this result special attention is given to the New Zealand region as a case study for <b>orographic</b> <b>cloud</b> formation. Cirrus is found be more prevalent over New Zealand when compared to the adjacent ocean to the west. ISCCP cloud amounts are also compared with a ten year simulation of the UK Meteorological Office's Unified Model. The model is found to be considerably lacking in both cirrus and total high cloud over major mountain ranges. The model is also found to lack trailing cirrus clouds in the lee of orography despite the inclusion of a prognostic ice variable capable of being advected by the model winds. To improve the simulations of orographic cirrus and high cloud in the Unified Model a linear hydrostatic gravity wave scheme that predicts both the amplitude and phase of subgrid orographic gravity waves is introduced. The temperature perturbation caused by these waves in the troposphere is used to modify the amount of both liquid and ice cloud. One important feature of the parameterisation is that the launch amplitude of the gravity waves is predicted by a directional variance function which accounts for anisotropy in the subgrid orography. The parameterisation is explored {{in the context of an}} off-line testbed before implementation in the Unified Model. In a ten year simulation the parameterisation is found to increase the high cloud amounts over a number of the world's major mountain ranges. However, this extra cloud is optically thick and unable to remove the deficiency in optically thin cirrus amounts.

40|$|Long-term {{monitoring}} {{of rain and}} cloud water {{has been carried out}} at a high level site within the urban plume downwind of Manchester in north-west England. Samples have been taken weekly at Holme Moss. The site experiences significant <b>orographic</b> <b>cloud</b> cover, resulting in enhancement of rainfall volume via the seeder–feeder process. Samples are analysed for major ions, with the results being interpreted {{in the light of the}} effects of the seeder–feeder enhancement and reductions in UK emissions of pollutants. Rainfall volume enhancement is dependent on the spatial and temporal extent of <b>orographic</b> <b>cloud</b> at the site, with resultant consequences on ionic strength in the samples. Large rainfall amounts are associated with longer cloud duration and lower cloud base. Rain passing through the cloud scavenges proportionately more larger droplets, resulting in relatively lower ionic concentration. Coupled with increased washout upwind, this limits the amount of deposition, with some ions showing a decrease in deposition at high rainfall amounts. Clear downward trends are seen in sulphate concentration in rain and cloud water, with both emissions reduction and the dilution effect of increasing rainfall being responsible. Less significant downward trends are observed for nitrate, although this is in line with national patterns of deposition. Deposition at Holme Moss for all ions is dominated by the prevailing, predominantly maritime, southwesterly airflow, although for non-marine ions there are significant contributions from the industrial areas of Yorkshire to the east, and to a lesser extent the Birmingham conurbation to the south. ...|$|E

Several previously published case studies suc-cessfully documented the physical response in clouds and precipitation to ground-based seeding with silver iodide and liquid propane.

Careful docu-mentation of seeding plume transport and dispersion coupled with aircraft and ground-based measurements {{within and outside}} the seeding plume are used to verify the steps in the conceptual model for <b>orographic</b> <b>cloud</b> seeding. It is shown that seeding produced significant increases in ice crystal concentrations (well above 10 times the natural back-ground at aircraft level) and strong indications of increased precipitation at the surface (> 3 times the precipitation rate measured outside the seeding plume).

Measurements of soil 210 Pb inventories along a transect through complex terrain in north Britain were made to quantify the orographic enhancement of wet deposition, at Great Dun Fell in Cumbria. At the hill summit (∼ 800 m asl) precipitation of approximately 2000 mm year- 1 exceeds that on the low ground upwind by a factor of 2. 0.

We investigate which sulfate sources dominate the in-cloud addition of sulfate to different particle classes as an air parcel passes through an <b>orographic</b> <b>cloud.</b> Sulfate aerosol, SO 2 and H 2 SO 4 were collected upwind, in-cloud and downwind of an <b>orographic</b> <b>cloud</b> for three cloud measurement events during the Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia campaign in autumn 2010 (HCCT- 2010). Combined SEM and NanoSIMS analysis of single particles allowed the δ 34 S of particulate sulfate to be resolved for particle size and type. The most important in-cloud SO 2 oxidation pathway at HCCT- 2010 was aqueous oxidation catalysed by transition metal ions (TMI catalysis), which was shown with single particle isotope analyses to occur primarily in cloud droplets nucleated on coarse mineral dust. In contrast, direct uptake of H 2 SO 4 (g) and ultrafine particulate were the most important sources modifying fine mineral dust, increasing its hygroscopicity and facilitating activation. Sulfate addition to "mixed" particles (secondary organic and inorganic aerosol) and coated soot was dominated by in-cloud aqueous SO 2 oxidation by H 2 O 2 and direct uptake of H 2 SO 4 (g) and ultrafine particle sulfate, depending on particle size mode and time of day.

40|$|Urban air {{pollution}} and industrial {{air pollution}} have been shown qualitatively to suppress rain and snow. Here, precipitation losses over topographical barriers downwind of major coastal urban areas in California and {{in the land of}} Israel that amount to 15 %– 25 % of the annual precipitation are quantified. The suppression occurs mainly in the relatively shallow <b>orographic</b> <b>clouds</b> within the cold air mass of cyclones. The suppression that occurs over the upslope side is coupled with similar percentage enhancement on the much drier downslope side of the hills. The evidence includes significant decreasing trends of the ratio of hill to coast precipitation during the twentieth century in polluted areas in line with the increasing emissions during the same period, whereas no trends are observed in similar nearby pristine areas. The evidence suggests that air-pollution aerosols that are incorporated in <b>orographic</b> <b>clouds</b> slow down cloud-drop coalescence and riming on ice precipitation and hence delay the conversion of cloud water into precipitation.

40|$|Ice {{formation}} in <b>orographic</b> mixed-phase <b>clouds</b> can enhance precipitation and {{depends on the}} type of aerosols that serve as ice nucleating particles (INP). The resulting precipitation from these clouds is a viable source of water, especially for regions such as the California Sierra Nevada. Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} sources of INP that impact <b>orographic</b> <b>clouds</b> is important for assessing water availability in California. This study presents a multi-site, multi-year analysis of single particle insoluble residues in precipitation samples that likely influenced cloud ice and precipitation formation above Yosemite National Park. Dust and biological particles represented the dominant fraction of the residues (64 % on average). Cloud glaciation, determined using GOES satellite observations, not only depended on high cloud tops (greater than 6. 2 km) and low temperatures (less than - 26 C), but also on the composition of the dust and biological residues. The greatest prevalence of ice-phase clouds occurred in conjunction with biologically-rich residues and mineral dust rich in calcium, followed by iron and aluminosilicates. Dust and biological particles are known to be efficient INP, thus these residues are what likely influenced ice {{formation in}} clouds above the sites and subsequent precipitation quantities reaching the surface during events with similar meteorology. The goal of this study is to use precipitation chemistry information to gain a better understanding of the potential sources of INP in the south-central Sierra Nevada, where cloud-aerosol-precipitation interactions are under-studied and where mixed-phase <b>orographic</b> <b>clouds</b> represent a key element in the generation of precipitation and thus the water supply in California...|$|R

The {{emphasis is on the}} physical evidence that key processes occur in the hypothesized chain of events from release of seeding agent to snow reaching the ground. The range of opinions concerning the technology is briefly noted. Some problems related to reliable production of silver iodide are discussed. Evidence is reviewed from a number of locations showing that excess supercooled liquid water often exists during portions of winter storms, though usually in limited amounts. Much of the liquid water is found near the windward slope and crest of the mountains. The main problem with seeding winter orographic clouds is the transport and a~sociated dispersion of the silver iodide between its release and the supercooled water zone. An associated problem is ensuring that the seeding agent reaches a sufficiently cold region of liquid cloud in an appropriate concentration. While adequate transport and dispersion can be difficult with airborne seeding, it is a special problem with low-level ground generators. Evidence is cited showing that ground seeding projects have frequently failed to enhance the silver content of the target area snowfall. It is recommended that the silver content be monitored in all winter orographic projects which use silver iodide as a minimum first step in documenting whether or not the seeding agent was transported to the target. Where practical, additional testing of the physical hypothesis should be accomplished to improve validation of winter <b>orographic</b> <b>cloud</b> seeding...|$|E
