5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans. At least {{as early as the}} 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E

5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> and lesbian organizations.

Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.|$|E
