Water was supplied to the top pound by the feeder from the Afon Cynon, and later by the pumping engine at Tyr Founder. The Cwmbach lock had a fall of 9.2 ft, after which the middle pound crossed the Nant Pennar stream on an aqueduct to arrive at the Dyffryn lock, which lowered the level by another 3.8 ft.

The residual energy was the lowest for the flat stepped weir. The data for the stepped spillway configuration with in-line and staggered configurations of flat and pooled steps showed large differences in terms of residual head in the transverse direction consistent with the threedimensional flow motion.

50|$|Careful {{selection}} of the reaction tank material is essential along with control of the current, flow rate and pH. Electrodes can be made of iron, aluminum, titanium, graphite or other materials, depending upon the wastewater to be treated and the contaminants to be removed. Temperature and pressure appear to have only a minor effect on the process. In the EC process the water-contaminant mixture separates into a floating layer, a mineral-rich flocculated sediment, and clear water. The floating layer is generally removed {{by means of an}} <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> or similar removal method. The aggregated flocculent mass settles either in the reaction vessel or in subsequent settling tanks due to gravitational force.|$|E
50|$|Although {{sedimentation}} {{might occur}} in tanks of other shapes, removal of accumulated solids is easiest with conveyor belts in rectangular tanks or with scrapers rotating around the central axis of circular tanks. Mechanical solids removal devices move {{as slowly as}} practical to minimize resuspension of settled solids. Tanks are sized to give water an optimal residence time within the tank. Economy favors using small tanks; but if flow rate through the tank is too high, most particles will not have sufficient time to settle, and will be carried with the treated water. Considerable {{attention is focused on}} reducing water inlet and outlet velocities to minimize turbulence and promote effective settling throughout available tank volume. Baffles are used to prevent fluid velocities at the tank entrance from extending into the tank; and <b>overflow</b> <b>weirs</b> are used to uniformly distribute flow from liquid leaving the tank over a wide area of the surface to minimize resuspension of settling particles.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} novel experiments testing the relative efficiencies in passing juvenile salmon �parr � through a range of model fish passes incorporating devices such as vertical slots, orifices, weirs, and combinations of all three. The hydraulic parameters—head loss, velocity patterns, and turbulence structure—were measured under each set of test conditions. A significantly higher proportion of fish moved through submerged orifices and vertical slots than through <b>overflow</b> <b>weirs</b> for any given flow rate, velocity, and head loss. The orifice and vertical slot efficiencies were directly correlated to the velocities at their entrances. To reach the tested devices, salmon parr tended to remain {{near the bottom of}} the flume and followed paths providing them with low velocities and cover along the sides of the test arena. The movements of salmon approaching entrances were consistent with energy-conserving strategies.

There is a retaining wall or <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> separating the tube bundle from the reboiler section where the residual reboiled liquid (called the bottoms product) is withdrawn, so that the tube bundle is kept covered with liquid and reduce the amount of low-boiling compounds in the bottoms product.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} stretch of its route, the channel forms the {{boundary}} between the Reading suburbs of Beansheaf Farm, Fords Farm, Calcot, Southcote and Coley Park (all {{to the north of the}} brook), and the Kennet flood meadows (to the south). At Calcot, the brook passes Calcot Mill, one of two water mills that were driven by the brook and which originally belonged to the abbey. In this area the channel gives its name to the nearby civil parish of Holybrook. In some stretches, especially behind Coley Park, the brook is noticeably embanked along the hillside above the lower water meadows, demonstrating its artificial origins. Once past Coley Park the Holy Brook flows through the Victorian suburb of Coley, before reaching the town centre. At Coley, an <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> diverts excess water back to the Kennet, at a point which was once the site of a lido.|$|E
50|$|A butler's sink is a {{rectangular}} ceramic sink with a rounded rim {{which is set}} into a work surface. There are generally two kinds of butler's sinks: The London sink and the Belfast sink. In 2006, both types of sinks usually were 61 cm across and 46 cm front-to-back, with a depth of 22.5 cm. London sinks were originally shallower than Belfast sinks. (One plumbing guide in 1921 suggested that the Belfast sink was 38 cm deep.) Some believe this was because London had less access to fresh water (and thus a greater need to conserve water), but this theory is now contested. It is more likely the two sinks had different roles within the household. But that difference usually {{does not exist in}} the modern era, and both sinks are now shallow. The primary difference both in the past and today between a Belfast and London sink is that the Belfast sink is fitted with an <b>overflow</b> <b>weir</b> which prevented water from spilling over the sink's edge by draining it away and down into the wastewater plumbing.|$|E
50|$|Numerous flood {{retarding}} basins exist along Carbon Canyon Creek below Carbon Canyon Dam. These basins are Miller, Placentia, Raymond, and Gilbert, in downstream order.

Miller Basin Complex is approximately3.5 mi downstream of the dam at the confluence of Carbon Canyon Channel and Atwood Channel. It consists of a small stilling basin, retarding basin, desilting basin, and flow diversion structure. Flows entering Miller Basin Complex first run through the stilling basin, then into the desilting basin where a set of <b>overflow</b> <b>weirs</b> split flows between Carbon Canyon DiversionChannel (diverting flows to the Santa Ana River) and the Miller Retarding Basin.

Nevertheless, the experiments were conducted by focusing on the effect of varying flowrate, water depth differences and apron length; other parameters were left constant. The results show that the formation of scour hole is dependent on the three mentioned parameters whereas the increase in flowrate, increase in water depth differences and decrease in apron length will all lead to an increase in the scour depth.
