50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, oiled silk was used as a {{waterproofing}} medium in adult clothing, but not until latex rubber was commercially available from the 1920s did the idea of wearing a protective garment became commonplace. Ladies panties were worn with a waterproof latex crotch insert or a waterproof panel in the back of an underskirt, to make coping with heavy periods easier and socially safer. The original diaper covers were made from <b>oiled</b> <b>wool,</b> which was naturally waterproof. Newly available latex pants for covering diapers reduced the difficulties in caring for young children on long journeys, on special social occasions, and overnight.|$|E
50|$|The usual {{clothing}} for Arctic or mountain regions is a parka and heavy insulated mittens with long gauntlets {{to protect the}} wrist, gaiters to keep snow and moisture {{out of the top}} of the boots, and wool-felt or down-insulated booties. In high wind-chills, these garments may be supplemented by a mask, usually of <b>oiled</b> <b>wool.</b> In Arctic areas, the typical modern insulation is very fine hydrophobic polyester fiber batting sewn in laps between a nylon shell. The sewing must not compress or quilt the insulation, because the heat leaks out through the thin spots. Most designers now include a moisture barrier on the inner side to prevent condensation from a body's moisture from condensing and freezing in the insulation. Sometimes the moisture barrier has several layers of aluminized plastic film to reflect infrared back to the body. If plastic film is near the skin, usually some lightweight absorbent cloth is between the skin and the film, for comfort.|$|E

Cities in Hispania Citerior such as Valencia were enhanced, and irrigation aqueducts were introduced.

40|$|Publications on roman {{textiles}} {{have described}} the processing of wool in the following operational sequence: shearing, scouring, combing and spinning. As one can exclude large scale spinning of ‘crude’ wool and degreasing makes fibers too dry and tangled to be worked with, {{it seems likely that}} even in the classical world it was common practice to <b>oil</b> <b>wool</b> before combing and spinning. This procedure has been regularly attested from the late Medieval period up to the present day but was first described in detail in a fifteenth century manuscript from Florence. There are however a few clues that might suggest that the <b>oiling</b> of <b>wool</b> was already known and indeed widespread in classical times and that olive oil was in common use for this purpose. Archaeological evidence for a connection between <b>oil</b> and <b>wool</b> would seem to be limited to a site in Cyprus where it is believed that scented oils were produced, amongst other things, to perfume wool. A reference to this technique could be inferred by Homer’s description of the looms in Alcinoo’s palace “dripping with oil”; and on several attic vases there are scenes of women engaged in processing or perhaps more specifically in the <b>oiling</b> of <b>wool.</b> The possibility that the Romans used <b>oil</b> for softening <b>wool</b> seems convincing above all for the number of classical references to the initial degreasing of untreated wool to remove lanolin, {{as well as to the}} degreasing of finished textiles with fuller’s earth, perhaps to remove oil added in the process. Further information may be gleaned from inscribed lead tags that refer to initial washing and degreasing (indicating lana purgata as opposed to lana sucida), perhaps followed by softening (lana mulsa). Confirmation of the antiquity of this missing link in wool to textile processing has clear implications for future archaeological research in the fields both of textiles and the production/distribution of olive oil for industrial use...|$|R

40|$|Strict {{ecological}} legislation, {{especially in}} highly developed countries, imposed {{requirements for the}} purification of industrial effluents {{and the need for}} efficient oil clean up after sea and inland water spills. Although numerous processes have been developed, the application of sorbents {{is still one of the}} most efficient methods to remove heavy metal ions, dyes and crude oil from water. Recently, special attention was paid to sorbents based on natural fibres. A review of studies concerning the sorption properties of wool is presented in this paper. The presence of various functional groups on the wool fibre surface contributes to the efficient sorption of heavy metal ions and dyes. A hydrophobic, scaly surface and fibre crimp strongly influence the high sorption capacity of <b>wool</b> for <b>oil.</b> <b>Wool</b> has great sorption potential even as a recycled material. Accordingly, it can be used as a viable substitute to commercially available synthetic sorbents that show poor biodegradab ility...|$|R

The original publication {{is available at}} [URL] assessed wool and conformation traits form part of the selection objective in wool sheep enterprises. The present study investigated the genetic, phenotypic and environmental correlations for nematode resistance (using faecal worm egg count (FEC)) with subjectively assessed wool and conformation traits. The Merino sheep flock (consisting of four lines) maintained on Tygerhoek Research Farm was used. Fixed effects of selection line, birth type, sex, age of dam in years, year of birth, and sex*birth year interaction {{had a significant effect}} on all subjective traits. At genetic level, log transformed FEC was significantly related to <b>wool</b> <b>oil</b> only at 0. 18 ± 0. 09, staple formation at 0. 29 ± 0. 10, and topline at − 0. 33 ± 0. 11.

Heavy investment was made in ersatz (synthetic) industries to produce goods from natural resources Germany did have, such as textiles made from cellulose, rubber and oil made from coal, sugar and ethyl alcohol from wood, and materials for the print industry produced from potato tops. There were also ersatz foodstuffs such as coffee made from chicory and beer from sugar beet.
