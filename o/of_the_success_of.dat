5|$|At {{least a dozen}} {{recordings}} {{were issued}} in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure {{in a number of}} artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in Peter Weir's Fearless (1993), and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996). An art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.|$|E
5|$|Between 80 and 90 {{percent of}} the {{residents}} of New Orleans were evacuated before the hurricane struck, testifying to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the evacuation measures.

The Louisiana Superdome was used to house and support some of those who were unable to evacuate. Television shots frequently focused on the Superdome {{as a symbol of the}} flooding occurring in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> infantry tactics {{and changes in}} weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, {{the role of the}} war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E

5|$|In 1978 Burnet {{decided to}} officially retire; in {{retirement}} he wrote two books. During this time, {{he missed his}} laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet {{was one of three}} contributors to Challenge to Australia, writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Sid Sheinberg, the {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios and a seasoned attorney, {{was trying to find}} a way to get his company into the booming video game market. In April, he learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E
5|$|Selena's {{family was}} interviewed by Julie Chen of The Early Show about Ones. Chen asked Selena's father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla Jr., about his {{intention}} to re-release her songs on Ones.

Chris Pérez, her widower, told Chen that the recording was released for Selena's new fans; building on the film's popularity, explaining that the family used the DVD to showcase the singer for those who never saw her perform live.|$|E
5|$|Smart's Hymns {{are one of}} {{the first}} works of hymns {{dedicated}} to children, and they are intended to teach Christian virtues. Unlike some of the other works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum, such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs, this work was a success and went into many immediate editions. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> this work lies in the simplicity and accessibility of the text. However, Smart died before he ever saw the proceeds of the work and never learned of the book's success.|$|E

5|$|The Operations Research Section (ORS) {{was also}} set up in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> such {{programs}} in Fighter and Bomber Commands. Many scientists were appointed to the ORS Coastal Command. Some acted as advisors to Air Marshal Bowhill. Four sections were set up; planned flying and maintenance, ASO, A/S, and weather and navigation. Resources were spread evenly. However, A/S received more attention. The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and {{a certain degree of}} ascendancy achieved.|$|E
5|$|Throughout her career, Godwin worked {{consistently}} {{with her}} agent, John Hawkins, but worked with several different publishing houses. Godwin's early books were published by Knopf. After the editor for The Perfectionists, David Segal, died suddenly {{of a heart}} attack, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf became her editor for her next four books. Godwin credits Gottlieb for much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> her early works. Later on, when Godwin's then-recent books were less widely read, USA Today commented {{that this could be}} in part because she was no longer working with Gottlieb. After Knopf, Godwin contracted with Viking, who offered larger advances and more publicity for her books.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg Airport, officially {{opened in}} 1938 because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>of</b> the cement industry, {{had in fact}} {{operated}} flights to Copenhagen since 1936. During the German invasion of Denmark in 1940, the airport was captured by German paratroopers {{on the night of}} the 21 April as a base for German aircraft flying to Norway. On 13 August 1940, a dozen Bristol Blenheim bombers of No. 82 Squadron RAF were launched against the Luftwaffe airfield during one of the most disastrous Royal Air Force raids of the war. One turned back because of fuel problems, but all of the remaining 11 were shot down by enemy fighters and/or flak batteries within 20 minutes. After the war, the Royal Air Force destroyed all the German facilities including planes, hangars and equipment but left the passenger facilities intact.|$|E
