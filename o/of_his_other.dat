5|$|Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes {{are all in}} {{straightforward}} ternary or episodic form, {{sometimes with}} a coda. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies {{and the use of}} drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op.63 No.3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.|$|E

5|$|Despite some {{immediate}} confiscations {{after the}} siege, {{by the time}} of the Restoration of Charles II, the Somerset family had managed to recover most of their possessions, including Raglan Castle.

5|$|The first {{movement}} is in 3/4 time, hitherto uncommon among Haydn's opening movements.

50|$|Demuth began {{a series}} of {{paintings}} in 1919, inspired by the architecture of Lancaster. In creating these works, Demuth notably opted not to use watercolors, instead created the works in oil and tempera.

Demuth created works of this manner until 1933, two years before his untimely death.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes {{have emerged in}} Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions. In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> responsibilities.|$|E
