5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Book Nine {{introduces}} {{the details of}} Fyodor's murder and describes the interrogation of Dmitri as he is questioned for the crime he maintains he did not commit. The alleged motive for the crime is robbery. Dmitri was {{known to have been}} completely destitute earlier that evening, but is suddenly seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> thousands of rubles shortly after his father's murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor Karamazov had set aside for Grushenka has disappeared. Dmitri explains that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles Katerina gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first meeting with Grushenka—another drunken orgy—and sewed up the rest in a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina in the name of honor, he says. The lawyers are not convinced by this. All of the evidence points against Dmitri; the only other person in the house {{at the time of the}} murder was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he apparently suffered the day before. As a result of the overwhelming evidence against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the patricide and taken away to prison to await trial.|$|E
40|$|M. A. (Social Work) Abstract: The study {{investigated}} the survival strategies of homeless women living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> their children. Poverty is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> increase and is giving rise to the phenomenon of homeless women with children. Internationally and in South Africa, women living in poverty are said to face {{the risk of being}} homeless far more than men. <b>The</b> study focussed <b>on</b> homeless women with children in the Hillbrow area. Hillbrow is known for a high number of young people living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets; however, not enough {{attention has been paid to}} the ever-increasing phenomenon of women living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> their children. <b>The</b> study was aimed at finding the reason why women choose to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> their children. <b>The</b> main interest was on exploring how they survived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> their children. This was done through a qualitative exploratory method. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 10 homeless women who lived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> their children. <b>The</b> results reflected that homeless women with children were largely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> as a result of poverty and unemployment. These women were subjected to many difficult conditions such as lack of access to clean water and sanitation, harassment and abuse, and exposure to inclement weather conditions. However, they were surviving due to their own inner resilience, the support from NGOs, and some being in receipt of child support grants. It is recommended that more support be given to NGOs that support homeless women with children and a multipronged approach be developed between the Departments of Housing, Social Development and Public Works in order to address the challenges of homeless women with children...|$|R

500|$|As a child, Gilberto {{lived in}} the city of Lagoa da Prata with his father (a blacksmith), his mother (a housewife) and three sisters. His family lived in a small house which his father built, in the {{district}} of Usina Luciânia.

2500|$|The {{prevalent}} {{practice is}} that one eats in the sukkah on the eighth day, but without reciting the blessing (berakhah) for sitting in a sukkah. However, one does not take the lulav and etrog (nor does one sleep in the sukkah according to most opinions) on the eighth day. If someone sees a neighbor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> a lulav and etrog on the eighth day, the rabbis reason, s/he might mistakenly assume {{that it is still}} the seventh day (ḥol hamoed), when the lulav and etrog are still needed. S/he might then violate prohibitions of the yom tov of the eighth day. For that reason, the rabbis ruled that one should not take the lulav and etrog on the eighth day, even outside the Land of Israel. They are therefore muktzah; that is, one may not even move them on a holiday where they are not needed. [...] Sleeping in the sukkah brings a similar discussion. Additionally, most people would prefer to sleep indoors {{at this point in the}} year due to the weather, so sleeping in the sukkah may impinge on one's own joy during the festival. This is why the rabbis ruled that one does not sleep in the sukkah on Shemini Atzeret, even outside the Land of Israel. Other rabbis, such as the Vilna Gaon, ruled that one should sleep in the sukkah on Shemini Atzeret outside the Land of Israel.|$|E
