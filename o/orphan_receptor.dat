25|$|A 2007 study {{investigated}} the interaction between bisphenolA's and estrogen-related receptor γ (ERR-γ). This <b>orphan</b> <b>receptor</b> (endogenous ligand unknown) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR-γ (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but only weakly to the ER. BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal constitutive activity. It can also protect it from deactivation from the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (afimoxifene). This may be the mechanism by which BPA acts as a xenoestrogen. Different expression of ERR-γ {{in different parts of}} the body may account for variations in bisphenolA effects. For instance, ERR-γ has been found in high concentration in the placenta, explaining reports of high bisphenol accumulation in this tissue. BPA has also been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).|$|E

40|$|Clinical pharmacology/research {{has a very}} {{interesting}} history. It started in the 40 ’s of the 20 th century through the pioneering work of Harry Gold at Cornell University New York. Clinical research {{is an integral part}} of drug development. Drug development can be hastened by a number of new techniques with reduction in cost. In addition reverse pharmacology approaches for drug discovery have come to occupy a special place. 85 % of the neutral antagonists act as inverse agonists. Inverse agonists have a distinct effect on receptor regulation as opposed to neutral antagonists. <b>Orphan</b> <b>receptors</b> constitute about 50 % of the GPCRs. It is estimated that now there are nearly 175 <b>orphan</b> <b>receptors</b> after 125 having been deorphanised. Targeting these <b>orphan</b> <b>receptors</b> can lead to about the same number of ligands and antagonists thereof.

40|$|AbstractHuman and simian {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (HIV and SIV, respectively) use chemokine receptors as coreceptors {{along with}} CD 4 to mediate viral entry. Several <b>orphan</b> <b>receptors,</b> including GPR 1, GPR 15, and STRL 33, can {{also serve as}} coreceptors for a more limited number of HIV and SIV isolates. We investigated whether these <b>orphan</b> <b>receptors</b> could function as efficient coreceptors for {{a diverse group of}} HIV and SIV envelopes (Envs) in comparison with the principal coreceptors CCR 5 and CXCR 4. We found that a limited number of HIV- 1 isolates could mediate inefficient cell–cell fusion with the <b>orphan</b> <b>receptors</b> relative to CCR 5 and CXCR 4; however, none of the <b>orphan</b> <b>receptors</b> tested could support pseudotype virus infection despite robust infection via CCR 5 or CXCR 4. All except one of the SIV Envs tested mediated some degree of cell–cell fusion and pseudotype infection, with target cells expressing {{at least one of these}} <b>orphan</b> <b>receptors,</b> although CCR 5 proved to be the most efficient coreceptor for infection. Only one SIV Env protein, BK 28, could mediate infection using GPR 1 as a coreceptor, albeit much less efficiently than with CCR 5. In addition, use of these coreceptors did not correlate with the published tropism of the SIV clones and was strictly CD 4 dependent for both SIV and HIV. We also examined the expression of these molecules in cell lines and primary cells widely used for virus propagation and as targets for infection. All cells examined expressed STRL 33, a more limited number expressed GPR 15, and GPR 1 was much more restricted in its expression pattern. Taken together, our results indicate that GPR 15 and STRL 33 are rarely used by HIV- 1 but are more frequently used by SIV strains, although not in a manner that correlates with SIV tropism...|$|R

RORα, one member of the retinoid <b>orphan</b> nuclear <b>receptor</b> (ROR) subfamily of <b>orphan</b> <b>receptors,</b> regulates various cellular and pathological activities. RORα is commonly down-regulated and/or hypoactivated in breast cancer compared to normal mammary tissue.
