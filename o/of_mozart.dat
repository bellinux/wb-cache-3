5|$|Upon his retirement, Hickling {{chose to}} settle in Malvern, Worcestershire, because of family {{connections}} to the town, and indulged his lifelong passion for the music <b>of</b> <b>Mozart.</b> He died after a short illness on 11 February 2007 in St. Richard's Hospice, Malvern, survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter, and 12 grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{the unusual}} {{placement}} of the cadenza before the recapitulation {{is reflected in the}} violin concertos of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza is similarly placed) and Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto it was very rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist to improvise as in the days <b>of</b> <b>Mozart</b> and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, the Royal Academy of Music {{awarded the}} first Mendelssohn Scholarship to the 14-year-old Sullivan, {{granting}} him a year's {{training at the}} academy. His principal teacher there was John Goss, whose own teacher, Thomas Attwood, had been a pupil <b>of</b> <b>Mozart.</b> He studied piano {{with the head of}} the academy, William Sterndale Bennett, and with Arthur O'Leary. During this year at the Royal Academy, Sullivan continued to sing solos with the Chapel Royal, which provided a small amount of spending money.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Whilst {{the work}} {{as a whole has}} proved to be one <b>of</b> <b>Mozart's</b> best loved and most admired, it has been clear ever since {{completion}} was first published that it sometimes lacks the perfection of detail, smooth craftmanship, the imaginative relationship of subsidiary material to the whole that is so characteristic <b>of</b> <b>Mozart's</b> other mature masterpieces. Süssmayr's orchestration ... may not often get in the way <b>of</b> <b>Mozart's</b> vision, but rarely enhances it.' ...|$|R

50|$|The {{finale of}} Axur {{appears in the}} 1984 film Amadeus. The film is {{incorrect}} in presenting Axur as being performed soon after the ninth and final performance <b>of</b> <b>Mozart's</b> Marriage <b>of</b> Figaro in 1786, and before the death <b>of</b> <b>Mozart's</b> father Leopold Mozart on 28 May 1787.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} year Schubert's brother Ferdinand sold the sonatas' autographs to another publisher, Anton Diabelli, who would only publish them about ten years later, in 1838 or 1839. Schubert had intended the sonatas to be dedicated to Johann Nepomuk Hummel, whom he greatly admired. Hummel was a leading pianist, a pupil <b>of</b> <b>Mozart,</b> and a pioneering composer of the Romantic style (like Schubert himself). However, {{by the time the}} sonatas were published in 1839, Hummel was dead, and Diabelli, the new publisher, decided to dedicate them instead to composer Robert Schumann, who had praised many of Schubert's works in his critical writings.|$|E
5|$|Named {{after the}} South American mammal, Kinkajou was the younger {{half-sister}} <b>of</b> <b>Mozart</b> and appeared sporadically throughout the programme. In the first series, a teenage Kinkajou took {{her younger brother}} Mitch from the burrow and left him alone in the desert after she got bored with watching him. She became a more reliable babysitter as she grew older, but followed in her mother Flower's footsteps with an unauthorised pregnancy in the second series. As Kinkajou was evicted between {{the second and third}} series, it remains unanswered how she was reunited with her sisters Mozart and De la Soul.|$|E
5|$|The {{company has}} aimed {{to present the}} {{standard}} operatic repertoire, sung in English, and has staged all the major operas <b>of</b> <b>Mozart,</b> Wagner and Puccini, and {{a wide range of}} Verdi's operas. Under Mackerras and his successors the Czech repertoire has featured strongly, and a broad range of French and Russian operas has been presented. The company has for decades laid stress on opera as drama, and has avoided operas where vocal display takes precedence over musical and dramatic content. In addition to the operatic staples, ENO has a history of presenting new works, and latterly of commissioning them.|$|E

5|$|Sophie was one <b>of</b> <b>Mozart</b> 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding them a bit of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E
5|$|The Delius {{household}} was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, {{and played}} for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz {{was drawn to the}} music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music <b>of</b> <b>Mozart</b> and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to London for Delius to attend concerts and opera.|$|E
