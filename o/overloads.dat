5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which <b>overloads</b> the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E

50|$|The {{start of}} an <b>overload</b> frame due to case 1 is only {{allowed to be}} started at the first bit time of an {{expected}} intermission, whereas <b>overload</b> frames due to case 2 start one bit after detecting the dominant bit. <b>Overload</b> Flag consists of six dominant bits. The overall form corresponds {{to that of the}} active error flag. The <b>overload</b> flag’s form destroys the fixed form of the intermission field. As a consequence, all other stations also detect an <b>overload</b> condition and on their part start transmission of an <b>overload</b> flag. <b>Overload</b> Delimiter consists of eight recessive bits. The <b>overload</b> delimiter is of the same form as the error delimiter.|$|R

Shockwave escapes the ensuing confrontation, and Cliffjumper becomes trapped, leaving Jazz to fight off the incoming Insecticon swarm.

However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus.

5|$|Determined {{to prove}} that he can become a scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters a door to the human world that leads to a summer camp, but he is unable to scare a cabin full of children, and runs off into the woods. Meanwhile, Roar Omega Roar offers to {{reinstate}} Sulley, but he refuses, instead confessing to Hardscrabble that he cheated, just as she is alerted to Mike's break-in. Realizing what happened, Sulley defies Hardscrabble, and enters the same door to find Mike. After reconciling, they try to return, but are unable to exit after Hardscrabble deactivates the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive. Pursued by camp rangers, Mike realizes {{that the only way to}} escape is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sulley and Mike terrify the camp rangers and generate an overwhelming amount of scream energy to return to the lab seconds before the device <b>overloads</b> and explodes in front of Hardscrabble.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical <b>overloads</b> and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|E
30|$|<b>Overload</b> {{detection}} algorithm {{ensures that}} when a host is <b>overloaded,</b> then the algorithm will find it. Moreover, it will provide intelligent measure so that the datacenter does not get <b>overloaded.</b> There are several <b>overload</b> detection algorithms proposed in [1, 2, 4], 1) A Static CPU Utilization Threshold (THR): where <b>overload</b> decision {{is based on a}} static threshold; 2) Adaptive Median Absolute Deviation (MAD): the <b>overload</b> threshold is calculated dynamically using median absolute deviation; 3) Adaptive Interquartile Range (IQR): <b>overload</b> threshold is calculated dynamically using interquartile range method; 4) Local Regression(LR); and 5) Robust local Regression(LRR). LR and LRR are predication methods which will predict whether the host is going to be <b>overloaded</b> or not.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDifferential {{pressure}} sensors using precision-engineered protection mechanisms provide an <b>overload</b> capability {{of at least}} Δp= 160 bar at a nominal range of Δp= 10 mbar. Silicon differential {{pressure sensors}} provide good mechanical properties, due to their low hysteresis and zero point stability. Because of their basic <b>overload</b> capability p< 1 bar (100 kPa), an <b>overload</b> protection is required that {{does not affect the}} sensor's sensitivity. An integrated micromechanical <b>overload</b> protection reduces the complexity; compared to state-of-the-art external <b>overload</b> protection made of stainless steel with defined oil filling. The presented measuring element achieves these characteristics for one-sided <b>overload</b> by limiting the deflection of the diaphragm with an integrated <b>overload</b> protection made of structured glass (Fig. 2). The <b>overload</b> resistant differential pressure sensor with nominal range Δp= 10 mbar is able to provide an average <b>overload</b> capability of Δp= 220 bar (Fig. 1). The frequency response and step response both shows a clear low-pass behavior, indicating an <b>overload</b> resistance for dynamic pressure excitation (Fig. 6) ...|$|R

The Doctor and Donna get into an escape pod and together press a lever which <b>overloads</b> the converter and triggers the eruption, killing the Pyroviles and launching the pod clear of the blast. The Doctor and Donna run for the TARDIS and the Doctor coldly leaves Caecilius and his family cowering in their home using the TARDIS in order to not interfere too deeply with history. However, Donna tearfully begs him to go back and at least save one person, regardless of who it is. The Doctor finally relents and goes back for Caecilius and his family. He leaves them on a hill overlooking the destruction, and together with Donna slips out quietly as the family mourns Pompeii.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{usefulness}} of thallium- 201 myocardial imaging in assessing right ventricular (RV) <b>overloading</b> was evaluated and {{compared with the}} electrocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements. Multiple unprocessed photoscans were obtained using a gamma camera in 47 patients who had chronic RV <b>overload,</b> including 28 subjects with pressure <b>overload,</b> 14 with volume <b>overload</b> and five with pressure and volume <b>overload.</b> With pressure <b>overload</b> the degree of RV visualization (RVV) was correlated with elevation of RV systolic pressure. With volume <b>overload</b> the RV free wall was visualized in all patients, and RVV was correlated with the increment in pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio. Pressure and volume <b>overload</b> could be differentiated from the morphologic characteristics of myocardial image. With pressure <b>overload</b> the interventricular septum appeared straight. With volume <b>overload</b> the RV cavity appeared to be dilated and the interventricular septum convex to the right ventricle. Myocardial images were compared with ECG findings of RV hypertrophy in cases with pressure <b>overload.</b> RVV intensity correlated {{with the number of}} criteria (Sokolow and Lyon) satisfied in each tracing. The sen-sitivity of myocardial imaging for diagnosis of RV pressure <b>overload</b> was 93. 3 %, higher than that of ECG cri-teria for RV hypertrophy.
