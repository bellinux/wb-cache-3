5|$|In the 1960–61 season, Ramsey guided Ipswich to the Second Division {{title and}} into the top flight {{for the first time}} in the club's history. The success was built upon the prowess <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Crawford, the division's top goalscorer with 39.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the Australian team was based around its formidable batting line-up, which included Bradman, Arthur Morris, vice-captain Lindsay Hassett, Neil Harvey and Sid Barnes, and the hostile fast bowling <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Lindwall, Keith Miller and Bill Johnston.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating in}} 1922 Hayden {{took on a}} number of {{different}} jobs and was called to coach the University of Kentucky's basketball team in 1926 following the departure <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Eklund. After a 3–13 record in his first year he was replaced with John Mauer and returned to his previous occupations. When he died in 2003, at the age of 103, he was the University of Kentucky's oldest former athlete, and his jersey is among those hung in the school's Rupp Arena.|$|E
30|$|Traditional cameras {{capture a}} 2 D digital image, {{in which each}} pixel is the energy {{integration}} <b>of</b> all <b>rays</b> that reach the point in scene; the direction <b>of</b> these <b>rays</b> are not distinguished. The image is a projection of 3 D scene, which makes the direction and position <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> lost. Light field retains the directions and positions <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> in scene.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{restructuring}} of the cellular arrangement, rays in storeyed cambium undergo transformations, that is, uniting and splitting on the borders of storeys, when their height during development exceeds that of the storeys of fusiform cells. The primordial rays on the cambium surface have a non-storeyed arrangement. Prolonged predominance of splitting over uniting {{can lead to a}} situation in which the height <b>of</b> the <b>rays</b> does not exceed that of fusiform cell storeys. A storeyed arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> is thus formed. The maintenance of a given arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> in successive annual growths is the result of the cumulation of several traits, such as: 1) the seriation <b>of</b> <b>rays,</b> 2) the magnitude of grain inclination, 3) the rate of the {{restructuring of}} the cell arrangement. For example, the quicker a storeyed arrangement <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> will be formed the less the rays are seriated, the quicker the cells are restructured and the greater the inclination of their arrangement. The magnitude of the inclination of the grain and the rate of cell restructuring are traits connected with the arrangement of fusiform cells. The seriate nature <b>of</b> <b>rays,</b> however, is characteristic <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> and, moreover, it is a characteristic individual trait. It seems that the seriation <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> can play a valuable role in taxonomic analysis...|$|R

5|$|Arsenal {{were missing}} defender Sol Campbell from their team {{after the death}} of his father, and manager Arsène Wenger dropped wingers Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord in favour <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Parlour and Fredrik Ljungberg, {{creating}} a more physical midfield. Wenger's tactics worked, as the Arsenal defence withstood the pressure from the Manchester United attack. United themselves were without Paul Scholes due to injury, and they played a 4–3–2–1 formation with Phil Neville, Roy Keane and Quinton Fortune completing a defensively minded midfield.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was born}} on 9 October 1969 in Bridport, Dorset, as the second child <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> and Eva Harvey, who owned a stone {{quarrying}} business, and {{grew up on the}} family's farm in Corscombe. During her childhood, she attended school in nearby Beaminster, where she received guitar lessons from folk singer-songwriter Steve Knightley, and her parents introduced her to music that would later influence her work, including blues music, Captain Beefheart and Bob Dylan. Her parents were avid music fans and regularly arranged get-togethers and small gigs; among their oldest friends was Ian Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Maupertuis' {{ideas were}} in {{opposition}} to the influence of early taxonomists like John Ray. In the late 17th century, Ray had given the first formal definition of a biological species, which he described as being characterized by essential unchanging features, and stated the seed of one species could never give rise to another. The ideas <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> and other 17th-century taxonomists were influenced by natural theology and the argument from design.|$|E

40|$|Divide-and-conquer {{ray tracing}} (DACRT) methods solve intersec-tion {{problems}} between large numbers <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> and primitives by recursively subdividing the problem size until {{it can be}} easily solved. Previous DACRT methods subdivide the intersection prob-lem based {{on the distribution of}} primitives only, and do not exploit the distribution <b>of</b> <b>rays,</b> which results in a decrease of the render-ing performance especially for high resolution images with anti-aliasing. We propose an efficient DACRT method that exploits the distribution <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> by sampling the rays to construct an accelera-tion data structure. To accelerate ray traversals, we have derived a new cost metric which is used to avoid inefficient subdivision of the intersection problem where the number <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> is not sufficiently reduced. Our method accelerates the tracing of many types <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> (primary rays, less coherent secondary rays, random rays for path tracing) by a factor of up to 2 using ray sampling...|$|R

5|$|The England openers Cyril Washbrook and Len Hutton {{were given}} a loud {{reception}} as they walked out to bat, particularly the Yorkshire local Hutton. They {{had to face the}} Australian opening pair <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Lindwall and Keith Miller without the aid of sightscreen. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.|$|E
40|$|Ray theorectic {{modeling}} with {{stable and}} accurate amplitude requires a velocity model {{that has a}} continuous first derviative. After studying alternatives, we concluded that a standard smoothed physical model on a Cartesian grid is {{likely to lead to}} a computer code of competitive cpu speed, when amplitude accuracy is of as much concern as traveltime accuracy. We use a wave front construction technique, in which the size of triangular plates connecting three nearby rays on the isochron (surface of constant traveltime) are used as an indicator of adequate density <b>of</b> <b>rays.</b> When the criteria for density <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> are violated, data at new points on the wavefront are interpolated into the family <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> and the wavefront construction continues. In this manner, the method does not require excessing density <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> at small traveltimes in order to maintain adequate density <b>of</b> <b>rays</b> at larger traveltimes.

5|$|The teams {{played out}} a {{draw in the}} third match at Manchester, where Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from the bowling <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch.

5|$|A week later, Arsenal {{travelled}} to face Manchester United at Old Trafford. Pirès and Wiltord {{were dropped}} by Wenger in favour <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Parlour and Ljungberg; Campbell did not travel due to family bereavement. In the 80th minute, Vieira was sent {{off for a}} second bookable offence; he attempted to kick out at striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, which was seen by referee Steve Bennett. With the score 0–0, United were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute, but Van Nistelrooy's spot kick hit the bar and rebounded back into play. At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by several Arsenal players, which escalated into an altercation between both teams. Six of Arsenal's players (Ashley Cole, Lauren, Keown, Parlour, Lehmann, Vieira) were later charged with improper conduct by The Football Association (FA), while the club were fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and Parlour were given one-match suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man {{stopped the car}} but Doggett points out {{that it would have}} required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood <b>of</b> <b>Ray.</b> Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E

5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, {{although they}} enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked a {{turn away from}} the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole Teenager holdover Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Saggers had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included the likes <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, {{who were all}} capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As a result, many of the bowlers batted before he did. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Tallon had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 9,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included the likes <b>of</b> <b>Ray</b> Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, {{who were all}} capable with the bat.
