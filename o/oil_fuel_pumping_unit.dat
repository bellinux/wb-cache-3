50|$|The {{circular}} {{air inlet}} behind the reduction gear has a de-icing device using hot air. The compressor's two axial stages use blisks. The shaft runs on ball bearings. Air {{flow through the}} annular combustion chamber is S-wise, with fuel being added in radial direction by a rotating atomizer disc. The blades of the three-stage turbine's wheels, also blisks, are air-cooled from the inside. The jet nozzle is fixed with an interior cone. Auxiliary drives are mounted on a mounting plate behind the inlet, which also has the connections for starter motor/generator, <b>oil</b> and <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> engine speed control and tachometer. There are also optional drives for an AC generator and a hydraulic pump. The whole engine is mounted at three points, two trunnions {{on the right and}} left front of the turbine casing and one on its underside to the rear.

5000|$|The systems use an {{individual}} injection pump {{mounted on the}} engine block for each cylinder so it is primarily designed for OHV or [...] "cam in the block" [...] engines. The <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> are driven by an extra camshaft lobe where each <b>pump</b> <b>unit</b> {{is connected to the}} injector via a short precise length high-pressure fuel line as opposed to Unit Injector systems which combines both a pump and an injector element in a compact unit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accessory}} end had a one- or two-speed engine-driven supercharger {{that might}} have a second stage with or without an intercooler, the ignition magnetos and the customary assortment of <b>oil</b> and <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> all dictated by the application requirements. The front of the engine could have {{one of a number}} of different output drives. The drive might be a [...] "long-nose" [...] or close coupled propeller reduction gear, an extension drive to a remote gearbox, or a gearbox that could drive two wing-mounted propellers from a fuselage-mounted engine. Another key feature of the V-1710 design was its ability to turn the output shaft clockwise or counter-clockwise by assembling the engine with the crankshaft turned end-for-end, by installing an idler gear in the drive train to the supercharger, camshafts, and accessories, installing a starter turning the proper direction, and re-arranging the ignition wiring on the right side to accommodate a changed firing order. No change to the oil pump nor coolant pump circuits was needed. [...] The ability to reverse the direction of rotation with a minimum of extra parts to achieve the task allowed the use of either a [...] "tractor" [...] or [...] "pusher" [...] propeller. This approach allowed easy changes of the supercharger(s) and supercharger drive-gear ratio. That gave different critical altitude (the maximum altitude at which the engine could produce full power) ratings ranging from 8000 to 26000 ft.|$|R
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the <b>oil</b> and <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps.</b> [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering pump driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|R
