5|$|Before Wildwater Kingdom, Geauga Lake had a water park (located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> {{side of the}} park) which {{operated}} {{for over}} 20 years. During the Six Flags era, it was known as Hurricane Harbor; Cedar Fair renamed it Hurricane Hannah's after it purchased the park in 2004. Hurricane Hannah's closed {{at the end of}} the 2005 season. It sat vacant and fenced off during the 2006 and 2007 seasons at Geauga Lake.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio {{began to think}} of a supernatural spin on the pirate genre. Walt Disney Pictures had Jay Wolpert write a script based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> in 2001, which was based on a story created by the {{executives}} Brigham Taylor, Michael Haynes, and Josh Harmon. This story featured Will Turner as a prison guard who releases Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth, who is being held for ransom money by Captain Blackheart.|$|E

50|$|This trick {{involves}} {{the combination of}} an Ollie with an Airwalk. The rider initiates an Ollie and grabs the board with the front hand. While this is being done the rider kicks the front foot forward (diagonal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> direction) and kicks the back foot backwards (diagonal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>riding</b> direction). Like many others, this trick was invented by Rodney Mullen, and comes {{with an array of}} variations, including fingerflips and 180 spins.|$|R
50|$|These rides are {{a hybrid}} of kiddie ride and arcade video games. <b>The</b> <b>rides</b> usually {{incorporate}} a video display and, while the motion is synchronized to <b>the</b> events happening <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> will start and end following <b>the</b> events <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> is usually interactive and there are push-buttons to allow the rider {{to interact with the}} on-screen actions.|$|R
5|$|During the {{following}} off-season, Kings Dominion widened the first high-speed turn {{to lower the}} amount of G-force experienced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> The park's goal was {{to reduce the number}} of blackouts some riders were experiencing. The modification allowed them to remove the trim brakes on the ride's first drop, making it possible for the roller coaster's maximum speed to return to original specifications.|$|E
5|$|JAL is {{also known}} for its liveries {{featuring}} Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, {{as it is the}} official airline of the Tokyo Disney Resort. They sponsor the attraction Star Jets (not related to past Star Jets fleet with the old tsurumaru livery), which feature a variation of the current livery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> vehicles. At one time there were more than six widebody aircraft painted with the special liveries.|$|E
5|$|Like many Disney attractions, Test Track exited into a themed {{gift shop}} {{featuring}} merchandise {{associated with the}} attraction. Guests could also view and purchase photos taken of their vehicle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> or scan their Photopass to view or purchase the photos later. There was also an area {{where there was a}} showroom of all new, prototype, or legendary GM vehicles.|$|E

5|$|On 8 May 2012, a 20-year-old man {{climbed over}} safety fences and {{accessed}} the underground ride area. He reportedly {{dropped into the}} hole from which the roller coaster track re-emerges from the underground tunnel, walked through the underground section and emerged on a ledge where the track enters the ground. Neither he nor any guests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> were harmed following the ride cars being held at the boarding station. He was arrested for a public order offence, and the ride returned to normal operation the following day.|$|E
5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> were designed to resemble {{the look of a}} test car that is used to go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> the vast motion of the vehicles made it impossible for riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 1993, MTV's Headbanger's Ball taped {{an episode}} at the park. The host, Riki Rachtman, interviewed and went <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rides</b> with <b>the</b> band Alice In Chains.|$|R
5|$|On July 13, 2012, Cedar Point {{announced}} that Disaster Transport would close on July 29, 2012. It {{was the second}} roller coaster at Cedar Point to close in 2012. A charity auction was held for the final riders, benefiting the Give Kids the World charity foundation. The last ride was given at 11:53 PM on July 29, with the lights turned <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> started demolition on August 6, using about 380 trucks to transport scrap materials. A portion of track, two cars and the main entrance sign will be donated to the National Roller Coaster Museum. Less than a month later on August 29 at around 9:30 AM, the last section of Disaster Transport was demolished. The 12E {{part of the building}} was the last section left standing.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2004, a 53-year-old, 5' 2", 230lb (104.5kg) {{man from}} Bloomfield, Connecticut, {{fell out of}} his coaster seat during the last turn and was killed. Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride. The park stated that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to a person with a disability as long as the person can get <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> by themselves.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{construction}} of Test Track, numerous problems occurred causing delays in the ride opening. One problem that Imagineers had to overcome was that the wheels used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> vehicles could not stand up to the demand of the ride course and speed. This problem was resolved but a second, more severe problem caused the ride to be delayed by over a year. In order for Test Track to run with the highest hourly capacity possible, twenty-nine ride vehicles would be needed. The ride programming system could only handle operating a maximum of six cars over the layout of the ride. One by one, programmers were able to get the computer system able to run twenty-nine ride vehicles all at once. After these problems were resolved, Test Track soft-opened to the public on December 19, 1998. The ride was still prone to breakdowns and didn't officially open until March 17, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Bianca tells Whitney she {{is moving}} to Milton Keynes with her partner Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and wants her to move with them and the children. Although {{originally}} agreeing, Lee persuades her to stay and she moves into the pub with the Carters. Lee develops depression, and when Whitney finds out, she struggles to support him at his lowest points. At Mick's stag party before his wedding to Linda, Lee knocks himself unconscious and is carried upstairs by Mick and Whitney. Whitney confesses to Mick that she intends to break up with Lee after the wedding, unable to handle his depression. However, she is unaware that Lee has overheard her via the baby monitor. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Lee goes missing and Whitney and Mick find him drunk at the park. Lee tells Whitney that he blames himself for her wanting to break up with him, and she promises him that they will work things out. Whitney later thanks Mick for helping her with Lee, but accidentally kisses him on the lips in the process. While Mick and Linda are on their honeymoon, Whitney invites Ryan back to Walford to see Lily, but while at the pub, he steals the cash from the safe, causing Whitney and Nancy to fight, just as Mick and Linda walk in on them. The next morning, Whitney contacts Ryan and he asks to meet in the park. Mick accompanies Whitney and assures a scared Ryan that he can trust him. It then emerges that Whitney told Mick that Ryan killed Rob, so Whitney and Mick convince Ryan to return the money and hand himself to the police, and Whitney will back him up in the hope of him being charged with manslaughter instead of murder, to which Ryan agrees. Whitney shares an emotional goodbye with Ryan as he heads into the police station. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> home from the police station, an upset Whitney tells Mick that she has feelings for him and kisses him again. Mick tells Linda what happened, so Linda tells her to stay away from Mick and not to give up on Lee. Whitney later visits Ryan in prison, stating that she is worried about Lee. When she accidentally says Mick's name, he guesses that she has feelings for Mick, which she denies. He then urges Whitney to help Lee, so she gets him a job interview at a local pub, however this causes major grievances between Lee and Nancy. Whitney is forced by Babe to tell Lee about her kissing Mick, and although Nancy tells her to move out, Lee's response is to propose marriage.|$|E
