40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} PROMETHEUS, a frame-work for {{proactive}} temperature aware scheduling of embedded workloads on single ISA (instruction set architecture) het-erogeneous Multi-Processor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoC). It sys-tematically combines temperature aware task assignment, task migration and dynamic {{voltage and frequency}} scaling (DVFS). PROMETHEUS is based on our novel low <b>overhead</b> <b>temperature</b> prediction technique, Tempo. In contrast to previous work, Tempo allows accurate estimation of potential thermal effects of future scheduling decisions without requiring any runtime adaptation. It reduces the maximum prediction error by up to an order of magnitude. Using Tempo, PROMETHEUS framework provides two temperature aware scheduling techniques which proactively avoid power states leading to future thermal emergencies while matching the performance needs to the workload requirements. The first technique, TempoMP, integrates Tempo with an online multi-parametric optimization method to guide decisions on task assignment, migration and setting core power states in a temperature aware fashion. Our second scheduling technique, TemPrompt uses Tempo in a heuristic algorithm which provides comparable efficiency at lower overhead. On average, these two techniques reduce the lateness of the tasks by 2. 5 X and energy-lateness product by 5 X compared to the previous work.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a method to assess the eco-efficiency of flexibility measures applied to the electrical energy supply system. As the regional wind energy feed in exceeds the regional power consumption temporarily even to a high extent, leading to an export of surplus wind power from local grids to the transmission grid and by this to distant areas, and as neither the existing distribution grids nor the transmission grids were set up for today’s requirements, the application of flexibility measures becomes vital. The required grid extension cannot keep pace with the growing share of wind energy feed in, which results in bottlenecks. Thus, other technical options to increase dynamic system operation come into focus as well, even though there remains uncertainty, if they can be an alternative to grid extension or if they merely represent an interim solution. Former investigations concerning the assessment of alternative transmission technologies were limited on the comparison of investment costs or environmental impacts against the background of transmission capability. With this dissertation, an abstract method for assessing the eco-efficiency of flexibility measures in power systems is being developed. Therefore, well known practices of ecological and economical assessment are optimised regarding technical backgrounds as well to offer an objective and abstract comparison of the different measures. In doing so, it is emphasised, that only a direct assessment of CO 2 -emissions is necessary for ecological assessment. The investigation of other ecological impacts is part of the project specific approval procedure and will be respected as a sensitivity by varying the realisation time of the measures. Regarding monetary aspect, it will be shown, that solely costs have to be assessed, which are generated in the balance room by realising a specific measure. The application of the assessment method will be shown for a representative model of a 110 kV network area considering the implementation of <b>overhead</b> line <b>temperature</b> monitoring, the utilisation of a high <b>temperature</b> <b>overhead</b> line conductor (ACCR) and the network extension by realising a new corridor with TACSR high <b>temperature</b> <b>overhead</b> line conductors. It becomes clear that the eco-efficiency is significantly influ-enced by the possible wind energy feed in and by covering consumer loads. Investments show relatively low impacts on the results. To support the objectivity of the given comparison, a sensitivity analysis is obtained for the categories global power-mix, compensation of omitted incomes of wind energy converters, enhancement of generation management, period under observation and realisation time. Against this background, the results of the exemplary investigations for three assessed locations (strong wind, medium wind, low wind) show the highest eco-efficiency for the grid extension...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of microprocessors has been hindered by increasing power consumption and heat dissipation on die. An excessive {{amount of heat}} creates reliability problems, reduces the lifetime of a processor, and elevates the cost of cooling and packaging considerably. It is therefore imper-ative {{to be able to}} monitor the temperature variations across the die in a timely and accurate manner. Most current techniques rely on on-chip thermal sensors to report the temperature of the proces-sor. Unfortunately, significant variation in chip temperature both spatially and temporally exposes the limitation of the sensors. We present a compensating approach to tracking chip temperature through an OS resident software module that generates live power and thermal profiles of the processor. We developed such a software thermal sensor (STS) in a Linux system with a Pentium 4 Northwood core. We employed highly efficient numerical methods in our model to minimize the <b>overhead</b> of <b>temperature</b> calculation. We also developed an efficient algorithm for functional unit power modeling. Our power and thermal models are calibrated and validated against on-chip sensor readings, thermal images of the Northwood heat spreader, and the thermometer measure-ments on the package.

40|$|Abstract — For proper {{transmission}} {{of power in}} <b>overhead</b> transmission lines <b>temperature</b> control and sag monitoring are the two major parameters {{to be kept in}} mind. Electrical load variation and environmental changes affect the temperature in the transmission lines. For proper safety measurements these monitoring should be done on a continuous basis. Some of the ongoing temperature and sag monitoring methods that can be sited are the usage of stainless steel temperature probes, glass based sensors, thermocouples, RTDs, and Infrared sensors. However, all these methods have a disadvantage of having loosening of contacts. Cross sensitivity may also arise due to environmental contaminations. The disturbances caused by the different parameters can be stated as follows:-High temperature due to climate changes decreases th...|$|R

30|$|Temperature is an {{important}} factor influencing in-stream processes (Allan and Castillo 2009). Increased solar radiation following harvest to the stream edge often resulted in higher maximum stream temperatures (up to 25 to 30 °C) and diurnal temperature ranges of up to 12 °C in the warmer northern latitudes of New Zealand and where the hydrology was dominated by surface and sub-surface flow (Baillie et al. 2005; Boothroyd et al. 2004; Graynoth 1979; Quinn and Wright-Stow 2008) (Table  1). Streams with cooler base flow <b>temperatures,</b> <b>overhead</b> logging slash cover and inputs from groundwater seepages, mediated the impact of reduced shade and increased solar radiation on water temperatures after harvest at some sites (Table  1) (Fahey and Stansfield 2006; Pruden et al. 1990). It is likely that, in some streams, temperatures after harvest are exceeding levels and duration periods considered stressful for some sensitive aquatic invertebrates and fish species (≥ 23 °C for aquatic invertebrates and[*]≥[*] 28 °C for indigenous fish) (Olsen et al. 2012; Quinn et al. 1994; Richardson et al. 1994).|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{a number of}} control {{strategies}} {{have been developed for}} control of the overhead composition of a binary distillation column. The nonlinear wave model as presented in the literature, has been substantially modified in order to express it in variables that can easily be measured and make it more robust to feed flow and feed composition changes. The new model consists essentially of the equation for wave propagation and a static mass and energy balance across the top section of the column. Taylor series developments are used to relate the temperature on the measurement tray to the temperature and concentration on the tray where the inflection point of the concentration profile is located. The model has been incorporated in control of the overhead quality of a toluene/o-xylene benchmark column. In addition, a number of partial least squares (PLS) estimators have been developed: a nonlinear estimator for inferring the <b>overhead</b> composition from <b>temperature</b> measurements and a linear and nonlinear estimator for inferring the inflection point of the concentration profile in the column. These estimators are also used in a cascade control strategy and compared with use of the wave propagation model. Finally a control strategy consisting of a simple temperature controller and a composition controller were implemented on the simulated column. The study shows that the inferential control using PLS estimators performs equally well than control using the nonlinear wave model. In all cases the advantage of using inferential controllers is substantial compared with using single tray temperature control or composition control. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In {{all fields}} of {{wildlife}} research and management, fundamental biodiversity and species distributional data are required. Yet, the difficulty that wildlife researchers face detecting small and cryptic species, in particular snakes and lizards (squamates), {{has led to}} gaps in fundamental knowledge. The lack of fundamental ecological data limits our understanding about the role many squamates perform in ecosystems and diminishes our ability to manage potential threats. Indeed, the dearth of squamate data is so pervasive that the global threat to squamates in 2015 could not be assessed. This situation is of great concern since squamates are a particularly speciose vertebrate group. Collecting fundamental data on squamates is ordinarily achieved with capture, trapping, or visual encounter methods. These methods are often costly, since researchers need {{to remain in the}} field for protracted periods, and are ethically questionable due to direct and indirect impacts on target and non-target fauna. Thus, developing survey methods that can effectively, efficiently, and ethically provide fundamental data are paramount for squamate research and management. 	The most direct solution to ameliorate data deficiency is to improve detection methods and the most direct solution to improve detection methods is to adopt new technologies. In recent decades camera-traps have become a valuable tool for monitoring mammals, fish, {{and to a lesser extent}} birds. For example, camera-traps are both more effective and more cost-effective than labour-intensive methods, such as live-trapping, for detecting numerous mammal species. However, the use of camera-traps to monitor squamates hitherto has been limited. While camera-traps have real limitations, their use for detecting squamates has been limited due to misconceptions about camera-trapping technology. It might be that camera-traps are as useful for monitoring squamates as they have been for other taxa, but considerable research might be required to develop an effective method. Hence, this thesis addresses the following question: Is camera-trapping a cost-effective and ethical method for monitoring terrestrial squamates? 	As camera-traps had not been used to monitor a squamate assemblage, a suitable method needed to be developed. The method would need to detect the range of squamate species occurring in an area, including small species (snout-vent length ≤ 50 mm), and generate ecologically meaningful data. By reviewing how camera-traps function at a technical level, and assessing attempts to use camera-traps for detecting ectothermic species, the Camera <b>Overhead</b> Augmented <b>Temperature</b> (COAT) method was developed. The COAT method positions the camera-trap so as to take overhead images of squamates as they pass under the camera-trap. In the first field trial, the COAT method detected the majority of squamate and mammal species known to occur on the study area. Detections included small squamates with a SVL ≤ 50 mm. Most species could be identified to species-level, and several species could be identified to individual-level. While the results were encouraging, the pilot study did not address the main question of the thesis. 	With development of the COAT method, the next logical step was to compare the COAT method to existing standard squamate-survey methods to assess whether camera-traps were effective. As a first comparison, the COAT method was compared to cage and Elliott traps and artificial refuges. These labour-intensive methods had been used on the study area since 2011 as part of a long-term monitoring program. The COAT method was found to be more effective and more cost-effective than the labour-intensive methods for detecting squamates and mammals simultaneously, and mammals alone. The COAT method was no more, but importantly, no less effective than the labour-intensive methods for detecting squamates alone. There was weak evidence that the COAT method was more cost-effective than the labour-intensive methods for squamates alone. Importantly, given that several mammal and squamate individuals perished in the labour-intensive methods survey, the COAT method was ethically superior. 	Despite the encouraging results, six aspects of Version 1 of the COAT method were identified as areas requiring improvement or further analysis. Three aspects related to the instrument (i. e., camera-trap) and three related to the concentration methods. To improve the COAT method the time-lapse trigger, a more sensitive passive infrared (PIR) trigger, and adjusted camera focal length were examined. Both the time-lapse trigger and more sensitive PIR trigger increased squamate detections. Unfortunately, regardless of sensitivity the PIR sensor resulted in biased detections, which the time-lapse trigger did not. It was also revealed that by adjusting the camera’s focal length all squamates, including small species, could be identified to species-level. Thus, the second version of the COAT method dictated that both time-lapse and PIR triggers be used simultaneously, and camera focal length be adjusted. 	When first designed, two concentration methods were included in the COAT method. Bait, specifically peanut butter and oats, was included to attract mammals, and drift fences were included to channel fauna to the detection zone. Additionally, a cork floor tile was positioned in the detection zone of the camera-trap. It was included to create a thermal contrast between fauna and the background substrate, necessary for the camera-trap to trigger. However, the tile appeared to function as a concentration method. While inclusion of each component was logical, their effects on squamate detections were not empirically tested. Thus, three further field experiments were conducted. The presence of bait and drift fences did not affect squamate detections. Both the presence and material of the tile affected squamate detections. Whether the tile functioned as a concentration method was not clear and could not be explored within the scope of this thesis. Although these experiments did not directly improve the COAT method, they deepened the understanding of how the COAT method functions, and highlighted future research directions. 	Given the improvements made to the COAT method, a final comparison was required to provide a definitive answer to the main question of the thesis. The COAT method was compared to artificial refuges and pitfall traps. Version 2 of the COAT method was both more effective and more cost-effective than the labour-intensive methods examined for inventorying the squamate assemblage. More squamate species on average were detected per transect with camera-traps than with artificial refuges or pitfall traps. Over the entire survey, all 10 squamate species were detected with camera-traps, yet only seven and six squamate species were detected with artificial refuges and pitfall traps respectively. Again, camera-traps had less impact upon fauna as several squamates and amphibians perished in pitfall traps. With this final comparison, the central question of the thesis could be confidently answered in the affirmative. 	Development of the COAT method has several important implications. First, this is the first camera-trapping method that can be used to monitor a squamate assemblage. This provides wildlife researchers with a new tool to address both existing and new types of questions. Camera-traps have been used to great effect in mammology, and the COAT method should provide herpetologists those same benefits. Second, by being more cost-effective, the COAT method will save precious research funds and should increase data collection overall. Lastly, the COAT method detects both squamates and mammals simultaneously. Wildlife researchers currently using camera-traps to monitor small-mammals can use the COAT method and include squamates as target fauna. Results from this research are encouraging and provide a critical first chapter in how camera-traps can be utilised to monitor squamates...|$|R
