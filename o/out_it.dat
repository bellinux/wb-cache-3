5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point <b>out,</b> <b>it</b> is {{difficult}} for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society. This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 2016, The Sydney Morning Herald {{reported}} that a man had found what could possibly be debris from the aircraft at a location on Kangaroo Island, southern Australia. South Australian police collected the shoebox-sized piece and {{it was to be}} delivered to the ATSB for further investigation. The examination found <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was not from the missing aircraft.|$|E

5|$|This {{problem was}} first {{addressed}} by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In incompressible flow, the velocity profile is linear because the fluid temperature is constant.

5|$|When Rotting {{first came}} <b>out</b> <b>it</b> stirred {{a huge amount}} of {{controversy}} due to its cover art— a traditional grim reaper figure licking what appears to be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a crown of thorns over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.|$|E

5|$|Arizona was {{commissioned}} into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with John D. McDonald as captain. She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after {{the crew had}} cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been tested at the dock. After declinating the ship's magnetic compasses, the ship sailed south for her shakedown cruise. Outside Guantanamo Bay, a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order Arizona back to New York for repairs, although {{she was able to}} enter Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19–20 December. The turbine could not be repaired inside the ship, so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing <b>out.</b> <b>It</b> was reinstalled after almost four months of repairs at the naval yard.|$|E

If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in play when the clock runs <b>out,</b> <b>it</b> is completed under the normal rules.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{elected to}} bat first and Brown made 106, while Bradman (65) and Harvey (60) both scored half-centuries. Kent {{collapsed}} {{to the lowest}} score of the tour in the first innings, succumbing in only 23 overs. Johnston and Loxton both took 3/10, and six local batsmen made ducks. Forced to follow on, half the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings. Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71, but the match, held in front of record crowds for the ground, ended inside two days, soon after Evans was run <b>out.</b> <b>It</b> took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets. Lindwall took 4/37 in the second innings; all his wickets were top-order batsmen.|$|E

Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from {{stealing}} from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of Grand Theft Scratchy in Springfield, although Lisa points <b>out</b> <b>it</b> is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.|$|E

With Australia forced to follow-on, Bradman fought hard to ensure McCabe's effort was not in vain, and he secured the draw with 144 not <b>out.</b> <b>It</b> was the slowest Test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 not {{out in the next}} Test as Australia struggled to another draw.
