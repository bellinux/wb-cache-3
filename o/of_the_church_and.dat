5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

5|$|Sélestat has {{two large}} and {{remarkable}} churches from the Middle Ages. St. Faith's Church {{is the oldest}} and {{a prime example of}} Romanesque architecture.

The church was renovated in the 19th century and a medieval death mask was found during this work.

5|$|The first {{histories}} of Henry's reign {{emerged in the}} 16th and 17th centuries, relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers, in particular writings of Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. These early historians, including Archbishop Matthew Parker, were influenced by contemporary concerns about the roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> state, and examined {{the changing nature of}} kingship under Henry, the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy. During the English Civil War, historians also drew parallels between Henry's experiences and those of the deposed Charles I.|$|E
5|$|The north transept, {{which had}} {{previously}} {{served as a}} vestry from which the Poor Law was administered, was used to house the church's William Hill & Son organ, which had been installed in 1852 in the now-removed western gallery; the south transept, which up to that date had {{been used as a}} mausoleum for the Cavendish family and was completely walled off from the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>and</b> accessible only via its own door from the churchyard, was opened up to the church.

5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>and</b> individual Christian observance {{would lead to a}} harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>and</b> thought she {{would be even more}} troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E
