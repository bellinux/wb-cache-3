Levofloxacin was given to each patient at a dose of 300 mg or 400 mg a day for 7 - 14 days (average 12. 0 +/- 0. 5 days). In 2 cases of chronic UTI, infected by P. aeruginosa in one case and P. stutzeri in another case, the isolates were eradicated, and the clinical efficacy was moderate or excellent. For evaluating the effectiveness on chronic prostatitis, the patients were divided into 2 groups; group I (G-I) was chronic bacterial (number of isolates including GNR or E. faecalis, {{greater than or equal}} to 10 (4) ml) and group II (G-II) was chronic non-bacterial prostatitis (number of isolates including GPC less than or equal to 10 (3) /ml). A complete bacteriological response was obtained in all 7 cases, classified in G-I, but in 20 of the 27 isolates, (74. 1 %) in G-II. In 3 cases of chronic non-chlamydial epididymitis, the response was moderate. In safety profile, there were slight elevations in the laboratory values of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) in one case, and that of GOT in another case.

5000|$|In chemistry, an {{enantiomer}} ( [...] ), {{also known}} as an <b>optical</b> <b>isomer,</b> {{is one of two}} stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). A single chiral atom or similar structural feature in a compound causes that compound to have two possible structures which are non-superposable, each a mirror image of the other. Each member of the pair is termed an enantiomorph (enantio = opposite morph = form); the structural property is termed enantiomerism. The presence of multiple chiral features in a given compound increases the number of geometric forms possible, though there may be some perfect-mirror-image pairs.|$|E

50|$|The first 29 {{amino acids}} of GHRH were {{discovered}} {{to be as}} equally potent as its full 44 amino acid structure This fragment became known as GRF (1-29). However, due to a rapid metabolic clearance analogues of GRF (1-29) were synthesized to enhance the biological activity and reduce the rapidity of metabolic clearance. These analogues were primarily created by substituting amino acids within the peptide structure for amino acids more resistant to enzymatic cleavage. One early analogue substituted the amino acid L-alanine (abbreviated as Ala or A) at the 2nd position of the peptide structure for its <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> (mirror image), D-alanine (abbreviated as D-Ala). This substitution resulted in a peptide bond between D-Ala and the 3rd amino acid in the structure aspartic acid (Asp) more able to resist rapid cleavage by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4, a cleavage which had previously led to an inactive peptide fragment. This successful modification prompted the further creation of analogues with additional amino acid substitutions.|$|E

MDMA {{was produced in}} 1912 (according to other sources in 1914) as an intermediate product. However, this synthesis also went largely unnoticed. In the 1920s, both methamphetamine and the dextrorotatory <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> of amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, were synthesized. This synthesis was a by-product of a search for ephedrine, a bronchodilator used to treat asthma extracted exclusively from natural sources. Over-the-counter use of substituted amphetamines was initiated in the early 1930s by the pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline & French (now part of GlaxoSmithKline), as a medicine (Benzedrine) for colds and nasal congestion. Subsequently, amphetamine {{was used in the}} treatment of narcolepsy, obesity, hay fever, orthostatic hypotension, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, alcoholism and migraine. The [...] "reinforcing" [...] effects of substituted amphetamines were quickly discovered, and the misuse of substituted amphetamines had been noted as far back as 1936.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> can {{be named}} by the spatial {{configuration}} of its atoms. The [...] system (named after Latin dexter and laevus, right and left), {{not to be confused}} with the d- and l-system, see above, does this by relating the molecule to glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde is chiral itself, and its two isomers are labeled [...] and [...] (typically typeset in small caps in published work). Certain chemical manipulations can be performed on glyceraldehyde without affecting its configuration, and its historical use for this purpose (possibly combined with its convenience as one of the smallest commonly used chiral molecules) has resulted in its use for nomenclature. In this system, compounds are named by analogy to glyceraldehyde, which, in general, produces unambiguous designations, but is easiest to see in the small biomolecules similar to glyceraldehyde. One example is the chiral amino acid alanine, which has two optical isomers, and they are labeled according to which isomer of glyceraldehyde they come from. On the other hand, glycine, the amino acid derived from glyceraldehyde, has no optical activity, as it is not chiral (achiral).|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the set of}} columns, can be {{combined}} in various types. The Original column sets in the beginning were mainly poly(dimethylsiloxane) in the first dimension and poly(ethyleneglycol) in the second dimension. These so-called straight phase column sets are very suitable for Hydrocarbon analysis. Therefore, these are still used most frequent in Oil and Gas industry. If the application is to determine more polar compounds in a non-polar matrix. The reverse phase column set gives more resolution for the polar compounds. The first dimension column in this situation is a polar column, followed by a mid-polar second dimension column.For each application there can be an optimal column set. In this respective you can use also chiral columns for <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> separation or for example PLOT columns for volatiles and gas samples.To optimize the application {{is a bit more}} complex compared to 1D separations, as there are more parameters involved. Flow and oven temperature program are still very important but also hot jet pulse duration, length of the second dimension column and modulation time have a big influence on the final results. The outcome is also different. No longer a traditional chromatogram is produced, but now a 3 dimensional plot is produced by specially designed software [...] packages. It is a different way of evaluate data, but you get much more information. With modern software, you can perform group-type separation as well as automated peak identification (with Mass Spectrometry).|$|E
50|$|It {{appears that}} the biosyntheis of JH III is {{identical}} to that of cholesterol, from production of IPP to FPP, although {{there appear to be}} no studies on export of citrate or other metabolites from the mitochondrion into the cytosol, or formation of acetyl-CoA. The enzymes of this pathway were first studied in Manduca sexta, which produces both homoisoprenoid and isoprenoid (JHIII) JHs. Very early on propionate was shown to incorporate very highly efficiently into JH II and JH I in cell free extracts of M. sexta corpora allata. Mevalonate and acetate also incorporate into JH I, II, JH III from M. sexta, albeit far less efficiently that propionate. Jennings et al. showed that homomevalonate incorporates into JH II in M. sexta.Baker identified 3-hydroxy-3-ethylglutarate and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate from the same enzyme source incubated with acetyl and propionyl-CoA. Lee et al. showed that the same source of enzymes efficiently make both mevalonate and its 3-ethyl homolog, homomevalonate. Bergot showed that the mevalonate and homomevalonate produced by these enzymes has the same 3S <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> configuration as the vertebrate enzymes. Baker showed that isopentenyl diphosphate, and its homolog, 3-ethyl-butenyl diphosphate (homoisopentenyl diphosphate) are metabolized to their corresponding allyic diphosphates, DMAPP and homoDMAPP (3-ethyl-3-methylallyl diphosphate). The latter is required for biosynthesis of JH I, JH II, and 4-methylJH I. 2 units of homoDMAPP are required for JH I and 4methyl JH I biosynthesis, and one for JH II biosynthesis. All parts of the carbon skeleton comes from IPP. Then an enzyme prenyl transferase/farnesyl diphosphate synthase binds IPP, strips the diphosphate off it to give an allyllic carbocation, and adds this to an IPP to give geranyl diphosphate (C10). Then it does the same thing to geranyl diphosphate, giving farnesyl diphosphate (C15). This reaction appears to be the only known enzymatic reaction involving the coupling of two molecules with a carbocation. The free electron pair adds to the double bond of IPP, also isomerizing IPP so that the product is an allylic diphosphate. Thus, this part of the isoprenoid pathway appears nearly identical with that of cholesterol {{with the exception of the}} insect specific homoisoprenoid units.NAD+-dependent farnesol dehydrogenase, a corpora allata enzyme involved in juvenile hormone synthesis showed that the same source of enzymes efficiently make both mevalonate and its 3-ethyl homolog, homomevalonate.

5000|$|The third {{chapter is}} named [...] "Maxwell's Demons". It starts off {{by stating that}} {{proteins}} are the molecular agents of teleonomic performance in living beings. Monod continues by writing that living beings are chemical machines, every organism constitutes a coherent and functional unit, and that the organism is a self-constructing machine whose macroscopic structure is not determined by outside forces but by autonomous internal interactions. The author spends much of the chapter reviewing general facts of biochemistry. He explains that proteins are composed of 100-10,000 amino acids and he distinguishes between elongated fibrous proteins that play a mechanical role and the more numerous globular proteins that are folded upon themselves. He talks about the extraordinary specificity of action that enzymes display as exemplified by their ability to not only recognize a specific geometric isomer but an <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> as well. He points out that enzymes are optically active themselves, L isomers are the [...] "natural" [...] isomers, and that the specificity of action and the sterospecificity of the reaction conducted by an enzyme {{are the result of}} the positioning of the molecules with respect to each other. Monod writes that an enzymatic reaction can be seen in two steps: The formation of a sterospecific complex between protein and substrate and the catalytic activation of a reaction within the complex (he stresses again that the reaction is oriented and specified by the structure of the complex). He next considers the energetic differences between covalent and non-covalent bonds and how the speed of a reaction is affected by activation energy. Since the activation energy of a covalent bond is high the reaction will have a slower speed than that of a non-covalent bond (which occurs spontaneously and rapidly). The author points out that non-covalent interactions attain stability only through numerous interactions and when applied over short distances. To attain stable non-covalent interaction {{there is a need for}} complementary sites between two interacting molecules so as to permit several atoms of the one to enter into contact with several atoms of the other. In this complex the molecule of substrate is strictly positioned by the multiple non-covalent interactions with the enzyme. Enzymatic catalysis is believed to result from the inductive and polarizing action of certain chemical groupings of the specific receptor. By virtue of an enzyme's capacity to form sterospecific and non-covalent complexes with specific substrate the substrate is correctly presented in the precise orientation that specifies the catalytic effect of the enzyme. Monod reminds us that this reaction comes at the expense of chemical potential energy.|$|E

Starting with a model of three-point interaction between two individual molecules, we come to a more complex recognition system composed of homostructural and homochiral molecules, mimicking the asymmetric surfaces catalyzing biochemical reactions in living organisms. These asymmetric surfaces can discriminate between the enantiomers of entirely different molecules, so they are able to separate the synthetically prepared <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> mixtures and this system is a good model for studying second order weak interactions playing an important role in enzyme catalyzed reactions.

Compounds able to form such chiral surfaces are good and frequently applied resolving agents...|$|E
40|$|The (A) - and (S) -isomers of 5 -methylhydantoin (5 -MH) and of 5 -isopropylhydantoin (5 -IPH) were synthesized, and incubations of the {{individual}} isomers with a rat liver dihydropyrimidi-nase preparation (100, 000 g supernatant fraction) were carried out. Only the (R) -isomer of 5 -MH or 5 -IPH was ring-opened by the enzyme. Reversibility of the enzymatic ring-opening reaction could be demonstrated with only the (R) -isomer of 2 -methylhydantoic acid (2 -MHA) or 2 -isopropylhydantoic acid (2 -IPHA). The {{results of the present}} investigation show that the replacement in 5 -phenylhydantoin of the phenyl group with an alkyl group does not alter the stereospecificity of the hydantoin substrates in the ring-opening reaction. The results are used to form the concept that (R) -dihydrothymine, the <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> previously postulated as the natural substrate to the enzyme, may have a difterent type of binding at the active site of the enzyme...|$|E
30|$|The {{chirality}} {{of chemical}} compounds {{is an important}} property for their availability as building blocks for pharmaceuticals and chemicals, including chemical catalysts, liquid crystals, flavors, agrochemicals, and medicines. As is often the case, only one <b>optical</b> <b>isomer</b> primarily or completely exhibits the intended activity. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop methods to produce optically pure compounds for use in the industrial production of chiral compounds. Biotransformations using whole cells and enzyme-catalyzed reactions have been attempted for the production of various chiral compounds. The enzymatic asymmetric reduction of prochiral carbonyl compounds is a promising method for the production of chiral alcohols, because enzymes have certain advantages for use in chemical reactions under mild conditions and with chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selectivity (Hummel 1997; Kataoka et al. 2003; Goldberg et al. 2007). Structural information about useful enzymes would enable the generation of new enzymes exhibiting high activity, enhanced stability, and altered-coenzyme specificity, and would also enable elucidation of the detailed reaction mechanisms and substrate-binding specificities.|$|E
