5|$|The Forbidden City remains {{important}} in the civic scheme <b>of</b> <b>Beijing.</b> The central north–south axis remains the central axis <b>of</b> <b>Beijing.</b> This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Beijing is {{the second}} largest energy {{consumption}} city in China, so it is necessary of analyzing its energy consumption situation. The energy flow <b>of</b> <b>Beijing’s</b> energy consumption was analyzed by Energy Balance Sheet (EBS), which is an effective tool for researching energy economy and energy sustainable development. Different stages of energy flow in the process <b>of</b> <b>Beijing’s</b> energy utilization were analyzed by EBS, and the indicators including total energy consumption, comparison, structure, dynamic changes and energy intensity at all stages of energy flow were extracted. Further, the structure feature, change process, development trend <b>of</b> <b>Beijing’s</b> energy consumption was obtained, {{and the relationship between}} resources, economy, and energy was explained. Finally, some suggestions for the next focusing work on effective utilization <b>of</b> <b>Beijing’s</b> energy were proposed...|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{concerns}} over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including allegations that China violated its pledge to allow open media access, various alleged human rights violations, its continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan and North Korea), air pollution in both the city <b>of</b> <b>Beijing</b> and in neighbouring areas, proposed boycotts, warnings {{of the possibility that}} the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups, disruption from pro-Tibetan protesters, and religious persecutions.|$|E

For example, John of Montecorvino, archbishop <b>of</b> <b>Beijing</b> founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language. Long-distance trade brought new methods of doing business from the far East to Europe; bills of exchange, deposit banking, and insurance were introduced to Europe during the Pax Mongolica. Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveller would not be burdened {{by the weight of}} metal coins.|$|E
5|$|Between its 1968 debut and its {{appearance}} at the Beijing Olympics, Barbadian delegations appeared at every Summer Olympics except for the 1980 Summer Olympics, {{which took place in}} Moscow in the Soviet Union. With the exceptions of the 1968 and the 2008 Barbadian teams, every appearance by Barbados at the Olympics (as <b>of</b> <b>Beijing)</b> included at least ten athletes; its smallest delegation arrived in 2008, carrying only eight competitors. All the delegations except the one that arrived in 1968 have included female athletes. Prior to and including the 2008 Beijing Olympics, there had been one medalist from Barbados. Obadele Thompson won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, as part of Barbados' most successful showing at any Olympic games as of 2008.|$|E

5|$|But the {{agreement}} broke down a month later. In late June, the defeated {{king and his}} small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan. But on 1 July 1287, the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son Thihathu, the Viceroy of Prome. Anarchy ensued. Each region in the country which had not revolted broke away. No successor to Narathihapate, who could honor and enforce {{the terms of the}} treaty <b>of</b> <b>Beijing,</b> emerged. Indeed, a king would not emerge until May 1289.|$|E
5|$|In November 1657, a major {{cheating}} scandal erupted {{during the}} Shuntian provincial-level examinations in Beijing. Eight candidates from Jiangnan {{who were also}} relatives <b>of</b> <b>Beijing</b> officials had bribed examiners {{in the hope of}} being ranked higher in the contest. Seven examination supervisors found guilty of receiving bribes were executed, and several hundred people were sentenced to punishments ranging from demotion to exile and confiscation of property. The scandal, which soon spread to Nanjing examination circles, uncovered the corruption and influence-peddling that was rife in the bureaucracy, and that many moralistic officials from the north attributed to the existence of southern literary clubs and to the decline of classical scholarship.|$|E

5|$|Most Chinese {{people and}} many others have been {{influenced}} in some way by Taoist traditions. Since {{the creation of the}} People's Republic of China, its government has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the Chinese Taoist Association was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957. It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution under Mao, but was re-established in 1980. The headquarters of the association are at the Baiyunguan, or White Cloud Temple <b>of</b> <b>Beijing,</b> belonging to the Longmen branch of Quanzhen Taoism. Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, both belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools, and clergy ordination has been resumed.|$|E
5|$|Open-spandrel {{segmental}} arch bridge: The earliest known fully stone open-spandrel {{segmental arch}} bridge is the Zhaozhou Bridge in southern Hebei province, China, completed in 605 by the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineer Li Chun. The bridge span is 37.5m (123ft) {{and the structure}} relatively light in weight due to the four semi-circular arch spandrels which allow for additional flood waters to pass through. Other Chinese bridges would be influenced by this design, such as the open-spandrel Yongtong Bridge of Zhaoxian, Hebei built in 1130, and the simple segmental arch Lugou Bridge built in 1698 (originally in 1189). The latter, located just west <b>of</b> <b>Beijing</b> and features eleven segmental arches.|$|E
30|$|With {{increased}} {{water supply}} from the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, {{there will be}} a gradual increase in volume of redistributed water supplied to industrial production departments rather than to urban residents. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the economic benefits of South-to-North Water Diversion to all <b>of</b> <b>Beijing’s</b> industrial departments up to the year of 2020. This requires estimation <b>of</b> <b>Beijing’s</b> population and economic aggregate in 2020.|$|R

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{offense to}} the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the Portuguese {{so they could}} eat them. In reality, Simão had earned the Portuguese a bad reputation for buying young Chinese slaves, presumably {{some of whom were}} kidnapped after Simão offered local Chinese huge sums of money for child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by Portuguese authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Simão's abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all Portuguese) no doubt reached as far as the court <b>of</b> <b>Beijing,</b> which would soon condemn the Portuguese for this and other reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the Chinese Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists were simply called boxers by the Westerners due to the martial arts and {{calisthenics}} they practiced. It began as an anti-foreign, anti-imperialist, peasant-based movement that attacked foreigners who were building railroads and violating Feng shui. Christians who they felt were responsible for foreign domination of China were also targeted. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. The Qing commander in chief Ronglu expelled the Boxers from the city. The Qing ordered foreign diplomats and personnel to leave to Tianjin but they refused and stay put in the legation quarter <b>of</b> <b>Beijing.</b>|$|E
