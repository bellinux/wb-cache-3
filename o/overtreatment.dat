5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a distal DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to distal DVT <b>overtreatment.</b> Doppler ultrasound, CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011 the {{outgoing}} Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% {{of health care}} spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) <b>overtreatment</b> of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity {{of the health care}} system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.|$|E
25|$|The United States Preventive Services Task Force {{does not}} {{recommend}} electrocardiography for routine screening procedure in patients without symptoms and those at low risk for coronary heart disease. This is because an ECG may falsely indicate {{the existence of}} a problem, leading to misdiagnosis, the recommendation of invasive procedures, or <b>overtreatment.</b> However, persons employed in certain critical occupations, such as aircraft pilots, may be required to have an ECG as part of their routine health evaluations.|$|E
25|$|Prostate cancer {{screening}} is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection {{but does not}} decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due {{to the risk of}} overdiagnosis and <b>overtreatment,</b> as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5α-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not appear to affect the risk.|$|E
25|$|Active {{surveillance}} involves {{monitoring the}} tumor {{for signs of}} growth or the appearance of symptoms. The monitoring process may involve serial PSA, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies. The goal of surveillance is to avoid <b>overtreatment</b> and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that would never cause any problems for the person. This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause anxiety for people who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have life-threatening cancer. For 50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies from other causes.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenging}} aspects of long-term management is optimizing growth {{so that a}} child with CAH achieves his or her height potential because both undertreatment and <b>overtreatment</b> can reduce growth or the remaining time for growth. While glucocorticoids are essential for health, dosing is always a matter of approximation. In even mildly excessive amounts, glucocorticoids slow growth. On the other hand, adrenal androgens are readily converted to estradiol, which accelerates bone maturation {{and can lead to}} early epiphyseal closure. This narrow target of optimal dose is made more difficult to obtain by the imperfect replication of normal diurnal plasma cortisol levels produced by 2 or 3 oral doses of hydrocortisone. As a consequence, average height losses of about 4inches (10cm) have been reported with traditional management.|$|E
25|$|Reported toxicities include {{dry mouth}} (xerostomia) from salivary gland damage, 18% (grade 2); {{difficulty}} swallowing (dysphagia) from {{damage to the}} constrictor muscles, larynx and oesophageal sphincter, 15% (grade 2); subclinical aspiration up to 50% (reported incidence of aspiration pneumonia approximately 14%); hypothyroidism 28–38% at three years (may be up to 55% depending on amount of the thyroid gland exposed to over 45Gy radiation; esophageal stenosis 5%; osteonecrosis of the mandible 2.5%; and need for a gastrostomy tube to be placed {{at some point during}} or up to one year after treatment 4% (up to 16% with longer follow up). Concerns have been expressed regarding excessive short and long term toxicity, especially dysphagia and xerostomia, and hence whether standard doses expose patients with better prognoses are being exposed to <b>overtreatment</b> and unnecessary side effects.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{systems have}} a {{practice}} of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination {{is more likely to}} result in problems like misdiagnosis, <b>overtreatment,</b> or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.|$|E
500|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} {{whether there is a}} benefit from treating subclinical hypothyroidism, and whether this offsets the risks of <b>overtreatment.</b> Untreated subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary artery disease. A 2007 review found no benefit of thyroid hormone replacement except for [...] "some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function". There is no association between subclinical hypothyroidism and an increased risk of bone fractures, nor is there a link with cognitive decline.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{diagnosis}} of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (e.g. papillary thyroid cancer) is established or suspected by FNA the surgery is indicated, whereas watchful waiting strategy is not recommended in any evidence-based guidelines. [...] Watchful waiting reduces overdiagnosis and <b>overtreatment</b> of thyroid cancer among old patients.|$|E
2500|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} regarding excessive {{short and long}} term toxicity, especially dysphagia and xerostomia, and hence whether standard doses expose patients with better prognoses to <b>overtreatment</b> and unnecessary side effects. Current toxicities have been described as [...] "not tolerable", and hence an intense interest in de-escalation.|$|E
2500|$|Clinical judgement, {{rather than}} over {{reliance}} on MRI {{or any other}} modality, is strongly advised in determining [...] the cause of shoulder pain, or planning its treatment, since rotator cuff tears are also found in some without pain or symptoms. The role of X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound, is adjunctive to clinical assessment and serves to confirm a diagnosis provisionally made by a thorough history and physical examination. Over-reliance on imaging may potentially lead to <b>overtreatment</b> or distraction from the true underlying problem.|$|E
2500|$|Consequently, {{finding and}} {{treating}} {{many cases of}} DCIS represents overdiagnosis and <b>overtreatment.</b> [...] Treatment is given to all women with DCIS because it is currently impossible to predict which patients with DCIS will have an indolent, non-fatal course, and which few will inevitably progress to invasive cancer and premature death if left untreated. Consequently, all patients with DCIS are treated {{in much the same}} way, with at least wide local excision, and sometimes mastectomy if the DCIS is very extensive. The cure rate for DCIS if treated appropriately is extremely high, partly because the majority of DCIS cases were harmless in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|There are 2 common {{methods of}} deworming. [...] Purge dewormers that kill parasites {{with a single}} strong dose, are given periodically, {{depending}} on local conditions and veterinary recommendations. Continuous dewormers, also known as [...] "daily" [...] dewormers, are given in the horse's feed each day, in small doses, and kill worms as they infect the horse. [...] Neither of these methods is perfect; purge dewormers are effective for rapidly killing parasites, but are gone from the horses' body in a few days, and then the horse may start to be re-infected. [...] Continuous dewormers are a mild low dose and may be easier on the horse, but may not be effective in quickly killing worms in a heavily-infected horse and may contribute to drug resistance. [...] If a treatment doesn't kill at least 95% of a worm species, that species is classed as 'resistant' to the drug. [...] For adult horses, frequent rotation of several types of dewormers is no longer recommended, as it can often lead to <b>overtreatment</b> and subsequent drug resistance.|$|E

50|$|Thyroid care {{changed in}} other ways as well. Accurate T4 and T3 {{measurements}} became widely used in the 1970s, and by the late 1980s, TSH measurement had become sensitive enough to detect mild degrees of hyperthyroidism and <b>overtreatment.</b> Blood levels of thyroid hormones and TSH {{were found to be}} the best predictors of objective benefits from thyroid replacement: those with the most severe measurable deficiency enjoyed the most dramatic and sustained benefits. It was also discovered that even mild hyperthyroidism as defined by a suppressed TSH level, whether due to disease or <b>overtreatment,</b> was associated with poorer bone density in women, and with higher rates of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients.|$|E

50|$|When {{public or}} private {{insurance}} cover expenses and doctors are paid under a fee-for-service (FFS) model, neither has an incentive to consider the cost of treatment, a combination that contributes to waste.

50|$|Unnecessary {{health care}} (overutilization, overuse, or <b>overtreatment)</b> is {{healthcare}} {{provided with a}} higher volume or cost than is appropriate.

50|$|It is most {{commonly}} associated with hypoxia and COPD. Additionally, it {{can be caused by}} theophylline toxicity, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index commonly used to treat COPD. Theophylline can cause a number of different abnormal heart rhythms when in excess, and thus further predisposes COPD patients to MAT. Theophylline toxicity often occurs following acute or chronic <b>overtreatment</b> or factors lowering its clearance from the body.|$|E
50|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} {{are used}} in combination with traditional clinicopathologic factors to decide on a treatment plan. MammaPrint provides a binary result, either high risk or low risk. Patients with a low risk result are unlikely to develop distant metastases and are therefore unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy.

50|$|The rate of <b>overtreatment</b> in the U.S. {{is similar}} to the rate of over {{diagnosis}} since the majority of men undergo curative intervention after receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis. A range of estimates of over diagnosis between 23% and 42% have been reported based on U.S. incidence. Depending upon the age at diagnosis, and the disease characteristics, the likelihood that a screen detected cancer has been over diagnosed can vary from below 5% to more than 75%.|$|E

50|$|Many {{scientific}} reviews {{have concluded}} that indiscriminate screening mammography for all middle-aged and older women, regardless of each woman's individual risk of developing breast cancer, results in <b>overtreatment</b> of some women whose cancer would never harm them.
