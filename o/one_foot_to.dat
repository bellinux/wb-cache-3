5|$|The first {{recorded}} instances of high jumping competitions were in Scotland in the 19th century. Further competitions were organised in 1840 in England and in 1865 the basic {{rules of the}} modern event were standardised there. Athletes have a short run up and then take off from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> jump over a horizontal bar and fall back onto a cushioned landing area. The men's high jump {{was included in the}} 1896 Olympics and a women's competition followed in 1928.|$|E
25|$|A French {{variant of}} {{hopscotch}} {{is known as}} escargot (snail) or marelle ronde (round hopscotch). It is played on a spiral course. Players must hop on <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> {{the center of the}} spiral and then reverse their path to back out again.|$|E
500|$|Hull was {{promoted}} to flying officer on 16 April 1938. As war loomed, the squadron began to prepare for combat in late 1938, and in December that year was re-equipped with Hawker HurricaneMkIs. Hull reacted to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in September 1939 with great excitement; according to Hector Bolitho, No. 43 Squadron's intelligence officer, the Rhodesian leapt from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> the other in the officer's mess, repeating the words [...] "wizard, wizard".|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} of Dance Dance Revolution is <b>to</b> move <b>one's</b> <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> a set pattern. One player can play using one dance pad (Single mode), two players can play using one dance pad each (Versus mode), or one player can play using both dance pads (Doubles mode).|$|R
2500|$|The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about [...] When walking, a horse's legs {{follow this}} sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, {{in a regular}} 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will always have one foot raised {{and the other three}} feet on the ground, save for a brief moment when weight is being {{transferred}} from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> another. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.|$|E
2500|$|The ISUCF'V'MB {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} and traditional marching style during its pregame presentations. The high-step march (used {{for the majority of}} pregame) incorporates a high leg/knee motion combined with a downward toe point. In addition, a similar half-height, double-time version of the high-step, called 'X'ing, is used to enter the field for pregame performances. The swing cadence the band uses to march into the tunnel is also an ISUCF'V'MB signature; members move in a half-time while jumping from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> the other to cadence in a motion that is similar to hopping. For halftime performances the band uses [...] "glide step", which allows it to maximize its musical and marching output. This is the step the band uses during parades.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Laudrup was {{acclaimed}} for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep {{passes and}} dribbling ability. In regard to his vision, Jorge Valdano, the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid, said, [...] "e has eyes everywhere." [...] His trademark move– looking {{one way and}} passing the other– fooled countless opponents during his career. The Laudrup dribble, a feint {{also known as the}} croqueta, was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> the other away from the defender. His skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. This led to the expression [...] "Made in Laudrup", widely used in Spain about his creative style of play. Numerous teammates of his have said, [...] "Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball." ...|$|E
60|$|When one grew old {{and wild}} {{and ran up}} bills, one somehow never ran them up with Gessler Brothers. It would not have seemed {{becoming}} {{to go in there}} and stretch out <b>one's</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> that blue iron-spectacled glance, owing him for more than--say--two pairs, just the comfortable reassurance that one was still his client.|$|R

50|$|Pretexting {{can also}} be used to {{impersonate}} co-workers, police, bank, tax authorities, clergy, insurance investigators—or any other individual who could have perceived authority or right-to-know in the mind of the targeted victim. The pretexter must simply prepare answers to questions that might be asked by the victim. In some cases, all that is needed is a voice that sounds authoritative, an earnest tone, and an ability <b>to</b> think on <b>one's</b> <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> create a pretextual scenario.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{forms of}} jazz use clear regular meters and {{strongly}} pulsed rhythms, usually in 4/4 or (less often) 3/4. Free jazz normally retains a general pulsation and often swings but without regular meter, and we encounter frequent [...] and ritardando, giving {{an impression of}} the rhythm moving in waves. Despite all of this, it is still very often possible <b>to</b> tap <b>one's</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> a free jazz performance; meter is more freely variable but has not disappeared entirely.|$|R

2500|$|From Uppingham he {{took the}} headship of Wanganui Collegiate School in New Zealand. He {{remained}} in that post for 18 years, leaving in 1954. The Wanganui Collegian wrote, [...] "He believed in good sportsmanship, modesty, tolerance, and seeing the other man's point of view, and he was himself an exemplar of these qualities. He would go to endless trouble to help anybody. To watch him taking a game was a liberal education {{in the art of}} coaching. A devotee of using <b>one's</b> <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> play slow bowling and of forward play." ...|$|R

60|$|The man stepped very {{cautiously}} with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> on <b>to</b> the balcony, {{and peered}} forward. But {{the glass door}} reflected into his eyes. He followed slowly with the other foot, and crept forward, ready at any moment to take flight.|$|R

5000|$|The major {{mission of}} Toms {{is that a}} business, rather than a charity, would help their impact last longer. In his speech at the Second Annual Clinton Global Initiative Mycoskie states that his initial {{motivation}} was a disease called podoconiosis—a debilitating and disfiguring disease which causes <b>one's</b> <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> swell {{along with many other}} health implications. Also known as [...] "Mossy Foot", podoconiosis is a form of elephantiasis that affects the lymphatic system of the lower legs. The disease is a soil-transmitted disease caused by walking in silica-rich soil. Toms currently works with factories nearby where they perform some of their shoe drops.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pat—you'll {{dance with}} me—Leslie hates a polka." [...] I danced with her. I {{do not know}} the time when I could not polka—it seems innate in <b>one's</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>to</b> dance that dance. We went flying round, hissing through the dead leaves. The night, the low hung yellow moon, the pallor of the west, the blue cloud of evening {{overhead}} went round and through the fantastic branches of the old laburnum, spinning a little madness. You cannot tire Lettie; her feet are wings that beat the air. When at last I stayed her she laughed as fresh as ever, as she bound her hair.|$|R
5000|$|Movement in {{a linear}} fashion is achieved, principally, by a [...] "step and slide." [...] The fighter will first {{move to the}} desired 'point' on the {{triangular}} matrix, then swiftly slide one's rear leg to meet his leading foot. From this position, the practitioner either rests <b>one's</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> facilitate an attack or defense, or shoot his <b>foot</b> out <b>to</b> another point to complete another step and slide motion. Advanced users of triangular footwork literally [...] "bounce" [...] their rear feet off the ankle or heel area of their leading <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> jut out to another point as swiftly as possible, allowing for change of direction at incredible speed. The majority of the arts that utilize triangular footwork can effectively be practiced in either right or left leads interchangeably, so they are naturally suited for this manner of movement.|$|R
