The work on that study helped shape Franklin's ideas about the complexities of modern technological society.|$|E
40|$|NACA model 11 -C {{was tested}} with four {{different}} depths <b>of</b> <b>step</b> {{to obtain information}} as {{to the effect of}} the depth <b>of</b> <b>step</b> on the water performance. The depths <b>of</b> <b>step</b> were selected to cover the practicable range of depths and in each case the included angle between the forebody and afterbody keels was kept the same 6 - 1 / 2 degrees. Small depths <b>of</b> <b>step</b> were found to give lower resistance at speeds below and at the hump speed of the model and greater depths <b>of</b> <b>step</b> lower resistance at high speeds. For low resistance throughout the speed range of the model investigated the most desirable depth <b>of</b> <b>step</b> is from 2. 5 to 4. 0 percent of the beam. The change of the best trim angle caused by variation of the depth <b>of</b> <b>step</b> was not appreciable. Increased depth <b>of</b> <b>step</b> caused increases in the maximum positive trimming moments at all trim angles investigated...|$|R

40|$|Striatal-enriched protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase (STEP) is a CNS-enriched protein {{implicated in}} multiple neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. STEP regulates key signaling proteins required for synaptic strengthening {{as well as}} NMDA and AMPA receptor trafficking. Both high and low levels <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> disrupt synaptic function and contribute to learning and behavioral deficits. High levels <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> are present in human postmortem samples and animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia and in animal models of fragile X syndrome. Low levels <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> activity are present in additional disorders that include ischemia, Huntington’s chorea, alcohol abuse, and stress disorders. Thus the current model <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> is that optimal levels are required for optimal synaptic function. Here {{we focus on the}} role <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> in Alzheimer’s disease and the mechanisms by which STEP activity is increased in this illness. Both genetic lowering <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> levels and pharmacological inhibition <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> activity in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease reverse the biochemical and cognitive abnormalities that are present. These findings suggest that STEP is an important point for modulation of proteins required for synaptic plasticity...|$|R

Subjects were 60 university athletes with age of 18 to 22. As markers, stickers were placed on the subjects at the following locations; ear hole, acromion, trochanter major, knee and lateral malleolus on the side. While being videotaped from the side, subjects were placed on a load meter and were asked to apply weight on both feet, on right foot and on the front <b>of</b> right foot. <b>Step</b> point measurements and posture were obtained from load meter readings and video tapes respectively. Subjects were divided a group into three groups (front <b>of</b> <b>step</b> point, center <b>of</b> <b>step</b> point, rear <b>of</b> <b>step</b> point) according to a task. The following thing was made clear as a result of having done MANOVA. (1) In case of weight on both feet, there was not the difference of posture by a difference <b>of</b> <b>step</b> point.

The influence of these parameters on the transient processes in step controllers and on the output position of the actuator is analyzed. Transient processes in step controllers with motor-driven actuators are simulated in PI and PID control mode. These transient processes are compared to the transient processes in continuous controllers. The accuracy <b>of</b> <b>step</b> PID controllers is analyzed, and restrictions on the parameters <b>of</b> <b>step</b> PID controllers are presented. The diagrams <b>of</b> <b>step</b> PID controllers considered in this paper can be implemented in the up-to-date PLCs software for automatic control using the electric motor-driven actuators in the control loops...|$|R

5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only {{if they could be}} constructed in a finite number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E

One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E

5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within.
