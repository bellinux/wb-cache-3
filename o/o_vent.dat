40|$|Volcanic eruptions {{are often}} {{accompanied}} by spatiotemporal migration of ground deformation, a consequence of pressure changes within magma reservoirs and pathways. We modeled the propagation of pressure variations through the east rift zone (ERZ) of K" ılauea Volcano, Hawai‘i, caused by magma " o-Kupaianaha withdrawal during the early eruptive episodes (1983 – 1985) of the ongoing Pu‘u ‘ O‘" " eruption. Eruptive activity at the Pu‘u ‘ O‘" <b>o</b> <b>vent</b> was typically accompanied by abrupt deflation that lasted for several hours and {{was followed by a}} sudden onset of gradual inflation once the eruptive episode had ended. Similar patterns of deflation and inflation were recorded at K" ılauea’s summit, approximately 15 km to the northwest, albeit with time delays of hours. These delay times can be reproduced by modeling the spatiotemporal changes in magma pressure and flow rate within an elastic-walled dike that traverses K" ılauea’s ERZ. Key parameters that affect the behavior of the magma-dike system are the dike dimensions, the elasticity of the wall rock, the magma viscosity, and to a lesser degree the magnitude and duration of the pressure variations themselves. Combinations of these parameters define a transport efficiency and a pressure diffusivity, which vary somewhat from episode to episode, resulting in variations in delay times. The observed variations in transport efficiency are most easily explained by small, localized changes to the geometry of the magma pathwa...|$|E

30|$|As stated before, air {{is usually}} vented after a single {{pass through the}} {{bioreactor}}. However, for other gas feeds, for example air enriched by <b>O</b> 2, <b>venting</b> the off-gas after a single pass through the bioreactor would lead to losses of valuable gases. These losses can be reduced by recirculating the off-gas. A closed off-gas recycling when using pure O 2 for aeration was presented by de Ory et al. (2004) for vinegar production to avoid losses of ethanol via off-gas, but the economic feasibility of the system compared to the conventional aeration method was not evaluated. Chang et al. (2010) presented such an evaluation for an industrial-scale poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) fermentation. Their results showed that an off-gas recycle system including pressure swing adsorption for production of pure O 2 leads to lower fermentation costs than conventional aeration with air.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} use of ethy-gen II ® {{ripening}} concentrate (150 - 300 ppm of ethylene) {{as an alternative to}} the traditional method of off vine ripening would support ripening of locally cultivated mangoes. Mangoes, Keith variety, were treated with the ripening concentrate for 15 h in Graff ® standard reefer of 66. 5 m 3. Humidity was sustained by knapsack spraying of 20 litres of water inside the reefer. Fruits were stored for 6 days after treatment at ambient temperature 23 ± 2 <b>o</b> C, <b>vented</b> 30 min per day (1000 hGMT) in an air tight room to further ripe the mangoes. Total Soluble Solids (TSS) and sensory quality were studied at an interval of 2 days during the storage period. Sensory quality was assessed specifically on day 2 of storage. Results showed that ethy-gen II ® treated mangoes ripened uniformly and faster than untreated mangoes Treated mangoes had higher average TSS, attaining an average brix (14. 8 o) at day 2 of storage. The control had brix of 12. 18 o at the end of the storage period. Treated mangoes had the highest percentage (100 %) while the control had 34. 81 % at day 6 of storage. The fruity odour of the ripening concentrate had an impact on the taste of treated mangoes, however sensory evaluation revealed no significant difference (p < 0. 05) among treatments. Ethylene produced from ethy-gen II ® supports uniform ripening of locally cultivated mangoes and increased period of ventilation during storage helps to remove the fruity odour...|$|R

MethodsThe studied strains were isolated from urine, stool, blood and wound of infected patients and identified by biochemical tests. In further, the antibacterial activity of 8 ethanolic local plant extracts including Querqus brantii (Q. brantii), Ziziphus spina-christi (Z. spina-christi), Peganum harmala (P. harmala), Oliveira decumbens (O. decumbens), Galium tricornutum (G. tricornutum), Vitex pseudo negundo (Vi. pseudo negundo), Salvia officinalis (S. officinalis), Vaccaria pyramidata (V. pyramidata) were then evaluated using agar disc diffusion method. ResultsA total of 9 isolates were isolated and identified as S. aureus. Antibacterial {{profile of the}} strains showed that the strains were resistant to methicillin and cefixime. The highest antibacterial activity against the studied strains were belong to Q. brantii, P. harmala, Z. spina-christi and <b>O.</b> decumbens <b>vent</b> extracts with 11 - 40 mm, 15 - 28 mm, 8 - 26 mm and 10 - 20 mm of diameters, respectively. Intermediate antibacterial activity was exhibited by G. tricornutum and Vi. pseudo negundo {{against some of the}} studied strains with 7 - 20 mm and 7 - 13 mm of diameters, respectively. Noteworthy, out of 9 studied strains; 6 and 2 of them were resistant to the G. tricornutum and Vi. pseudo negundo extracts, respectively. The S. officinalis and Va. pyramidata, however, showed no antibacterial activity against the studied strains. ConclusionsThe Q. brantii, P. harmala, Z. spina-christi and O. decumbens extracts were shown to possess strong antibacterial activity against methicillin and cefixime resistant S. aureus strains and can be considered as the promising natural antibiotics for treating the studied strains...|$|R

Soil pools of nitrite NO 2 (-), nitrate NO 3 (-), and ammonia (NH 3) were measured in soil samples taken at 2 and 10 cm depths during each emission collection to determine transformations of the nitrogen pools coupled with N 2 O emissions. The highest diel N 2 O emission occur midday in the Spring cycle, measuring 9. 0 g N/ha/d only for several weeks, while emissions dropped to less than 1. 0 g N/ha/day during hot, dry, and colder months. Intensively managed meadows (4 fertilizations and harvests per year plus pest management) induced higher seasonal N 2 O emissions than minimal treatment (1 fertilization and harvest) averaging 2. 75 and 5. 97 g N/ha/day.

40|$|Many deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} vent systems are regularly impacted by volcanic eruptions, leaving fresh basalt where abundant animal and microbial communities once thrived. After an eruption, microbial biofilms {{are often the}} first visible evidence of biotic re-colonization. The present study {{is the first to}} investigate microbial colonization of newly exposed basalt surfaces in the context of vent fluid chemistry {{over an extended period of}} time (4 to 293 days) by deploying basalt blocks within an established diffuse-flow vent at the 9 <b>o</b> 50 ’N <b>vent</b> field on the East Pacific Rise (EPR). Additionally, samples obtained after a recent eruption at the same vent field allowed for comparison between experimental results and those from natural microbial re-colonization. Over 9 months, the community changed from being composed almost exclusively of Epsilonproteobacteria to a more diverse assemblage, corresponding with a potential expansion of metabolic capabilities. The process of biofilm formation appears to generate similar surface-associated communities within and across sites by selecting for a subset of fluid-associated microbes, via species sorting. Furthermore, the high incidence of shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs) over time and across different vent sites suggests that the microbial communities colonizing new surfaces at diffuse-flow vent sites might follow a predictable successional pattern...|$|R

40|$|Osmium {{and other}} platinum-group {{elements}} (PGEs) have been measured in sediments accumulating {{directly under the}} Rainbow hydrothermal plume at 36 [deg]N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 187 Os/ 188 Os and PGE concentrations in the sediments of four cores taken 2 - 25 km from the active vent site reveal evidence of both radiogenic Os scavenged from seawater and, importantly, unradiogenic Os released by hydrothermal venting. The majority of analyses (n= 16) yield 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios that fall in a narrow range (0. 99 - 1. 06) close to that of modern seawater. In these samples, Os concentrations correlate linearly with hydrothermal V enrichments, which are also derived from seawater scavenging. A smaller subset of samples, characterized by unusually high concentrations of Ni and Cr derived from ultramafic rock fragments, exhibit distinctly lower 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios. Their Ir content is also higher, and their PGE ratios are more similar to mantle material than the PGE patterns of the larger set of samples dominated by seawater-scavenged Os. Although the two most proximal cores lack evidence for any similar ultramafic 'detritus' in their surficial sediments, 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios in these samples are also {{lower than that of}} ambient seawater, suggesting they are likely to have been influenced by unradiogenic <b>Os</b> from <b>vent</b> fluid incorporated into the plume. Samples from the most distal core, by contrast, exhibit 187 Os/ 188 Os ratios indistinguishable from that of seawater. Compared with 'background' NE Atlantic sediments, Os is enriched four-fold in the seawater-dominated samples, while Pd, Pt and Ir are twice the background value. Burial fluxes of Os scavenged by hydrothermal Fe in these sediments are 200 - 400 pg cm- 2 kyr- 1, up to twice that found on the EPR, and several times the background (bg) of 50 pg cm- 2 kyr- 1. For Pt, burial fluxes are 1800 - 3000 pg cm- 2 kyr- 1 (bg ca. 1000 pg cm- 2 kyr- 1) and for Pd 2700 - 4600 pg. cm- 2 kyr- 1 (bg ca. 800 pg cm- 2 kyr- 1...|$|R
40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{reported}} that photochemical nucleation of new ultrafine particles (UFP) in urban environments within high insolation regions occurs simultaneously with high ozone (O 3). In this work, we evaluate the atmospheric dynamics leading to summer O 3 episodes in the Madrid Air Basin (Central Iberia) by means of measuring a 3 D distribution of concentrations for both pollutants. To this end, we obtained vertical profiles (up to 1200 m, above ground level) using tethered balloons and miniaturised instrumentation at a suburban site located to the SW of the Madrid Metropolitan Area (MMA), Majadahonda site (MJDH) in July 2016. Simultaneously, measurements of an extensive number of air quality and meteorological parameters were carried out at 3 supersites across the MMA. Furthermore, data from O 3 -soundings and daily radio-sounding were also used to interpret the atmospheric dynamics. The results demonstrate the concatenation of venting and accumulation episodes, with relative <b>O</b> 3 lows (<b>venting)</b> and peaks (accumulation) in surface levels. Regardless of the episode type, fumigation of high altitude O 3 -rich layers contributes the major proportion of surface O 3 concentrations. Accumulation episodes are characterised by a relatively thinner planetary boundary layer (PBL    2400  m). This orographic-meteorological setting causes the vertical recirculation of air masses and the enrichment of O 3 in the lower tropospheric layers. When the highly polluted urban plume from Madrid is affected by these dynamics, the highest O x (O 3  + NO 2) concentrations are recorded in the MMA. Vertical O 3 profiles during venting episodes, with marked synoptic winds and a deepening of the PBL reaching >  2000  m above sea level, were characterised by an upward gradient in O 3 levels, whereas low-altitude O 3 concentration maxima due to local/regional production were found during the accumulation episodes. The two contributions to O 3 surface levels (fumigation from high altitude strata and local/regional production) require very different approaches for policy actions. In contrast to O 3 vertical top-down transfer, UFP are formed in the lowest levels and are transferred upwards progressively {{with the growth of}} the PBL...|$|R
40|$|Brothers volcano, of the Kermadec intraoceanic arc, is host to a {{hydrothermal}} system {{unique among}} seafloor hydrothermal systems known {{anywhere in the}} world. It has two distinct vent fields, known as the NW Caldera and Cone sites, whose geology, permeability, vent fluid compositions, mineralogy, and ore-forming conditions are {{in stark contrast to}} each other. The NW Caldera site strikes for ∼ 600 m in a SW–NE direction with chimneys occurring over a ∼ 145 -m depth interval, between ∼ 1, 690 and 1, 545 m. At least 100 dead and active sulfide chimney spires occur in this field and are typically 2 – 3 m in height, with some reaching 6 – 7 m. Their ages (at time of sampling) fall broadly into three groups: < 4, 23, and 35 years old. The chimneys typically occur near the base of individual fault-controlled benches on the caldera wall, striking in lines orthogonal to the slopes. Rarer are massive sulfide crusts 2 – 3 m thick. Two main types of chimney predominate: Cu-rich (up to 28. 5 wt. % Cu) and, more commonly, Zn-rich (up to 43. 8 wt. % Zn). Geochemical results show that Mo, Bi, Co, Se, Sn, and Au (up to 91 ppm) are correlated with the Cu mineralization, whereas Cd, Hg, Sb, Ag, and As are associated with the dominant Zn-rich mineralization. The Cone site comprises the Upper Cone site atop the summit of the recent (main) dacite cone and the Lower Cone site that straddles the summit of an older, smaller, more degraded dacite cone on the NE flank of the main cone. Huge volumes of diffuse venting are seen at the Lower Cone site, in contrast to venting at both the Upper Cone and NW Caldera sites. Individual vents are marked by low-relief (≤ 0. 5 m) mounds comprising predominately native sulfur with bacterial mats. Vent fluids of the NW Caldera field are focused, hot (≤ 300 °C), acidic (pH[*]≥[*] 2. 8), metal-rich, and gas-poor. Calculated end-member fluids from NW Caldera vents indicate that phase separation has occurred, with Cl values ranging from 93 % to 137 % of seawater values. By contrast, vent fluids at the Cone site are diffuse, noticeably cooler (≤ 122 °C), more acidic (pH 1. 9), metal-poor, and gas-rich. Higher-than-seawater values of SO 4 and Mg in the Cone vent fluids show that these ions are being added to the hydrothermal fluid and are not being depleted via normal water/rock interactions. Iron oxide crusts 3 years in age cover the main cone summit and appear to have formed from Fe-rich brines. Evidence for magmatic contributions to the hydrothermal system at Brothers includes: high concentrations of dissolved CO 2 (e. g., 206 mM/kg at the Cone site); high CO 2 / 3 He; negative δD and δ 18 OH 2 <b>O</b> for <b>vent</b> fluids; negative δ 34 S for sulfides (to − 4. 6 ‰), sulfur (to − 10. 2 ‰), and δ 15 N 2 (to − 3. 5 ‰); vent fluid pH values to 1. 9; and mineral assemblages common to high-sulfidation systems. Changing physicochemical conditions at the Brothers hydrothermal system, and especially the Cone site, occur over periods of months to hundreds of years, as shown by interlayered Cu[*]+[*]Au- and Zn-rich zones in chimneys, variable fluid and isotopic compositions, similar shifts in 3 He/ 4 He values for both Cone and NW Caldera sites, and overprinting of “magmatic” mineral assemblages by water/rock-dominated assemblages. Metals, especially Cu and possibly Au, may be entering the hydrothermal system via the dissolution of metal-rich glasses. They are then transported rapidly up into the system via magmatic volatiles utilizing vertical (∼ 2. 5 km long), narrow (∼ 300 -m diameter) “pipes,” consistent with evidence of vent fluids forming at relatively shallow depths. The NW Caldera and Cone sites are considered to represent stages along a continuum between water/rock- and magmatic/hydrothermal-dominated end-members...|$|R
