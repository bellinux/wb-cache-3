5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, a variety <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E

5|$|General homomorphisms {{can also}} {{be thought of as}} a kind of coloring: if the {{vertices}} of a fixed graph H are the available colors and edges of H describe which colors are compatible, then an H-coloring of G is an assignment <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> to vertices of G such that adjacent vertices get compatible colors.|$|E

The Encyclopedia also delves into color as it applies to other domains such as art and design – ie – color design, color harmony, color palettes, color and accessibility, researching color deficiency, and color and data visualization. There is also information on color in art conservation, color and architecture, color and educations, color and culture, and an overview of the history <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and comments on the future <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> This unique work will extend the influence <b>of</b> <b>color</b> to a much wider audience than has been possible to date...|$|R

5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the challenges of}} intra-race legal representation for lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> law students <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> and those teaching law students <b>of</b> <b>color</b> by analyzing how {{the dynamics of the}} lawyer’s and client’s racial sameness impact legal representation. This Article brings together three strands of lawyering theory – the role of race in lawyering, critical race theory, {{and the role of the}} lawyer in intra-race legal representation. In doing so, this Article explores a number of provocative questions: Does being the same race as their clients make lawyers better legal representatives? Should lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> embrace or resist race’s influence on intra-race legal representation? How do lawyers balance their desire to remain representative of their race with their responsibility to their clients? This Article also scrutinizes the role of the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> in intra-race legal representation by examining questions that are under-reviewed, such as: Do lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> engage in the same explicit and implicit biases against their clients <b>of</b> <b>color</b> that lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> similarly suffer? Do racial stereotypes tempt the lawyer to be more sympathetic towards, and understanding of, their same-race clients, or does it cause the lawyer to view the same-race client as an ‘other’? For lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and clients <b>of</b> <b>color</b> who seek same-race legal representation, this Article explores a difficult question— Is the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> representative enough <b>of</b> the race to be a representative for the client, particularly when the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and the client <b>of</b> <b>color</b> live in different socio-economic environments? Given the resurgent examination of the role of race in interactions between persons <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and persons <b>of</b> power, this Article presents a timely opportunity to examine and question the role of race and the impact of divergent socio-economic status in intra-race legal representation...|$|R

5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by Van de Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E

40|$|In the {{proposed}} paper, {{we present a}} three-dimensional interactive visualization method {{for the analysis of}} the referential aspects <b>of</b> <b>color</b> term semantics. Using rgl and geometry R packages, the method is designed to represent the distribution <b>of</b> <b>color</b> term referents as point clouds or convex hulls in a three dimensional color space such as RGB, Lab, Luv etc. (see Fig. 1) Theoretical background – the technique has been developed for the usage-based analysis of linguistic categorization and is aimed to complement the distributional methods applied in the traditional corpus studies. Corpus-based analyses <b>of</b> <b>color</b> term meanings have provided important insights into the structure <b>of</b> <b>color</b> concepts, however, they can give only indirect access to the referential aspects <b>of</b> <b>color</b> term meaning (Kerttula 2002, Steinvall 2002). Considering the essentially perceptual nature <b>of</b> <b>color</b> concepts {{and the role of the}} extralinguistic reality in their construal, the lack of referential information considerably limits the possibility of modeling the very core <b>of</b> the <b>color</b> term semantics. Furthermore, this limitation remains a major methodological obstacle for developing cognitive linguistic models <b>of</b> <b>color</b> conceptualization which would be compatible with the experimental findings <b>of</b> <b>color</b> categorization studies in psychology, anthropology, color vision, artificial intelligence, and other cognitive sciences, where the referential/perceptual aspects <b>of</b> <b>color</b> categories play a central role...|$|R
