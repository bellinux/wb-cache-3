40|$|Purpose - This {{prospective}} study examined how environmental smoking affects the perception <b>of</b> lifetime <b>smoking</b> prevalence {{and thereby the}} likelihood <b>of</b> subsequent regular <b>smoking.</b> Methods - A longitudinal design (N = 6769) with three waves {{was used to test}} our research questions. Exposure to smoking by peers, best friends, and parents were assessed at T 1. Perception <b>of</b> lifetime <b>smoking</b> prevalence was calculated at T 2. Adolescent smoking was assessed at three waves. Results - Overestimation <b>of</b> lifetime <b>smoking</b> prevalence was predicted by having a predominantly smoking peer group, having a best friend who smokes, and by having at least one parent who smokes. In consistency with a false consensus effect, smokers were more susceptible to overestimate lifetime smoking prevalence than nonsmokers. Subsequently, while controlling for smoking at T 2, overestimating lifetime smoking prevalence was predictive <b>of</b> regular <b>smoking</b> at T 3 (in accordance with the conformity hypothesis). Specifically, overestimation <b>of</b> lifetime <b>smoking</b> appeared to mediate the effects <b>of</b> environmental <b>smoking</b> (peers, best friends, and parents) on adolescent smoking. No support was found for a moderation effect of exposure to environmental smoking on the link between misperception <b>of</b> lifetime <b>smoking</b> prevalence and regular smoking. Conclusions - The study offers a rare and needed theoretical and empirical research examining environmental and individual predictors <b>of</b> regular <b>smoking.</b> Besides direct prevention <b>of</b> exposure to <b>smoking,</b> cognitions that are a product <b>of</b> exposure to <b>smoking</b> need to be addressed in prevention campaigns...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} joint effects <b>of</b> movie <b>smoking</b> {{exposure}} and team sports participation on established smoking. Design: Longitudinal study. Setting: School- and telephone-based surveys in New Hampshire and Vermont between September 1999 through November 1999 and February 2006 through February 2007. Participants: A total of 2048 youths aged 16 to 21 years at follow-up. Main Exposures: Baseline movie smoking exposure categorized in quartiles assessed when respondents were aged 9 to 14 years and team sports participation assessed when respondents were aged 16 to 21 years. Main Outcome Measure: Established smoking (having smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes in one's lifetime) at follow-up. Results: At follow-up, 353 respondents (17. 2 %) were established smokers. Exposure {{to the highest}} quartile <b>of</b> movie <b>smoking</b> compared with the lowest increased the likelihood <b>of</b> established <b>smoking</b> (odds ratio= 1. 63; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 03 - 2. 57), and team sports nonparticipants compared with participants were {{twice as likely to}} be established smokers (odds ratio= 2. 01; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 47 - 2. 74). The joint effects <b>of</b> movie <b>smoking</b> exposure and team sports participation revealed that at each quartile <b>of</b> movie <b>smoking</b> exposure, the odds <b>of</b> established <b>smoking</b> were greater for team sports nonparticipants than for participants. We saw a dose-response relationship <b>of</b> movie <b>smoking</b> exposure for established smoking only among team sports participants. Conclusions: Team sports participation clearly plays a protective role against established smoking, {{even in the face of}} exposure to movie smoking. However, movie smoking exposure increases the risk <b>of</b> established <b>smoking</b> among both team sports participants and nonparticipants. Parents, teachers, coaches, and clinicians should be aware that encouraging team sports participation in tandem with minimizing early exposure to movie smoking may offer the greatest likelihood <b>of</b> preventing youth <b>smoking.</b> © 2009 American Medical Association.

5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method <b>of</b> <b>smoking.</b> It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|After {{recognizing}} {{the harmful effects}} <b>of</b> <b>smoking</b> on health, several items of anti-smoking legislation were enacted. The later 1930s increasingly saw anti-tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis. In 1938, the Luftwaffe and the Reichspost imposed a ban on smoking. Smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions, but also in several public offices and in rest homes. Midwives were restricted from smoking while on duty. In 1939, the Nazi Party outlawed smoking {{in all of its}} offices premises, and Heinrich Himmler, the then chief of the Schutzstaffel (SS), restricted police personnel and SS officers from smoking while they were on duty.

40|$|Abstract — A vast body of {{research}} attests to the adverse effects <b>of</b> chronic <b>smoking</b> on cardiac, pulmonary, and vascular function {{as well as the}} increased risk for various forms of cancer. However, comparatively {{little is known about the}} effects <b>of</b> chronic <b>smoking</b> on human brain function. Although smoking rates have decreased in the developed world, they remain high in individuals with alcohol use disorders. Despite the high prevalence <b>of</b> comorbid chronic <b>smoking</b> in alcohol use disorders, very few studies have addressed the potential neurobiological or neurocognitive effects <b>of</b> chronic <b>smoking</b> in alcohol use disorders. Here, we briefly review the existing literature on the neurobiological and neurocognitive consequences <b>of</b> chronic cigarette <b>smoking</b> and summarize our neuroimaging and neurocognitive studies on the effects of comorbid chronic excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking in treatment-seeking and treatment-naïve populations. Our research suggests comorbid chronic cigarette smoking modulates magnetic resonance-detectable brain injury and neurocognition in alcohol use disorders and that neurobiological recovery in our abstinent alcoholics is adversely affected by chronic <b>smoking.</b> Consideration <b>of</b> the potential separate effects and interactions <b>of</b> chronic <b>smoking</b> and alcohol consumption may foster a better understanding of specific mechanisms and neurocognitive consequences of brain injury in alcoholism and of brain recovery during sustained abstinence from alcohol. The material presented also contributes to ongoing discussions about treatment strategies for comorbid alcoholism and cigarette smoking and will hopefully stimulate further research into the neurobiological and neurocognitive consequences <b>of</b> chronic <b>smoking</b> in alcoholism and other substance use disorders...|$|R
5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates <b>of</b> <b>smoking</b> and improving indoor and outdoor air quality.
