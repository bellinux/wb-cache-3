5|$|Any {{baseball}} game involves {{one or more}} umpires, who make rulings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of each play. At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, {{to have a good}} view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.|$|E

5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E
5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of {{the battle}} are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite {{the lifting of the}} blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E
5|$|In late October 2009, Halcyon {{announced}} it would auction off the rights to future Terminator material and was seeking $60–70 million, though the only offer made was by director Joss Whedon for $10,000.

On February 8, 2010, an auction was held to determine the owner of the Terminator rights. After studios Sony Pictures and Lionsgate bid separately, Pacificor, the hedge fund that pushed Halcyon into bankruptcy, made a deal for $29.5 million. Pacificor hired an agency to sell off the rights to the franchise.|$|E

5|$|On December 2, 1896, Earp was {{a last-minute}} choice as referee for a boxing match that the {{promoters}} {{billed as the}} heavyweight championship of the world. Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey {{that night at the}} Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, but under the older and more liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and {{unprepared}} for the war; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight North Korean armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained North Korean troops– though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly {{had a profound effect}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture. Smith also said he felt he had stayed too long in his position, allowing North Korean troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated. These weaknesses would play out with other U.S. units for the next month as North Korean troops pushed them further back.|$|E
5|$|The War of the Fifth Coalition {{was fought}} in 1809 by a {{coalition}} of the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom against Napoleon's French Empire and Bavaria. Major engagements between France and Austria, the main participants, unfolded over much of Central Europe from April to July, with very high casualty rates for both sides. Britain, already involved on the European continent in the ongoing Peninsular War, sent another expedition, the Walcheren Campaign, to the Netherlands in order to relieve the Austrians, although this effort had little impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the conflict. After much campaigning in Bavaria and across the Danube valley, the war ended favourably for the French after the bloody struggle at Wagram in early July.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{supplies}} and reinforcements carried on Thétis to reach the Caribbean may have had an effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809. Except for one reinforcement frigate, Amphitrite, none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful, and a large British expeditionary force was able to overwhelm the island's poorly-supplied defenders in a brief campaign. The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the despatch of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both Île de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.|$|E
5|$|The sport enjoyed an {{unprecedented}} surge in popularity during the Regency period {{when it was}} openly patronised by the Prince Regent (later George IV) and his brothers. Championship boxing matches acquired a louche reputation as the places {{to be seen by}} the wealthy upper classes. Thus a match would often be attended by thousands of people, many of whom had wagered money <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome.</b> The Duke of Cumberland (an uncle of King George III) was reported to have bet thousands of pounds on Jack Broughton, who was the English champion for 18years.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{attempts}} have been made to improve the efficacy of minimal interventions by tailoring them to individual features. In the development of these tailored interventions, it is important to know which information in interventions is essential. Most smoking cessa-tion interventions contain information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of quitting and skills to be used in a quit attempt The present study was designed to assess the cognitive changes caused by both sorts of information. Therefore, 246 smokers who were planning to quit within 6 months were randomly assigned to three different condi-tions. In the first condition, the respondents received a computer-generated tailored letter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of smoking cessation. In the second condition, the respondents received a computer-generated tailored letter containing self-efficacy enhancing information, mainly on skills. In both conditions, the contents of the letters were based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pre-test scores of the participants. Participants in the control condition did not receive any cessation informa-tion. The results show that information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of quitting changed expected outcomes while information on coping skills changed self-efficacy expectations, in comparison with the control condition. Comparing both experi-mental conditions, information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> led to changes in expected outcomes, wherea...|$|R

5|$|A {{council of}} the army convened in Babylon {{immediately}} after Alexander's death, naming PhilipIII as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas {{in a civil war}} initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the 321BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent (since PhilipIII was considered mentally unstable), in effect bypassing the {{council of the}} army as well.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E

5|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the Holbrooke–Tuđman {{meeting and}} the {{assessment}} of the HV General Staff that the VRS 2nd Corps was completely destroyed, a decision was made to deploy the HV to the area with virtually no preparation and planning. The assessment of the HV General Staff was based on ARBiH gains in western Bosnia and Herzegovina over the previous four days. The order to attack was drawn up on 17 September and signed by Major General Vinko Vrbanac on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff, General Zvonimir Červenko. The attack, codenamed Operation Una, was to commence with crossings of the Una River at Novi Grad and Bosanska Dubica, and the Sava River at Jasenovac, followed by the seizing of Mount Prosara to allow for further advances towards Prijedor. The operation was intended to be coordinated with the ARBiH 5th Corps, which would continue its rapid advance towards Prijedor and Novi Grad.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state was}} allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a {{proposal}} during the debates {{in accordance with the}} majority opinion of the state's delegates. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come and go, with only 30–40 being present on a typical day. Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally divided in their views on a given proposal, or if too few of the state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that state's delegation had essentially no effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the vote on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they {{could be construed as}} legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E
