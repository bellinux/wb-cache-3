Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges {{the poor and the}} gods for the superabundance of {{happiness}} and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.|$|E

2500|$|At its roots, {{geometry}} consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> congruence {{between different}} objects in a space.

[...] Lie groups generally act quite rigidly, and so a Cartan geometry is a generalization of this notion of congruence to allow for curvature to be present. [...] The flat Cartan geometriesthose with zero curvatureare locally equivalent to homogeneous spaces, hence geometries in the sense of Klein.|$|E

The research was conducted within the theoretical frameworks <b>of</b> <b>a</b> postfoundational <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> practical theology, narrative therapy and research, and social constructionism. A qualitative research strategy was employed, with the case study design as point of departure in collecting and analysing research data. Various key aspects were investigated {{with the use of the}} model of narrative and the seven movements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> postfoundational <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> practical theology. The aim of this article is to provide <b>an</b> illustration <b>of</b> the application of the principles <b>of</b> <b>a</b> postfoundational <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> practical theology, and its sixth movement – an interdisciplinary investigation – as it is applied within this specific research context. Four interdisciplinary conversationalists, each from a different academic field, were invited to reflect on the three narrated stories of the co-researchers. This article, then, gives a report on their feedback and the value of interdisciplinary investigation in aiding, with the understanding of the meaningmaking process behind collected narratives...|$|R

60|$|The {{first thing}} for any honest Englishman to send {{across the sea}} is this; that the English have not the shadow <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> what they are up against in America. They have {{never even heard of}} the {{batteries}} of almost brutal energy, of which I had thus touched a live wire even before I landed. People talk about the hypocrisy of England in dealing with a small nationality. What strikes me is the stupidity of England in supposing that she is dealing with a small nationality; when she is really dealing with a very large nationality. She is dealing with a nationality that often threatens, even numerically, to dominate all the other nationalities of the United States. The Irish are not decaying; they are not unpractical; they are scarcely even scattered; they are not even poor. They are the most powerful and practical world-combination with whom we can decide to be friends or foes; and that is why I thought first of that still and solid brown house in Buckinghamshire, standing back {{in the shadow of the}} trees.|$|E

The clerk already had the little, short-legged desk before him and was calling the roll with {{incredible}} rapidity. Bewildered and excited as Wetherell was, and knowing as little of parliamentary law as the gentleman who had proposed the woodchuck session, he began to form some sort <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> Jethro's generalship, and he saw that the innocent rural members who belonged to Duncan and Lovejoy's faction had tried to get away before the roll-call, destroy the quorum, and so adjourn the House. These, needless to say, were not parliamentarians, either. They had lacked a leader, they were stunned by the suddenness of the onslaught, and had not moved quickly enough. Like trapped animals, they wandered blindly about for a few moments, and then sank down anywhere. Each answered the roll-call sullenly, out of necessity, for every {{one of them was a}} marked man. Then Wetherell remembered the two members who had escaped, and Mr. Duncan, and fell to calculating how long it would take these to reach Fosters Opera House, break into the middle of an act, and get out enough partisans to come back and kill the bill. Mr. Wetherell began to wish he could witness the scene there, too, but something held him here, shaking with excitement, listening to each name that the clerk called.|$|E
