50|$|The {{transportation}} <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is {{the intentional}} movement <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> by transport. Common categories <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> which are transported include livestock destined for sale or slaughter; zoological specimens; laboratory animals; race horses; pets; and wild animals being rescued or relocated. Methods <b>of</b> transporting <b>animals</b> vary greatly from species to species.|$|R

5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

5000|$|During the 20th century, the {{transportation}} <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> has focussed on the movement <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> for food, research, entertainment and conservation and the transport <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is regulated in many countries. Such transport is regulated by a guideline by the European Council enacted in 2007, with relevant legislation passed in member countries, including England, through the Welfare <b>of</b> <b>Animals</b> (Transport), Order 2006 ("WATEO 2006"); and [...] "equivalent national legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland".

5|$|Beddard's Animal Coloration {{is cited}} and {{discussed}} both by historians of science, and by practising scientists {{from a number}} of different fields. For example, the book illuminates the progress of Darwinism, camouflage research, sexual selection, mimicry and the debate on the purpose <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> coloration triggered by Abbott Thayer. These areas are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Cannibal is {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Kesha, released on November 19, 2010. The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, Animal. Originally, the record {{was thought to}} be released as a deluxe edition <b>of</b> <b>Animal,</b> but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition <b>of</b> <b>Animal.</b> Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, Max Martin, Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, with some songs incorporating elements of electro and electropop in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on Cannibal speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak.|$|E

5|$|From 1954 to 1959 Dawkins {{attended}} Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English {{public school}} with a distinct Church of England flavour, where he was in Laundimer house. While at Oundle, Dawkins read Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian for the first time. He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and Doctor of Philosophy degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year. Tinbergen was {{a pioneer in the}} study <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning and choice; Dawkins's research in this period concerned models <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> decision-making.|$|E
