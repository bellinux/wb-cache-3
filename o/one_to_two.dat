5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>two</b> weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} TSR, Gygax was {{approached}} by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984. Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, {{he would be able}} to bring in <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>two</b> million dollars of investment. Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, New Infinities Productions, Inc. (NIPI) was publicly announced. To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached Frank Mentzer and Dragon magazine editor Kim Mohan from TSR. But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>two</b> million dollars failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 {{the soils}} of the Fishing Creek {{watershed}} {{were found to}} yield large quantities of farm crops.

5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked {{in place on}} the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>two</b> days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders have to molt to grow {{as their}} cuticle ("skin") cannot stretch.

Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an iron lung, was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person could breathe independently (generally about <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>two</b> weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern jacket-type negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.|$|E

5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>two</b> inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) long and contain six or seven brownish seeds.

Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees.

It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>two</b> weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack.
