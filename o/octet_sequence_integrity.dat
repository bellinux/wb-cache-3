This new cloning vector, named pELMO, lacked additional unnecessary DNA contained in the pDONR- 221 PstI-EcoRI region of a previously engineered pUC 18 ccdB vector (Weibel et al. 2013). This resulted in an optimised cloning vector (3306  bp) (Fig.  1). The resulting plasmid containing the ccdB gene was transformed into One Shot ccdB Survival cells and plated on LB plates with ampicillin. As expected, numerous resistant colonies were found bearing the vector. This indicated that pELMO can be propagated in E. coli ccdB resistant strains (Bernard and Couturier 1992) and verified the plasmid’s ampicillin resistance. Conversely, no colonies were found when pELMO was transformed in One Shot TOP 10 chemically competent E. coli cells, thereby confirming constructed plasmid lethality.|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the group II Lactococcus lactis Ll. LtrB intron could retrotranspose into ectopic locations on the genome of its native host. Two integration events, which had been mapped to unique sequences, were localized {{in the present study}} to separate copies of the six L. lactis 23 S rRNA genes, within operon B or D. Although further movement within the bacterial chromosome was undetectable, the retrotransposed introns were able to re-integrate into their original homing site provided on a plasmid. This finding indicates not only that retrotransposed group II introns retain mobility properties, but also that movement occurs back into sequence that is heterologous to the sequence of the chromosomal location. Sequence analysis of the retrotransposed introns and the secondary mobility events back to the homing site {{showed that the}} introns retain <b>sequence</b> <b>integrity.</b> These results are illuminating, since the reverse transcriptase (RT) of the intron-encoded protein, LtrA, has no known proofreading function, yet the mobility events have a low error rate. Enzymatic digests were used to monitor sequence changes from the wild-type intron. The results indicate that retromobility events have ∼ 10 − 5 misincorporations per nucleotide inserted. In contrast to the high RT error rates for retroviruses that must escape host defenses, the infrequent mutations of group II introns would ensure intron spread through retention of sequences essential for mobility...|$|R

40|$|The {{regressive}} {{evolution of}} eyes has long intrigued biologists yet the genetic underpinnings remain opaque. A system of discrete aquifers in arid Australia provides a powerful comparative means to explore trait regression at the genomic level. Multiple surface-ancestors from two tribes of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) repeatedly invaded these calcrete aquifers and convergently evolved eye-less phenotypes. We use this system to assess transcription of opsin photoreceptor genes among the transcriptomes of two surface and three subterranean dytiscid species and test whether these genes have evolved under neutral predictions. Transcripts for UV, longwavelength and ciliary-type opsins were identified {{from the surface}} beetle transcriptomes. Two subterranean beetles showed parallel loss of all opsin transcription, as expected under ‘neutral’ regressive evolution. The third species Limbodessus palmulaoides retained transcription of a longwavelength opsin (lwop) orthologue, albeit in an aphotic environment. Tests of selection on lwop indicated {{no significant differences between}} transcripts derived from surface and subterranean habitats, with strong evidence for purifying selection acting on L. palmulaoides lwop.

40|$|The mouse c-Ki-ras {{protooncogene}} promoter {{contains an}} unusual DNA element {{consisting of a}} 27 bp-long homopurine-homopyrimidine mirror repeat (H-motif) adjacent to a d(C-G) 5 repeat. We have previously shown that in vitro these repeats may adopt H and Z conformations, respectively, causing nuclease and chemical hypersensitivity. Here we have studied the functional role of these DNA stretches using fine deletion analysis of the promoter and a transient transcription assay in vivo. We found that while the H-motif is responsible for {{approximately half of the}} promoter activity in both mouse and human cell lines, the Z-forming sequence exhibits little, if any, such activity. Mutational changes introduced within the homopurine-homopyrimidine stretch showed that its <b>sequence</b> <b>integrity,</b> rather than its H-forming potential, is responsible for its effect on transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the putative H-motif tightly binds several nuclear proteins, one of which is likely to be transcription factor Sp 1, as determined by competition experiments. Southwestern hybridization studies detected two major proteins specifically binding to the H-motif: a 97 kD protein which presumably corresponds to Sp 1 and another protein of 60 kD in human and 64 kD in mouse cells. We conclude that the homopurine-homopyrimidine stretch is required for full transcriptional activity of the c-Ki-ras promoter and at least two distinct factors, Sp 1 and an unidentified protein, potentially contribute to the positive effect on transcription...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The human {{aldehyde}} dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene superfamily consists of 19 genes encoding enzymes critical for NAD(P) -dependent oxidation of endogenous and exogenous aldehydes, including drugs and environmental toxicants. Mutations in ALDH genes are the molecular basis of several disease states (e. g. Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and type II hyperprolinemia) and {{may contribute to}} the etiology of complex diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this nomenclature update was to identify splice transcriptional variants principally for the human ALDH genes. METHODS: Data-mining methods were used to retrieve all human ALDH sequences. Alternatively spliced transcriptional variants were determined based on (i) criteria for <b>sequence</b> <b>integrity</b> and genomic alignment; (ii) evidence of multiple independent cDNA sequences corresponding to a variant sequence; and (iii) if available, empirical evidence of variants from the literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Alternatively spliced transcriptional variants and their encoded proteins exist for most of the human ALDH genes; however, their function and significance remain to be established. When compared with the human genome, rat and mouse include an additional gene, Aldh 1 a 7, in the ALDH 1 A subfamily. To avoid confusion when identifying splice variants in various genomes, nomenclature guidelines for the naming of such alternative transcriptional variants and proteins are recommended herein. In addition, a web database (www. aldh. org) has been developed to provide up-to-date information and nomenclature guidelines for the ALDH superfamily...|$|R

Homogeneity analysis confirmed that reducing the number of selective passages didn't affect the quality of LAIV seed viruses. Finally, the two-way hemagglutination inhibition test, implemented for all the final seed viruses, confirmed that any amino acid substitutions acquired by reassortants during egg propagation didn't affect antigenicity of the vaccine. Our new strategy reduces the time required to generate a vaccine and was used to generate seasonal LAIVs candidates for the 2012 / 2013, 2014 / 2015, and 2015 / 2016 seasons more rapidly.

40|$|Extensive {{experience}} with the analysis of human prophase chromosomes and studies into the complexity of prophase GTG-banding patterns have suggested {{that at least some}} prophase chromosomal segments can be accurately identified and characterized independently of the morphology of the chromosome as a whole. In this dissertation the feasibility of identifying and analyzing specified prophase chromosome segments was thus investigated as an alternative approach to prophase chromosome analysis based on whole chromosome recognition. Through the use of prophase idiograms at the 850 -band-stage (FRANCKE, 1981) and a comparison system based on the calculation of cross-correlation coefficients between idiogram profiles, we have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} divide the 24 human prophase idiograms into a set of 94 unique band sequences. Each unique band sequence has a banding pattern that is recognizable and distinct from any other non-homologous chromosome portion. ^ Using chromosomes 11 p and 16 thru 22 to demonstrate unique band <b>sequence</b> <b>integrity</b> at the chromosome level, we found that prophase chromosome banding pattern variation can be compensated for and that a set of unique band sequences very similar to those at the idiogram level can be identified on actual chromosomes. ^ The use of a unique band sequence approach in prophase chromosome analysis is expected to increase efficiency and sensitivity through more effective use of available banding information. The use of a unique band sequence approach to prophase chromosome analysis is discussed both at the routine level by cytogeneticists and at an image processing level with a semi-automated approach to prophase chromosome analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} the first genome-wide {{analysis of the}} Inverted Repeat (IR) structure in the human genome, using a novel and efficient software package called Inverted Repeats Finder (IRF). After masking of known repetitive elements, IRF detected 22, 624 human IRs characterized by arm size from 25 bp to > 100 kb with at least 75 % identity, and spacer length up to 100 kb. This analysis required 6 h on a desktop PC. In all, 166 IRs had arm lengths > 8 kb. From this set, IRs were excluded {{if they were in}} unfinished/unassembled regions of the genome, or clustered with other closely related IRs, yielding a set of 96 large IRs. Of these, 24 (25 %) occurred on the X-chromosome, although it represents only ∼ 5 % of the genome. Of the X-chromosome IRs, 83. 3 % were ≥ 99 % identical, compared with 28. 8 % of autosomal IRs. Eleven IRs from Chromosome X, one from Chromosome 11, and seven already described from Chromosome Y contain genes predominantly expressed in testis. PCR analysis of eight of these IRs correctly amplified the corresponding region in the human genome, and six were also confirmed in gorilla or chimpanzee genomes. Similarity dot-plots revealed that 22 IRs contained further secondary homologous structures partially categorized into three distinct patterns. The prevalence of large highly homologous IRs containing testes genes on the X- and Y-chromosomes suggests a possible role in male germ-line gene expression and/or maintaining <b>sequence</b> <b>integrity</b> by gene conversion...|$|R
40|$|LOGRES is a {{new project}} for the {{development}} of extended database systems which is based on the integration of the object-oriented data modelling paradigm and of the rule-based approach for the specification of queries and updates. The data model supports generalization hierarchies and object sharing, the rule-based language extends Datalog to support generalized type constructors (sets, multisets, and <b>sequences),</b> rule-based <b>integrity</b> constraints are automatically produced by analyzing schema definitions. Modularization is a fundamental feature, as modules encapsulate queries and updates, when modules are applied to a LOGRES database, their side effects can be controlled. The LOGRES project is a follow-up of the ALGRES project, and takes advantage of the ALGRES programming environment {{for the development of}} a fast prototype...|$|R
