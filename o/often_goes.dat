5|$|The James Tiptree, Jr. Award honours {{works of}} science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one's {{understanding}} of gender. Thus, it <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> to works which deal directly or tangentially with gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender issues.|$|E
5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E

5|$|Hayward Field {{has been}} host to {{numerous}} national {{track and field}} {{events such as the}} U.S. Olympic Trials, NCAA Championships, and the USA Track and Field Championships. No other venue has hosted more NCAA Championships and no other venue had held three consecutive U.S. Olympic Trials. Many have attested to the magical aura of Hayward field, citing many personal bests run at the venue. Credit <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> to the regular attendance of knowledgeable track and field fans for the phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Netball is {{most popular}} in Commonwealth countries, {{and the most}} popular women's spectator sport in Australia and Tanzania and the effort to {{increase}} media attention and participation for women's sport <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> to Olympic sports with low participation rates, low rates of interest and few facilities. Even then, historically, coverage of women's team sports in the Olympics has been limited. Instead, according to Jones, the media focus on female athletes in non-team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E

5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E

25|$|Reputedly, {{heat damage}} {{is the most}} {{widespread}} and common problem found in wines. It <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> unnoticed because of the prevalence of the problem, consumers don't know it's possible, and most often would just chalk the problem up to poor quality, or other factors.|$|E

25|$|The hobby of {{collecting}} <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> hand-in-hand {{with an interest}} in the objects collected and what they represent, for example collecting postcards may reflect an interest in different places and cultures. For this reason, collecting can have educational benefits, and some collectors even become experts in their field.|$|E
25|$|The artist-in-residence program, {{begun in}} 2006, brings to campus leading {{performers}} and visual artists from San Diego and Southern California to UC San Diego. Each artist is featured {{for one year}} and {{given the opportunity to}} develop new showcase work, which <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> on to fuller production off campus. Marshall College is the first college at UCSD to commission public art on campus, and has contributed {{in the creation of a}} vibrant campus community. Allan Havis, a professor from the Theatre Department launched these programs during his term as college provost from 2006 to 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{biodiversity}} of the Chironomidae <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> unnoticed {{because they}} are notoriously difficult to identify and ecologists usually record them by species groups. Each morphologically distinct group comprises a number of morphologically identical (sibling) species {{that can only be}} identified by rearing adult males or by cytogenetic analysis of the polytene chromosomes. Polytene chromosomes were originally observed in the larval salivary glands of Chironomus midges by Balbiani in 1881. They form through repeated rounds of DNA replication without cell division, resulting in characteristic light and dark banding patterns which can be used to identify inversions and deletions which allow species identification.|$|E

25|$|Pancreatitis is {{inflammation}} of the pancreas. The pancreas is a large organ behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes {{and a number of}} hormones. There are two main types, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting. The pain <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> into the back and is usually severe. In acute pancreatitis a fever may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days. In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, fatty stool, and diarrhea may occur. Complications may include infection, bleeding, diabetes mellitus, or problems with other organs.|$|E
25|$|When a Mafia boss retires from {{leadership}} (or is killed), his clan's {{reputation as}} effective protectors and enforcers <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> with him. If his replacement has a weaker reputation, clients may lose {{confidence in the}} clan and defect to its neighbours, causing {{a shift in the}} balance of power and possible conflict. Ideally, the successor to the boss will have built a strong reputation of his own as he worked his way up the ranks, giving the clan a reputable new leader. In this way, established Mafia clans have a powerful edge over newcomers who start from scratch; joining a clan as a soldier offers an aspiring mafioso a chance to build up his own reputation under the guidance and protection of senior mafiosi.|$|E
25|$|The {{hereditary}} form (HAE) <b>often</b> <b>goes</b> undetected {{for a long}} time, as its symptoms {{resemble those}} of more common disorders, such as allergy or intestinal colic. An important clue is the failure of hereditary angioedema to respond to antihistamines or steroids, a characteristic that distinguishes it from allergic reactions. It is particularly difficult to diagnose HAE in patients whose episodes are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Besides {{a family history of}} the disease, only a laboratory analysis can provide final confirmation. In this analysis, it is usually a reduced complement factor C4, rather than the C1-INH deficiency itself, that is detected. The former is used during the reaction cascade in the complement system of immune defense, which is permanently overactive {{due to the lack of}} regulation by C1-INH.|$|E
