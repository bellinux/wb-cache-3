25|$|Unlike {{the system}} obtaining under State control, when hauls wore left on deck until all {{operations}} ended, the method adopted was to place each haul of fish straight {{into a separate}} ice-house, and, to prevent-crushing of the lower layers of fish, each ice-house is divided into sections by removable shelves. This system also obviates the use of grappling hooks, which formerly tore {{the flesh of the}} fish, and so made large quantities unsaleable. Under the new system loading into the baskets is affected by a simple inclination of the shelves. Mr. Creamer, general manager of the Coastal Trawling Company, which controls the Koraaga, pointed <b>out</b> <b>yesterday</b> that the reduction of handling to a minimum must ensured the good condition of all fish. The â€˜Koraaga, moreover, should show a profit with even moderate catches. The weakness of the State trawling enterprise was, in his opinion, the large administrative and storage expenses. The Coastal Trawling Company has entirely eliminated the latter. Arrangements were made for the landing of fish at the markets in as fresh a condition as possible. Voyages were cut short; bonus systems were introduced, which made it worthwhile for the crews to see that no damage was done in the stowage or unloading of their hauls. Unnecessary handling was obviated by all discoverable devices.|$|E

[...] Many international journalists in Egypt covering the protests were detained, beaten, shouted at or threatened by pro-Mubarak protesters, as were numerous Egyptian bloggers and activists including Wael Abbas. Two Al Jazeera reporters were attacked as they arrived from the airport while three others were arrested and later released.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Carnifex Ferry in present-day West Virginia, Rutherford B. Hayes of the 23rd Ohio Infantry was camped south of the battle site, where he wrote about a [...] "very cold rain-storm" [...] in a September 27 letter to his wife Lucy. Conditions at the time were characterized by leaking tents and temperatures getting [...] "colder and colder". Hayes wrote, [...] "We were <b>out</b> <b>yesterday</b> P.M. very near to the enemy's works; were caught in the first of this storm and thoroughly soaked. I hardly expect to be dry again until the storm is over." [...] Strong winds buffeted the Burlington, New Jersey, area from early evening to midnight on September 27, uprooting trees and causing some damage to property. Further north, Boston, Massachusetts, experienced intense winds and light rainfall for about five hours starting at midnight, with no initial reports of significant destruction.|$|E

2500|$|The murderous {{event was}} broadly {{covered by the}} Israeli media, and was widely {{condemned}} by many public figures. President Shimon Peres reacted to the murder, stating that: [...] "The horrifying murder that was carried <b>out</b> <b>yesterday</b> in Tel Aviv, against teenagers and young people, is a murder that civilized and enlightened people cannot accept. Murder and hatred {{are the two most}} serious crimes in society. The police must exert great efforts in order to catch the despicable murderer, and the entire nation must unite in condemning this abominable act." [...] Peres called the culprit a [...] "lowly criminal" [...] and urged the police to apprehend him quickly.|$|E
