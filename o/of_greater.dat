5|$|Following the deindustrialisation <b>of</b> <b>Greater</b> Manchester in the mid-20th century, {{there was}} a {{significant}} economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era were found to be in a poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population <b>of</b> <b>Greater</b> Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population <b>of</b> <b>Greater</b> Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E
