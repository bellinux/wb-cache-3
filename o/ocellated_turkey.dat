50|$|The <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey</b> (Meleagris ocellata) is {{a species}} of turkey {{residing}} primarily in the Yucatán Peninsula. A relative of the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), it was sometimes previously treated in a genus of its own (Agriocharis), but {{the differences between the}} two turkeys are currently considered too small to justify generic segregation. It is a relatively large bird, at around 70 - 122 cm long and an average weight of 3 kg in females and 5 kg in males. The <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey</b> lives only in a 130,000 km2 range in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico—which includes all or part the states of Quintana Roo, Campeche, Yucatán, Tabasco, and Chiapas—as well as the northern and western parts of Belize and northern Guatemala.|$|E

50|$|The {{wild turkey}} (Meleagris gallopavo) is an upland ground bird native to North America {{and is the}} {{heaviest}} member of the diverse Galliformes. It is the same species as the domestic turkey, which was originally derived from a southern Mexican subspecies of wild turkey (not the related <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey).</b> Although native to North America, the turkey probably got {{its name from the}} domesticated variety being imported to Britain in ships coming from the Levant via Spain.

50|$|Turkeys are large, long-legged {{birds that}} can {{grow up to}} four feet in height and weigh up to 30 lbs in the wild. They have a long, broad, rounded tail with 14-19 blunt feathers. They have a naked, {{wrinkled}} head and feathered body. The North American wild turkey - Meleagris gallopavo - has five distinct subspecies (Eastern, Rio Grande, Florida Osceola, Merriam's, and Gould's). Hybrids also exist where the ranges of these subspecies overlap. All are native only to North America, though transplanted populations exist elsewhere. Their plumage differs slightly by subspecies, but is generally dark to black for males, with buff to cream highlights, and generally drab brown for females. The feathers are quite iridescent and can take on distinct reddish/copper hues in sunlight. Their feathers are well defined with broad, square ends, giving the bird the appearance of being covered in scales. Males have a “beard” of coarse black bristles hanging {{from the center of}} their upper breasts and tend to have more vibrantly colored plumage than do females. They breed in the spring and their typical clutch size is between 10 and 12 eggs. The <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey</b> (Meleagris ocellata), a different species of turkey, currently exists only in a portion of the Yucatán peninsula. After the 19th and early 20th centuries, wild turkey populations dropped significantly because of hunting and habitat loss. However, populations now flourish again due to hunting management and transplanting. The <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey,</b> not commonly hunted, is currently threatened due to ongoing habitat loss in the Yucutan.|$|E

5000|$|Domestic {{chickens}} have metatarsal spurs which {{project from}} {{the axis of}} the metatarsus at an angle of about 90 degrees and are pointed posteromedially at about 45 degrees. They are placed between the middle and distal thirds of the metatarsus. Both hens and roosters can develop spurs, but they are more common and generally larger and better developed in roosters. Domestic and wild turkeys also have metatarsal spurs. In the wild turkey, the spurs continue growing through life and become longer and sharper. Spur length is {{generally considered to be}} the most reliable characteristic in determining the age of wild males. There are also differences in spur length between the different sub-species, probably due to habitat differences. <b>Ocellated</b> <b>turkeys</b> usually have the longest spurs; they generally live in swamps and areas with soft dirt and few rocks so they do not wear off the spur tips. Contrary to this, the western sub-species, like the Merriam's, often live in rocky areas which usually means even very old birds will have spurs that have been worn off to less than 2.5 cm long. [...] During mating in domesticated hens and turkeys, the claws and spurs of the male may often scratch and injure the back and shoulders of the female. To prevent this, the females are sometimes fitted with [...] "saddles" [...] to protect them.|$|R
50|$|The {{colouration}} of {{the green}} junglefowl is sexually dimorphic. The male's plumage is dark and blackish at a distance. A closer view will reveal an iridescent mantle of gleaming scales reminiscent in colour and pattern to those seen in the <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey</b> and green peafowl. Each scale is vivid blue at its base and moves through various shades of gold and bronzed green. Specialized plumes framing the throat of the male green junglefowl are highly light reflective and appear violet at the proximal and sky blue at the distal edges. The lesser coverts of the wing are a striking burned orange with bronzed black centers. The distal edges of the greater secondary coverts are vivid ocher.|$|E

5000|$|The {{turkey is}} a large bird in the genus Meleagris, which is native to the Americas. One species, Meleagris gallopavo (commonly known as the {{domestic}} turkey or wild turkey), is native to the forests of North America, from Mexico, throughout the midwest and eastern United States, and into southeastern Canada. The other living species is Meleagris ocellata or the <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey,</b> native to the forests of the Yucatán Peninsula. [...] Males of both turkey species have a distinctive fleshy wattle or protuberance that hangs {{from the top of}} the beak (called a snood). They are among the largest birds in their ranges. As in many galliformes, the male is larger and much more colorful than the female.|$|E
5000|$|The body {{feathers}} {{of both sexes}} are a mixture of bronze and green iridescent color.

40|$|Classification {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely applied tasks in ecology. Ecologists have to deal with noisy, highdimensional data that often are {{non-linear}} and do not meet the assumptions of conventional statistical procedures. To overcome this problem, machine-learning methods have been adopted as ecological classification methods. We compared five machine-learning based classification techniques (classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and automatically induced rulebased fuzzy models) in a biological conservation context. The study case was that of the <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey</b> (Meleagris ocellata), a bird endemic to the Yucatan peninsula that has suffered considerable decreases in local abundance and distributional area during the last few decades. On a grid of 10 × 10 km cells that was superimposed to the peninsula we analysed relationships between environmental and social explanatory variables and <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey</b> abundance changes between 1980 and 2000. Abundance was expressed in three (decrease, no change, and increase) and 14 more detailed abundance change classes, respectively. Modelling performance varied considerably between methods with random forests and classification trees being the most efficient ones as measured by overall classification error and the normalised mutual information index. Artificial neural networks yielded the worst results along with linear discriminant analysis, which was included as a conventional statistical approach. We not only evaluated classification accuracy but also characteristics such as time effort, classifier comprehensibility and method intricacy—aspects that determine the success of a classification technique among ecologists and conservation biologists as well as for the communication with managers and decision makers. We recommend the combined use of classification trees and random forests due to the easy interpretability of classifiers and the high comprehensibility of the method. ...|$|E
40|$|Wild turkeys were {{important}} both to American Indians and early Europeans in America. For Plains and Eastern Indians, turkeys were an important food source and provided feathers for head dressings and arrows.

However, believe it or not, historians are unsure if wild turkeys were served to the Pilgrims on our country’s first Thanks giving. Ben Franklin considered the wild turkey a better symbol for the United States than the bald eagle because he felt the wild turkey was a more respectable bird.

40|$|Abstract Background Subsistence {{hunting is}} a {{traditional}} practice providing food and many other goods for households in the Yucatan Peninsula, southeast Mexico. Economic, demographic, and cultural change in this region drive wildlife habitat loss and local extinctions. Improving our understanding about current practices of wildlife use may support better management strategies for conserving game species and their habitat. We aimed to evaluate if wildlife use remained relevant for the subsistence of rural residents of the Yucatan Peninsula, as well as if local hunting practices were related to environmental, geographical, and cultural factors. Methods Fieldwork was done between March 2010 and March 2011. Information was obtained through conversations, interviews, and participant observation. Record forms allowed recording animals hunted, biomass extracted, distance intervals to hunting sites, habitat types and seasonality of wildlife harvests. Data were analyzed using one-way Analysis of Variance, and Generalized Linear Models. Results Forty-six terrestrial vertebrate species were used for obtaining food, medicine, tools, adornments, pets, ritual objects, and for sale and mitigating damage. We recorded 968 animals taken in 664 successful hunting events. The Great Curassow, <b>Ocellated</b> <b>Turkey,</b> paca, white-tailed deer, and collared peccary were the top harvested species, providing 80. 7 % of biomass (10, 190 kg). The numbers of animals hunted and biomass extracted declined as hunting distances increased from villages. Average per capita consumption was 4. 65 [*]±[*] 2. 7 kg/person/year. Hunting frequencies were similar in forested and agricultural areas. Discussion Wildlife use, hunting patterns, and technologies observed in our study sites {{were similar to those}} recorded in previous studies for rural Mayan and mestizo communities in the Yucatan Peninsula and other Neotropical sites. The most heavily hunted species were those providing more products and by-products for residents. Large birds such as the Great Curassow and the <b>Ocellated</b> <b>Turkey</b> were extremely important for local hunters, representing around 40 % of total prey taken. Final considerations Our results suggest that hunting is frequent in our study areas. Low human densities allow low hunting pressure on most game species and favor conservation of the tropical forest. We suggest that co-management may help regulating hunting, prioritizing cultural practices of sustainable use and conservation for benefiting local users and animal populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Late Preclassic (300 BC–AD 100) turkey remains {{identified}} at {{the archaeological}} site of El Mirador (Petén, Guatemala) represent the earliest {{evidence of the}} Mexican turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) in the ancient Maya world. Archaeological, zooarchaeological, and ancient DNA evidence combine to confirm the identification and context. The natural pre-Hispanic range of the Mexican turkey does not extend south of central Mexico, making the species non-local to the Maya area where another species, the <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey</b> (Meleagris ocellata), is indigenous. Prior to this discovery, the earliest evidence of M. gallopavo in the Maya area dated to approximately one thousand years later. The El Mirador specimens therefore represent previously unrecorded Preclassic exchange of animals from northern Mesoamerica to the Maya cultural region. As the earliest evidence of M. gallopavo found outside its natural geographic range, the El Mirador turkeys also represent the earliest indirect evidence for Mesoamerican turkey rearing or domestication. The presence of male, female and sub-adult turkeys, and reduced flight morphology further suggests that the El Mirador turkeys were raised in captivity. This supports an argument for the origins of turkey husbandry or at least captive rearing in the Preclassic.

40|$|The <b>ocellated</b> <b>turkey</b> Meleagris ocellata (OT) is a large, unmistakable endemic bird of the Yucatan peninsula. The {{species has}} {{suffered}} a considerable loss of distributional area {{as well as local}} abundance between 1980 and 2000 and is classified as endangered according to Mexican norms. We applied Classification Trees and Random Forests {{in order to determine the}} factors that most closely explain the observed patterns of distribution and abundance loss, and to develop hypotheses that may guide measures for the protection of the OT. Among the most important predictors of change were variables corresponding to aspects of forest cover and variables on human population and small settlements. OT abundance in 1980, however, was by far the most important predictor for OT abundance change. This is an indication that the OT dynamics are governed by internal rather than by external factors. Medium and low abundances in 1980 inevitably led to a further decrease during the following years, which gives rise to the conclusion that the OT might find itself in an extinction vortex. We suggest the following hypothetical scenario for OT decline: migrant people from other Mexican states colonise forested regions in Yucatan; they establish small settlements; bushmeat hunting is important for their survival; the naïve OT is easy prey; huntingdtogether with beginning deforestationdreaches a certain level, and local OT abundance falls below a critical threshold; OT continues declining regardless of current social and environmental changes except where there is total protection of both the species and its habitat. ...|$|E
