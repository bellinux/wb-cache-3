5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} ergodic theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} for the kippa has two sides. The Vilna Gaon said <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a berakhah without a kippah, since wearing a kippah is only an midos chassidus ("exemplary attribute"). Recently, {{there has been an}} effort to suppress earlier sources that practiced this leniency, including erasing lenient responsa from newly published books.|$|E

While animal-driven sakias can rotate at 2-4 rpm, motorised <b>ones</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> as much as 8-15 rpm. The improved modern versions are also known as zawaffa and jhallan.|$|R

25|$|But {{there is}} no valid logical {{argument}} <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> to claim that morality ought to be or can be suspended in any given circumstance, or ever. Thus, Silentio believes ethics and faith are separate stages of consciousness. The choice to obey God unconditionally is a true existential 'either/or' decision faced by the individual. Either one chooses to live in faith (the religious stage) or to live ethically (the ethical stage).|$|E
25|$|Once one accepts The Matrix as a {{generated}} {{reality of}} malicious machines invention {{then this is}} Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise {{can be found in}} Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. <b>One</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato's Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.|$|E
25|$|The first mode is god mode, {{which allows}} players to design or terraform a {{selected}} {{tract of land}} where the city will be built. God mode also allows players to trigger disasters, including tornadoes and earthquakes among several others. Players can select an area where a disaster will occur and even control the direction of certain disasters. Most terraforming tools are disabled after the city is named and founded. The player still has some terraforming tools made available in mayor mode, although they become very limited and expensive, and they can still trigger disasters at will. In addition to these abilities, god mode also gives the player tools to reconcile {{the borders of the}} cities, so as to fix any discrepancies created during the terraforming process, and a day/night cycle adjustment, so that <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it always day, always night, or alternate between day or night in accordance with the in-universe game clock. Both the ability to reconcile the city edges and the ability to modify the day/night cycle are available even once the city has been established.|$|E

500|$|Public {{reaction}} varied.

Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever been. In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands me better and no <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> me laugh the way Bill does.

[...] Shaikh Ayaz of Rediff rated the film 3.5/5 stars and felt that Zoya Akhtar had put together a familiar plot but the film's fresh energy is entertaining. He wrote, [...] "Akhtar's invigorating characters pump in fresh energy into a film {{that could have been}} strictly mediocre". Kaveree Bamzai of India Today, too was full of praise for Akhtar's direction and said [...] "By the time I finished watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara I was convinced that no <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a romance as beautifully as a woman", giving the film 4 stars.|$|E

It may represent the newfangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs." [...] Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter said, [...] "Dhoom 2 has all {{of the benefits of}} a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world cinema, but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse." [...] L.A. Weeklys David Chute stated the film was, [...] "A movie meal as satisfying as this <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> you feel that nothing else matters." [...] Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing [...] "By roping in acclaimed action director Alan Amin {{to take care of the}} thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial." [...] Manish Gajjar, Bollywood Correspondent for BBC Shropshire said, [...] "With its high-powered action sequences matching Hollywood standards, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way at the box office!" ...|$|E
