25|$|Very {{soon after}} the {{accident}} at Moorgate, London Underground changed the <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> so that the protecting signal at terminal platforms was held at danger until trains approaching were travelling slowly, or {{had been brought to}} a stop. However, this caused delays and operating problems. In July 1978, approval was given for Moorgate protection, Moorgate Control or TETS (Trains Entering Terminal Stations) to be introduced at all dead-end termini on manually driven lines on the Underground system.|$|E

50|$|These {{instructions}} are decoded during stage three. The I-box then checks if the resources {{required by the}} two {{instructions are}} available during stage four. If so, the instructions are issued, providing they can be paired. Which instructions could be paired {{was determined by the}} number of read and write ports in the integer register file. The 21064 could issue: an integer operate with a floating-point <b>operate,</b> any load/store <b>instruction</b> with any <b>operate</b> <b>instruction,</b> an integer <b>operate</b> with an integer branch, or a floating-point operate with a floating-point branch. Two combinations were not permitted: an integer operate and a floating-point store, and a floating-point operate and an integer store. If one of the two instructions cannot be issued together, the first four stages are stalled until the remaining instruction is issued. The first four stages are also stalled in the event that no instruction can be issued due to resource unavailability, dependencies, or similar conditions.|$|R

2500|$|In 2004, O'Brien {{apologized to}} Canadians for {{engaging}} in Quebec bashing, something which some felt reflected prejudice against Francophones. On March 7, 2006, NBC announced a new adventure/comedy series entitled Andy Barker, P.I., starring O'Brien's former sidekick, Andy Richter. O'Brien was executive producer and co-wrote the pilot. After six episodes and low ratings, the show was canceled despite being named by Entertainment Weekly {{as one of the}} Top Ten Shows of 2007. USA Network handed out a 90-minute, cast-contingent pilot order to the medical-themed <b>Operating</b> <b>Instructions</b> from O'Brien's production banner. O'Brien served as an executive producer through his Conaco label. The script came from Just Shoot Me veterans Judd Pillot and John Peaslee who also executive produced."

25|$|The logical {{instructions}} {{consist of}} those for performing bitwise logical operations and conditional moves on the integer registers. The bitwise logical instructions perform AND, NAND, NOR, OR, XNOR, and XOR between two registers or a register and literal. The conditional move instructions test a register as a signed quadword to zero and move if the specified condition is true. The specified conditions are equality, inequality, {{less than or}} equal to, less than, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The shift instructions perform arithmetic right shift, and logical left and right shifts. The shift amount is given by a register or literal. Logical and shift instructions use the integer <b>operate</b> <b>instruction</b> formats.|$|R
