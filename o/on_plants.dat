Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E
5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed <b>on</b> <b>plants.</b> By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E

Honeydew, nectar, Pacific reef heron feces, carrion, Pandanus fruits, plants, seeds, sucrose, fats and grease will also be consumed.

5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely to}} lay their eggs <b>on</b> <b>plants</b> that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{profound}} influences <b>on</b> <b>plant</b> community composition and ecosystem functions. However, its effects <b>on</b> <b>plant</b> community composition and biomass production {{are not well}} understood. A four-year field experiment was conducted {{to examine the effects}} of warming, nitrogen (N) addition, and their interactions <b>on</b> <b>plant</b> community composition and biomass production in a temperate meadow ecosystem in northeast China. Experimental warming had no significant effect <b>on</b> <b>plant</b> species richness, evenness, and diversity, while N addition highly reduced the species richness and diversity. Warming tended to reduce the importance value of graminoid species but increased the value of forbs, while N addition had the opposite effect. Warming tended to increase the belowground biomass, but had an opposite tendency to decrease the aboveground biomass. The influences of warming on aboveground production were dependent upon precipitation. Experimental warming had lit-tle effect on aboveground biomass in the years with higher precipitation, but significantly suppressed aboveground biomass in dry years. Our results suggest that warming had indi-rect effects <b>on</b> <b>plant</b> production via its effect on the water availability. Nitrogen addition sig...|$|R

5|$|Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm long or less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly <b>on</b> <b>plants</b> by puncturing and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.|$|E
5|$|Although Italian Renaissance had {{a modest}} impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was {{influential}} in broadening the European worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through {{the influence of}} wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including Pedro Nunes, João de Castro, Abraham Zacuto and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Estêvão Gomes and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary Tomé Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Cristóvão da Costa collected and published works <b>on</b> <b>plants</b> and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.|$|E
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, {{he would have had}} a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books <b>on</b> <b>plants</b> including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E

5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid <b>on</b> <b>plants.</b> Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Humans depend <b>on</b> <b>plants</b> for food, either {{directly}} or as feed for domestic animals. Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E
5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding <b>on</b> <b>plants</b> has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E

30|$|So, is it {{possible}} to account for variability by developing site-specific management policies depending on prevailing soil and climatic conditions? Such a scenario would be relatively straightforward, but studies have also found that grazer effects on vegetation composition and <b>on</b> <b>plant</b> production not only vary across ecosystems, but also co-vary with one another. Specifically, grazer effects <b>on</b> <b>plant</b> community composition are inversely related to their corresponding effects <b>on</b> <b>plant</b> production (Milchunas and Lauenroth 1993; Chase et al. 2000). This additional complexity suggests that understanding the mechanisms that establish their inter-dependency may be critical, but these aspects remain inadequately resolved to inform ecosystem management.|$|R
