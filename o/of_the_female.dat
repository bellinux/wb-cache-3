5|$|Parker and Stone voice most of {{the male}} South Park characters. Mary Kay Bergman voiced the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> characters until her suicide on November 11, 1999. Mona Marshall and Eliza Schneider succeeded Bergman, with Schneider leaving the show after its seventh season (2003). She was replaced by April Stewart, who, along with Marshall, continues to voice most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> characters. Bergman was originally listed in the credits under the alias Shannen Cassidy to protect her reputation {{as the voice of}} several Disney and other kid-friendly characters. Stewart was originally credited under the name Gracie Lazar, while Schneider was sometimes credited under her rock opera performance pseudonym Blue Girl.|$|E
50|$|They {{reproduce}} by fertilizing eggs outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> body (see frog reproduction). <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> seven amplexus modes (positions {{in which}} frogs mate), these frogs are found breeding in inguinal amplexus, where the male clasps <b>the</b> <b>female</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female's</b> back legs and squeezes until eggs come out. The eggs are then fertilized.|$|R
50|$|While he was 12 {{years of}} age, {{he was a}} “pretty boy,” and refused all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> who loved him, and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> who {{approached}} him died from being so love-stricken. When he burned the love letters he received from all <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> due to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> who {{was not able to}} acquire her love, when the love letters burned, the smoke that came out enveloped him, turning him into an oni. Because of this, it was said that he, who became an oni, after moving from mountain to mountain centered on Honshu, eventually settled on Mt. Ooe.|$|R
50|$|The drone has {{a yellow}} {{head with a}} few black hairs. <b>The</b> {{coloration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thorax and abdomen {{is similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females,</b> with <b>the</b> exception that the last abdominal segments are yellow on the sides. <b>The</b> fur <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drone is longer than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{front of}} the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green {{at the back of}} the head, except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the eye and the bill is dark greenish grey, and the area around the ear is green.

5|$|The spermatophores usually remain {{embedded}} {{near the}} mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female.</b> Mating usually occurs well before spawning, but may also happen on the spawning grounds themselves. In those cases, the male will stay near the female's side as she lays eggs.|$|E

5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female,</b> a typical quack, {{but it is a}} deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|A shade named Durza, {{along with}} a group of urgals, ambushes a party of three elves.

5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
5|$|After mating sperm {{is stored}} in the spermathecae, organs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> {{reproductive}} tract, {{and can be used}} up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in including New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Japan and in greenhouses in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho {{devised a}} new key in 2004 to {{identify}} the Sphecius species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> S. convallis wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and S.grandis had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E
5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions {{of the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
40|$|From <b>the</b> {{examination}} <b>of</b> some 654 Ruffs {{killed in}} <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> Senegal, {{we conclude that}} sex and age ratios fluctuate widely within the year. Sex-ratio has an average of 2. 2 females for 1 male between August and January, but are as high as 4. 1 females for 1 male in February-March. In April, large numbers of females are still present while males have already left Senegal. Percentages of immature birds also fluctuate within the year : 0 % in August, 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and 22 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males in September. A maximum of immature birds is reached in October with 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and 63 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males. Between December and March, young birds account for about 31 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> and 41 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males. Adult <b>females</b> leave Senegal somewhat earlier than young ones and these represent 42 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>females</b> in April. Fluctuations in <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> Ruff populations may be due either to <b>the</b> stop-over <b>of</b> birds which will fly further south later, or {{to some kind of}} segregation based on sex or age in different feeding grounds.

5|$|Host-parasite mimicry is a {{situation}} where a parasite mimics its own host. As with mimicry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>female</b> sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic being of the same species. Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, is one such situation where host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E
5|$|If {{the green}} parrots Leguat {{referred}} to {{were not the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodericanus), they might perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested.
