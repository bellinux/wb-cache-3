2500|$|Hole formed after Eric Erlandson {{responded to}} an {{advertisement}} placed by Courtney Love in Recycler {{in the summer}} of 1989. [...] The advertisement simply read: [...] "I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, and Fleetwood Mac." [...] "She called me up and talked my ear off," [...] said Erlandson. [...] "We met at this coffee shop, and I saw her and I thought [...] "Oh, God. Oh, no, What am I getting myself into?" [...] She grabbed me and started talking, and she's like [...] "I know you're the right one", and I hadn't even <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> yet." [...] In retrospect, Love said that Erlandson [...] "had a Thurston [...] quality about him" [...] and was an [...] "intensely weird, good guitarist." [...] In his 2012 book, Letters to Kurt, Erlandson revealed that he and Love had a sexual relationship during their first year together in the band, which Love also confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{he began}} his mission around 1900, he {{continued}} to have other business interests as well. [...] One of those interests was gold mining. [...] In 1897, the Los Angeles Times published an article on Yoakum's claim that he had discovered a new method of [...] "X-Ray Prospecting" [...] for gold. [...] Yoakum {{reported that he had}} laid [...] a bit of gold-bearing quartz on the x-ray plate while taking an x-ray of a patient with a tumor. [...] The x-ray showed the location of the gold deposits in the quartz, and Yoakum proposed using x-rays in mine tunnels to [...] "ascertain decisively if gold is present, and if so, exactly where it lies and in what quantities." [...] Following this report, Yoakum became active in gold and copper mining. [...] In 1902, he ran a newspaper advertisement (pictured at left) offering stock at 25 cents a share in his new mining company. Yoakum later claimed that it was while traveling in Mexico, the location of his mining interests, that he spoke {{for the first time in}} [...] "tongues." [...] He reported: [...] "I was in the heart of Mexico in a church, speaking through an interpreter to the Mexicans and Indians, when suddenly a distinct rush of some might wind came upon me, and when I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> it was not English, but a beautiful smooth Castilian language, and for 20 or 30 minutes I held that large audience." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to protest, but Louis' manner {{underwent}} a further change.|$|E
50|$|I {{will not}} <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> until {{the portion of}} food has been brought to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} it isn't always the man's fault," [...] said Dan darkly. [...] "When I get married I'll be good to my wife, but I mean to be boss. When I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>my</b> word will be law." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never can}} <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{except in the}} {{presence}} of a woman," [...] observed Vivian, with impudent mendacity; and he looked interesting and innocent.|$|R
60|$|Euphemia and the boarder {{looked at}} each other. I looked at them. Then I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> in earnest.|$|E
60|$|I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to speak, to confess. But he {{prevented}} me, {{the tears}} filling the wrinkles around his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I sat down, and <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to tell Anabela {{what she}} loved to hear--that she was a trust, monopolizing all the loveliness of earth. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and {{instead of the usual}} {{vibrating}} words of love and compliment, there came forth a faint wheeze such as a baby with croup might emit. Not a word--not a syllable--not an intelligible sound. I had caught cold in my laryngeal regions when I took my injudicious bath.|$|E
6000|$|... "So all {{wealth is}} thine, {{as well as}} all power," [...] said Leo, presently, for remembering Ayesha's awful threat I {{scarcely}} dared to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, there's a blackguard {{creditor}} in {{the tent}} I don't want to see, who'll discover me and nab me as sure as Satan if I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> What's to be done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{perceive}} Nature, here {{in sight}} of the sea, is taking advantage of me, to [...] dart upon me, and sting me, Because I have dared to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to sing at all.|$|R
60|$|I had <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> {{to reply}} to this tirade, when with a crisp knock our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, then, {{stop your}} mouth with that, Ralph," [...] said Peterkin, holding a large oyster to my lips. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and {{swallowed}} it in silence, and really it was remarkably good.|$|E
60|$|His rapid {{rattling}} {{mouth shut}} quite tight suddenly, {{and he looked}} steadily and triumphantly at me, with his head on one side. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and the mere motion seemed to sting him to fresh verbal leaps.|$|E
5000|$|... "When {{you see me}} <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> at a letter, put a dot above it. When I close it, put {{one next}} to the letter. When I draw them apart, put a dot under it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait here!" [...] cried Mr. Marx, in a harsh, unnatural tone. And before I could <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> he had {{vanished}} {{out of sight}} and it seemed as though the black, yawning darkness had swallowed him up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Serious!" [...] {{answered}} his visitor; [...] "why, I have been serious all this day: I can hardly <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> but something comes out about death, a burial, or suchlike--the most serious subjects that I wot of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh my word! Fancy me telling him! He'd jump down {{my throat}} with both feet afore I'd <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> He's not to be spoken to, he isn't. He's my-lord, he is. You mustn't look, or you're done for." ...|$|E
60|$|I expect I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> {{and eyes}} pretty wide, for I was never so astonished. A young lady like that keeping the bar! But I didn't want Mrs. Locky {{to know how}} much I was surprised, and so I said nothing about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it was on}} our side, Stemm, {{it was not so}} with my knowledge. I did all I {{could to}} prevent it. I spoke against it {{whenever}} I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> I would not have given a shilling for a single vote, though it would have got me the election." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if you were trying to make out that I am disagreeable," [...] she murmured. [...] "Am I? You will make me afraid to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> presently. I shall end by believing I am no good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we can pay our bills an' {{have enough}} left {{to keep the}} stock up, by a week from to-day you shall go 'round to spread the news, an' I won't <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> till you've seen every feller you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't worry--I shan't <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> Philip. I {{am glad to}} hear of this, for, I {{tell you}} privately, Van Blott needs watching. He is a sly dog, and I am {{satisfied}} {{in my own mind}} that he has something up his sleeve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Cheeko's brother kept {{creeping}} nearer and {{nearer to}} the edge of the thorns, looking back at me every once in a while, as if believing I'd be scared out of my wits because he was so venturesome; but I never <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and finally he said with a flirt of his tail: ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to speak, but Mull {{went on in}} {{oblivion}} of me, {{speaking out}} of the cavern of his hands. [...] "I don't mind telling you, Father, because it's really more defending the poor Duke than giving him away. Didn't you ever hear {{of the time when}} he very nearly lost all the estates?" ...|$|E
60|$|A wave {{of anger}} passed through me as I listened to Summerlee. It was disgraceful {{that he should}} speak thus of the leader {{who had been the}} source of all our fame and given us such an {{experience}} as no men have ever enjoyed. I had <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to utter some hot retort, when Lord John got before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he replied, [...] "I shall {{probably}} astonish strangers, {{because they}} have never before {{had the pleasure of}} seeing me. Also, they will marvel at my great learning. Every time I <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> Cayke, I am liable to say something important." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope I will, an' then I'll {{feel as if}} I had kinder {{paid for}} runnin' away. If Uncle Dan'l will only let me stay with him again he may whip me every mornin', an' I won't <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to holler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope it is," [...] growled the Rak. [...] "I want {{to crush}} them, if possible, for I {{have a bad}} disposition. If only I could <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> I'd eat all of you, {{although}} my appetite is poorly this warm weather." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Haven't I said--I {{appeal to}} the T'other Governor as my witness--haven't I said from the first minute that I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> in this here world-without-end-everlasting chair' (he evidently used that form of words as next in force to an affidavit), 'that I was willing to swear that he done it? Haven't I said, Take me and get me sworn to it? Don't I say so now? You won't deny it, Lawyer Lightwood?' ...|$|E
60|$|I felt relief, {{at least}} as far as the two men were concerned. It was clear he did not wish to run too far away from them. I picked up hope at the thought and put the order swiftly into execution. I had {{scarcely}} <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to issue the necessary commands, when eager men were springing to halyards and downhauls, and others were racing aloft. This eagerness on their part was noted by Wolf Larsen with a grim smile.|$|E
6000|$|Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good. Providence {{had stood}} by me this fur all right, but I {{was hard and}} tight aground now. I see it warn't a bit of use {{to try to go}} ahead--I'd got to throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth. I <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have stopped him, for he was off before I had time to so much as <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and there I stood leaning against the canoe, giving the people of Benedict to believe I was eager to be {{fighting}} for my country.|$|R
60|$|These {{were the}} two things {{uppermost}} in my mind; and I could <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> upon neither without black ungenerosity. So I did the next worst, and said nothing, nor so much as looked once at my companion, save with the tail of my eye.|$|R
6000|$|I {{perceive}} I {{have not}} really understood any thing, not a single [...] object, and that no man ever can, [...] Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon [...] me and sting me, [...] Because I have dared to <b>open</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to sing at all.|$|R
