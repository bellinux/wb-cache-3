[...] A cave, with remains dating to the Iron Age I (12-11th centuries B.C.E.) were excavated at Khirbat Za‛kuka, south of Sur Baher.|$|R
25|$|Fires have {{historically}} been a vital component of the grassland ecosystem, but {{pose a threat to}} human life and property. In the Milk River Natural Area, management policy is suppression of wildfires, with prescribed controlled burns allowed for ecosystem maintenance purposes to manage the grassland in its climax state. Campfires are permitted but discouraged. Following the 2007 wildfire, inventories were conducted which showed an increase in species richness and also good recovery of native species with little invasion of exotics. Invasive weed species that have been found in the area, such as nodding thistle, are being controlled by spot spraying and hand picking. Larger species like the Russian <b>olive</b> are <b>cut</b> down and spot-treated.|$|R
25|$|Olives were {{harvested}} {{in the late}} summer and were processed for oil by crushing the olives, pressing the mash and separating the oil from the flesh. In the early Iron Age period, this was done by treading the <b>olives</b> in basins <b>cut</b> into rock, or with a mortar or stone on a flat slab. In the later Iron Age period, the introduction of the beam press made large scale processing possible.|$|R
5000|$|From 1948 to 1967, the Mount of <b>Olives</b> was <b>cut</b> {{off from}} the rest of Jerusalem by the 1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1949 Armistice Agreements. After Israel regained the region in the Six-Day War, Kalman Mann, then-director general of Hadassah Medical Center, went with a group of rabbis to the {{cemetery}} to assess the condition of Szold's grave. They found that it had been paved over by a road built by the Jordanians, who had also vandalized many grave markers. They were able to locate Szold's burial site using a cemetery chart and [...] "counting the indentations in the ground". The grave was later rebuilt and remarked with a new stone marker in an official ceremony.|$|R

In our clinical practice, we take measures to prevent premature consolidation: first, we start distraction {{on the third day}} after surgery; secondly, we use <b>cut</b> <b>olive</b> wires inserted into the bone segments adjacent to the osteotomy to enable predictable distraction through the osteotomy instead of distraction of adjacent joints.|$|R

According to the ICRC, 10,000 <b>olive</b> trees were <b>cut</b> down or burned by settlers in 2007-2010. Foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the report ignored official PA data {{showing that the}} economic situation of Palestinians had improved substantially, citing Mahmoud Abbas's comment to The Washington Post in May 2009, where he said [...] "in the West Bank, {{we have a good}} reality, the people are living a normal life." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{activity}} of the theatre will proceed regularly until 1832 when the last known association will born after the merge of the two local academies: The Nobles and The Resurrected, that will form the Academy of the Nobles Resurrected. To witness this union the new blazon of the association is an <b>olive</b> tree, <b>cut</b> {{at the lower end}} with new branches on the sides that are growing back, that which symbolizes the definitive rebirth of this association. The academy will not be the only one to be renewed. The old theater, now dilapidated and in poor condition, will be demolished in favor of a new building, built in stone in front of the old theater. Work will begin in 1833, a year after the birth of the new academy, led by the florentine Francesco Leoni and continued until August 1836. On September 1, the new theater called royal Dante theatre was inaugurated with La Sonnambula by Vincenzo Bellini. The name of the theater was chosen to pay tribute {{to one of the most}} important poets of Italy, the florentine Dante Alighieri.|$|R
50|$|When {{follower}} Solange Boilard {{complained of}} an upset stomach, Thériault laid her naked on a table, punched {{her in the}} stomach, jammed a plastic tube up her rectum to perform a crude enema with molasses and <b>olive</b> oil, then <b>cut</b> open her abdomen, and ripped off part of her intestines with his bare hands. Thériault made another member, Gabrielle Lavallée, stitch her up using needle and thread, and had the other women shove a tube down her throat and blow. Boilard died the next day. Claiming to have the power of resurrection, Thériault bore a hole into Boilard's skull with a drill, and then made other male members—along with himself—ejaculate into the cavity.|$|R
50|$|The {{house and}} gardens date to 1691. It {{belonged to the}} commune, was rented for a time by the Marquis de Castellane, and then was {{purchased}} by the painter Pierre Deval in 1925. During World War II the land was requisitioned by the German army for an artillery position, {{and many of the}} trees, including the rows of <b>olive</b> trees, were <b>cut</b> down. The Germans spared only the plane trees in front of the house, because they liked to have dinner {{in the shade of the}} trees. After the war Deval and his wife Henriette replanted the trees which had surrounded the house. Beginning in 1993, their daughter Françoise inherited the house and restored and added many new kinds of trees and plants to the gardens.|$|R
60|$|He {{reached the}} station {{that led to}} the works at Rocca Marina. The sun was high, {{the heat of the day}} coming on, and as he strode along, the workmen were leaving off to take their siesta at noontide. On he went, across the private walks in the terraced garden, not up the broad stone steps {{that led to the}} house, but to a little group of <b>olive</b> trees which <b>cut</b> off the chaplain's house from the castle gardens, and where stood a great cork tree, to whose {{branches}} a hammock had been fastened, and seats placed under it. As he opened the gate a little dog's bark was heard, and he was aware of a broad hat under the tree. Simultaneously a small Maltese dog sprang forward, and Francie's head rose from leaning over the little table with a start, her cheeks deeper rose than usual, having evidently gone to sleep over the thin book and big dictionary that lay before her.|$|R
5000|$|In Mexico {{and some}} parts Central America, it is served either in {{cocktail}} cups with tostadas, salted crackers, or as a tostada topping and taco filling. In Mexico, when {{served in a}} cup with tomato sauce, it is called a ceviche cocktail. Although this cocktail is made from the [...] "dry" [...] ceviche recipe, this presentation is rather unusual outside of some specific areas, and in most areas of Mexico it is almost unheard of, while in some others, such as the Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz area and the Mexican Southeast, the ceviche cocktail is very popular. Shrimp, octopus, squid, tuna, and mackerel are also popular bases for Mexican ceviche, apart from fish. The marinade ingredients include salt, lime, onion, chili peppers, avocado, and coriander leaves (known as cilantro in the Americas). <b>Cut</b> <b>olives</b> {{and a bit of}} tomatoes are often added to the preparation (ketchup is not used because it adds sugar and is not fresh).|$|R
6000|$|... § XXXVIII. For instance, in the inlaid {{design of}} the dove with the olive branch, from the Casa Trevisan (Vol. I. Plate XX. p. 369), it is {{impossible}} for anything to go beyond the precision with which the <b>olive</b> leaves are <b>cut</b> out of the white marble; and, in some wreaths of laurel below, the rippled edge of each leaf is as finely and easily drawn, as if by a delicate pencil. No Florentine table is more exquisitely finished than the façade of this entire palace; and as ideals of an executive perfection, which, though we must not turn aside from our main path to reach it, may yet with much advantage be kept in our sight and memory, these palaces are most notable amidst the architecture of Europe. The Rio Façade of the Ducal Palace, though very sparing in color, is yet, as an example of finished masonry in a vast building, one of the finest things, not only in Venice, but in the world. It differs from other work of the Byzantine Renaissance, in being on a very large scale; and it still retains one pure Gothic character, which adds not a little to its nobleness, that of perpetual variety. There is hardly one window of it, or one panel, that is like another; and this continual change so increases its apparent size by confusing the eye, that, though presenting no bold features, or striking masses of any kind, there are few things in Italy more impressive than the vision of it overhead, as the gondola glides from beneath the Bridge of Sighs. And lastly (unless we are to blame these buildings for some pieces of very childish perspective), they are magnificently honest, as well as perfect. I do not remember even any gilding upon them; all is pure marble, and of the finest kind.[5] ...|$|R
6000|$|If he {{had taken}} a contradictious tone on purpose to draw Mrs. Luna out, he could not have {{elicited}} more of the information he desired. It was perfectly true that he had seen no reference to Verena's performances in the preceding June; there were periods when the newspapers seemed to him so idiotic that for weeks he never looked at one. He learned from Mrs. Luna that it was not Olive who had sent her the [...] "Transcript" [...] and in letters had added some private account of the doings at the convention to the testimony of that amiable sheet; she had been indebted for this service to a [...] "gentleman-friend," [...] who wrote her everything that happened in Boston, and what every one had every day for dinner. Not that it was necessary for her happiness to know; but the gentleman she spoke of didn't know what to invent to please her. A Bostonian couldn't imagine that one didn't want to know, and that was their idea of ingratiating themselves, or, at any rate, it was his, poor man. Olive would never have gone into particulars about Verena; she regarded her sister as quite too much one of the profane, and knew Adeline couldn't understand why, when she took to herself a bosom-friend, she should have been at such pains to select her in just the most dreadful class in the community. Verena was a perfect little adventuress, and quite third-rate into the bargain; but, of course, she was a pretty girl enough, if one cared for hair of the colour of cochineal. As for her people, they were too absolutely awful; it was exactly as if she, Mrs. Luna, had struck up an intimacy with the daughter of her chiropodist. It took Olive to invent such monstrosities, and to think she was doing something great for humanity when she did so; though, in spite of her wanting to turn everything over, and put the lowest highest, she could be just as contemptuous and invidious, when it came to really mixing, as if she were some grand old duchess. She must do her the justice to say that she hated the Tarrants, the father and mother; but, all the same, she let Verena run to and fro between Charles Street and the horrible hole they lived in, and Adeline knew from that gentleman who wrote so copiously that the girl now and then spent a week at a time at Cambridge. Her mother, who had been ill for some weeks, wanted her to sleep there. Mrs. Luna knew further, by her correspondent, that Verena had--or had had the winter before--a great deal of attention from gentlemen. She didn't know how she worked that into the idea that the female sex was sufficient to itself; but she had grounds for saying that this was one reason why Olive had taken her abroad. She was afraid Verena would give in to some man, and she wanted to make a break. Of course, any such giving in would be very awkward for a young woman who shrieked out on platforms that old maids were the highest type. Adeline guessed Olive had perfect control of her now, unless indeed she used the expeditions to Cambridge as a cover for meeting gentlemen. She was an artful little minx, and cared as much for the rights of women as she did for the Panama Canal; the only right of a woman she wanted was to climb up on top of something, where the men could look at her. She would stay with Olive as long as it served her purpose, because Olive, with her great respectability, could push her, and counteract the effect of her low relations, to say nothing of paying all her expenses and taking her the tour of Europe. [...] "But, mark my words," [...] said Mrs. Luna, [...] "she will give <b>Olive</b> the greatest <b>cut</b> she has ever had in her life. She will run off with some lion-tamer; she will marry a circus-man!" [...] And Mrs. Luna added that it would serve Olive Chancellor right. But she would take it hard; look out for tantrums then! ...|$|R
