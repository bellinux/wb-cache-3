Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.|$|E

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional <b>or</b> <b>chronic</b> tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E

5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute <b>or</b> <b>chronic</b> inflammation {{around the}} apex of a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute <b>or</b> <b>chronic</b> maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute <b>or</b> <b>chronic</b> liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), <b>or</b> <b>chronic</b> (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute <b>or</b> <b>chronic</b> pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E

Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife.

5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are followed by}} a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, <b>or</b> <b>chronic</b> HIV. Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute <b>or</b> <b>chronic</b> pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Presently, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} on how to define multimorbidity. In this paper we investigate the connection between prevalence estimates for two or more and three <b>or</b> more <b>chronic</b> conditions to improve comparability of multimorbidity studies with different cut-offs. METHODS: In a systematic review of the literature published between January, 1990 and December, 2011, we found 52 suitable studies, many providing prevalence estimates for several age groups. A total of 31 studies reported both the prevalence for multimorbidity based on two <b>or</b> more <b>chronic</b> conditions and three <b>or</b> more <b>chronic</b> conditions, which were analysed in this study. Our research question was whether there is a systematic interrelation between these two prevalence estimates, and how this could be used to improve the comparability of studies on the burden of multimorbidity. RESULTS: Actually, we found a tight relationship between the prevalence of two or more and three <b>or</b> more <b>chronic</b> conditions. Moreover, each of these estimates can be predicted from the other. I. e. the cut-offs of two or three for the number of chronic conditions produce essentially the same information on prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a way to enhance and improve the comparability of prevalence estimates from different multimorbidity studies...|$|R
