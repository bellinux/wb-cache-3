After that we introduce a hyper BCK-algebra <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set of all equivalence classes of an equivalence relation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of a deterministic finite automaton and we prove that this hyper BCK-algebra is simple, strong normal and implicative. Finally we define a semi continuous deterministic finite automaton. Then we introduce a hyper BCK-algebra S <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of this automaton an...|$|R
