5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip value, while tens and court cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> receiving the stake.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} {{blackjack}} {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as possible without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In blackjack, the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E
25|$|On stage, Suzy {{was joined}} by backing vocalists Marta Mota and Sara Campina, backing dancers Luís Filipe Pimenta and Renato Nobre, and percussionist Jefferson Negreiros. The {{performance}} featured the two backing vocalists performing choreography with Suzy, the two dancers playing two large drums and the percussionist performing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> drum.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of playing each hand {{can be very}} different according {{to the strength of}} the <b>hand.</b> For example, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>hand,</b> <b>a</b> player might want to try to appear weak in order to not scare off other players with weaker <b>hands,</b> while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> weak <b>hand,</b> <b>a</b> player might try to bluff other players into folding.|$|R

25|$|While in the past, the {{majority}} of jumpers and other Aran garments were knitted by hand, today {{the majority}} of items for sale in Ireland and elsewhere are either machine knit or produced <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> loom.

25|$|In late April 1861, four Confederate half dollars {{were struck}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> press by certain {{employees}} of the New Orleans Mint. Because of the high relief of the coin die, a test striking was made to see if coins would release from the Confederate die. The die was made by a printing plate engraver (A.H.M. Peterson) in New Orleans who was unfamiliar with techniques required to engrave coining dies. These coins were struck using a U.S. obverse die (Seated Liberty) and the Confederate die made by Peterson. These coins are known as originals, {{and the location of}} all four of the coins is known today.|$|E
25|$|Also notable are the {{different}} grades of compensation given to wounds {{depending on the}} degree of disfigurement produced by the wounding, with a differentiation between craith ogyfarch; a conspicuous scar which attracts remarks, and craith guiddiedig; a hidden scar which will therefore attract less remarks. The craith ogyfarch afforded the most compensation, but the value of the ogyfarch compensation varied according to its noticability. The three most conspicuous scars are given as those on a face (six score pence), <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> (sixty pence), and on a foot (thirty pence), whilst a hidden scar is given only four pence. Interestingly, the Latin texts A and E ‘make provision for a cloak to cover facial disfigurement’ and front teeth were also accorded a higher value than other teeth.|$|E

25|$|Fecal sludge {{collection}} {{services can}} be made available on a scheduled basis or on a call-for-service basis (also known as on-demand, on-request or non-scheduled services). The collected fecal sludge may be transported to treatment plants by using a vacuum truck; a tank and pump mounted on a flatbed truck; a small tank pulled by a motorcycle; or in containers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> cart. Mobile or permanent transfer stations {{can be used to}} improve the efficiency of fecal sludge transportation by transferring the waste to larger tankers for haulage to treatment. The wider use of multiple decentralized sludge treatment facilities within the city (to avoid long haulage distances) is currently being researched and piloted.|$|E
25|$|Up to March 1964, Hassan Habiby was {{editor and}} {{responsible}} for collecting information, articles, and news; while Jazani {{was in charge}} of the publication process. In the spring of 1964 a committee was selected to run the publication made up of all factions of the student movement. Hooshang Keshavarz Sadr, Matin Daftari, Majeed Ahsan, and Mansoor Soroush were part of this committee. Jazani {{was in charge of}} publication and Behzad Nabavi (بهزاد نبوی) was responsible for circulation. The preliminary work related to the print was done by Jazani at his home. The printing was done <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> made copy machine that was not only labor-intensive, it also demanded a safe environment from the authorities. Jazani had rented a hidden house for this purpose and in all stages of the process from financial to print had a major role.|$|E
25|$|User {{needs were}} given a high {{priority}} in the cockpit's design; both layout and functionality was created through feedback and assessments from military pilots and a specialist testing facility. The aircraft is controlled {{by means of a}} centre stick (or control stick) and left hand throttles, designed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Hand</b> on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) principle to lower pilot workloads. Emergency escape is provided by a Martin-Baker Mk.16A ejection seat, with the canopy being jettisoned by two rocket motors. The HMSS was delayed by years but should have been operational by late 2011. Standard g-force protection is provided by the full-cover anti-g trousers (FCAGTs). a specially developed g suit providing sustained protection up to 9 g. German Air Force and Austrian Air Force pilots wear a hydrostatic g-suit called Libelle (dragonfly) Multi G Plus instead, which also provides protection to the arms, theoretically giving more complete g tolerance.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things in Texas hold'em is knowing how to evaluate a hand.The strategy of playing each hand can be very different according to the strength of the <b>hand.</b> For example, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>hand,</b> <b>a</b> player might want to try to appear weak in order to not scare off other players with weaker <b>hands,</b> while <b>on</b> <b>a</b> weak <b>hand,</b> <b>a</b> player might try to bluff other players into folding.|$|R
500|$|At {{the same}} time, poker night is a Thursday night {{tradition}} among Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), the TGS staff. Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) join {{them for the}} first time. Jack is able to read and defeat all of the other players, except for NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), who wins the final hand. The next day, Jack sets up another poker night. Eventually, Jack and Kenneth come down to the final hand. Jack has more chips and goes all-in. He offers to make the hand winner-take-all if Kenneth bets his page jacket. Kenneth agrees, and Jack's pair of twos beats Kenneth's king high. Liz asks why Kenneth would bet <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> like that, and he responds that he enjoys living on the edge and was also confused about the rules. Jack stops Kenneth from leaving, explains that he only made Kenneth bet his job to prove his power over him, and returns the jacket to Kenneth with the expectation that he come in early on Monday.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the four}} {{portrait}} pages, only that for Luke survives (Folio 129v). [...] He is shown {{sitting on a}} marble throne, with a cushion, in an elaborate architectural setting, probably based on the scaenae frons of a Roman theatre - a common convention for Late Antique miniatures, coins and Imperial portraiture. [...] The pose with the chin resting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> suggests an origin in classical author portraits of philosophers - more often evangelists are shown writing. [...] Above a cornice sits the winged ox, Luke's evangelist's symbol. [...] The pediment has an inscription with a hexameter from the Carmen Paschale by the 5th century Christian poet Coelius Sedulius (Book 1, line 357): [...] "Iura sacerdotii Lucas tenet ore iuvenci" [...] - [...] "Luke holds the laws of priesthood {{in the mouth of}} the young bull" [...] (iuvencus meaning also [...] "young man").|$|E

60|$|All {{the world}} was there and of course our hero. Never was {{the arrival of a}} comet watched by astronomers who had {{calculated}} its advent with more anxiety than was the appearance of the young Duke. Never did man pass through such dangers. It was the fiery ordeal. St. Anthony himself was not assailed by more temptations. Now he was saved from the lustre of a blonde face by the superior richness of a blonde lace. He would infallibly have been ravished by that ringlet had he not been nearly reduced by that ring which sparkled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> like the white cat's. He was only preserved from his unprecedented dangers by their number. No, no! He had a better talisman: his conceit.|$|E
60|$|Now {{this town}} of Cetewayo's stands, or rather stood, for {{it has long been}} burnt, on the slope of the hills to the {{north-east}} of the plains of Ulundi. Above it these hills grow steeper, and deep in the recesses of {{one of them is the}} Valley of Bones. There is nothing particularly imposing about the place; no towering cliffs or pillars of piled granite, as at the Black Kloof. It is just a vale cut out by water, bordered by steep slopes on either side, and a still steeper slope strown with large rocks at its end. Dotted here and there on these slopes grew tall aloes that from a little distance looked like scattered men, whereof the lower leaves were shrivelled and blackened by veld fires. Also there were a few euphorbias, grey, naked-looking things that end in points like fingers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> and among them some sparse thorn trees, struggling to live in an inhospitable soil.|$|E
60|$|So {{much for}} his {{personal}} life and temperament. His public career as a popular preacher carries him equally far beyond John the Baptist. He lays no stress on baptism or vows, and preaches conduct incessantly. He advocates communism, the widening of the private family with its cramping ties into the great family of mankind under the fatherhood of God, the abandonment of revenge and punishment, the counteracting of evil by good instead of by a hostile evil, and an organic conception of society in which you are not an independent individual but a member of society, your neighbor being another member, and each of you members one of another, as two fingers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> the obvious conclusion being that unless you love your neighbor as yourself and he reciprocates you will both be the worse for it. He conveys all this with extraordinary charm, and entertains his hearers with fables (parables) to illustrate them. He has no synagogue or regular congregation, but travels {{from place to place}} with twelve men whom he has called from their work as he passed, and who have abandoned it to follow him.|$|E

60|$|The scout applied {{his fingers}} to his mouth, and raised a low hissing sound, that caused Duncan, at first, to start aside, believing that he heard a serpent. The head of Chingachgook was resting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand,</b> as he sat musing by himself; but the moment he heard the warning of the animal whose name he bore, it arose to an upright {{position}} and his dark eyes glanced swiftly and keenly on every side of him. With this sudden and perhaps involuntary movement, every appearance of surprise or alarm ended. His rifle lay untouched, and apparently unnoticed, within reach of his hand. The tomahawk that he had loosened in his belt {{for the sake of}} ease, was even suffered to fall from its usual situation to the ground, and his form seemed to sink, like that of a man whose nerves and sinews were suffered to relax for the purpose of rest. Cunningly resuming his former position, though with a change of hands, as if the movement had been made merely to relieve the limb, the native awaited the result with a calmness and fortitude that none but an Indian warrior would have known how to exercise.|$|E

They said they were elegant and very moderate in price. It seemed a stylish thing to go to the theater in kid gloves, and we acted upon the hint. A very handsome young lady in the store offered me a pair of blue gloves. I did not want blue, but she said they would look very pretty <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> like mine. The remark touched me tenderly. I glanced furtively at my hand, and somehow it did seem rather a comely member. I tried a glove on my left and blushed a little.
