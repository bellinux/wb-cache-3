5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After the hosts had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain Walter Robins and Test players Freddie Brown, Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while {{the other two were}} caught by Ian Johnson in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75.|$|E
5|$|Four county matches {{remained}} {{before the}} Tests, giving the players more chances to press their claims for selection. Johnston was recalled for Australia'a first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. After {{the first day}} was washed out, Johnston made 24 in a 25-run ninth-wicket partnership with wicket-keeper Ron Saggers, which took Australia from 8/170 to 9/195. The tourists were eventually bowled out for 204. During his innings, Johnston swung lustily and hit three sixes. In reply, Lancashire reached 4/144 before Johnston took five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets to help dismiss the home side for 182, securing a slender lead for the tourists. Johnston ended with 5/49 from 29 overs, the most {{by any of the}} Australians, and was not required to bat in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|For {{his second}} season, Munnerlyn {{moved up to}} {{starting}} right cornerback after Richard Marshall was not re-signed. In Week 3 against the Cincinnati Bengals, he snagged his first career interception against Carson Palmer. In his first {{start of the season}} in Week 12 against the Cleveland Browns, Munnerlyn stepped in front of a pass from Jake Delhomme intended for Mohamed Massaquoi to pick it off and return it 37 yards for the touchdown. He went on to start five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> games of the season for the Panthers. Playing in 16 games with five starts, Munnerlyn recorded 47 tackles and one forced fumble, tied for second on the team with three interceptions (including one returned for a touchdown) and ranked first with 10 passes defensed, contributing to a Panthers defense that ranked seventh in the NFL in average yards per play. He also led the Panthers with a 10.9-yard punt return average on 30 returns for 327 yards with a long of 37 yards and returned two kickoffs for 87 yards.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the final}} match for Bradman in England, and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions. It was Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Ring. The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat, but Lindwall took 6/59 in an innings that lasted into the second day, bowling four of his victims and taking five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62. Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face, breaking his nose. Australia reached 2/407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8/469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result. Leveson-Gower's XI played out time, with Bradman bowling the last over.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} of Chastity, my Brother, Travers {{returned}} to comedy, though not immediately to farce. Later in 1936 his O Mistress Mine was a light Ruritanian vehicle for Yvonne Printemps. He returned to farce with Banana Ridge (1938) in which Robertson Hare starred with Alfred Drayton. It was set in Malaya, and turned on which of two middle-aged pillars of Empire {{was the father of}} the young hero. Travers himself played the part of Wun, a servant; his lines in colloquial Malay, remembered from his Malacca days, were improvised and sometimes took his colleagues by surprise.

Morales came back strongly in the second half of the fight and won four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> rounds on two judges' scorecards. However, the judges scored the bout 114–114, 114–115, 113–115 in favor of Barrera, in what was justifiably a very, very close, but non-controversial and justifiable win for Barrera. Their third meeting was once again named The Ring Fight of the Year.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of World War 2 {{during the period of}} 1939 – 1945, saw the zoo trying to survive. Attendance was down, animal {{importation}} and supplying zoo animals with food was low on the New Zealand Government's list of priorities. Due to these pressures, exhibits changed to more localised and rural representatives. The arrival of United States military personnel in June 1942 helped the zoo, especially because the personnel were quartered close to Western Springs. It was not infrequent for the majority of weekend visitors to be in uniform. The end of the war found the zoo in a state of slight disrepair and depletion of stocks, but in good condition considering the conflict <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> years. Furthermore, this time saw the retirement, and movement of many of the early or original members of the zoo staff.|$|E

25|$|Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for {{the first}} time in 1901, making them the only non-League club to do so since the {{formation}} of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition– the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1967, Spurs won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and were the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When they won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that they had won a major trophy in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> decades– an achievement only matched by Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|With the {{retirement}} of Nigel Howard in 1954, Lancashire appointed its first professional captain, Cyril Washbrook, who would captain the club {{for the next six}} years. In 1954 Geoff Pullar, Ken Grieves and Alan Wharton all scored over 2,000runs, whilst Brian Statham, Ken Higgs and Tommy Greenhough all took over 100wickets; despite this, Lancashire managed to finish only 5th. Lancashire came close to reclaiming the county championship in 1960 under a new captain, Bob Barber. Five batsmen scored more than 1,000runs in the season, and Statham, Higgs and Greenhough all took over 100wickets; Lancashire finished runner up due to a poor run of form {{towards the end of the}} season: losing four and drawing two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> matches after topping the table in August. The following year, however, Lancashire dropped to 13th, due in part to Barber’s inexperience and Statham’s and Geoff Pullar’s England commitments. Things declined further in 1962, under the leadership of Joe Blackledge, who had had no previous first-class experience, as Lancashire dropped to second last, winning only two matches. After a period of unrest, Brian Statham was appointed captain between 1965 and 1967 and Lancashire’s results improved. Statham retired in 1968 with 1,816 first-class wickets, a record for the club.|$|E
25|$|Plunkett {{was called}} {{up for the}} England One Day International and Test squads to tour Pakistan in November & December 2005 after an injury to Simon Jones. He made his Test debut in the third Test of that series in Lahore taking figures of 2–125 in the innings defeat. Plunkett came on as a Super Sub in his first ODI on 10 December 2005 after Kevin Pietersen went off with a back injury. Plunkett {{finished}} with England's best bowling figures, taking 3 wickets for 51 runs, {{and he was also}} involved in the run out of Shoaib Akhtar. They were three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>six</b> wickets, which fell for 23 as England {{went on to win the}} match by 42 runs. Two days later, when Plunkett entered the crease, England's score was a disappointing 130 for 8 in the second ODI. He added 56 runs to the total in a record ninth-wicket 100 run partnership with Vikram Solanki before chipping a return catch to Shoaib Akhtar. England needed to keep the Pakistani run rate below five an over, however, after setting a target of 231, but Plunkett's seven overs went for 63 – Kamran Akmal taking 39 off the 25 balls Plunkett bowled to him.|$|E
