40|$|Non-immunized, vaccinated, and {{recovered}} cattle were inoculated intranasally with various doses of foot-and-mouth disease virus. Samples of oesophageal-pharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>fluid</b> were taken periodically {{for up to}} 7 days after inoculation and virus titres of these samples were plotted as pharyngeal virus growth curves. In non-immunized cattle, {{the length of the}} lag period and of the growth period were inversely proportional to the dose of virus given. Maximum titres were observed when clinical signs were first detected. Three of the 10 cattle studied had virus growth rates that were lower than rates of others given the same dose of virus, and clinical signs appeared later than expected in these three cattle. Cattle vaccinated with an inactivated virus oil-adjuvant vaccine had pharyngeal virus growth curves that were similar to those obtained from non-immunized cattle for 30 h. after inoculation. Titres of virus in <b>OP</b> <b>fluid</b> samples taken 2 - 7 days after inoculation were substantially lower in cattle with a high pre-exposure serum mouse protection index than titres from partly-immunized or non-immunized cattle. Nine of 14 cattle had detectable but reduced virus growth after intranasal inoculation with homologous virus. Five recovered cattle inoculated with heterologous virus reacted similarly to non-immunized animals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Foot-and mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, febrile, and {{contagious}} vesicular disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals. Some animals {{may become}} persistent infected carriers when they contact FMD virus (FMDV), and persistent infected animals are a dangerous factor to cause FMD outbreak. Findings 300 OP (oesophageal-pharyngeal) fluid {{samples were collected}} from cattle without clinic symptom after one month FMD circulated in 2010 in China. A FMDV strain was isolated when a positive OP sample was passed in BHK 21 cell line. The strain, named O/CHN/ 2010 / 33 -OP, was detected to be O/Myanmar/ 1998 lineage with VP 1 DNA sequence comparison. In order to testify its infectivity, two cattle were challenged with <b>OP</b> <b>fluid</b> and three pigs were put into the same pen for direct contact infection. The result showed {{that one of the}} cattle and one of the pigs appeared FMD clinic symptoms respectively. Furthermore, two cattle (three pigs were also put into the same pen for direct contact infection) and three pigs were inoculated with O/CHN/ 2010 / 33 -OP cell passaged strain. The result showed that one of the challenged pigs appeared FMD clinic symptoms. Two cattle and three pigs in the same pen did not appeared FMD clinic symptoms, but the sera antibody and their <b>OP</b> <b>fluid</b> of two cattle were positive. Meanwhile, the spinal cords of three pigs in the same pen with two cattle were positive detected with multiplex- RT-PCR. Conclusion The persistent infection strain O/CHN/ 2010 / 33 -OP has infectivity and pathogenicity to cattle and pigs, and infected cattle may transmit the virus to pigs although its virulence was lower than the circulated strain O/CHN/Mya 98 / 2010. </p...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{detect the}} proper time for {{vaccination}} of infected calves after the onset of clinical signs and revaccination for previously vaccinated animals with bivalent FMD montanide ISA 206 inactivated vaccine. Materials and Methods: Twenty calves naturally infected with {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) showing clinical signs represented by lesions on the tongue, buccal mucosa and feet. Samples were collected from these calves including tongue epithelial and oropharyngeal <b>fluid</b> (<b>OP).</b> The causative virus was isolated from such samples through inoculation of baby mice and typed by indirect Sandwich ELISA and was confirmed in 2 tongue epithelia samples using PCR. Results: The serum antibody titers were determined using SNT and ELISA in the sera of the 20 infected calves revealing that the infected farms should be vaccinated with inactivated bivalent FMD vaccine for (type O and A) Adjuvanted with montanide ISA 206 after 32 weeks from the appearance of clinical signs. In addition the FMD immune status was monitored in 2 farms in EL-Fayoum and El-Sharkia Governorates where 50 calves in each farm were vaccinated with the bivalent FMD inactivated vaccine adjuvaned with montanide ISA 206 and serum samples were collected monthly from these animals to determine their immune status using SNT and ELISA. The obtained results showed that vaccinated calves with the bivalent FMD montanide ISA 206 inactivated vaccine should be revaccinated after 36 weeks post vaccination. Conclusions: naturally infected calves should be vaccinated on the 32 weeks post infection while vaccinated calves should be revaccinated on the 36 weeks post vaccination.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV) serotypes circulating in Uganda's cattle population, both serological and virological analyses of samples from outbreaks that occurred during 2012 - 2013 were performed. Altogether, 79 sera and 60 oropharyngeal <b>fluid</b> (<b>OP)</b> /tissue/oral swab samples were collected from herds with reported FMD outbreaks in seven different Ugandan districts. Overall, 61 / 79 (77 %) of the cattle sera were positive for antibodies against FMDV by PrioCHECK FMDV NS ELISA and solid phase blocking ELISA detected titres ≥ 80 for serotypes O, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 in 41, 45, 30 and 45 of these 61 seropositive samples, respectively. Virus neutralisation tests detected {{the highest levels of}} neutralising antibodies (titres ≥ 45) against serotype O in the herds from Kween and Rakai districts, against SAT 1 in the herd from Nwoya district and against SAT 2 in the herds from Kiruhura, Isingiro and Ntungamo districts. The isolation of a SAT 2 FMDV from Isingiro was consistent with the detection of high levels of neutralising antibodies against SAT 2; sequencing (for the VP 1 coding region) indicated that this virus belonged to lineage I within this serotype, like the currently used vaccine strain. From the Wakiso district 11 tissue/swab samples were collected; serotype A FMDV, genotype Africa (G-I), was isolated from the epithelial samples. This study shows that within a period of less than one year, FMD outbreaks in Uganda were caused by four different serotypes namely O, A, SAT 1 and SAT 2. Therefore, to enhance the control of FMD in Uganda, there is need for efficient and timely determination of outbreak virus strains/serotypes and vaccine matching. The value of incorporating serotype A antigen into the imported vaccines along with the current serotype O, SAT 1 and SAT 2 strains should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four {{specific}} pathogen free pigs were inoculated intradermally at the front-right heel bulb with 0. 5 ml of viral suspension containing 10 (6. 0) {{tissue culture}} infectious dose (TCID(50)) with the porcinophillic strain (O/Taiwan/ 97) of {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV) isolated from the epizootic of FMD in Taiwan in 1997. Two pigs were euthanatized at 8 h, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 15, 21, 26 and 63 days post-inoculation (DPI), and two pigs remained for long-term observation and terminated at 400 DPI. Typical symptoms of depression and inappetence appeared in the inoculated pigs at 1 DPI and subsided by 7 DPI. Vesicles developed in the epidermis over non-inoculated metacarpals joints at 1 DPI and vesicles in the mouth and on the snout were noticed at 2 DPI. Lesions in the feet were characterized by necrosis in the stratum spinosum, intercellular oedema, and vesicle formation accompanied by neutrophilic and mononuclear cells infiltration. Baby hamster kidney- 21 cell cultures were used for virus isolation and viraemia was detected beginning at 1 DPI and persisted till 3 DPI and was no longer detectable when neutralizing antibody (NA) developed at 4 DPI. However, virus was isolated from skin samples from 1 to 12 DPI, from faeces from 2 to 8 DPI, and from 95 % oesophageal-pharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>fluid</b> samples at 8 HPI. Among the samples tested in this study, skin vesicles had the highest virus titre, 10 (8. 63) TCID(50). No virus was isolated from the skin or visceral organs obtained from post-mortem at day 15 after infection and the virus was not detectable from the <b>OP</b> <b>fluid</b> from 12 DPI {{till the end of}} this study (400 DPI). By using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, viral RNA was detected first from the tissues at the inoculation site at 1 DPI, and still detectable at 21 DPI. Neutralizing antibody emerged at 4 DPI and the geometric mean NA titre reached to 1 : 861 and 1 : 1097 at 21 and 301 DPI respectively. The re-growth of hoof began at 21 DPI; however, minimal lesions including remnants of the old hoof were still presented {{at the end of this}} study. These results suggest that monitoring pig's hooves for residual lesions should be part of the FMD diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is {{a serious}} trans-boundary {{livestock}} disease and is present {{in many parts of}} the world. It can result in devastating economic impacts in affected countries or regions. It is endemic in South East Asia (SEA) including Lao PDR and Myanmar. Susceptible animals infected with FMD typically show clinical signs two to four days after exposure to the virus, and in some cases within 24 hours, especially in pigs. However, some animals develop only mild lesions and in others lesions may not be visible. Some animals become persistently infected after recovery. This is the so-called ‘carrier’ state where the virus can still be recovered after 28 days post infection (PI) in the oesophageal-pharyngeal (OP) region. In SEA, the Asian swamp buffalo (ASB), is important to livestock systems and communities and therefore the presence of FMDV in persistently infected ASB, is potentially of importance in disease control. To investigate the presence and the role of FMD carriers in ASB, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were conducted in both Lao PDR and Myanmar. The cross sectional studies were conducted to evaluate the use of tests to detect carriers under field conditions and to determine the percentage of ASB that were seropositive after infection; and the longitudinal studies were conducted to determine the proportion of ASB that remained persistently infected and also measure the duration of persistent infection. The studies were conducted at the sites of FMD outbreaks in 2008. These were due to FMD serotype O as confirmed by FMD laboratory reports from both FMD national laboratories and from the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) for FMD in Thailand. In this study, several tests to detect FMD carrier animals were used and results of the tests were compared. All laboratory diagnosis of samples collected from both Lao PDR and Myanmar were done at the Institute for Animal Health (IAH), Pirbright Laboratory, United Kingdom. The internationally accepted standard for confirmation of diagnosis of an FMD carrier animal is by recovery of live FMDV from <b>OP</b> <b>fluid</b> collected by probang sampling. This is a highly invasive process and is labour intensive and the recovery of the FMDV in carrier animals is usually intermittent. This makes <b>OP</b> <b>fluid</b> sampling difficult to use as routine diagnosis for carrier identification. An IgA ELISA based test has been developed to detect FMDVspecific immunoglobulin A (IgA) which is present in the serum and also in the saliva of animals after infection with and vaccination by FMDV. It has also been shown that the level of FMD-specific IgA was elevated in carrier animals and this IgA ELISA based test was developed to quantify this elevated level of FMD-specific salivary IgA in persistently infected animals. The non-structural protein (NSP) ELISA which differentiates antibodies due to infection from vaccination and which have been previously used in other species to identify animals that have been infected with FMD and which may still be carrying live virus was validated and used in this study. This study is the first to validate test performances of the above tests on ASB population previously infected with FMDV. Using the Bayesian statistical analysis, the overall test sensitivity (Sn) of the four NSP ELISAs and the salivary IgA ELISA vary from 60...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{control and}} {{monitoring}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) relies upon rapid and accurate disease confirmation. Currently, clinical samples are usually tested in reference laboratories using standardized assays recommended by The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). However, {{the requirements for}} prompt and serotype-specific diagnosis during FMD outbreaks, {{and the need to}} establish robust laboratory testing capacity in FMD-endemic countries have motivated the development of simple diagnostic platforms to support local decision-making. Using a portable thermocycler, the T-COR™ 8, this study describes the laboratory and field evaluation of a commercially available, lyophilized pan-serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay and a newly available FMD virus (FMDV) typing assay (East Africa-specific for serotypes: O, A, Southern African Territories [SAT] 1 and 2). Analytical sensitivity, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the pan-serotype-specific lyophilized assay were comparable to that of an OIE-recommended laboratory-based rRT-PCR (determined using a panel of 57 FMDV-positive samples and six non-FMDV vesicular disease samples for differential diagnosis). The FMDV-typing assay was able to correctly identify the serotype of 33 / 36 FMDV-positive samples (no cross-reactivity between serotypes was evident). Furthermore, the assays were able to accurately detect and type FMDV RNA in multiple sample types, including epithelial tissue suspensions, serum, oesophageal–pharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>fluid</b> and oral swabs, both with and without the use of nucleic acid extraction. When deployed in laboratory and field settings in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, both assays reliably detected and serotyped FMDV RNA in samples (n = 144) collected from pre-clinical, clinical and clinically recovered cattle. These data support the use of field-ready rRT-PCR platforms in endemic settings for simple, highly sensitive and rapid detection and/or characterization of FMDV...|$|E
40|$|Probiotics {{have been}} {{advocated}} as a novel therapeutic approach to respiratory disease, but {{knowledge of how}} oral administration of probiotics influences the respiratory microbiota is needed. Using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing of bacterial DNA our objective {{was to determine whether}} oral probiotics changed the composition of the upper and lower airway, rectal, and blood microbiota. We hypothesized that oral probiotics would modulate the respiratory microbiota in healthy cats, demonstrated by the detection and/or increased relative abundance of the probiotic bacterial species and altered composition of the microbial population in the respiratory tract. Six healthy young research cats had oropharyngeal (<b>OP),</b> bronchoalveolar lavage <b>fluid</b> (BALF), rectal, and blood samples collected at baseline and 4 weeks after receiving oral probiotics. 16 S rRNA gene amplicon libraries were sequenced, and coverage, richness, and relative abundance of representative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined. Hierarchical and principal component analyses (PCA) demonstrated relatedness of samples. Mean microbial richness significantly increased only in the upper and lower airways. The number of probiotic OTUs (out of 5 total) that significantly increased in relative abundance vs. baseline was 5 in OP, 3 in BAL and 2 in feces. Using hierarchical clustering, BALF and blood samples grouped together after probiotic administration, and PERMANOVA supported that these two sites underwent significant changes in microbial composition. PERMANOVA revealed that OP and rectal samples had microbial population compositions that did not significantly change. These findings were visualized via PCA, which revealed distinct microbiomes in each site; samples clustered more tightly at baseline and had more variation after probiotic administration. This is the first study describing the effect of oral probiotics on the respiratory microbiota via detection of probiotic species in the airways. Finding bacterial species present in the oral probiotics in the upper and lower airways provides pilot data suggesting that oral probiotics could serve as a tool to target dysbiosis occurring in inflammatory airway diseases such as feline asthma, a disease in which cats serve as an important comparative and translational model for humans...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the first multiway comparison of portable isothermal assays {{for the detection}} of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), benchmarked against real-time reverse transcription RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The selected isothermal chemistries included reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). The analytical sensitivity of RT-LAMP was comparable to rRT-PCR (10 (1) RNA copies), while RT-RPA was one log 10 less sensitive (10 (2) RNA copies). Diagnostic performance was evaluated using a panel of 35 samples from FMDV-positive cattle and eight samples from cattle infected with other vesicular viruses. Assay concordance for RT-LAMP and RT-RPA was 86 - 98 % and 67 - 77 %, respectively, when compared to rRT-PCR, with discordant samples consistently having high rRT-PCR CT values (no false-positives were detected for any assay). In addition, a hierarchy of sample preparation methods, from robotic extraction to simple dilution of samples, for epithelial suspensions, serum and oesophageal-pharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>fluid</b> were evaluated. Results obtained for RT-LAMP confirmed that FMDV RNA can be detected in the absence of RNA extraction. However, simple sample preparation methods were less encouraging for RT-RPA, with accurate results only obtained when using RNA extraction. Although the evaluation of assay performance is specific to the conditions tested in this study, the compatibility of RT-LAMP chemistry with multiple sample types, both in the presence and absence of nucleic acid extraction, provides advantages over alternative isothermal chemistries and alternative pen-side diagnostics such as antigen lateral-flow devices. These characteristics of RT-LAMP enable the assay to be performed over a large diagnostic detection window, providing a realistic means to rapidly confirm positive FMD cases close to the point of sampling...|$|E

Foot and Mouth disease virus serotypes O and A still existing in Egypt. In January 2012, sever outbreaks struck the animal population in most Egyptian 1 governorates. The causative virus was identified as FMDV SAT 2. Material and Methods: Five samples of tongue epithelium (ET) and five oesophageal-pharyngeal (<b>OP)</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were collected from FMD suspected cattle in infected farm at El-Fayoum and 20 OP samples from in-contact cattle at the same farm in addition to 30 OP samples from apparently healthy cattle at three different localities in El-Fayoum governorate (12 from Fayoum; 9 from Sinoras and 9 from Edsa) in order to detect carrier cattle. All of these samples were collected during November and December 2011 and January 2012. Results: All the ET and OP samples were inoculated on BHK cell culture and baby mice. The obtained results were identified using complement fixation test in addition to real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). In the infected farm at El-Fayoum FMDV type SAT 2 was detected in cattle which are considered as the first introduction of this type while FMDV type O and SAT 2 were detected in the in-contact cattle in the same farm. The sensitivity of rRT-PCR was cleared in the in-contact cattle as 13 out of 20 OP samples were positive to FMDV by rRT-PCR while 11 out of 20 OP samples were positive to FMDV by CFT. The OP samples collected from apparently healthy cattle from Fayoum, Sinoras and Edsa localities in Fayoum governorate demonstrate the circulation of the FMDV type A, O and the recent SAT 2 in carrier cattle which threaten cattle population in Fayoum governorate. Also the sensitivity of real time RT-PCR over the CFT in detection of FMDV carrier cattle was clearly noticed in these localities as 19 out of 30 OP samples were positive by rRT-PCR while in contrast there were only 16 out of 30 samples positive by CFT. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that real-time RT-PCR currently used at the WRL for FMD provides an extremely sensitive and rapid additional procedure for improved laboratory diagnosis of FMD especially in-contact and carrier cases. The rRT-PCR generated results in less than one day from test commencement, in contrast to up to four days to define some positive and all negative samples by combined use of CFT and virus isolation. This is an important feature when definitive diagnostic results are required in a short timescale during emergencies. Also this study demonstrates the current situation of FMDV circulating in EL-Fayoum governorate and the introduction of new SAT 2 serotype beside type A and O.
