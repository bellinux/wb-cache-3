25|$|She {{returns to}} the house in a shaken dreamlike state, {{relieved}} to be alive. She finds a noose and chair arranged in her room, and a strong smell of the sea. With visions of her former lover, Hugo, urging her on, in a post-traumatic state, she adjusts the noose and kicks the chair <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
500|$|As part of {{photographer}} Annie Leibovitz's Disney Dream Portrait Series {{that she}} has been commissioning for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts since 2007, The Walt Disney Company hired American country singer-songwriter Taylor Swift to be featured as the model for Rapunzel. In {{a detailed description of the}} piece, Us Weekly wrote, [...] "The stunning image — captioned 'Where a world of adventure awaits' — shows the 23-year-old Grammy winner perched on the window ledge of a moss-covered stone tower. A pink petticoat peeks <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> purple gown as she stares wistfully into the distance, her long golden tresses flowing regally in the wind." [...] Swift told On The Red Carpet that she was honored.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Voices Carry" [...] was {{directed}} by D.J. Webster, and filmed at Dorchester's Strand Theater, Davio's Restaurant, and W. Brookline St in Boston. The clip incorporates dialogue and acting, and resembles a mini-movie. The plot centers on the band's lead singer, Aimee Mann, who appears as a musician with an abusive boyfriend, played by actor Cully Holland. He mistreats her for playing in a rock band, and demands that she change her look to fit in his upper-class lifestyle. The video uses spoken dialogue in between to interrupt the musical parts, including Mann's boyfriend demanding: [...] "Why can't you for once do something for me?". At the end, the couple attend a concert at Carnegie Hall where the boyfriend is angered to notice part of Mann's rattail sticking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> cap. At her breaking point, Mann lashes out at him, jumping up from her seat in the audience and yelling the lyrics—"He said, shut up! He said, shut up! Oh God, can't you keep it down?..."—as she removes her cap to reveal her spiky, rat-tailed hair, while the boyfriend now hides his face in embarrassment {{and the rest of}} the audience watches in shock.|$|E
50|$|Frieda {{sometimes}} {{leans against}} Schroeder's piano, making Lucy jealous. She {{does not seem}} to be much of an annoyance to him as Lucy, but Schroeder prefers Lucy over her, possibly because Frieda has no knowledge of classical music at all (in Play It Again, Charlie Brown she thought Beethoven was a drink, causing Schroeder to pull the piano <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> both <b>her</b> and Lucy).|$|R
5000|$|Fr. De Marchi {{described}} her {{features in the}} following manner: [...] "She was not a pretty child. The only attractions of her face — which {{was not on the}} whole repellent — were her two great black eyes which gazed <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> thick eyebrows. <b>Her</b> hair, thick and dark, was parted in the center over her shoulders. Her nose was rather flat, her lips thick and her mouth large." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{passed through}} the hall and the small oak parlour, on the table of which stood the three {{tumblers}} and the empty rum-bottle which had served for Sir Pitt's carouse, and through that apartment into Sir Pitt's study, where they found Miss Horrocks, of the guilty ribbons, with a wild air, trying at the presses and escritoires {{with a bunch of}} keys. She dropped them with a scream of terror, as little Mrs. Bute's eyes flashed <b>out</b> at <b>her</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> black calash.|$|R
2500|$|As Raven {{grew into}} a man, he met the uncle's wife where he tried to play with her. [...] He tickled the girl and two birds flew <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> arms, a bluejay and a woodpecker; and the girl died. [...] When the uncle {{returned}} from his hunt, he saw {{that his wife had}} died and he intended to kill Raven again, but this time in rage rather than trickery. [...] But once again, Raven escaped with his canoe carvings. [...] But when Raven escaped this time, he did not return home and his journey began; never to return to his home.|$|E
2500|$|Maryland Senate President Thomas V. [...] "Mike" [...] Miller {{specifically}} {{stated that}} he intended to draw Morella's district <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> after her relatively narrow reelection in 2000. The Democrats controlled both the State Legislature and the Governor's Office in 2000, thus controlling the redistricting for the 2000 Census. Staffers from Senate President Miller, House Speaker Cas Taylor, and Governor Parris Glendening drew new maps to gerrymander out Morella and fellow moderate Republican Bob Ehrlich. One proposal {{went so far as to}} divide her district in two, effectively giving one to State Senator Chris Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular Delegate and Kennedy political family member Mark Shriver.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Dushku {{starred in}} the horror film Wrong Turn and The Kiss, an {{independent}} comedy-drama. Starting that same year, she starred in a new Fox supernatural drama, Tru Calling, where she played the main character, medical student Tru Davies. After having a grant pulled <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her,</b> Tru is forced {{to take a job}} at a local morgue where she discovers her power to [...] "re-live" [...] the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of Buffy The Vampire Slayer which would have been about Faith. She has had many roles as a [...] "bad girl" [...] in movies and relishes the opportunities. In an interview with Maxim in May 2001, Dushku says of her roles, [...] "It's easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't {{have to deal with the}} consequences, because it's only acting." ...|$|E
50|$|Lt. Col. Valentina Vostok of the Soviet Air Force stole an {{experimental}} Russian fighter plane {{in order to}} defect to the United States. The plane malfunctioned en route and she crash-landed {{at the spot where}} the original Doom Patrol had apparently perished and was fused with the negative energy being which formerly inhabited the body of the Patrol's Negative Man. However, instead of being able to send it <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> body <b>under</b> <b>her</b> control, Vostok gained the ability to transform herself into such a being. Years later, it was revealed by Doom Patrol villain the Brain that Niles Caulder, founder of the Doom Patrol, manipulated Valentina's transformation into a superhero {{in order to create a}} replacement for presumed dead Negative Man.|$|R
50|$|Over time, Threnody {{learned a}} great deal more about the man she was indentured to and began {{plotting}} how to get <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> Sinister’s thumb. <b>Her</b> constant monitoring turned up the existence of Nate Grey, fresh from the Age of Apocalypse, and she saw in him a chance to free herself from Sinister. She concealed Nate’s arrival from Sinister and eventually fled to Paris to seek him out. Almost immediately, Sinister unleashed the Marauders to track her down and return her to him. Luckily for Threnody, Nate heard her psychic cries for help and was more than willing to stand against Sinister’s forces on any world. Grey fought off the Marauders on Threnody’s behalf and killed nearly all of them. He implanted a false memory of Threnody’s death {{in the mind of the}} sole surviving Marauder, Riptide in the hope that Sinister would give up his search for her.|$|R
60|$|She had {{got rid of}} {{her tears}} before she came down to dinner, but still she was melancholy and almost lachrymose. This was the last night, and she felt that {{something}} special ought to be said; {{but she did not}} know what she expected, or what it was that she herself wished to say. I think that she was longing for an opportunity to forgive him--only {{that he would not be}} forgiven. If he would have spoken one soft word to her, she would have accepted that one word as an apology; but no such word came. He sat opposite to her at dinner, drinking his wine and feeding his dog; but he was no more gracious to her at this dinner than he had been on any former day. She sat there pretending to eat, speaking a dull word now and then, to which his answer was a monosyllable, looking <b>out</b> at him <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> eyes, through the candlelight, to see whether any feeling was moving him; and then having pretended to eat a couple of strawberries she left him to himself. Still, however, this was not the last. There would come some moment for an embrace--for some cold, half-embrace, in which he would be forced to utter something of a farewell.|$|R
6000|$|But how of Eve's sharp-cut {{nose and}} pointed chin, thin lips, and look of quiet but rather {{surprised}} attention--not specially reverent, but looking keenly <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> eyelids, like a careful servant receiving an order? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at my boots, Mrs. Adams!" [...] she cried, {{thrusting}} them <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> skirt. [...] "These fells {{of yours}} are dreadful places--effroyable--one inch, two inch; never have I seen such mud! My dress, too--voila!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure I have," [...] she said, {{pulling it}} <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> cloak. [...] "I {{have it on}} this little chain which I wear around my neck. I've worn it ever since I got it. And I see you each have kept yours on your watch-guards." ...|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Fenwick {{entered the}} kitchen, Mrs. Brattle {{was sitting there}} alone. Her {{daughter}} was away, disposing of the remnants and utensils of the dinner-table. The old lady, with her spectacles on her nose, was sitting as usual with a stocking over her left arm. On the round table was a great open Bible, and, lying on the Bible, were sundry large worsted hose, which always seemed to Mr. Fenwick as though they must have undarned themselves {{as quickly as they}} were darned. Her Bible and her stockings furnished the whole of Mrs. Brattle's occupation from her dinner to her bed. In the morning, she would still occupy herself in matters of cookery, would peel potatoes, and prepare apples for puddings, and would look into the pot in which the cabbage was being boiled. But her stockings and her Bible shared together the afternoons of her week-days. On the Sundays there would only be the Bible, and then she would pass many hours of the day asleep. On every other Sunday morning she still walked to church and back,--going there always alone. There was no one now to accompany her. Her husband never went,--never had gone,--to church, and her son now had broken away from his good practices. On alternate mornings Fanny went, and also on every Sunday afternoon. Wet or dry, storm or sunshine, she always went; and her father, who was an old Pagan, loved her for her zeal. Mrs. Brattle was a slight-made old woman, with hair almost white peering <b>out</b> modestly <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> clean cap, dressed always in a brown stuff gown that never came down below her ankle. Her features were still pretty, small, and débonnaire, and there was a sweetness in her eyes that no observer could overlook. She was a modest, pure, high-minded woman,--whom we will not call a lady, because of her position in life, and because she darned stockings in a kitchen. In all other respects she deserved the name.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas! dear father,' she answered, 'they {{have gone}} away {{and left me}} all alone.' And {{she told him that}} looking out of her little window she had seen her {{brothers}} flying over the wood in the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers which they had let fall in the yard, and which she had collected. The King mourned, but he did not think that the Queen had done the wicked deed, and as he was afraid the maiden would also be taken from him, he wanted to take her with him. But she was afraid of the stepmother, and begged the King to let her stay just one night more in the castle in the wood. The poor maiden thought, 'My home is no longer here; I will go and seek my brothers.' And when night came she fled away into the forest. She ran all through the night and the next day, till she could go no farther for weariness. Then she saw a little hut, went in, and found a room with six little beds. She was afraid to lie down on one, so she crept under one of them, lay on the hard floor, and was going to spend the night there. But when the sun had set she heard a noise, and saw six swans flying in at the window. They stood on the floor and blew at one another, and blew all their feathers off, and their swan-skin came off like a shirt. Then the maiden recognised her brothers, and overjoyed she crept <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> the bed. <b>Her</b> brothers were not less delighted than she to see their little sister again, but their joy did not last long.|$|R
6000|$|These {{were the}} Professor's talking seasons: most {{commonly}} {{he spoke in}} mere monosyllables, or sat altogether silent and smoked; while the visitor had liberty either {{to say what he}} listed, receiving for answer an occasional grunt; or to look round for a space, and then take himself away. It was a strange apartment; full of books and tattered papers, and miscellaneous shreds of all conceivable substances, [...] "united in a common element of dust." [...] Books lay on tables, and below tables; here fluttered a sheet of manuscript, there a torn handkerchief, or nightcap hastily thrown aside; ink-bottles alternated with bread-crusts, coffee-pots, tobacco-boxes, Periodical Literature, and Blucher Boots. Old Lieschen (Lisekin, 'Liza), who was his bed-maker and stove-lighter, his washer and wringer, cook, errand-maid, and general lion's-provider, and for the rest a very orderly creature, had no sovereign authority in this last citadel of Teufelsdrockh; only some once in the month she half-forcibly made her way thither, with broom and duster, and (Teufelsdrockh hastily saving his manuscripts) effected a partial clearance, a jail-delivery of such lumber as was not Literary. These were her Erdbeben (earthquakes), which Teufelsdrockh dreaded worse than the pestilence; nevertheless, to such length he had been forced to comply. Glad would he have been to sit here philosophizing forever, or till the litter, by accumulation, drove him out of doors: but Lieschen was his right-arm, and spoon, and necessary of life, and would not be flatly gainsayed. We can still remember the ancient woman; so silent that some thought her dumb; deaf also you would often have supposed her; for Teufelsdrockh, and Teufelsdrockh only, would she serve or give heed to; and with him she seemed to communicate chiefly by signs; if it were not rather by some secret divination that she guessed all his wants, and supplied them. Assiduous old dame! she scoured, and sorted, and swept, in her kitchen, with the least possible violence to the ear; yet all was tight and right there: hot and black came the coffee ever at the due moment; and the speechless Lieschen herself looked <b>out</b> on you, <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> clean white coif with its lappets, through her clean withered face and wrinkles, with a look of helpful intelligence, almost of benevolence.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Verloc’s mind {{got hold}} of that {{declaration}} with morbid tenacity. The man who had taken Stevie <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> very eyes to murder him in a locality whose name was at the moment not present to her memory would not allow her go out. Of course he wouldn’t.|$|E
60|$|Her {{small white}} fingers came hesitatingly <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> cloak. I {{did not stop}} to think to what my action might commit me, whether indeed it was seemly that I should accept any measure of {{friendship}} from this woman. I {{took her hand and}} held it for a moment in mine.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{could be}} more satisfactory. You can imagine how quickly I grasped at so simple a solution. In ten minutes she was before us, a most stately dame, with her grey curls peeping <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> mantilla. Her face was as yellow as though it {{reflected}} the countless doubloons of her treasury.|$|E

60|$|Miriam put <b>her</b> feet <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> dress. Her boots {{had that}} queer, irresolute, rather pathetic look about them, which showed how {{self-conscious}} and self-mistrustful she was. And they {{were covered with}} mud.|$|R
6000|$|She drew it <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> loose cloak. [...] "Here it is, gentle sir. Indeed {{it went to}} {{my heart}} to take it, for you had mercy upon me in my trouble. But now I am, as you see, in real and very sore distress. Will you not have mercy now? Take ruth on us, fair sir! On my knees I beg it of you, most gentle and kindly Squire!" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the scarlet}} and gold net {{confining}} her sable locks, her ponderous earrings, her massive chains and bracelets, and gorgeous silk, {{she was a}} splendid ornament {{at the head of}} the table; but she looked sleepily <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> black-fringed eyelids, turned over the carving as a matter of course to Owen, and evidently regarded the two young ladies as bound to take all trouble off her hands in talking, arranging, or settling what she should do with herself or her carriage.|$|E

[...] All these {{energetic}} exclamations were elicited by {{the delight of}} the mother in finding that her son was strong enough and mischievous enough to pull all her hair <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> cap. [...] "He's been and pulled down all Mamma's hair, and he's the naughtiest, naughtiest, naughtiest little man that ever, ever, ever, ever, ever--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She is shy!" [...] {{said one}} of the ladies to the other; and they let her alone a little, and began to talk to Mr. Wardour about the journey, and various other things, to which Kate did not greatly listen. She began to let her eyes come <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> hat brim, and {{satisfied}} herself that the aunts certainly did not wear either turbans or birds of paradise, but looked quite as like other people as she felt herself, in spite of her title.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'll {{lie down}} {{again for a}} little while," [...] said Lizzie. [...] "I feel so sick I hardly know what to do. If I were to lie down for a little I should be better." [...] With much {{difficulty}} she got them to leave her. Then, before she again undressed herself, she bolted the door that still had a bolt, and turned the lock in the other. Having done this, she took <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> pillow the little parcel which had been in her desk,--and, untying it, perceived that her dear diamond necklace was perfect, and quite safe.|$|E
6000|$|At {{last she}} rose, and {{standing}} above him, parted the yellow locks from off his brow, and looked long and lovingly into his face. There {{was nothing to}} be spoken, for there {{was nothing to be}} concealed between these two souls as clear as glass. Each knew all which the other meant; each knew that its own thoughts were known. At last the mutual gaze was over; she stooped and kissed him on the brow, and was in the act to turn away, as a tear dropped on his forehead. Her little bare feet were peeping <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>her</b> dress. He bent down and kissed them again and again; and then looking up, as if to excuse himself,-- ...|$|E
