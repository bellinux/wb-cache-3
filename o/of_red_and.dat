5|$|Sunderland {{played in}} an all blue strip from their {{formation}} until 1884, when they adopted {{a red and}} white halved strip. They assumed the current strip <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> white stripes in the 1887–88 season. Their badge included a ship, {{the upper part of}} the Sunderland coat of arms, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's red and white stripes. In 1977 the badge was changed, but still included the ship, football and the background <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> white stripes.|$|E

5|$|The {{colors of}} Hygrocybe {{mushrooms}} originate from betalains, a class <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> yellow indole-derived pigments.

5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open {{east side of the}} courtyard, the design is nearly identical in design to the original school, built <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can {{be represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors may be perceived by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> green light).|$|E

A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} games, the player character receives his first Pokémon, a choice between Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, from the region's local Pokémon scientist Professor Elm and then begins his journey to win the eight Gym Badges of the Johto region and then challenge the Elite Four and Champion to become the region's new Pokémon Master. Opposing him is his mysterious rival, a boy who stole {{one of the other}} Pokémon from Professor Elm and regularly challenges the player to test his strengths. The player also encounters the villainous Team Rocket, having reunited to seek out their previous leader Giovanni to return the group to their former glory. After the player defeats Team Rocket once and for all and defeats the Elite Four and Champion of the Pokémon League on Indigo Plateau, the player can then travel to the Kanto region from the previous games and challenge the Gym Leaders there, discovering how much has changed in the three years following the events <b>of</b> <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> Blue. After defeating the Kanto region's Gym Leaders, the player is allowed to enter the treacherous Mt. Silver area, home to very powerful Pokémon, and deep within Mt. Silver's caves is Red, the protagonist <b>of</b> <b>Red</b> <b>and</b> Blue, who the player can challenge for the most difficult battle in the game.|$|E
5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was {{the subject}} of several {{anonymous}} sketches, including two 1896 vignettes, published in Adevărul, and a 1917 drawing signed Correggio. He is also depicted in an affectionate cartoon published in 1914 by Petrescu Găină. Domnica Bogdan herself sat as a model for various artists, and was notably depicted in works by Camil Ressu, Pallady and the Bulgarian-born painter Pascin. In 1920, Bogdan-Pitești commissioned Paciurea to complete a portrait bust of Domnica. The same year, Dimitrescu painted her an oil-on-cardboard portrait in dominant shades of brown (with touches <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> gray). Artists who illustrated works by Bogdan-Pitești include, in addition to himself, George Demetrescu Mirea, Ion Georgescu and Satmari.|$|E

50|$|The Redding Area Bus Authority is the {{operator}} {{of public transportation}} in Shasta County, California. Ten local routes serve the city <b>of</b> <b>Redding</b> <b>and</b> its suburban regions, with over 650,000 riders taking advantage of public transportation each year. Buses operate 6 days per week and stops are located at approximately quarter mile intervals. An eleventh route, the Burney Express, serves as a limited-stop weekday commuter line, operating twice per day in each direction. The agency was formed in 1981, and as the population <b>of</b> <b>Redding</b> exploded in the 1990s, service was greatly expanded. The service {{is administered by the}} City <b>of</b> <b>Redding</b> <b>and</b> operated by Transdev.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular health, magic, and experience chests that are found throughout the game world, there are three Uber Chests to be found. Two of these chests provide an additional increment to the Health and Magic Meters, respectively, and the third chest contains an abundance <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> gold orbs. Several urns are also hidden in the game (e.g., the Urn of Gaia) which, {{upon completion of the}} challenge mode, unlocks special abilities (e.g., unlimited magic) for use during bonus play.|$|E
5|$|In {{the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), a banner of the Commonwealth was also used, {{combining}} the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with {{the arms of the}} Commonwealth which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white (Argent) charges in a red (Gules) field, these two colors started to be used for the entire banner. During the 17th century, the banner was usually divided into two, three or four horizontal, often swallow-tailed, stripes <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> white.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{ships of}} Mussolini's navy {{retained}} its pre-war scheme of light gray overall for its smaller ships, but the larger units mostly had dazzle camouflage of dark gray, light sea blue, light sea green and light gray.

5|$|Other {{examples}} of flags {{that could be}} confused with the Polish one include the civil flags of the following regions: Cantabria, Spain; Kranj, Slovenia; Thuringia, Germany; Upper Austria and Tyrol, Austria; as well the city of Honda, Colombia. Furthermore, the Dutch city of Maastricht used a similar design between 1938–1994 but reinstitated its old flag to avoid confusion. There are currently two independent states – Indonesia and Monaco – whose national flags are horizontal bicolors <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> white, reversing the Polish flag. The Monaco and Indonesia flags differ in proportions and shades of the colors (see Flag of Indonesia and Flag of Monaco).|$|E
5|$|Plumbe {{designed}} the estate with five classes of houses. Although {{the houses were}} built to the same five basic designs, each street was given a distinct style of design and ornamentation. Varying mixes <b>of</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> yellow bricks, and variations in window design and ornamental motifs, were used to give each street a distinct identity. All were designed with front and back gardens. Corner houses were given distinctive designs and turrets.|$|E
