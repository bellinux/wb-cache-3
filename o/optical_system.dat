5|$|To {{deal with}} embrittlement, the entire target chamber was {{designed}} to be easily rolled out of the center of the building on rails to the maintenance building where it could be rebuilt. The chamber was expected to last four years, and be replaced in one month. The <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> is decoupled from the chamber, which isolates it from vibrations during operation and means that the beamlines themselves {{do not have to be}} realigned after chamber replacement.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} {{the launch of the}} telescope, the {{returned}} images indicated a serious problem with the <b>optical</b> <b>system.</b> Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, various optical {{systems were}} tested. Kohler {{generators}} were installed in 1949 {{along with the}} stationary electric light system. A new rotating light system (EMV-3) was installed in 1963, making the lighthouse fully automated. It was in use until 1982, when an experimental EMV-930M system (made in Ukraine) was installed. The rotation mechanism of the <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> is a novel solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead. The optics brought a six to eight hundredfold increase to {{the efficiency of the}} light radiated by a 1kW quartz lamp. The same light system is still in use.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

30|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{employed}} markers, HMC systems are classified in two groups: nonoptical (inertial, magnetic, and mechanic) or <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> (active and passive). <b>Optical</b> <b>systems</b> based on photogrammetric methods are more used than the nonoptical ones, usually requiring special suits embedding rigid skeletal-like structures [4], magnetic [5] or accelerometric devices [6] or multisensor fusion algorithms [7]. Instead, image-based or <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> allow a relative freedom of movement and are less intrusive. A common issue of all <b>optical</b> and nonoptical <b>systems</b> is {{the fact that they are}} usually expensive and require a dedicated hardware. The most usual involve IR retro-reflective markers that reflect back light, that is, generated near the cameras lens [8]. Other <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> triangulate positions by using active markers that emits a pulse modulated signal.

25|$|With the {{development}} of the steady illumination of the Argand lamp, the application of optical lenses to increase and focus the light intensity became a practical possibility. William Hutchinson developed the first practical <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> in 1763, known as a catoptric system. This rudimentary system effectively collimated the emitted light into a concentrated beam, thereby greatly increasing the light's visibility. The ability to focus the light led to the first revolving lighthouse beams, where the light would appear to the mariners as a series of intermittent flashes. It also became possible to transmit complex signals using the light flashes.|$|E
