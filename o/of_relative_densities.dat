More accurate estimates of all nine elastic constants are obtained by modifying the analysis of Gibson and Ashby (1997) to account for the nodes at the intersection of the vertical and inclined members. The effect of the nodes becomes significant at high relative densities. We then compare the new analytical equations with previous analytical models, with a numerical analysis based on a computational homogenization technique and with data for rubber honeycombs {{over a wide range}} <b>of</b> <b>relative</b> <b>densities</b> and cell geometries.
