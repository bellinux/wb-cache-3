The analysis presented makes the relation between <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> and word order explicit in that it shows that a preceding conjoined NP has already been assigned a plural value when the agreeing verb is parsed.

The aim {{of the current study}} was to review the literature and discuss the optimal management of T 1 and T 2 glottic carcinoma. Literature review indicated that the local control, laryngeal preservation, and survival rates of patients were similar after transoral laser resection and <b>open</b> <b>partial</b> laryngectomy. Voice quality depended on the extent of resection for patients undergoing surgery; results for patients undergoing laser resection for limited lesions showed better Voice Handicap Index scores, whereas <b>open</b> <b>partial</b> laryngectomy yielded poorer results. The cost of treatment was more for <b>open</b> <b>partial</b> laryngectomy. Patients with well defined lesions suitable for transoral laser excision with a good functional outcome were treated with laser. <b>Open</b> <b>partial</b> laryngectomy was reserved for patients with locally recurrent tumors.

40|$|When {{an outcome}} is rated by several raters, {{ensuring}} consistency across raters increases {{the reliability of}} the measurement. Tanner and Young (1985) proposed a general class of log-linear models to assess agreement among K raters and a rating scale with C nominal categories. Their methodology can be used to assess pair-wise agreement among three or more raters. Rogel et al. (1996, 1998) extended this work by assessing various patterns of agreement among rater sub-groups of size K- 1. These models can be used to test the assumption of rater exchangeability. Although parameters from these models can be used to identify atypical raters, no formal inferential procedures are available. I propose a formal inferential approach {{that can be used to}} test the assumption of rater exchangeability and to identify an atypical rater. The global and heterogeneous <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> model is fit to the data and pair-wise comparisons of the K <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> parameters are made, adjusting the p-values for the multiple comparisons made. The heterogeneous <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> parameter that is constantly involved in the pair-wise comparisons that are statistically significant is distinguished. The premise is that, if there is an atypical rater, at least one heterogeneous <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> parameter will differ from at least one of the remaining K- 1 <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> parameters. The approach is illustrated using published data from an intestinal biopsy rating study with six raters (Rogel et al., 1998). Overall Type I error and the power of the inferential approach to correctly identify atypical raters are assessed via simulation with rater sub-groups of size 5. The Bonferroni, Sidak, and Holm's Step-down procedures using the Bonferroni and Sidak adjustments are used to control the overall Type I error. Being able to correctly identify an atypical rater, if present, and improving the consistency of ratings directly, influence {{the reliability of the}} measurement and the power of the study for a given sample size. Consequently, more informative studies can be conducted of interventions (e. g., behavioral, medicinal) that may have a significant positive impact on the public's health...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Advances in transoral laser microsurgery, {{radiotherapy}} {{and chemotherapy}} (and their combinations) {{have reduced the}} indications for <b>open</b> <b>partial</b> laryngectomies, though they have replaced total laryngectomies in selected advanced or recurrent laryngeal carcinomas (LSCC).

Materials and Methods Fifty consecutive patients who had undergone <b>open</b> <b>partial</b> laryngectomy (supraglottic and supracricoid laryngectomies) were investigated, measuring the immunohistochemical expression of the hypoxia-inducible proteins angiogenin and endoglin in their primary LSCCs, also with image analysis.

40|$|We model a {{situation}} in which two players bargain over two issues (pies), one of which can only be resolved at a future date. We find that if the players value the issues asymmetrically (one player considers the existing issue more important than the future one, while the other player has the opposite valuation) then they may delay agreement on the first issue until the second one is finally on the table. If we allow for <b>partial</b> <b>agreements,</b> then the players never leave an issue completely unresolved. They either make a <b>partial</b> <b>agreement</b> on the first issue, and wait for the second one to emerge before completing the agreement; or they come to complete agreements on each of the issues at their earliest possible dates.
