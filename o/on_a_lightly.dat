500|$|The {{design of}} the Lexington-class battlecruisers was {{approved}} on 30 June 1916 and six were planned {{as part of the}} massive 1916 building program, but their construction was repeatedly postponed in favor of escort ships and anti-submarine vessels. The original design mounted ten [...] and sixteen [...] guns <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> armored hull with a maximum speed of [...] The General Board regarded the design's firepower as inadequate and took the opportunity offered by the postponement to order a redesign to improve the ships' armament to include eight [...] and sixteen [...] guns. After the Americans entered World War I in April 1917, the Royal Navy furnished more information from its analyses of the Battle of Jutland, in which three British battlecruisers were destroyed by magazine explosions, and provided detailed information on the heavily armored {{design of the}} s then under construction. The General Board then re-evaluated the design and greatly increased the armor protection, at the cost of reducing the maximum speed to [...] Anti-torpedo bulges, additional torpedo bulkheads and a general increase in armor thicknesses increased the design's beam by [...] and increased its displacement by over [...]|$|E
2500|$|To {{improve the}} {{mobility}} of the Nebelwerfer units, a ten-tube [...] launcher was mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> armored Sd.Kfz. 4 [...] "Maultier" [...] half-track chassis as the 15cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Selbstfahrlafette Sd.Kfz. 4/1 (based on the Opel [...] "Maultier", or [...] "Mule", half-track). Three hundred of these were produced, split evenly between launchers and ammunition carriers (which were identical except for the launcher). These were superseded in production by the 15cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Schwerer Wehrmachtsschlepper (Panzerwerfer auf SWS), which had improved cross-country mobility and had greater ammunition storage than the [...] "Maultier". The exact number built of the latter weapon is unknown, but evidence suggests that fewer than 100 were completed {{before the end of}} the war.|$|E
50|$|It {{is served}} by a station <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> built branchline of the {{national}} railway system. In 2009, this branchline is to be upgraded. Koru is located between the stations of Muhoroni and Fort Ternan.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{than being}} mounted <b>on</b> <b>an</b> amphibious but <b>lightly</b> {{armoured}} BRDM chassis like the 9K31, the 9K35 is mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more mobile tracked, modified MT-LB, with {{more room for}} equipment and missile reloads. Provision for amphibious capability is provided in some variants {{in the form of}} polyurethane-filled floats.|$|R
5000|$|For tile that {{requires}} a straight cut a tile cutter is used. This is a small mechanical device where the tile is placed, aligned and clamped <b>on</b> <b>a</b> platform; <b>lightly</b> [...] "scored" [...] with a cutting wheel and snapped in two with a handled slicer (blade similar to a paper cutter in appearance).For larger jobs an electric tile saw or wet saw is used; this saw {{is similar to a}} small mitre saw except that water is distributed on the saw blade to lessen the effects of heat and friction.|$|R
5000|$|The Panhard AML (Auto Mitrailleuse Légère, or [...] "Light Armoured Car") is a fast, long-ranged, and {{relatively}} cheap first-generation armoured car with excellent reconnaissance capability. Designed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small, <b>lightly</b> armoured 4X4 chassis, it weighs an estimated 5.5 tonnes - much lighter than a tank - {{and is therefore}} more suited to rapid airborne deployments. Since 1959 AMLs have been marketed on up to five continents; several variants remained in continuous production for half a century. These have been operated by fifty-four national governments and other entities worldwide, seeing regular combat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1889 by A.W. Swallows. [...] The {{laminated}} arch construction is unusual for 19th-century bridges in Vermont, but is well suited for use on a short crossing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> traveled road.|$|E
50|$|The gopchang {{is first}} marinated in the {{seasonings}} and spices, then grilled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> greased pan or griddle. Onions and bell peppers are often grilled together with gopchang. Grilled gopchang is often eaten dipped in salt and sesame oil.|$|E
5000|$|Galbi is grilled, {{typically}} by the diners themselves, on grills {{set in the}} tables. The meat cooks for a {{short time}} on medium high heat <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> greased gridiron over glowing charcoal. The remaining marinade is brushed on during grilling to produce a glazed finish.|$|E

50|$|However, <b>a</b> {{little further}} <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> small, <b>lightly</b> defended Nepalese stockade was seen, which the British {{grenadiers}} in Ludlow’s force, having found easy victories earlier that day, entreated {{to be allowed}} to attack in order to avenge the humiliation they had suffered at Nalapani. This was a questionable move as it meant abandoning the original battle plan. Ludlow saw, indeed, that the stockade itself was of no great strength, and he thought it might be carried by a coup-de-main before the Nepalese should have time to reinforce its garrison. The occurrences at Nalapani ought to have suggested greater caution.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of his arrest, Knight claimed that there was only one {{instance}} during his 27 years of solitude in which he spoke with another human: {{at some point in the}} 1990s, he exchanged the word [...] "Hi," [...] with a hiker whom he encountered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> traveled path.|$|E
50|$|The {{architect}} of the station was Sophus Frederik Kühnel who {{was interested in the}} Italian Renaissance architecture and National romantic architecture which was starting at this time. These inspirations {{have played a role in}} the design of the building; constructed of red bricks <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> curved base of ashlar. The architectural inspirations is especially visible in the pointed gables, pointy-arched windows, bay windows and the pompous expression of the tower.The building also has characteristic green garages.|$|E
5000|$|Overnight {{and even}} 24x6-hour {{turnaround}} times were not uncommon. During peak times, {{it was common}} {{to stand in line}} waiting to submit a deck. However, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> used system, it was possible to make alterations and rerun a program in less than an hour. Dedicated programmers might stay up well past midnight to get a few quick turnarounds. Use of this expensive equipment was often charged to a user's account. A mainframe computer could cost millions of dollars and usage was measured in seconds per job.|$|E
5000|$|Meadvale is [...] {{with the}} 'town centre' of Reigate and Linkfield or Linkfield Street which is mostly part of Redhill {{and the only}} other suburb shared between the two post towns. Meadvale has the Greensand Way, a path cutting through its centre <b>on</b> <b>a</b> low, <b>lightly</b> wooded stretch of the Greensand Ridge. The ridge spans most of Kent and all of Surrey and is quite steep, e.g. {{reaching}} Leith Hill, and (until the 19th century) traditionally having no villages on its crest, it is relatively densely and using many listed buildings built upon at St John's, Redhill directly east of the suburb.|$|R
50|$|The Kingsbury Covered Bridge {{is located}} in southernmost Randolph, just west of Vermont Route 14 <b>on</b> Kingsbury Road, <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> {{traveled}} local road. It is a single-span multiple kingpost truss bridge, with trusses 51 ft long resting on stone abutments. The bridge is 18 ft wide, with a roadway width of 15.5 ft (one lane). Its exterior is sheathed in vertical board siding, and it is covered by a metal roof. There are no windows in the side walls, and the portal ends and interiors are also covered in vertical boards.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{platforms}} at {{the station}} today, although from 1964 until 1990 only a single line and platform (the current southbound one) was used. The 30 mi long block section between Craven Arms and Llandrindod Wells {{was considered to be}} a capacity bottleneck (even <b>on</b> such <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> used line) however and following the modernisation of the route signalling in 1986, an additional passing loop was installed here to provide extra capacity, with the disused second platform being refurbished and returned to use by British Rail. The northbound loop (and platform) was out of action {{for more than two years}} but was put back into use by Network Rail in September 2010 following the replacement of the old automatic points (which were obsolete) with new electrically-worked ones.|$|R
50|$|The meat {{traditionally}} used is {{thinly sliced}} rib-eye or top round, although other cuts of beef are also used. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> oiled griddle at medium temperature, the steak slices are quickly browned and then scrambled into smaller pieces {{with a flat}} spatula. Slices of cheese are then placed over the meat, letting it melt, and then the roll is placed {{on top of the}} cheese. The mixture is then scooped up with a spatula and pressed into the roll, which is then cut in half.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the other}} {{well-known}} roads, the entire stretch is full with food hawkers and street vendors. There are vendors with little kerosene stoves making egg toasts—an omelette <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> toasted sliced bread and serving {{them with a}} cup of tea. Then there are little food stalls selling rolls - chicken roll, egg-chicken rolls etc. The ones in front of Jadavpur market are specially good! Then there is roti served with ghugny and aloor dom, shingara (Bengali breakfast samosas), muglai paratha (crispy bread stuffed with mince and fried), chow mein, chilli chicken, biryani, sweetmeats and, of course, chai (tea).|$|E
50|$|Many newer medium calibre APDS cores use a {{frangible}} {{high density}} alloy, the resulting projectiles are called Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot (FAPDS) for APDS types, or FRAP (Frangible Armour Piercing) for full-calibre projectiles. During penetration, a frangible projectile's core fragments into many high-velocity pieces. The {{effect of a}} frangible projectile <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> armoured target {{is much the same}} as a high explosive incendiary round, but with a cloud of dense, high-velocity fragments penetrating deeper into the target's interior. Upon striking heavy armour the effect of FAPDS is more akin to a standard APDS, albeit with higher fragmentation of the core, and hence lethality if the armour is perforated.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of men at pistol target range, ca. 1930. Two men in darkly colored {{suits and}} hats aim handguns at a {{target in the}} center while a man to their right sits <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stool taking notes. The targets are dark circles <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{rectangular}} <b>lightly</b> colored background that are visible lined up in the distance. Above the circular targets stand human shaped pictures {{that could be used}} to add difficulty. In the foreground, a man with a large stomach slumps over to clean his gun <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small staircase below the firing range. To the left <b>a</b> man leans <b>on</b> his knee with his right arm as he looks at what appears to be the results of his target practice...|$|R
5000|$|These {{machines}} {{were not a}} great success because they lacked flexibility. Most could haul a single trailer, but no more. This meant {{they were unable to}} cope with greater than expected passenger demands - a classic example being busy market days <b>on</b> <b>an</b> otherwise <b>lightly</b> used rural branch line. They were also unable to haul goods wagons, requiring a conventional locomotive to be stationed on the same line in any case for these duties. For this reason, they were largely superseded by push-pull trains and the GWR converted some of their railmotors into autocoaches for this purpose. The South Eastern & Chatham Railway built its P Class of small, light tank locomotives specifically to replace railmotors in the 1900s.|$|R
500|$|The cubical {{structure}} is clad in unrelieved ashlar Indiana limestone <b>on</b> <b>a</b> high, <b>lightly</b> rusticated base, and is {{topped with a}} low pyramidal roof that sheathes its interior dome. It stands <b>on</b> <b>a</b> raised terrace approached by a wide monumental staircase. The structure has four identical faces. <b>On</b> each face <b>an</b> Ionic screen of six columns, behind which are tall banks of windows, and is surmounted by symbolic standing figures designed by Henry Hering: Courage, Memory, Peace, Victory, Liberty, and Patriotism. The sculptures are repeated on each façade. On the south side, standing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pink granite base {{in the center of}} the grand access stairs, is Hering's colossal exultant male nude bronze Pro Patria (1929); it is [...] high, weighs seven tons, and was the largest cast bronze sculpture in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Since chain wear is {{strongly}} aggravated by dirt {{getting into the}} links, the lifetime of a chain depends mostly on how well it is cleaned (and lubricated) and {{does not depend on}} the mechanical load. Therefore, well-groomed chains of heavily used racing bicycles will often last longer than a chain <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> used city bike that's cleaned less. Depending on use and cleaning, a chain can last only 1000 km (e.g. in cross-country use, or all-weather use), 3000 to 5000 km for well-maintained derailleur chains, or more than 6000 km for perfectly groomed high-quality chains, single-gear, or hub-gear chains (preferably with a full cover chain guard).|$|E
5000|$|Red Wilson Field is the {{official}} home of the Sinker Burger, the Hurler Burger, and the Boston Screamer. Introduced during the 2004 season, the Sinker is a hamburger served <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> toasted cake doughnut, with three varieties: inside, down-the-middle, and outside (cinnamon, powder, and plain). The Hurler, also introduced in 2004, is a hamburger patty served between the halves of a jelly doughnut, finished with a squirt of canned cheese. The Boston Screamer, which made its official debut in 2010, is a hamburger served on a Boston cream doughnut. On July 19, 2011, the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox served their 6000th [...] "upgraded" [...] hamburger.|$|E
50|$|Some claim thatch cannot {{cope with}} regular {{snowfall}} but, {{as with all}} roofing materials, this depends {{on the strength of}} the underlying roof structure and the pitch of the surface. A law passed in 1640 in Massachusetts outlawed the use of thatched roofs in the colony for this reason. Thatch is lighter than most other roofing materials, typically around 7 lb per square foot, so the roof supporting it {{does not need to be}} so heavily constructed, but if snow accumulates <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> constructed thatched roof, it could collapse. A thatched roof is usually pitched between 45-55 degrees and under normal circumstances this is sufficient to shed snow and water. In areas of extreme snowfall, such as parts of Japan, the pitch is increased further.|$|E
50|$|Few film movie cameras {{have been}} made that {{make use of the}} {{pellicle}} mirror. Probably the earliest is the Pathé WEBO M, m for membrane, of 1946. With that camera light is reflexed sideways into a primary plano-convex finder lens, the plane side being partially or fully matted. Another french amateur movie camera with a pellicle is the Christen Reflex for Double-Eight film. It was made from 1960 <b>on</b> and provides <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> slanted deflection. Later, in 1967, the professional Mitchell NCR and BNCR cameras were equipped with a pellicle-based finder. In the Soviet Union in 1970 appeared the Kiev 16 Alpha, also featuring a pellicle mirror finder system that deflects strictly vertically.|$|R
50|$|The {{sandwich}} {{is built}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> base of <b>lightly</b> buttered Cuban bread and contains sliced roast pork, thinly sliced Serrano ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard. In Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered {{in with the}} other meats, probably due to influence of Italian immigrants who lived side-by-side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. Tomatoes and lettuce are available additions in many restaurants, but these are considered by traditionalists as an unacceptable Americanization of the sandwich.|$|R
50|$|The Class 122s {{were built}} mainly {{for use on}} the London Midland Region of British Rail, {{although}} some were also used in Scotland. They were used <b>on</b> <b>a</b> variety of <b>lightly</b> used lines, {{many of which were}} closed during the Beeching Axe in the 1960s. Routes served included the Stourbridge Town and St Albans Abbey branch lines, as well as local services between Dundee and Arbroath. (The similar Pressed Steel Company built Class 121 single units were used on the Western Region).|$|R

50|$|After {{his father}} died in 1955, Bob Lee joined the Marines, forging a {{successful}} career as a Marine Sniper. Bob Lee served three tours in Vietnam, working with Special Operations, and earned the nickname 'Bob the Nailer' for his uncanny ability with a rifle. Despite official counts crediting him with 87 combat kills, in reality he has killed a total of 391 men, with his most notable success being an engagement when a battalion of the North Vietnamese Army were closing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> defended Special Forces Base. Bob Lee and his spotter, Lance Corporal Donny Fenn, succeeded in delaying the battalion for two days until air support could arrive, and during the engagement Bob Lee killed in excess of 80 enemy troops, only stopping when his ammunition ran out.|$|E
40|$|For {{polyethylene}} {{the temperature}} dependence of thermal conductivity decreases below a temperature T* — {{in this case}} 1 K — from T 2 to T. We now present experimental results <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> modified form of polyethylene for which T* is raised to between 3 K and 9 K. There {{appears to be a}} correlation between T* and the microcrystalline structure and we speculate that for semicrystalline polymers in this temperature range structure scattering is more important than 2 -level tunnelling...|$|E
50|$|Plans {{were drawn}} {{up in the}} mid-2000s to {{alleviate}} the problems for both companies {{through the construction of}} a new underground line, primarily under the north-south thoroughfare Naniwa-suji (hence the name), branching at its south end to connect both the Yamatoji Line (Kansai Main Line) terminal at JR Namba, and a Nankai line, with Shin-Osaka via a new underground route through what was then the Umeda Freight Terminal. The Umeda portion of this plan was eventually incorporated into Phase II of the Osaka Higashi Line, with provisions in place for eventual construction of the Naniwasuji Line itself. Early plans for Nankai called for moving the Shiomibashi Line (the northern end of the Kōya Line) underground and connecting to the Naniwasuji Line via Shiomibashi Station (thus upgrading and increasing traffic <b>on</b> <b>an</b> otherwise <b>lightly</b> traveled, local route), but the company ultimately rejected this routing in favor of one via a new underground station at Namba.|$|R
