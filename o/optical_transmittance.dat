2500|$|Defect-free NaCl {{crystals}} have an <b>optical</b> <b>transmittance</b> {{of about}} 90% for infrared light, specifically between 200nbsp&nm and 20nbsp&µm. They were therefore used in optical components (windows and prisms) operating in that spectral range, where few non-absorbing alternatives exist and where requirements for absence of microscopic inhomogeneities are less strict {{than in the}} visible range. While inexpensive, NaCl crystals are soft and hygroscopic – when exposed to the ambient air, they gradually cover with [...] "frost". This limits application of NaCl to dry environments, vacuum sealed assembly areas or for short-term uses such as prototyping. Nowadays materials like zinc selenide (ZnSe), which are stronger mechanically and are less sensitive to moisture, are used instead of NaCl for the infrared spectral range.|$|E

In 1992, Gaudiana et al. reported {{a series of}} polymethylacrylate compounds containing lateral brominated and iodinated carbazole rings. They had refractive indices of 1.67-1.77 depending on the components and numbers of the halogen substituents. However, recent applications of halogen elements in microelectronics have been severely limited by the WEEE directive and RoHS legislation adopted by the European Union to reduce potential pollution of the environment.Phosphorus-containing groups, such as phosphonates and phosphazenes, often exhibit high molar refractivity and <b>optical</b> <b>transmittance</b> in the visible light region. Polyphosphonates have high refractive indices due to the phosphorus moiety {{even if they have}} chemical structures analogous to polycarbonates. Shaver et al. reported a series of polyphosphonates with varying backbones, reaching the highest refractive index reported for polyphosphonates at 1.66. In addition, polyphosphonates exhibit good thermal stability and optical transparency; they are also suitable for casting into plastic lenses.|$|E
50|$|An ideal beam-splitter transmits and {{reflects}} 50% {{of the incident}} radiation. However, as any material has a limited range of <b>optical</b> <b>transmittance,</b> several beam-splitters may be used interchangeably to cover a wide spectral range. For the mid-IR region the beamsplitter is usually made of KBr with a germanium-based coating that makes it semi-reflective. KBr absorbs strongly at wavelengths beyond 25 μm (400 cm−1) so CsI is sometimes used to extend the range to about 50 μm (200 cm−1). ZnSe is an alternative where moisture vapor {{can be a problem}} but is limited to about 20μm (500 cm−1). CaF2 is the usual material for the near-IR, being both harder and less sensitive to moisture than KBr but cannot be used beyond about 8 μm (1200 cm−1). In a simple Michelson interferometer one beam passes twice through the beamsplitter but the other passes through only once. To correct for this an additional compensator plate of equal thickness is incorporated. Far-IR beamsplitters are mostly based on polymer films and cover a limited wavelength range.|$|E

The {{effects of the}} processing conditions on the structure, optical and electrical properties of the AZO-rGO films, {{as well as the}} AZO thin films for comparison, were investigated by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TEM and SEM, UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, and with the four-point prober and Hall effect measurements. Al 3 + ions and rGO sheets existed in the composite films, and both of more Al 3 + amount and more rGO could result in worse crystallinity of ZnO. More amount of rGO led to more rGO fiakers existed in the surface of the AZO-rGO films. Increasing Al-doping amount could not obviously affect the <b>optical</b> <b>transmittances</b> of the AZO-rGO films, but lead to the UV absorption edge of the films slightly blue-shifted. <b>Optical</b> <b>transmittances</b> of the AZO-rGO films decreased obviously with increasing the rGO ratio, but slightly decreased with increasing the annealing time. The minimum sheet resistance R-square could be obtained when Al-doping amount was similar to 2 mol% and rGO similar to 0. 25 g/L: 50. 1 k Omega/square for the AZO film and 15. 2 k Omega/square El for the AZO-rGO film. Addition of rGO could improve the electric conductivity of AZO films. Longer time of vacuum-annealing could also improve the electric conductivity of the AZO-rGO films. For the AZO-rGO film doped with 2 mol% Al 3 + and 10 mg rGO after vacuum-annealing for 12 h, Hall mobility was similar to 17. 7 cm(2) /Vs and the carrier concentration was similar to 10. 6 x 10 (19) /cm(3).

A prediction accuracy of R 2 (correlation coefficient of determination) of 0. 85 with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1. 52 % for intact, whole tubers and R 2 = 0. 95 and RMSEP= 0. 50 % for sliced tubers was achieved. We conclude that short-wavelength near-infrared technology using a partial <b>transmittance</b> <b>optical</b> sampling geometry can be a useful tool for rapid assessment of tuber dry matter concentration prior to processing...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of <b>optical</b> reflectance, <b>transmittance,</b> and {{electrical}} resistivity on the switchable mirror systems YHx and YDx {{show that the}} absorption of hydrogen induces the same variations as that of deuterium. In both cases there is a weak transparency window for the metallic dihydride (dideuteride) phase and a yellowish transparency in the insulating trihydride (trideuteride) phase. The slightly higher electrical resistivity of the deuterides {{is related to the}} lower energy of their optical phonons. The absence of significant isotope effects in the optical properties of YHx(YDx) is at variance with Peierls-like theoretical models. It is, however, compatible with strong electron correlation model...|$|R
