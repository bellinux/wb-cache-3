5|$|In February 1897, the New York Times prematurely {{reported}} {{his death}} in a New York mental asylum.

5|$|In {{philosophy}} of mind, Putnam {{is known for}} his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental,</b> and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem.

5|$|In this {{conception}} of mind no strict distinction is {{made between the}} conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the five senses and sixth for perception of mental phenomena. The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (manovijñāna) and attention (āvartana), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.|$|E
5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental.</b> Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E

5|$|The reformers were {{especially}} active at the Byberry Hospital in Philadelphia where four Friends initiated The Attendant magazine {{as a way}} to communicate ideas and promote reform.

Another effort of CPS, Mental Hygiene Project became the National Mental Health Foundation. Initially skeptical about the value of Civilian Public Service, Eleanor Roosevelt, impressed by the changes introduced by COs in the mental health system, became a sponsor of the National Mental Health Foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including Owen J.

5|$|Two main {{aspects of}} adult {{attachment}} have been studied. The organization and stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> working models {{that underlie the}} attachment styles is explored by social psychologists interested in romantic attachment. Developmental psychologists interested in the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment generally explore how attachment functions in relationship dynamics and impacts relationship outcomes. The organization of mental working models is more stable while the individual's state of mind with respect to attachment fluctuates more. Some authors have suggested that adults do not hold a single set of working models. Instead, on one level they {{have a set of}} rules and assumptions about attachment relationships in general. On another level they hold information about specific relationships or relationship events. Information at different levels need not be consistent. Individuals can therefore hold different internal working models for different relationships.|$|E
5|$|While {{it was a}} {{minority}} view in the 1960s, eliminative materialism gained prominence and acceptance during the 1980s. Proponents of this view, such as B.F. Skinner, often made parallels to previous pseudoscientific theories (such {{as that of the}} four humours, the phlogiston theory of combustion, and the vital force theory of life) that have all been successfully eliminated in attempting to establish their thesis about the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental.</b> In these cases, science has not produced more detailed versions or reductions of these theories, but rejected them altogether as obsolete. Radical behaviorists, such as Skinner, argued that folk psychology is already obsolete and should be replaced by descriptions of histories of reinforcement and punishment. Such views were eventually abandoned. Patricia and Paul Churchland argued that folk psychology will be gradually replaced as neuroscience matures.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} never an {{official}} tour of the album, the band gigged in the UK to promote the album. They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia, and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States. It was unsuccessful, mainly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> breakdown of Barrett. In his capacity as tour manager, Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations, but he ran into serious problems. Visas had not arrived, prompting the cancellation of the first six dates. The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November, but work permits were not yet obtained, so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito, California, just north of San Francisco. After a number of cancellations, the first US performance was given 4November at Winterland Ballroom, following Janis Joplin fronting Big Brother and the Holding Company.|$|E
5|$|Hibbard {{wrote that}} the {{condition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> foramen and masseteric ridges excluded the specimen from Onychomys, Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, and Eligmodontia and that in these features and in its depth and size, the fossil more closely resembled Oryzomys; therefore, he placed it in that genus with a query. Oryzomys is a living genus that {{has occurred in the}} United States since at least 300,000 years ago. In 1966, Philip Hershkovitz wrote that Hibbard had reconsidered his opinion after re-examining ? O.pliocaenicus in 1952; he no longer thought that it was an Oryzomys and instead believed it may be a Bensonomys. The latter genus occurs in the late Miocene and early Pliocene of North America and has been variously interpreted as a close relative of the South American Calomys or merely as an evolutionarily convergent member of the North American subfamily Neotominae. Jon Baskin mentioned the animal in 1978 and 1986, asserting that it cannot be identified to genus level, but may be Bensonomys. Although some continue to list it under Oryzomys, it is now usually excluded from the genus. In 2008, Everett Lindsay listed ? O.pliocaenicus as a questionable species of Jacobsomys, a Pliocene North American genus which he said may be ancestral to Oryzomys.|$|E

5|$|William's elder brother, the Prince of Wales, {{had been}} Prince Regent since 1811 because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> illness of their father, George III. In 1820, the King died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became George IV. William, Duke of Clarence, was now {{second in the}} line of succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate {{relatively}} frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water flavoured with lemon. Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered {{only a matter of time}} before he became king. When the Duke of York died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were going, and remaining away for ten days. The King, through the Prime Minister, by now Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, requested his resignation; he complied.|$|E
