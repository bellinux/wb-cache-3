5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the sixteen}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state <b>of</b> <b>Maine.</b> Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District <b>of</b> <b>Maine.</b> Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border <b>of</b> <b>Maine</b> was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.|$|E
5|$|William's next {{efforts were}} against Guy of Burgundy, who retreated to his castle at Brionne, which William besieged. After a long effort, the duke succeeded in exiling Guy in 1050. To address the growing {{power of the}} Count of Anjou, Geoffrey Martel, William joined with King Henry in a {{campaign}} against him, the last known cooperation between the two. They succeeded in capturing an Angevin fortress, but accomplished little else. Geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county <b>of</b> <b>Maine,</b> especially {{after the death of}} Hugh IV <b>of</b> <b>Maine</b> in 1051. Central to the control <b>of</b> <b>Maine</b> were the holdings of the Bellême family, who held Bellême on the border <b>of</b> <b>Maine</b> and Normandy, as well as the fortresses at Alençon and Domfort. Bellême's overlord was the king of France, but Domfort was under the overlordship of Geoffrey Martel and Duke William was Alençon's overlord. The Bellême family, whose lands were quite strategically placed between their three different overlords, were able to play each of them against the other and secure virtual independence for themselves.|$|E

40|$|CHAPTER ONE is {{concerned}} {{to describe the}} prevailing conditions in 19 th century England as. a context within which Maine's work may be seen. In general terms this provides {{an understanding of the}} economic, social and political circumstances, and more especially an understanding of the intellectual background.
