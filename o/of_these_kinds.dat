5|$|Books {{and audio}} dramas {{have also been}} made. Phantasia {{received}} multiple CD dramas, including four collected into anthologies in January and March 2000. and a stand-alone drama in December 2001. Symphonia received seven audio dramas following the game's plot. Two CD dramas for Legendia were respectively released in August and September 2005. A manga of Phantasia was written and serialized in 2008 and 2009, while Abyss received three manga adaptations {{in the years after}} its release. Symphonia was adapted in both novelizations and a manga serial. Others to receive adaptations <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> are Destiny, Graces and Xillia.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition is of concern for museum scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds.</b> In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E
5|$|Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are {{typically}} expressed as Boolean formulas {{of a special}} type, called conjunctive normal form (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of directed graph, the implication graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of variables as directed edges. Both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on backtracking or by using the strongly connected components of the implication graph.|$|E

5|$|State {{repression}} (including {{the infamous}} 1894 French lois scélérates) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations {{may have contributed}} to the abandonment <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.|$|E
5|$|Many {{problems}} in data analysis concern clustering, grouping data items into clusters of closely related items. Hierarchical clustering is {{a version of}} cluster analysis in which the clusters form a hierarchy or tree-like structure rather than a strict partition of the data items. In some cases, this type of clustering may be performed {{as a way of}} performing cluster analysis at multiple different scales simultaneously. In others, the data to be analyzed naturally has an unknown tree structure and the goal is to recover that structure by performing the analysis. Both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of analysis can be seen, for instance, in the application of hierarchical clustering to biological taxonomy. In this application, different living things are grouped into clusters at different scales or levels of similarity (species, genus, family, etc). This analysis simultaneously gives a multi-scale grouping of the organisms of the present age, and aims to accurately reconstruct the branching process or evolutionary tree that in past ages produced these organisms.|$|E

25|$|A quite {{different}} approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence. Examples <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of tests {{start in the}} late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from Kolmogorov complexity and data compression. Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} bond {{can be a}} covalent bond, an ionic bond, a hydrogen bond or just because of Van der Waals force. Each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), {{and the concept of}} oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of chemistry, energy is an {{attribute}} of a substance {{as a consequence of}} its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of structures, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants.|$|E

25|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is a third branch of machine learning, distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning, which also admits quantum enhancements. In quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with a classical environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions, which allows the agent to adapt its behaviour—in other words, to learn {{what to do in}} order to gain more rewards. In some situations, either because of the quantum processing capability of the agent, or due to the possibility to probe the environment in superpositions, a quantum speedup may be achieved. Implementations <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of protocols in superconducting circuits and in systems of trapped ions have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|According to {{extended}} habitable zone theory, planetary mass {{objects with}} atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther {{out from the}} Sun. Such objects could include those whose atmospheres contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth (super-Earth class planets), that have retained atmospheres with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough {{is known about the}} nature of atmospheres <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of extrasolar objects, and the net temperature effect of such atmospheres including induced albedo, anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources cannot be determined by their position in the habitable zone.|$|E
25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{throughout history}} had, arguably, {{been tempted to}} reduce two <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of belief and knowledge to the other one: René Descartes and David Hume thought that the only knowledge that people start with is self-knowledge. Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, {{for a person to}} have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.|$|E

25|$|According {{to early}} Muslim historians, towns that {{surrendered}} without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims {{were allowed to}} retain their churches and the towns captured by Muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques. One of the earliest examples <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of conversions was in Damascus, Syria, where in 705 Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I bought the church of St. John from the Christians and had it rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building {{a number of new}} churches for the Christians in Damascus. Overall, When He was left in Africa, he thought about the laws of the world and studied them. Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (Al-Waleed's father) is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques.|$|E
25|$|Yet this strange-ness {{also has}} a more {{negative}} side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled and ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is constantly threatening. Bauman's most famous book, Modernity and the Holocaust, {{is an attempt to}} give a full account of the dangers <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of fears. Drawing upon Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno's books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman argues that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he says, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorization of different species, and the tendency to view rule-following as morally good all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass.|$|E
25|$|Equatorial Guinea is {{considered}} wealthy by African standards, with a GDP that routinely outperforms neighboring African nations, {{in most instances}} by over 300 percent, and that has grown steadily in recent years. Indeed, its per capital GDP now exceeds those of Italy, Israel, and South Korea. But thanks to the massive diversion of funds from the national treasury into the Nguema/Mongomo group's bank accounts, the people of Equatorial Guinea live in desperate poverty, with over 60% earning less than $1 a day. Life expectancy is below 50, 57% of the people lack clean drinking water, 47% lack safe plumbing, {{and the level of}} medical care is primitive. The country has the world's fourth-highest infant mortality rate. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of indicators have gone from bad to worse in recent years. A 2009 UNDP report found that the difference between Equatorial Guinea's per capita GDP rank and its HDI (Human Development Index) rank was the world's highest, implying that Equatorial Guinea is the worst governed country on the planet.|$|E

500|$|Because {{this was}} a {{volunteer}} expedition and not a regular army operation, the men elected their officers. The candidates for the top position were David Williamson, the militia colonel who had commanded the Gnadenhütten expedition, and William Crawford, a retired Continental Army colonel. Crawford, a friend and land agent of George Washington, was an experienced soldier and frontiersman. He was a veteran <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of operations, having destroyed two Mingo villages during Dunmore's War in 1774. He had also taken part in the failed [...] "squaw campaign".|$|E
500|$|On {{both the}} life and {{casualty}} sides, the classical function of actuaries is to calculate premiums and reserves for insurance policies covering various risks [...] On the casualty side, this analysis often involves quantifying {{the probability of a}} loss event, called the frequency, and the size of that loss event, called the severity. The amount of time that occurs before the loss event is important, as the insurer will not have to pay anything until after the event has occurred. On the life side, the analysis often involves quantifying how much a potential sum of money or a financial liability will be worth at different points in the future. Since neither <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of analysis are purely deterministic processes, stochastic models are often used to determine frequency and severity distributions and the parameters of these distributions. Forecasting interest yields and currency movements also plays a role in determining future costs, especially on the life side [...]|$|E

[...] the humanization <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [...]" [...] Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the Alien films since Alien 3) was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic. An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however. Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and dry ice for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.|$|E
