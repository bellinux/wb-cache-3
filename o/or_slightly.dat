5|$|August 13, 2004— Tropical Storm Bonnie {{produces}} rainfall peaking at 4inches causing several rivers {{to swell}} to at <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> above flood stage.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of the genus Suillus, S.brevipes is edible, and the {{mushroom}} is considered choice by some. The odor is mild, and the taste mild <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> acidic. Field guides typically recommended to remove the slimy cap cuticle, and, in older specimens, the tube layer before consumption. The mushrooms are common in the diet of grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn wrote many songs, {{both for}} solo voice and for duet, with piano. Many {{of these are}} simple, <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> modified, strophic settings. Some, {{including}} Auf Flügeln des Gesanges (On Wings of Song), became popular. Nine of Mendelssohn's songs, including Auf Flügeln des Gesanges and Neue Liebe (New Love, set to a poem by Heinrich Heine) were transcribed for piano solo, in a virtuoso style, by Franz Liszt.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma was the 21st-largest {{recipient}} of medical {{funding from the}} federal government in 2005, with health-related federal expenditures in the state totaling $75,801,364; immunizations, bioterrorism preparedness, and health education were the top three most funded medical items. Instances of major diseases are near the national average in Oklahoma, and the state ranks at <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> above {{the rest of the country}} in percentage of people with asthma, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Suillus sibiricus is {{reportedly}} edible, {{but it is}} without any commercial or culinary value. It is one of over 200 species of mushrooms frequently collected for consumption in Nepal. Its taste has been described variously by authors as sour (Europe) and not distinctive <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> bitter (North America). Its odour is not distinctive.|$|E
5|$|The dense, bow-like {{lamellae}} are pale-orange to pale-ochre {{and on the}} stipe basifixed <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> decurrent. They are brittle and intermixed with shorter lamellulae (short gills that do {{not extend}} fully from the cap margin to the stem) as well as partly forking near the stem. In old age or in cases of injury they receive initially dark red, later grey green spots. The spore print is pale ochre.|$|E

5|$|The spores are elliptical, {{wrinkled}} <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> warted, and 10–14 by 5–7.5μm. They are nonamyloid, {{meaning they}} have a negative color reaction with the iodine in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing structures, the basidia, are elongated or club-shaped, hyaline (glassy or translucent), and four-spored, with dimensions of 60–90 by 8.5–11.5μm. G.clavatus does not contain cystidia, the sterile cells associated with basidia in many species. Clamp connections are present.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{that struck}} New Richmond would today be {{categorized}} an EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds {{in excess of}} 200 miles per hour, making it the third of only six EF5 tornadoes recorded in Wisconsin. Surveys of the damage caused at New Richmond and elsewhere determined the tornado had a damage path of roughly 400-500 yards, <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> over a quarter-mile in width.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} {{for the great}} spotted woodpecker is estimated at 73.7–110.3million individuals, with 35% {{of the population in}} Europe. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> increasing, especially in Britain, where the population has recently overspilled into Ireland. For this reason the great spotted woodpecker is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E
5|$|Andalusian {{horses are}} elegant and {{strongly}} built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, {{with a straight}} <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined withers and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with a well-rounded croup. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic gaits. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess feathering. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they are quick to learn, responsive, and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Anna's hold on {{the western}} limits of his kingdom, which bordered on the Fen lands that {{surrounded}} the Isle of Ely, was strengthened by the marriage in 651 (<b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> later) of his daughter Æthelthryth to Tondberht, a prince of the South Gyrwe, a {{people living in the}} fens who may have been settled in the area around Ely. Æthelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to Ecgfrith.|$|E

5|$|Apatosaurus was {{the second}} most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after Camarasaurus. Apatosaurus may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. Supersaurus has a greater total length and is the largest of all sauropods from the Morrison Formation. Apatosaurus fossils have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of Apatosaurus ajax are known {{exclusively}} from the upper Brushy Basin Member, about 152–151 mya. A.louisae fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional Apatosaurus remains are known from similarly aged <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{was one of}} the {{youngest}} sons of Romanos I and his wife Theodora. Theophanes Continuatus mentions him as {{the youngest}} son of the imperial couple, while the 11th-century chronicler George Kedrenos mentions him as the third of four known sons. His older brothers were Christopher Lekapenos (co-emperor 921–931) and Stephen Lekapenos (co-emperor 924-945). It is unclear if Theophylact (Patriarch of Constantinople in 933–956) was his younger brother <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> older than he was. His sisters included Helena, who married Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959), and Agatha, who married Romanos Argyros. He probably also had at least two unnamed sisters, known only because of their marriages to the magistroi Romanos Mosele and Romanos Saronites.|$|E

5|$|Functionalism was {{formulated}} by Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor {{as a reaction}} to the inadequacies of the identity theory. Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical computational theory of the mind. At about the same time <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> after, D.M. Armstrong and David Kellogg Lewis formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles. Finally, Wittgenstein's idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by Wilfrid Sellars and Gilbert Harman. Another one, psychofunctionalism, is an approach adopted by the naturalistic philosophy of mind associated with Jerry Fodor and Zenon Pylyshyn.|$|E
5|$|In the manga {{illustrated}} by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> modified from the anime version. For example, after {{the conclusion of}} the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him in the park. Also, at {{the conclusion of the}} story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her at their hotel wedding.|$|E
5|$|Ivan quickly {{weakened}} due to dry air, but {{it gradually}} reorganized, passing {{just south of}} Grenada as a major hurricane on September 7. The hurricane attained Category 5 status in the central Caribbean Sea. Over the subsequent days its intensity fluctuated largely due to eyewall replacement cycles, and Ivan passed just south of Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and western Cuba with winds at <b>or</b> <b>slightly</b> below Category5 status. Turning northward and encountering unfavorable conditions, Ivan gradually weakened before making landfall just west of Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16 with winds of 120mph (195km/h). The cyclone quickly weakened to tropical depression status as it turned to the northeast, and Ivan transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 18.|$|E
