5|$|Newer styles <b>of</b> <b>play</b> have {{recently}} emerged, pushing {{the bounds of}} what the gandingan was traditionally used for.

Because of the strenuous type <b>of</b> <b>play,</b> male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity, considered a sign of masculinity, on the gandingan. During a gandingan contest, two expert gandingan players (pagagandings) would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other.
