5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several bills in May 1914 which would have put the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then find their way into the war.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{a species}} of fungus in the genus Cyathus, family Nidulariaceae. Like {{other members of the}} Nidulariaceae, C.helenae resembles a tiny bird's nest filled with 'eggs'—spore-containing {{structures}} known as peridioles. It was initially described by mycologist Harold Brodie in 1965, who found it growing on mountain scree in Alberta, Canada. C.helenaes life cycle allows it to reproduce both sexually and asexually. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> species of Cyathus, C.helenae produces a number of chemically unique diterpenoid molecules known as cyathins. The specific epithet of this species was given by Brodie in tribute to his late wife Helen.|$|E
5|$|Many of the film's {{actors were}} unknown {{at the time}} of casting. The film was the acting debut of four cast members; Ken Wahl, Tony Ganios, Erland van Lidth and Michael Wright. It was also the feature film debut of Toni Kalem, who had {{previously}} acted on television. Kaufman intentionally cast unknown actors; Wahl {{was on his way to}} a job in a pizza parlor when someone sent a photograph of him to Rudin, thinking he could play <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> roles in the film. Kaufman felt Wahl was talented so he cast him in the lead role instead.|$|E

5|$|The Argentine government, {{bolstered by}} socialist {{additions}} in the legislature, introduced several bills in May 1914 {{which would have}} put the battleships up for sale, but the bills were all defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British {{were going to be}} given the ships as soon as they reached Argentina, and the latter charged the United States with ensuring that the ships fell into Argentina's possession only.

5|$|The Clydesdale is a {{breed of}} draught horse named for and {{derived from the}} farm horses of Clydesdale, a county in Scotland. Although {{originally}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> breeds of draught horses, {{it is now a}} tall breed. Often bay in color, they show significant white markings due to the presence of sabino genetics. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for draught purposes today. The Budweiser Clydesdales {{are some of the most}} famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British Household Cavalry. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{produced}} by Universal Pictures, The Brute Man was distributed by Producers Releasing Corporation, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> film studios from Hollywood's Poverty Row. In 1945, Universal {{merged with the}} company International Pictures, and the new organization adopted a policy against developing any more B movies, including Westerns, horror films, serials and movies running 70minutes or less. This resulted in the firing of numerous production personnel members and the sale of several already-developed films, including The Brute Man. The sale was also perpetuated {{in part by the}} death of star Rondo Hatton. He {{died as a result of}} his acromegaly on February2, 1946, about eight months before The Brute Man was first screened, making it his final film. Universal feared releasing the film so soon after his death would lead to accusations that the studio was exploiting the illness that ultimately killed Hatton. Now embarrassed by the film, the studio was anxious to sell it.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> {{ships from}} the convoy, an American {{merchant}} ship named Silenus, had {{separated from the}} main body in the storm and arrived at the Nicobar Islands. There she had encountered Caroline and the American captain had reported the location and value of the convoy to Féretier. Setting all sail, Féretier took Caroline to the north-west, and sighted the convoy at 05:30, {{only a few days}} after leaving the Nicobar Islands. The British ships, under the loose command of John Dale in Streatham, originally mistook the French frigate for the missing Victor and it was not until another half-hour had passed that Dale realised the danger his ships were in. Ordering the Indiamen to form a line of battle, Dale placed his ship in the centre, with the small Lord Keith ahead and Europe behind. However, the lack of naval experience on the British ships resulted in the Indiamen sailing too far from one another in line, thus leaving them unable to provide effective mutual support.|$|E
5|$|Othnielosaurus was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> {{members of}} the diverse Morrison Formation dinosaur fauna, {{diminutive}} {{in comparison to the}} giant sauropods. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining gallery forests of conifers, tree ferns, and ferns, to fern savannas with rare trees. It has been a rich fossil hunting ground, holding fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Other fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, several species of pterosaur, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Such dinosaurs as the theropods Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Ornitholestes, and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus are known from the Morrison. Othnielosaurus is present in stratigraphic zones 2-5.|$|E
5|$|Outside the city, Crocker Range Park, {{occupying a}} stretch of c. 20 x 80km of the Crocker Range {{mountain}} chain to the city's southeast (roughly between Tenom and Tambunan, is a popular spot for jungle trekking and camping.

The Rafflesia Forest Reserve near Tambunan, which is 30kilometres away from Kota Kinabalu, is also within the Crocker Range National Park boundary. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> species of Rafflesia, R. pricei, can be found there. The Gunung Emas Highland Resort, which is nearby, is another spot famous for its scenery and cool climate.

It {{is found in the}} western Amazon {{rainforest}} of South America; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil. It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The purple-throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies.

Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers and a white belly with some black barring on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male has a powerful voice.|$|E
