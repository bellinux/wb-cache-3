30|$|Based on {{the sand}} control mechanism, {{similarity}} criterion and factors affecting the stability of borehole plastic region, a large-scale laboratory test apparatus for simulating the performance of sand <b>control</b> <b>screens</b> for gas wells was developed. A series of sand control simulation experiments were performed. Based on the particle size analysis of formation sand and geological conditions, parameters of sand <b>control</b> <b>screen,</b> such as sand retention efficiency, were investigated. By simulating formation conditions, such as pressure gradient and gas flow rate, the performance of several types of screens, including slotted screen, wire wrapped screen and premium composite screen that are commonly used in oilfield, was evaluated. Experimental results were discussed and premium composite screen {{was found to be}} most efficient for sand control among all the tested screens. This study provides a sound experimental method for evaluating the performance of sand <b>control</b> <b>screens</b> for gas wells.|$|R

The key factor to design size reductionunits such as crushers and grinding mills, is ore’s work index. The work index, wi, presents the oregrindability, and is used in Bond formula to calculate the required energy. Bond has defined a specificrelationship between some parameters which is applied to calculate wi, which are <b>control</b> <b>screen,</b> fineparticles produced, feed and product d 80. In this research work, a high grade copper sample from Miduk copper concentrator was prepared, and itswork index values were experimentally estimated, using different <b>control</b> <b>screens,</b> 600, 425, 212, 150, 106 and 75 microns. The obtained results from the tests showed two different behaviors in fine production. According to these two trends the required models were then defined to present the fine mass calculationusing <b>control</b> <b>screen.</b> In next step, an equation was presented in order to calculate Miduk copper ore workindex for any size. In addition to verify the model creditability, a test using 300 microns control screenwas performed and its result was compared with calculated ones using defined model, which showed agood fit. Finally the experimental and calculated values were compared and their relative error was equalto 4. 11 % which is an indication of good fit for the results...|$|R

30|$|Sand {{production}} {{can pose}} serious problems to normal field production. Hence, numerous {{methods have been}} proposed to perform effective sand control. Laboratory sand control simulation experiment has been considered as {{a good way to}} select appropriate sand <b>control</b> <b>screens.</b> Schulien et al. (1997) designed and constructed a small-scale laboratory test apparatus for investigating screen plugging. With this test apparatus, the influence of scale sensitive parameters on the performance of a single wire wrapped screen was studied. Ballard et al. (1999) developed a laboratory method to evaluate the performance of various sand <b>control</b> <b>screens,</b> which was applied in a North Sea oilfield to select the most appropriate screen. Underdown et al. (1999) evaluated sand control efficiency for different screens and defined performance factor and sand control factor. The higher the sand control factor, the better the sand control performance of a screen. For the performance factor, the higher the value, the longer the screen occurs sand plugging. Zhu et al. (2000) conducted laboratory sand control simulation experiments for heavy oil reservoir of Shengli oilfield, China. They investigated the adaptability of different sand control methods in different geological conditions and established an optimal sand <b>control</b> <b>screen</b> selection model. Zeng et al. (2004) designed a sand control simulation apparatus and conducted simulation experiments for shallow loose heavy oil reservoir in the Bohai Sea, China. They came to conclusion that the studied reservoir is not suitable for gravel packing, while using metal cotton fiber for sand control is more preferable. Qi (2004) designed a large-scale experimental apparatus for simulating sanding during radial flow. The relationship between fluid viscosity, flow rate and sanding was obtained. Nouri et al. (2005) used field sand to make poorly cemented thick-walled cylinder samples. Laboratory sanding simulation experiments were conducted for both open hole completion and sand <b>control</b> <b>screen</b> completion. Sand <b>control</b> performance of expandable screen was analyzed as well. The experimental equipments include fluid injection system, axial loading system and sand collection system.|$|R
