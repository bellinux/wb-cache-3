40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> {{has been}} present within the United States {{for over a}} century. Traditionally, <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> efforts tend to focus more {{exclusively}} on either socially-based (e. g., recreational, scenic, or park planning) or ecologically-based (e. g., preserves, habitat networks or more general conservation planning) planning efforts. This separation of ecological and social frameworks in <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> is reinforced by a persistent cultural model, where community and conservation are seen as opposing forces instead of partners. While recent <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> efforts have begun to integrate social and ecological frameworks into one plan, {{the majority of our}} knowledge on integrated <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> comes from individual case studies. Thus, a synthesized toolbox for how to practice this planning field is lacking. Given this lack of synthesized knowledge of integrated <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning,</b> an exploratory effort was undertaken to begin to view this newer planning field through a comprehensive lens. The goal of this research was to identify the state of integrated <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> and begin to assess whether this state was leading toward 2 ̆ 2 landscape integrity, 2 ̆ 2 which suggests that healthy social and ecological systems must function together to be sustainable. Framed within an adapted Pressure-State-Response framework, this thesis employed mixed methods and multiple perspectives to engender a holistic framework that identifies the pressures, state of, and potential responses surrounding integrated <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning.</b> Pressures synthesized from practice and theory include key barriers and facilitators to achieving integration. For the first time, the state of integrated <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> has been identified from a synthesis of thirty planning processes, practices, and tools utilized in this new planning field. This framework provides planners with a framework upon which sharing and communication can now take place regarding how integrated <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> can be institutionalized. Finally, this understanding of the pressures and state reveals potential responses for this newer planning field, including the need for increased collaboration to build this new field of <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> into a mainstream planning field and increased research into bridging the gaps between theory and practice identified through this thesis. This study found two integrated <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> models and a breadth of literature supporting a movement away from the community versus conservation dichotomy. While this movement is not yet mainstream, both paradigm shifts and the rapidly changing landscapes in which we live are reinforcing this trend.

Although there is a long tradition of parks and <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> in American cities, planning efforts over the past twenty-five years (since 1960) have not been systematically reviewed and there remains no set standard to guide the planning of regional-scale open space.

40|$|With {{increasing}} worldwide {{recognition of}} the influence of urban development on the hydrological functions of water, there is growing pressure for urban planning to play a greater role in water resources management. Planning for green open spaces in particular can play an important role, as they support important ecosystem services, including those that assist in flood management. It has been argued that interconnected and strategically planned networks of green open spaces should be planned for early in land use planning and design processes, with consideration of water-related ecosystem values and landscape functions in concert with land development, growth management and physical infrastructure planning. Although there is growing {{recognition of the}} importance of green <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> for water sensitive cities and supportive planning measures, there are few analyses of the actual inclusion of this recognition in plans and strategies, or the presence of related actions and planning mechanisms. This paper addresses this gap by comparatively analysing the approaches taken to regional green <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> in three Australian capital city-regions. Findings indicate the acknowledgement of relationships between flood regulation and green <b>open</b> <b>space</b> <b>planning</b> and various associated planning mechanisms. However, there is limited explicit integration of flood management and green open spaces planning, and significant on-ground barriers to enabling this integration to occur given the legacy of past planning decisions and the lack of information to support implementation. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research to assist planning for green open spaces as an ally to ecosystem services relating to flood management.
