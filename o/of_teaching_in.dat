5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose was no different, with some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E

The paper covers three major areas: 1) A brief introduction to the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> literature <b>in</b> EFL classes in China before and now. 2) Theoretical interpretations of the important role <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> foreign literature <b>in</b> EFL classes in China 3) Practical application <b>of</b> literature <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> EFL classes in China. In the first area, the author gives some information about literature teaching before 1950 and now and also mentions the advantages <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> literature <b>in</b> China now. The second area shows what literature is and why Chinese EFL students should study foreign literature. The author intends to show in this area that the main purpose <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> foreign literature <b>in</b> EFL classes in China should not be to increase students' ability to appreciate novels, but to: 1) get information and knowledge of culture, history in the target language countries 2) increase students' ability to appreciate the thought pattern {{of the people in}} the target language countries 3) improve students' four language skills. Finally, some suggestions on what to teach, how to teach and how to evaluate the teaching result are provided. In order to apply the theories that this paper has mentioned to practical teaching, the author presents two teaching plans at the end...|$|R

25|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} features <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> the promotion of conceptual understanding are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how one problem is a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.|$|E

In April 1750, Timothy and others made a request of Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet, governor of New Hampshire, for a grant of a township.

25|$|The second arm of {{government}} policy, driven mainly by Mahathir first as Education Minister {{and then as}} Prime Minister, was the transfer of economic power to the Malays. Mahathir greatly expanded the number of secondary schools and universities throughout the country, and enforced the policy <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> Malay rather than English. This {{had the effect of}} creating a large new Malay professional class. It also created an unofficial barrier against Chinese access to higher education, since few Chinese are sufficiently fluent in Malay to study at Malay-language universities. Chinese families therefore sent their children to universities in Singapore, Australia, Britain or the United States – by 2000, for example, 60,000 Malaysians held degrees from Australian universities. This had the unintended consequence of exposing large numbers of Malaysians to life in Western countries, creating a new source of discontent. Mahathir also greatly expanded educational opportunities for Malay women – by 2000 half of all university students were women.|$|E
