50|$|Estimates vary {{considerably}} regarding how many college students transfer. Several reports suggested {{about a third}} of college-aged students had transferred at least once during their college careers, which includes transfers from community or two-year colleges to four-year colleges, as well as transfers between four-year colleges or universities. A high estimate was that 60% of students attended more than one collegiate institution between the ages of 18 and 24, and this estimate includes 20% who transferred from one four-year institution to another one. A third estimate was that only 20% of students in four-year colleges were transfer students. A fourth estimate, from the National Center of Education Statistics, was that 2.5 million college students transferred each year. In 2009, one report was that 566,400 students at schools surveyed by US News, transferred from one institution to another in that year. A report in 1999-2000 suggested that a fifth <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>students</b> intended to transfer to four-year colleges, and an additional 24% were taking courses for personal enrichment or for transfer purposes. Another report suggested that only about a quarter <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>students</b> followed through on their plan to transfer to a four-year college or university.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{the number}} of young people who attain postsecondary {{credentials}} {{has become one of the}} primary educational objectives of the 2010 s. While low college success rates are typically linked to students' lack of academic preparation for college and their subsequent need for developmental or remedial instruction, research suggests that even many students who are deemed "college-ready" by virtue of their placement test scores or completion of developmental coursework still do not earn a credential. This paper builds on previous work arguing that <b>community</b> <b>college</b> success is dependent not only upon academic preparation but also upon a host of important skills, attitudes, and behaviors that are often left unspoken. Drawing on role theory and on a qualitative study conducted at three <b>community</b> <b>colleges,</b> this paper aims to clarify the role <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>student</b> and the components of that role that must be enacted for students to be successful.

5000|$|There {{are reports}} of private colleges making more active efforts to woo {{community}} college students {{as an effort to}} [...] "bolster and diversify their enrollments". Private college admissions departments are more likely to evaluate transfer applicants based on nonacademic variables such as the interview, recommendations, writing samples, {{and the quality of the}} applicant's current college. One estimate was that 40% of these schools recalculate a transfer applicant's GPA as part of the evaluation process, by using algorithms to factor in perceived course difficulty and comprehensiveness. One report suggested that private schools, while they tend to be more expensive, were a [...] "strong option for transfer students" [...] since they were often unaffected by state budget cuts and tend to have [...] "better counseling services." [...] Private colleges often view applicants from community colleges positively since many have had a track record of finishing their four-year degrees, or what colleges term [...] "high persistence", and being successful students with relatively high graduation rates. There are reports that the percentage <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>students</b> who are transferring to private schools is increasing; in the past, the percentage was about 15% to 20%, but the figure is more likely to be higher in recent years.|$|E

A survey was used to collect data concerning the background characteristics as well as the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> and university experiences of transfer students. A purposive sample <b>of</b> female <b>community</b> <b>college</b> transfer <b>students</b> were interviewed to gather information about their overall socialization experiences. The researcher employed a hypothetical conceptual framework of undergraduate socialization for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> transfer <b>students</b> based on Weidman 2 ̆ 7 s (1987) conceptual framework of undergraduate socialization. The hypothesized model was used to examine how selected variables [...] background characteristics, <b>community</b> <b>college</b> experiences, and university experiences [...] impacted the academic and social adjustment among <b>community</b> <b>college</b> transfer <b>students.</b> Quantitative analysis, including descriptive statistics, independent samples t test, and hierarchical multiple regression, as well as qualitative analysis, including narrative inquiry, were used to analyze the data. Two hierarchical multiple regression models were used to examine the background characteristics and the <b>community</b> <b>college</b> and university variables that predict academic and social adjustment. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the background characteristics, including gender; <b>community</b> <b>college</b> experiences, including transfer semester hours, experience with faculty and transfer process; as well as university experiences that include negative general perception of transfer students, impacted the academic adjustment <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> transfer <b>students.</b> Similarly, a second hierarchical multiple regression model was used to examine the background characteristics and community and university variables that predict social adjustment. The results of this study suggest that the background characteristics parental household income level; <b>community</b> <b>college</b> experiences: academic advising, course learning; and university experiences: financial influential reasons for attending ISU and negative general perception of transfer students impacted the social adjustment <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> transfer <b>students</b> in STEM.

The study hypothesized that data analysis will show that there will be no difference in the integrations reported by the control and experimental groups. The overall approach was to conduct a pretest-posttest control-group experimental study using CMC as the experimental treatment. The Community College Student Experiences Questionnaire (CCSEQ) was given to collect data that were used to measure the academic and social integration of the control and experimental groups. After an in-depth analysis of data using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and ANCOVA, the finding of this study was that there is no statistically significant difference between the control and experimental groups on their academic and social integrations as measured by the CCSEQ. In other words, CMC did not have a positive or negative impact on the integrations <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>students.</b> This study examined for the first time the impact that CMC had on the integrations <b>of</b> <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>students</b> and provided an experimental methodology that future researchers might replicate or modify to further explore this topic.

Recommendations include political skill training for <b>community</b> <b>college</b> administrators as part of their professional development program, as well as including graduate education components and new employee orientation programs.
