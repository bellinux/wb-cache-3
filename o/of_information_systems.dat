25|$|Although a {{strengthened}} public-health {{system has}} accelerated the national tuberculosis control effort, progress in tuberculosis control has also strengthened the public-health system. In terms of policy, the national tuberculosis control program has clear targets and well-defined technical policies {{based on the}} DOTS strategy. National and international partners work in a cohesive manner toward the same targets, with the same implementation framework. Other public-health programs are learning from this successful model. In financial terms, funding from different partners is harmonized under one financing plan with clear funding needs and gapsâ€”another model for other programs. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the pastâ€”when tuberculosis services were not freeâ€”and the success in tuberculosis control {{over the past few}} yearsâ€”when tuberculosis services have been freeâ€”have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTSâ€”e.g., directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugsâ€”are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programs. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> the tuberculosis program's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programs. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the tuberculosis program leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes. Finally, the model of collaboration between hospitals and CDC facilities provided by the tuberculosis control program {{is one of the best}} examples to date of how hospitals should be involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has influenced the development of new policies that involve hospitals in the work of public health.|$|E
