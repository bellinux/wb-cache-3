Inhibiting {{the flow of water}} {{in and out of the}} bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional turbidity (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary.

40|$|How to, a {{landscape}} architect, design with coastal natural processes? Coastal areas have {{stronger and more}} fluctuating natural variables than many sites in more sheltered areas. Understanding the past, present, and future form of these processes will allow the designer to shape a form and program that works with the site-specific geomorphological processes. A site was located from which to approach this question. The DeltaWorks were created in the Netherlands between 1940 - 1971, The Haringvliet sluice, designed as a closed sluice, has come under discussion since the in 2000 the Netherlands decided to restore connections between river and sea {{as part of a}} European agreement, and partially open the Haringvliet sluice. Because of farmers’ outcry over the saltwater influx, the decision was withdrawn in 2010 and the sluices are now usually closed. Future scenarios are being proposed in the light of sea level rise and ‘room for the river’ projects, and one example shows an island {{on the outside of the}} more <b>open</b> <b>sluice.</b> This island was chosen to be designed in this research project. From this scenario comes the design question: How can we use the partial opening of the Haringvliet sluice to 1. fulfill the estuarine ecological landscape potential 2. protect the Dutch coast from excessive saltwater intake and storms and 3. offer landscape architectural qualities for the region - while working with the coastal natural processes? This graduation project demonstrates how one can create landscape architectural designs in coastal areas that work with natural processes and solve national environmental resolutions and coastal issues.

Army Corps of Engineers Portland District {{engaged the}} Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to {{evaluate}} juvenile salmon passage at The Dalles Dam in 2004 to inform decisions about long-term measures and operations to enhance sluiceway and spill passage and reduce turbine passage to improve smolt survival at the dam. PNNL used fixed-location hydroacoustic sampling {{across the entire}} project, especially at the sluiceway and spillway, using multiple split-beam transducers at selected locations. At the sluiceway nearfield, we used an acoustic camera to track fish. The fish data were interpreted and integrated with hydraulic data from a CFD model and in-field ADCP measurements. Two sluiceway operations were compared: West only (SL 1) vs. West+East (SL 1 + SL 18). Based on our findings, we concluded that The Dalles Dam sluiceway {{has the potential to}} be highly efficient and effective at passing juvenile salmonids. This potential could be tapped with hydraulic and entrance enhancements to the sluiceway. We recommended the following: (1) six rather than three sluice gates should be opened to take advantage of the maximum hydraulic capacity of the sluiceway. (2) The turbine units below <b>open</b> <b>sluice</b> gates should be operated as a standard fish operations procedure. (3) In 2005, the Corps and fisheries agencies should consider operating sluice gates in one or more of the following combinations of six gates: (a) SL 1 - 1, 1 - 2, 1 - 3 and SL 18 - 1, 18 - 2, 18 - 3 (repeat 2004 operation), (b) SL 1 - 1, 1 - 2, 1 - 3 and SL 11 - 1, 11 - 2, 11 - 3, or (c) SL 1 - 1, 1 - 2, 1 - 3 and SL 2 - 1, 2 - 2, 2 - 3. The following elements for surface flow bypasses which should be considered during design of any sluiceway enhancements at The Dalles Dam: (1) form an extensive surface flow bypass flow net (surface bypass discharge greater than {approx} 7 % of total project discharge), (2) create a gradual increase in water velocity approaching the surface flow bypass (ideally, acceleration 3 m/s) to entrain the subject juvenile fishes, (4) adapt the shape and orientation of the surface entrance(s) to fit site-specific features, and (5) consider installing a forebay wall to increase fish availability to the surface flow bypass...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Portland District {{engaged the}} Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to {{evaluate}} fish passage at The Dalles Dam powerhouse in 2005. The {{goal of the}} study was to provide information on smolt passage that will inform decisions on long-term measures and operations to enhance sluiceway passage and reduce turbine passage to improve smolt survival at the dam. The study addressed one of the main programs dedicated to improving juvenile salmonid survival at The Dalles Dam: Surface Flow Bypass. The study objectives (see below) were met using a combination of hydroacoustic and hydraulic data. The study incorporated fixed-location hydroacoustic methods across the entire powerhouse, with especially intense sampling using multiple split-beam transducers at all sluiceway portals. We did not sample fish passage at the spillway in 2005. In the sluiceway nearfield, we used an acoustic camera to track fish movements. The fish data were interpreted with hydraulic data from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Fish passage data were collected in the framework of an “experiment” using a randomized block design (3 -day treatments; two treatments) to compare two sluiceway operational configurations: Sluice 2 + 5 and Sluice 2 + 19 (six gates open for each configuration). Total project outflow was 76 % of the 10 -year average for spring and 71 % of the 10 -year average for summer. Based on these findings, we make the following recommendations: 1) The sluice should be operated 24 h/d from April until November. 2) Open six rather than three sluice gates to take advantage of the maximum hydraulic capacity of the sluiceway. 3) Open the three gates above the western-most operating main turbine unit and the three gates at MU 8 where turbine passage rates are relatively high. 4) Operate the turbine units below <b>open</b> <b>sluice</b> gates as a standard fish operations procedure. 5) Develop hydraulic and entrance enhancements to the sluiceway to tap the potential of The Dalles Dam sluiceway to be highly efficient and effective at passing juvenile salmonids. 6) Consider the following elements for surface flow bypasses during design of any sluiceway enhancements at The Dalles Dam: Form an extensive surface flow bypass flow net (surface bypass discharge greater than ~ 7 % of total project discharge) at both west and east ends of the dam; Create a gradual increase in water velocity approaching the surface flow bypass (ideally, acceleration 3 m/s) to entrain the subject juvenile fishes, e. g., 10, 000 cfs or so; Adapt the shape and orientation of the surface entrance(s) to fit site-specific features, i. e., test a Removable Sluiceway Weir. 7) The Dalles Dam sluiceway has potential to be highly efficient and effective at passing juvenile salmonids.
