By use of Fresnel principle, diffractions caused by raw silk in different conditions are analyzed and simulated. Image {{data of the}} fineness <b>of</b> raw <b>silk</b> measured by CMOS image sensor is analyzed for obtaining precise result. Finally, some suggestions are proposed for photoelectric measuring the fineness <b>of</b> raw <b>silk...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} evidence <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> {{was found}} at the sites of Yangshao culture in Xia County, Shanxi, where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by a sharp knife, dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BCE. The species was identified as Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of primitive loom {{can also be seen}} from the sites of Hemudu culture in Yuyao, Zhejiang, dated to about 4000 BCE. The earliest example <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> fabric is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child. The fabric comes from a Yangshao site in Qingtaicun at Rongyang, Henan. Scraps <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> were found in a Liangzhu culture site at Qianshanyang in Huzhou, Zhejiang, dating back to 2700 BCE. Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BCE).|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> {{originates in}} China in the Neolithic (Yangshao culture, 4th millennium BCE). Silk remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened {{at some point}} during the later half of the first millennium BCE. China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years. Not confined to clothing, silk was also used for a number of other applications, including writing, and the color <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> worn was an important guide of social class during the Tang Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|More {{information}} {{is known about}} the looms used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture, compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk. It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to be far superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the draw loom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> brocades.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} luxury {{product was}} silk, which was imported and then processed in the Empire. In {{order to protect}} the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> products, Justinian granted a monopoly to the imperial factories in 541. In order to bypass the Persian landroute, Justinian established friendly relations with the Abyssinians, whom he wanted to act as trade mediators by transporting Indian silk to the Empire; the Abyssinians, however, were unable to compete with the Persian merchants in India. Then, in the early 550s, two monks succeeded in smuggling eggs <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> worms from Central Asia back to Constantinople, and silk became an indigenous product.|$|E
5|$|Sericulture, the rearing of silkworms, {{was first}} {{adopted by the}} Chinese during the Shang dynasty. The only species farmed commercially is the domesticated silkmoth. When it spins its cocoon, each larva {{produces}} an exceedingly long, slender thread <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> The larvae feed on mulberry leaves and in Europe, only one generation is normally raised each year as this is a deciduous tree. In China, Korea and Japan however, two generations are normal, and in the tropics, multiple generations are expected. Most production <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> occurs in the Far East, with a synthetic diet being used to rear the silkworms in Japan.|$|E

5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{changed much}} of Europe’s silk industry. Due to {{innovations}} on spinning cotton, cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased {{the efficiency of}} production. Among these was the Jacquard loom, developed for silk embroidery. An epidemic of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world’s largest producer <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b> The rise of new fabrics such as nylon reduced the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> throughout the world, and silk is now once again a rare luxury good, much less important than in its heyday.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>silk</b> through sericulture was {{profitable for}} both small-time farmers and large-scale producers. Silk clothing {{was too expensive}} for the poor, who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp. The rural women usually wove all the family's clothes.|$|E

5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands <b>of</b> <b>silk.</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction Silk, {{trade and}} {{politics}} were common spokes in an intricate wheel, propelling Mediterranean influence towards the West. At {{a time when}} Western Europe lacked the ability to manufacture silk cloth, Eastern silken stuffs were eagerly sought for secular and ecclesiastical purposes. Byzantium in particular, in return for silks, demanded Western military and naval aid, and her silk trade concessions bore the hallmark of powerful political bargaining counters. The survival {{of more than one}} thousand silks in church treasuries of Western Europe, provides unspoken insights into the complex impact <b>of</b> Mediterranean <b>silk</b> trade on the West before 1200 A. D. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the broader ramifications of these remarkable influences. The Mediterranean silk trade spanned economic, political, cultural and religious divides between East and West:- Its economic impact was reflected by the breadth, scale and regularity of distribution <b>of</b> the <b>silks</b> on the Western market. - Its political impact was demonstrated by the existance of a 2 ̆ 7 diplomatic silk trade 2 ̆ 7 allied to a policy <b>of</b> special <b>silk</b> trade concessions in exchange for military or naval aid. - Its cultural impact was evident in the uses <b>of</b> <b>silks</b> in Western society. - Its religious impact was crystallised in the widespread and parallel uses <b>of</b> the <b>silks</b> in the Byzantine and the Latin Church. The economic and political influences were inextricably linked, and these together with the ensuing social and religious influences were spurred along by Western courts eager to rival their Eastern counterparts. It was not surprising that before the establishment <b>of</b> Latin <b>silk</b> weaving centres under Roger of Sicily at Palermo in 1147, the West should seek large numbers <b>of</b> patterned <b>silks</b> through silk trade with the Mediterranean (Weigand, 1935). Only the survival of large numbers <b>of</b> <b>silks</b> illustrates just how widespread was their distribution across Western Europe (Muthesius 1982 and forthcoming) (Map 1). Over a hundred centres were receiving silks from the Mediterranean region at varying times between the fourth and the twelfth century...|$|R
