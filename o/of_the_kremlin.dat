5|$|Yegor Gaidar : The sudden {{illness of}} Yegor Gaidar in Ireland on 24 November 2006, {{the day of}} Litvinenko's death, {{has been linked to}} his visit to the {{restaurant}} where polonium was present and is being investigated as part of the overall investigation in the UK and Ireland., Other observers noted he was probably poisoned after drinking a strange-tasting cup of tea. Gaidar was taken to hospital; doctors said his condition was not life-threatening and that he would recover. This incident was similar to the poisoning of Anna Politkovskaya on a flight to Beslan. Afterwards, Gaidar claimed that it was enemies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> who had tried to poison him.|$|E

50|$|After {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>kremlin</b> {{walls and}} churches was complete, the monarch decreed that no structures should {{be built in}} <b>the</b> immediate vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citadel. <b>The</b> <b>Kremlin</b> was separated from the walled merchant town (Kitay-gorod) by a 30-meter-wide moat, over which Saint Basil's Cathedral was constructed during <b>the</b> reign <b>of</b> Ivan <b>the</b> Terrible. The same tsar also renovated some of his grandfather's palaces, added a new palace and cathedral for his sons, and endowed the Trinity metochion inside <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin.</b> <b>The</b> metochion was administrated by the Trinity Monastery and boasted the graceful tower church of St. Sergius, which was described by foreigners as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest in the country.|$|R
5|$|In 1485 Ivan III {{commissioned}} {{the building of}} the royal residence, Terem Palace, within the Kremlin, with Aloisio da Milano as the architect of the first three floors. He and other Italian architects also contributed to the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> walls and towers. The small banquet hall of the Russian Tsars, called the Palace of Facets because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the Cathedral of the Archangel, a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the Metropolitan Peter in Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called octagon-on-tetragon architectural form in the Moscow Baroque of the late 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Podgorny's {{life after}} his {{resignation}} {{is not well}} documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never any explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed {{by the presence of}} Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.|$|E

50|$|Externally {{the palace}} {{is faced with}} white marble and the windows are tinted and reflective, which makes the ancient {{architecture}} in <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> appear particularly picturesque. However, from the start, <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a large modern public building in an historic neighborhood generated quite an uproar, especially since the building replaced several heritage buildings including the old neo-classical building <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Armory and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back corpuses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Kremlin</b> Palace. Although this was hardly {{the first time that}} the Soviet government destroyed architectural heritage (notably the Chudov and Ascension cloisters) in <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> and in <b>the</b> country in general, by the mid 1950s laws were in place effectively considering all pre-Soviet constructions as historical monuments and preventing their demolition, in someways making the construction illegal.
