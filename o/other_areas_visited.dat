50|$|In the beginning, all the {{inhabitants}} of Flowers Island were Church of England, until Methodism was introduced to them in 1874 and the Salvation Army in 1891. There was no church on Flowers Island but missionaries from <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>visited</b> the island to perform services, baptisms, burials, marriages, and visits to the sick. For example, the first missionary stationed in nearby Greenspond, Rev. N.A. Coster, visited Flowers Island on several occasions. In September 1830 he notes {{that there was a}} congregation of 35 consisting of people by the names of Kean, Sturge, Roger, and Perry. By 1891 the population had reached 64, 30 of them were Church of England, 4 were Methodist, and 30 were Salvation Army.|$|E
50|$|First floor {{facilities}} in the new school building allowed for the commencement of domestic science and manual training. It was the only school in Townsville with such facilities and students from <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>visited</b> the school {{once a week to}} receive tuition. At the beginning of 1942 Townsville became a restricted military zone with up to 90,000 military personnel stationed in the city and surrounding district. Townsville West State School, like many other schools, was commandeered by the military and a first aid post and convalescence ward were established on the first floor. Classes for Volunteer Aid Detachments (VADs) were held, dressmaking classes for the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF), first aid classes, various classes for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as well as community meetings. In September 1942, the 5th Australian Transport Unit under the command of Major Douglas, camped in the grounds under the fig trees {{at the rear of the}} school. These units used the school water supply and shared the ablutions with hospital patients.|$|E
40|$|I {{studied the}} {{population}} dynamics of an established flock of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) in south-central Iowa. I also evaluated {{the influence of}} various field methods and marking techniques on wild turkey growth and survival. I conducted a laboratory experiment to {{examine the effect of}} transmitter attachment techniques on the growth of turkey poults. Surgically implanted transmitters affected wing growth less than backpack harnesses and are recommended for attaching transmitters to wild turkey poults. I also conducted an analysis evaluating various estimates of wild turkey poult survival. Survival estimates obtained from the flush count method for poults 0 - 4 weeks of age were found to be comparable to those obtained by radio telemetry. The influence of age, capture technique, and behavior on survival was also examined. Capture technique did not affect hen survival. Adult hens had significantly different survival among seasons across years. However, when survival was evaluated on the basis of individual hen nesting behavior, no difference was detected. I studied the influence of movements, dispersal distances, home range size, and characteristics of vegetation at the nest site on nest success. I failed to identify any significant relationships between the probability of nest success and any of the variables evaluated. Habitat selection has been studied extensively for wildlife populations, but generally from a population level without regard to an individual 2 ̆ 7 s familiarity or access to a habitat. I used detailed movement information to evaluate habitat selection at an individual level and then identified structural habitat characteristics common across areas used by individuals, given that some individuals had knowledge of more than 1 area that was structurally similar. I found that adult hens with broods occupied areas that were structurally different from <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> <b>visited</b> prior to incubation...|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1953, a {{composite}} camp (consisting of scouts from various troops attending as individuals with leadership {{provided by the}} camp staff) called Camp Kennaway, was run on the site.

50|$|A {{community}} centre was built alongside the council chambers in 1982, adjoining the library.

There is also a modern shopping centre called Burnside Village that attracts people from <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> to <b>visit</b> Burnside. Further upgrades took place in 2001, resulting in a modern library and {{community centre}} for residents. Burnside developed a new council logo in 1993, utilising the colours of green and purple. Green represents the lush parks and reserves in Burnside, and purple represents the prominent Jacaranda trees. The adjacent suburbs of Skye and Auldana were merged into Burnside in 1999.

50|$|With a cool {{climate and}} {{relatively}} high elevation, Xiengkhouang produces many food items and forest {{products that are}} either not available or in scarce supply {{in other parts of}} the country. Specialty fruits of the province (seasonally available dependent on species) are Chinese pears (mak jong), passion fruit (mak nawt), peaches (mak kai), and plums (mak mun). Many different varieties of mushrooms are found here, such as hed deep, a yellow, flower-like mushroom common to the area. hed wai specific to the region, is exported at high prices (US$30-40/kg) to connoisseurs throughout the world. Another notable medicinal forest product unique to the province is ya hua, a root used to give strength and good appetite and for treating ailments experienced by women after giving birth. Xiangkhouang's local chili pastes are the jaeow bong, a sour version of the famous chili paste from Luang Prabang, and jaeow pa khem, a paste made from salted fish. One of the unusual foods that Xiengkhouang is famous for, available only here, is sour swallow (nok ann toong). Every year, beginning in August-September, migratory swallows, traveling from Russia and <b>other</b> northern <b>areas,</b> <b>visit</b> Xiengkhouang to bathe on dust platforms located on hill tops. The swallows are caught and placed in a container to ferment. Later they are prepared by either frying or cooking in a stew. The birds are best eaten whole—without the feathers of course.|$|R

Spunky, sarcastic, and very curious, she solves mysteries surrounding her town and <b>other</b> <b>areas</b> she <b>visits.</b> Frequently she is tormented both by other kids in school and on the street by people she meets, and whose emotions are constantly tested.

50|$|The {{authorities}} destroyed China's {{cultural heritage}} and Leys describes the different <b>areas</b> that he <b>visited</b> during his stay in China, {{and the situation}} in each one. Canton Province was rundown, but the atmosphere was more relaxed compared to Peking. There was also less interference from the central government and more outside influence, so foreigners are {{able to go to}} public places without causing a commotion. However, this less favored area faced poverty and also had a problem with juvenile delinquency. The delinquents were usually young urban people that were sent to the countryside to correct their behavior during the Cultural Revolution. They were often deported from their family, and were under army guidance, so their behavior was understandable. <b>Other</b> <b>areas</b> that Leys <b>visited</b> included Tientsin, Peitaiho, Linhsien, Chiengchow, Anyang, Hofei, Shanghai, Soochow and Hangchow. When traveling between provinces, foreigners are required to carry a pass that lists the places they are allowed to visit in detail, and the document must be stamped by security officials when you arrive, and when you depart. If a foreigner was to show up in a province unexpected, they {{would not be allowed to}} go and wander the city because they do not have permission to be there, instead they would be encouraged to stay in the hotel until their next train arrived.|$|R
