The sum of the observed fluorescent corneal areas is taken into account as an endpoint of <b>ocular</b> <b>irritation.</b> Eight currently used nonionic, cationic and anionic surfactants were applied onto the cornea of rabbits and mice, four times per day during 3 days at various concentrations. Benzalkonium chloride, a cationic surfactant, at a concentration range of 0. 01 - 0. 5 %, was tested in the same manner. The cornea was evaluated in vivo for ocular tolerance by confocal microscopy. In both rabbits and mice, the test revealed following irritation rankings: cationic>anionic>nonionic surfactants. Furthermore, in both animal models, the ocular damage increased with the concentration of benzalkonium.

40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} {{the short term}} cardiovascular, respiratory, and intraocular pressure (IOP) effects of four glaucoma medications in newly diagnosed glaucoma patients.  METHODS— 141 newly diagnosed glaucoma patients were recruited and underwent a full ocular, cardiovascular, and respiratory examination, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and spirometry. They were prescribed one of four topical glaucoma medications and reviewed 3  months later. One eye of each patient was randomly chosen for analysis, performed using analysis of variance and the χ 2 test.  RESULTS—Latanoprost had the greatest mean IOP lowering effect in both the primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) (p =  0. 005) and the "presumed" normal tension glaucoma (NTG) groups (p =  0. 33), reducing the IOP by 8. 9  mm Hg and 4. 1  mm Hg respectively. Timolol was associated with lowered pulse rates and reductions in the spirometry measurements. 41 % of patients using brimonidine complained of systemic side effects and over 55 % of patients using betaxolol complained of <b>ocular</b> <b>irritation.</b> 28 % of patients required an alteration in their glaucoma management.  CONCLUSIONS—Latanoprost {{appears to be a}} useful primary treatment for glaucoma patients, in view of superior IOP control and a low incidence of local and systemic side effects. Timolol causes a reduction in measurements of respiratory function, a concern in view of the potential subclinical reversible airways disease in the elderly glaucoma population.

Results: There were 63 subjects, mean age 43. 8 years (&#x 002 B;/- 14. 7 years) with various complaints of dryness presenting as having irritation or foreign body sensation. A group of 17 asymptomatic subjects, mean age 42. 1 years (&#x 002 B;/- 12. 7 years) were studied as controls. There were 22 (34. 9 &#x 0025;) males and 41 (65. 1 &#x 0025;) females in the symptomatic group while the control group had 4 (23. 5 &#x 0025;) males and 13 (76. 5 &#x 0025;) females. <b>Ocular</b> <b>irritations</b> included itching 38 (60. 3 &#x 0025;), pricking and itching 10 (15. 9 &#x 0025;). Mean Shirmer&#x 2032;s test values were lower for symptomatic subjects (mean 14. 5 mm &#x 002 B;/- 12. 3 right eye; 14. 9 mm &#x 002 B;/- 12. 4 left eye), compared to the controls (23. 0 mm &#x 002 B;/- 13. 4 right eye; 17. 9 mm &#x 002 B;/- 13. 4 left eye) P= 0. 02, for right eye and 0. 4 for left. The mean TBUT were also lower amongst the symptomatic subjects (10. 5 seconds, right eye and 10. 1 seconds left eye), while for controls mean TBUT was 12. 7 seconds right eye and 12. 1 seconds left eye (P= 0. 2). Fifty -six out of 126 (46. 8 &#x 0025;) eyes of all symptomatic subjects compared to 7 out of 34 (20. 6 &#x 0025;) eyes of asymptomatic subjects had positive staining of conjunctiva with rose Bengal (p= 0. 06). For subjects with itching as the primary symptom 44. 7 &#x 0025; of them as opposed to 23. 5 &#x 0025; of the controls were likely to stain positive with rose Bengal, (sensitivity of itching as screening tool for dry eye was 81 &#x 0025;, specificity 38. 2 &#x 0025;). Itching and pricking sensation together (sensitivity 46. 2 &#x 0025; and specificity improved to 65 &#x 0025;).

Methods: A PLA-g-CS copolymer was synthesized via a “protection-graft-deprotection” procedure and its structure was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray diffraction spectra. Amphotericin B-loaded nanoparticles based on PLA-g-CS (AmB/PLA-g-CS) were prepared by the dialysis method and characterized for particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency. Studies of these AmB/PLA-g-CS nanoparticles, including their mucoadhesive strength, drug release properties, antifungal activity, <b>ocular</b> <b>irritation,</b> <b>ocular</b> pharmacokinetics, and corneal penetration were performed in vitro and in vivo. Results: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray diffraction spectra showed that the PLA chains were successfully grafted onto chitosan molecules and that crystallization of chitosan was suppressed. The self-aggregated PLA-g-CS nanoparticles had a core-shell structure with an average particle size of approximately 200 nm and zeta potentials higher than 30 mV. Amphotericin B was incorporated into the hydrophobic core of the nanoparticles with high encapsulation efficiency. Sustained drug release from the nanoparticles was observed in vitro. The <b>ocular</b> <b>irritation</b> study showed no sign of irritation after instillation of the PLA-g-CS nanoparticles into rabbit eyes. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the AmB/PLA-g-CS nanoparticles showed antifungal activity similar to that of free amphotericin B against Candida albicans. The in vivo ocular pharmacokinetic study suggested that the PLA-g-CS nanoparticles have the advantage of prolonging residence time at the ocular surface. The corneal penetration study showed that the PLA-g-CS nanoparticles could penetrate into the cornea.

Methods and materials: This retrospective study enrolled 30  subjects diagnosed with conjunctivochalasis. Complete ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity assessment, slit-lamp examination, applanation tonometry, dilated funduscopy, tear break-up time, Schirmer 1  test, and fluorescein staining were performed in all patients. Age, sex, laterality, ocular history, symptoms, and clinical findings were recorded. Results: The study included 50  eyes from 30  cases. Ages ranged from 45  to 80  years, {{with a mean age}} of 65 ± 10  years. CChs grading were as follows: 30  (60 %) eyes with grade 1  CCh; 15  (30 %) eyes with grade 2  CCh; and five (10 %) eyes with grade 3  CCh. CCh was located in the inferior bulbar conjunctiva in 45  (90 %) eyes, and in the remaining five (10 %) CCh was located in the superior bulbar conjunctiva. Ten (33. 3 %) patients had no symptoms. Dryness, eye pain, redness, blurry vision, tired eye feeling, and epiphora were the symptoms encountered in the remaining twenty (63. 6 %) patients. Altered tear meniscus was noted in all cases.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the microscopic changes in rats at 3 hr and on days 1. 2, 3. 4. 7. 14. and 35 following treatment with anionic. cationic, and nonionic surfactants of differing irritancy. The right cyc of each rat was-treated by placing 10 pI of a surfactant directly on the cornea. Untreated left eyes served as the controls. At each time point, eyes and eyelids were macroscopically examined and collected for microscopic examination. Macroscopically. the differing levels of irritation were characterized by differences in incidence and magnitude of scores, reflecting involvement of the cornea, conjunctiva. and iris, as well as by the incidence of neovascularization and time to recovery. Microscop-ically. differences in the area and depth of injury, paralleled the differences seen grossly and the relative irritancies of the various surfactants. All surfactants affected the corneal and conjunctival epithelium. All surfactants, except the slightly irritating anionic surfactant, caused corneal stromal changes, with this involvement being proportional to their overall level of irritation. Corneal endothelial cell effects principally occurred with only the severely irritating cationic surfactant. Over time, responses to surfactants of differing irritancy were qualitatively and quantitatively different. and these differences correlated with the extent of initial injury. Qualitative differences in response included presence of keratocyte regeneration, corneal neovascularization, and conjunctivalization of the corneal epithelium with all of the surfactants except the slight irritant.

On a cellular level, Okumura et al. found that ripasudil produced [...] "guttae-like" [...] formations in ocular endothelial cells post-administration, which was attributed to, [...] "protrusion formation along intracellular borders caused by the reduction in actomyosin contractility of the CECs." [...] However, these morphological changes to the eye were considered transient and therefore quick to reverse, unlike symptoms Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy, a disorder for which these short-lived symptoms could be mistaken.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of {{recurrent}} nummular keratitis in a pediatric patient with Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome. Methods: A retrospective chart review. Results: A 14 -year-old boy with Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) presented with photophobia and <b>ocular</b> <b>irritation</b> concomitant with disease exacerbation. He was found on exam to have significant nummular keratitis, which responded to a short course of topical steroids. Despite acute response to local immunosuppression, the patient had several recurrent attacks and eventually developed a large corneal scar and decreased vision. After initiation of infliximab therapy his ocular sequelae improved dramatically and his vision returned to 20 / 20. Conclusion: One possible form of end-organ damage associated with HIDS is vision threatening nummular keratopathy. Background Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) results from mutations in the mevalonate kinase (MVK) gen...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVanilloid receptors (VRs) play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} transduction of peripheral tissue injury and/or inflammation responses. Molecules that antagonize VR channel activity may act as selective and potent analgesics. We report that synthetic arginine-rich hexapeptides block heterologously expressed VR- 1 channels with submicromolar efficacy in a weak voltage-dependent manner, consistent with a binding site located near/at the entryway of the aqueous pore. Dynorphins, natural arginine-rich peptides, also blocked VR- 1 activity with micromolar affinity. Notably, synthetic and natural arginine-rich peptides attenuated the <b>ocular</b> <b>irritation</b> produced by topical capsaicin application onto the eyes of experimental animals. Taken together, our results imply that arginine-rich peptides are VR- 1 channel blockers with analgesic activity. These findings may expand the development of novel analgesics by targeting receptor sites distinct from the capsaicin binding site...|$|R
