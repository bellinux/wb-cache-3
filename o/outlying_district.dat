These Selenites we have seen may be only the equivalent of cowboys and engine-tenders.

Though they could see it, {{it was impossible to}} throw the lasso over its head, and, after vainly trying to dislodge it, they at length set fire to the reeds. Still it refused to stir, but lay with head erect, fiercely glaring at them through the flames. Finally it disappeared from sight in the black smoke; and when the fire had burnt itself out, it was found, dead and charred, in the same spot.|$|E

6000|$|Over all the <b>outlying</b> <b>district</b> was a hush of dreadful {{excitement}} on that Sunday morning.

One of the young mistresses, persisting in dancing on the cabin roof of the launch, wilful young madam, drowned {{in the midst of}} the festival, with the young doctor! Everywhere on the Sunday morning, the colliers wandered about, discussing the calamity. At all the Sunday dinners of the people, there seemed a strange presence. It was as if the angel of death were very near, there was a sense of the supernatural in the air. The men had excited, startled faces, the women looked solemn, some of them had been crying. The children enjoyed the excitement at first. There was an intensity in the air, almost magical. Did all enjoy it? Did all enjoy the thrill? ...|$|E
