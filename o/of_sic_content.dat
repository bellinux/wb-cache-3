50|$|AlSiC {{parts are}} {{typically}} manufactured by near net shape approach, {{by creating a}} SiC preform by metal injection molding of an SiC-binder slurry, fired to remove the binder, then infiltrated under pressure with molten aluminium. Parts {{can be made with}} sufficiently low tolerances to not require further machining. The material is fully dense, without voids, and is hermetic. High stiffness and low density appears making larger parts with thin wall, and manufacturing large fins for heat dissipation. AlSiC can be plated with nickel and nickel-gold, or by other metals by thermal spraying. Ceramic and metal insets can be inserted into the preform before aluminium infiltration, resulting in a hermetic seal. AlSiC can be also prepared by mechanical alloying.

50|$|While UHTCs have {{desirable}} thermal {{and mechanical}} properties, they {{are susceptible to}} oxidation at their elevated operating temperatures. The metal component oxidizes to a gas such as CO2 or NO2, which is rapidly lost at the elevated temperatures UHTCs are most useful at; boron, for example, readily oxidizes to B2O3 which becomes a liquid at 490 °C and vaporizes very rapidly above 1100 °C; in addition, their brittleness makes them poor engineering materials. Current research targets increasing their toughness and oxidation resistance by exploring composites with silicon carbide, the incorporation of fibers, {{and the addition of}} rare-earth hexaborides such as lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). It has been found that the oxidative resistance of HfB2 and ZrB2 are greatly enhanced through the inclusion of 30% weight silicon carbide due to the formation of a protective glassy surface layer upon the application of temperatures in excess of 1000 °C composed of SiO2. To determine the effect <b>of</b> <b>SiC</b> <b>content</b> on diboride oxidation, ManLabs conducted a series of furnace oxidation experiments, in which the oxidation scale thickness as a function of temperature for pure HfB2, SiC and HfB2 20v% SiC were compared. At temperatures greater than 2100 K the oxide scale thickness on pure HfB2 is thinner than that on pure SiC, and HfB2/20% SiC has the best oxidation resistance. Extreme heat treatment leads to greater oxidation resistance as well as improved mechanical properties such as fracture resistance.|$|E

Tabular {{structure}} <b>of</b> Al 4 <b>SiC</b> 4 -Al 8 SiC 7 composites {{was successfully}} synthesized using a mixture <b>of</b> calcined bauxite, <b>SiC</b> and carbon black by a carbothermal reduction process. The {{effects of the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>SiC</b> addition and the heating temperature on synthesis <b>of</b> Al 4 <b>SiC</b> 4 -Al 8 SiC 7 composites by carbothermic reduction were investigated. The results show that SiC amount {{played an important role}} in the content of the final products. With the increasing of heating temperature, the Al 4 <b>SiC</b> 4 <b>content</b> increased and Al 8 <b>SiC</b> 7 <b>content</b> decreased in the products, which indicated the formation and growth <b>of</b> Al 4 <b>SiC</b> 4 were promoted...|$|R

The preparation steps involved the vigorous mixing of the powders and drying under conditions where the homogeneous mixture was kept stable, Pressureless sintering of die-pressed powders achieved reasonable densities (similar to 97 % theoretical density) for 2. 5 wt% <b>of</b> <b>SiC</b> on sintering at 2073 K. Higher <b>SIC</b> <b>contents</b> strongly reduced the sintered density. The {{use of a}} more reactive alumina (finer matrix powder) gave similar results, Hot pressing at 1973 K/ 1 h/ 25 MPa produced high-density materials for <b>SiC</b> <b>contents</b> Bs high as 20 wt%. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the SiC particles were well distributed and were situated both inside the grains and on the grain boundaries of the alumina matrix, The SiC strongly inhibited grain growth in the matrix {{in keeping with the}} Zener model. The bend strength increased as the <b>SiC</b> <b>content</b> increased, a result partly explained by the grain size refinement. The strength improvement of 20 % over monolithic was explained In terms of the change to an intergranular fracture mode...|$|R
