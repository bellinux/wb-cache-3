40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} whether a central government should privatize a polluting firm in a region under circumstances in which transboundary pollution occurs. This paper’s characteristic feature is its consideration of circumstances under which the degree of influence that pollution emissions exert on the environment can be assessed on various levels. Theoretical studies of privatization and the environment in recent years include those of Beladi and Chao (2006), who regard a monopoly public firm as considering the consumers’ surplus and private profit when the firm chooses the <b>output</b> <b>of</b> a <b>good.</b> In contrast, in the analysis described herein, the public firm considers not only the consumers’ surplus and the private profit, but also the environmental damage that occurs when the firm chooses the <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good.</b> Beladi and Chao (2006) conclude that privatization will decrease the <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good.</b> In contrast, our analyses demonstrate that when the effect that emissions have on environmental damage is small (large), privatization will decrease (increase) the <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good</b> in the region. Based on results presented above, this paper presents a demonstration that when the effects that emissions have on environmental damage are large (small), then the optimal policy decision of {{the government is not}} (full) privatization.

The average hours per work week declined to 33, the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964.With the decline of gross domestic product came the decline in innovation. With fewer resources to risk in creative destruction, the number of patent applications flat-lined.

50|$|In {{economic}}s, {{the study}} of economic development was borne out of an extension to traditional economics that focused entirely on national product, or the aggregate <b>output</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services. Economic development was concerned in the expansion of people’s entitlements and their corresponding capabilities, morbidity, nourishment, literacy, education, and other socio-economic indicators. Borne out of the backdrop of Keynesian, advocating government intervention, and neoclassical economics, stressing reduced intervention, with rise of high-growth countries (Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong) and planned governments (Argentina, Chile, Sudan, Uganda), economic development, more generally development economics, emerged amidst these mid-20th century theoretical interpretations of how economies prosper. Also, economist Albert O. Hirschman, {{a major contributor to}} development economics, asserted that economic development grew to concentrate on the poor regions of the world, primarily in Africa, Asia and Latin America yet on the outpouring of fundamental ideas and models.|$|E

5000|$|The {{classical}} aggregate supply curve comprises a short-run aggregate supply {{curve and}} a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve. The short-run curve visualizes the total planned <b>output</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> {{and services in}} the economy at a particular price level. The [...] "short-run" [...] {{is defined as the}} period during which only final good prices adjust and factor, or input, costs do not. The [...] "long-run" [...] is the period after which factor prices are able to adjust accordingly. The short-run aggregate supply curve has an upward slope for the same reasons the Keynesian AS curve has one: the law of diminishing returns and the scarcity of resources. The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because factor prices will have adjusted. Factor prices increase if producing at a point beyond full employment output, shifting the short-run aggregate supply inwards so equilibrium occurs somewhere along full employment output. Monetarists have argued that demand-side expansionary policies favoured by Keynesian economists are solely inflationary. As the aggregate demand curve is shifted outward, the general price level increases. This increased price level causes households, or the owners of the factors of production to demand higher prices for their goods and services. The consequence of this is increased production costs for firms, causing short-run aggregate demand to shift back inwards. The theoretical ultimate result is inflation.|$|E
50|$|Macedonia is {{vulnerable}} to economic developments in Europe - due to strong banking and trade ties - and dependent on regional integration and progress toward EU membership for continued economic growth. At independence in September 1991, Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5% of the total federal <b>output</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services. The collapse of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence of infrastructure, UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia, and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996. Since then, Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation, but it has so far lagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs, despite making extensive fiscal and business sector reforms. Official unemployment remains high at 24.6% (2015, Q4), but may be overstated based {{on the existence of}} an extensive gray market that is not captured by official statistics. In the wake of the global economic downturn, Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign direct investment, lowered credit availability, and a large trade deficit. However, as a result of conservative fiscal policies and a sound financial system, in 2010 the country credit rating improved slightly to BB+ and was kept at that level in 2011. Macroeconomic stability has been maintained by a prudent monetary policy, which keeps the domestic currency pegged against the euro. As a result, GDP growth was modest, but positive, in 2010 and 2011, and inflation was under control. Latest data from Macedonia's State Statistical Office show that overall, output for 2012 dropped by 6.6 percent compared to 2011.|$|E
