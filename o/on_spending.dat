Teenager Kevin Nolan was also promoted from the youth team, whilst 35-year-old defender Colin Hendry arrived on loan.

In {{the first game of}} the season, Hester caught seven passes from Cutler for 90 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown reception. In the following weeks Hester began to develop a rapport with Cutler and amassed 634 receiving yards and three touchdowns though the first ten weeks of the season. He played the best game of the season on October 25, 2009 against the Cincinnati Bengals, catching eight passes for 101 yards and a touchdown. In a game against the St. Louis Rams during the thirteenth week of the season, Hester injured his calf and missed three starts. Hester returned to play in the Bears season finale against the Detroit Lions, catching three passes for 75 yards. Despite missing the three starts, Hester led the team with 757 receiving yards, and finished behind Greg Olsen in receptions. Hester built his reputation around his kick returning abilities, but his kickoff-returning duties decreased significantly following the 2007 season finale.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{public spending}} efficiency {{and the effect}} of political and economic factors <b>on</b> public <b>spending</b> efficiency in East Asian countries for the period 2000 - 2007. In the first stage, the non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is used to estimate public spending efficiency scores.

Results of the study show that China is relatively efficient in public <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> education, health, and maintaining economic performance and stability, Japan on infrastructure, and Singapore on promoting public services. In addition, countries in East Asia are relatively less efficient in public spending for promoting equal income distribution.

Fox won an Emmy award for Spin City in 2000, three Golden Globe Awards in 1998, 1999, and 2000, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1999 and 2000.

He announced that he planned to continue to act and would make guest appearances on Spin City (he made three more appearances on the show during the final season).

First, {{there have been many}} recent calls for the (relatively new) UK R&D subsidy to be extended to other “research ” activities, such as software. Second, argument still rages about the efficacy of direct public <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> R&D via <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> academic research councils, universities, and government undertaken work on civil and military R&D. To evaluate these questions we use data on market sector productivity, R&D and non-R&D intangible assets, and public sector R&D spending. We look for evidence of market sector spillovers from intangible investment and from public R&D. We find (a) no evidence of spillover effects from intangible investment at the market sector level, including from R&D, (b) strong evidence of market sector spillovers from public R&D <b>spend</b> <b>on</b> research councils, and (c) no evidence of market sector spillovers from public <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> civil or defence R&D.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} {{the cost of}} psychotropic drugs {{and its impact on}} the Brazilian family budget in 2003 and 2009 comparatively. MethodsThis study had a cross-sectional design. Data were obtained from the Family Budget Surveys conducted in 2003 and 2009, including interviews in 48, 470 and 55, 970 homes of all Brazilian regions, respectively. The main measures are prevalence of psychotropic drug acquisition, monetary and nonmonetary expenses with psychotropic drugs, total <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> drugs, <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> health, total household spending, and estimated mean monthly household income. All incomes and expenses from the 2003 survey were adjusted by inflation. ResultsThere was a reduction in the prevalence of psychotropic drug acquisition by Brazilian households from 13. 0 % in 2003 to 11. 2 % in 2009. The mean monthly household <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs, however, rose from R $ 54. 38 in 2003 to R $ 78. 73 in 2009. The percentage of <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs from the expenses with health increased 27 %. ConclusionsThe increase in <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs can be due to a rise in their prices, the acquisition of more modern or more expensive drugs, or the increase in the number of drugs used. Proportionally, <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> psychotropic drugs grew more than did <b>spending</b> <b>on</b> health by Brazilian families...|$|R

The Velasco government inherited recessionary conditions in 1968, with a positive external balance and productive capacity readily available for expansion. It maintained effective restraint <b>on</b> <b>spending</b> and deficits for several years but then let things get out of control. The central government's deficit was no more than 1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1970, but its own deficit plus that of the greatly expanded group of state firms reached 10 percent of GNP by 1975. Correspondingly, the external current-account balance was positive in the period 1968-70 but showed a deficit equal to 10 percent of GNP by 1975.|$|E
