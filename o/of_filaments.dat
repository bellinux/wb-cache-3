25|$|The {{earliest}} headlamps were {{fueled by}} acetylene or oil, and {{were introduced in}} the late 1880s. Acetylene lamps were popular because the flame is resistant to wind and rain. The first electric headlamps were introduced in 1898 on the Columbia Electric Car from the Electric Vehicle Company of Hartford, Connecticut, and were optional. Two factors limited {{the widespread use of}} electric headlamps: the short life <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> in the harsh automotive environment, and the difficulty of producing dynamos small enough, yet powerful enough to produce sufficient current.|$|E
25|$|Next, the two plastid-dividing rings, or PD rings form. The inner plastid-dividing ring {{is located}} in the inner side of the {{chloroplast}}'s inner membrane, and is formed first. The outer plastid-dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane. It consists <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> about 5 nanometers across, arranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart, and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast. This is when chloroplast constriction begins. In a few species like Cyanidioschyzon merol√¶, chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.|$|E
25|$|In visible light, the Crab Nebula {{consists}} of a broadly oval-shaped mass <b>of</b> <b>filaments,</b> about 6arcminutes long and 4arcminutes wide (by comparison, the full moon is 30arcminutes across) surrounding a diffuse blue central region.

25|$|The prokaryotic {{cytoskeleton}} is {{the collective}} name for all structural filaments in prokaryotes.

25|$|Although {{only a few}} {{centimetres}} thick at most, microbial mats {{create a}} wide range of internal chemical environments, and hence generally consist of layers of microorganisms that can feed on or at least tolerate the dominant chemicals at their level and which are usually of closely related species. In moist conditions mats are usually held together by slimy substances secreted by the microorganisms, and in many cases some of the microorganisms form tangled webs <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> which make the mat tougher. The best known physical forms are flat mats and stubby pillars called stromatolites, but there are also spherical forms.|$|E
25|$|In {{materials}} science, {{and especially}} elasticity theory, ideas of torsion also {{play an important}} role. One problem models the growth of vines, focusing {{on the question of}} how vines manage to twist around objects. The vine itself is modeled as a pair of elastic filaments twisted around one another. In its energy-minimizing state, the vine naturally grows {{in the shape of a}} helix. But the vine may also be stretched out to maximize its extent (or length). In this case, the torsion of the vine is related to the torsion of the pair <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> (or equivalently the surface torsion of the ribbon connecting the filaments), and it reflects the difference between the length-maximizing (geodesic) configuration of the vine and its energy-minimizing configuration.|$|E

25|$|Anchiornis huxleyi was a small, bipedal {{theropod}} dinosaur with {{a triangular}} skull bearing several details {{in common with}} dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and primitive avialans. Like other early paravians, Anchiornis was small, {{about the size of}} a crow. It had long, wing-bearing arms, long legs, and a long tail. Like all paravians, it was covered in feathers, though it also had scales on certain parts of the body. The wings, legs, and tail supported long but relatively narrow vaned feathers. Two types of simpler, downy (plumaceous) feathers covered the rest of the body, as in Sinornithosaurus: down feathers made up <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> attached at their bases, and more complex down feathers with barbs attached along a central quill. Long, simple feathers covered almost the entire head and neck, torso, upper legs, and the first half of the tail. The rest of the tail bore pennaceous tail feathers (rectrices). Long feathers on the head (crown) may have formed a crest. While the first specimen of Anchiornis preserved only faint traces of feathers around the preserved portion of the body, many more well-preserved fossils have since been found. Studies of Anchiornis specimens using laser fluorescence have revealed not only more details of the feathers, but also of the skin and muscle tissue. Taken together, this evidence has given scientists a nearly complete picture of Anchiornis anatomy.|$|E
25|$|Photolithography {{involves}} {{exposing a}} light source to a photoresist-coated silicon wafer; a mask with the desired pattern is {{place between the}} light source and the wafer, thereby selectively allowing light to filter through and create the pattern on the photoresist. Further development of the wafer brings out the pattern in the photoresist. Photolithography performed in the near-UV is often viewed as the standard for fabricating topographies on the micro-scale. However, because the lower limit for size {{is a function of}} the wavelength, this method cannot be used to create nanoscale features. In their 2005 study, Mahoney et al. created organized arrays of polyimide channels (11¬µm in height and 20‚Äì60¬µm in width) were created on a glass substrate by photolithography. Polyimide was used because it adheres to glass well, is chemically stable in aqueous solution, and is biocompatible. It is hypothesized that the microchannels limited the range of angles that cytoskeletal elements within the neurite growth cones could accumulate, assemble, and orient. There was a significant decrease in the number of neurites emerging from the soma; however, there was less decrease as the range of angles over which the neurites emerged was increased. Also, the neurites were on average two times longer when the neurons were cultured on the microchannels versus the controls on a flat surface; this could be due to a more efficient alignment <b>of</b> <b>filaments.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although the {{cytoskeleton}} is {{not part}} of the cytosol, the presence of this network <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> restricts the diffusion of large particles in the cell. For example, in several studies tracer particles larger than about 25nanometres (about the size of a ribosome) [...] were excluded from parts of the cytosol around the edges of the cell and next to the nucleus. These [...] "excluding compartments" [...] may contain a much denser meshwork of actin fibres than the remainder of the cytosol. These microdomains could influence the distribution of large structures such as ribosomes and organelles within the cytosol by excluding them from some areas and concentrating them in others.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from an experimental research effort {{to gain a}} more complete understanding of the physics of tensile fracture in unidirectionally reinforced B-Al composite sheet. By varying the degree <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> degradation resulting from fabrication, composite specimens were produced which failed in tension by the cumulative mode, the noncumulative mode, or by any desired {{combination of the two}} modes. Radiographic and acoustic emission techniques were combined to identify and physically describe a previously unrecognized fundamental fracture mechanism which was responsible for the noncumulative mode. The tensile strength of the composite was found to be severely limited by the noncumulative mechanism which involved the initiation and sustenance of a chain reaction <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> fractures at a relatively low stress level followed by ductile fracture of the matrix. The minimum average filament stress required for initiation of the fracture mechanism was shown to be approximately 170 ksi, and appeared to be independent <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> diameter, number <b>of</b> <b>filament</b> layers, and the identity of the matrix alloy...|$|R

2500|$|Moulton and Chamberlin {{suggested}} that a star had passed close to the Sun early in its life to cause tidal bulges and that this, along with the internal process that leads to solar prominences, [...] resulted in the ejection <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> of matter from both stars. While most of the material would have fallen back, part of it would remain in orbit. The filaments cooled into numerous, tiny, solid fragments, ‚Äòplanetesimals‚Äô, and a few larger protoplanets. [...] This model received favourable support for about 3 decades but passed out of favour by the late '30s and was discarded in the '40s by the realization it was incompatible with the angular momentum of Jupiter, but a part of it, planetesimal accretion, was retained.|$|E
2500|$|Actin is {{a family}} of {{globular}} multi-functional proteins that form microfilaments. It is found in essentially all eukaryotic cells (the only known exception being nematode sperm), where it may be present at a concentration of over 100 ŒºM. [...] An actin protein's mass is roughly 42-kDa, with a diameter of 4 to 7nm, {{and it is the}} monomeric subunit of two types <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the cytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells. It can be present as either a free monomer called G-actin (globular) or as part of a linear polymer microfilament called F-actin (filamentous), both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division.|$|E
2500|$|Normally, {{bacteria}} {{have different}} {{shapes and sizes}} which include coccus, rod and helical/spiral (among others less common) and that allow for their classification. For instance, rod shapes may allow bacteria to attach more readily in environments with shear stress (e.g., in flowing water). Cocci may have access to small pores, creating more attachment sites per cell and hiding themselves from external shear forces. Spiral bacteria combine some of the characteristics cocci (small footprints) and <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> (more surface area on which shear forces can act) {{and the ability to}} form an unbroken set of cells to build biofilms. [...] Several bacteria alter their morphology in response to the types and concentrations of external compounds. Bacterial morphology changes help to optimize interactions with cells and the surfaces to which they attach. This mechanism has been described in bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{successful}} light bulb filaments {{were made of}} carbon (from carbonized paper or bamboo). Early carbon filaments had a negative {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} ‚Äî as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the [...] "flashing" [...] process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> as well as their efficiency. A metallized or [...] "graphitized" [...] filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage.|$|E
2500|$|Diatoms are a {{major group}} of microalgae, and {{are among the most}} common types of phytoplankton. Diatoms are unicellular, {{although}} they can form colonies in the shape <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> or ribbons (e.g. Fragilaria), fans (e.g. Meridion), zigzags (e.g. Tabellaria), or stars (e.g. Asterionella). The first diatom formally described in scientific literature, the colonial Bacillaria paradoxa, was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich M√ºller. Diatoms are producers within the food chain. [...] A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica (hydrated silicon dioxide) called a frustule. These frustules show a wide diversity in form, but are usually almost bilaterally symmetrical, hence the group name. The symmetry is not perfect since one of the valves is slightly larger than the other, allowing one valve to fit inside the edge of the other. Fossil evidence suggests that they originated during, or before, the early Jurassic period. Only male gametes of centric diatoms are capable of movement by means of flagella. Diatom communities are a popular tool for monitoring environmental conditions, past and present, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.|$|E
2500|$|A {{mushroom}} develops from a nodule, or pinhead, {{less than}} two millimeters in diameter, called a primordium, which is typically found {{on or near the}} surface of the substrate. It is formed within the mycelium, the mass of threadlike hyphae that make up the fungus. The primordium enlarges into a roundish structure of interwoven hyphae roughly resembling an egg, called a [...] "button". The button has a cottony roll of mycelium, the universal veil, that surrounds the developing fruit body. As the egg expands, the universal veil ruptures and may remain as a cup, or volva, {{at the base of the}} stalk, or as warts or volval patches on the cap. Many mushrooms lack a universal veil, therefore they do not have either a volva or volval patches. Often, a second layer of tissue, the partial veil, covers the bladelike gills that bear spores. As the cap expands, the veil breaks, and remnants of the partial veil may remain as a ring, or annulus, around the middle of the stalk or as fragments hanging from the margin of the cap. The ring may be skirt-like as in some species of Amanita, collar-like as in many species of Lepiota, or merely the faint remnants of a cortina (a partial veil composed <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> resembling a spiderweb), which is typical of the genus Cortinarius. Mushrooms lacking partial veils do not form an annulus.|$|E
