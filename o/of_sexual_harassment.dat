5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} association between peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>of</b> female high school juniors and seniors and their grade point average, a composite of negative school indicators that interfere with access to education, career aspirations, and career decision making self-efficacy. It also studied the moderating effect of mother attachment, father attachment, and school climate on the dependent variables. Two hundred and twenty four girls (2 sophomores, 12 freshmen, 99 juniors and 111 seniors) from four senior high schools in a medium sized mid-western city were surveyed. The participants were part of Psychology and English classes at the schools. Because the girls were minors, in order {{to participate in the}} research, they had to sign a consent form and obtain a written consent form from their parents or legal guardians. Approximately one third of the girls who were asked to participate in research were unable to, because they failed to return the parent consent forms. Many of the girls who did not participate expressed disappointment at not being able to complete the survey. None complained about the <b>sexual</b> content <b>of</b> the survey questions. Several parents expressed interest in the survey and asked to see the results once they were available. Three analyses were conducted to examine (1) the extent and type <b>of</b> peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> (2) the effect <b>of</b> peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> on the dependent variables, and (3) whether there was a moderating effect <b>of</b> peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> on the dependent variables by mother attachment, father attachment, and school climate. Additional analyses were also conducted on the four research hypotheses to examine whether the effect <b>of</b> peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> on the dependent variables would be greater for more frequently harassed study participants. Additional analyses were also conducted to factor analyze questions concerning negative school related effects <b>of</b> peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between perpetrator and target, {{as a factor}} in school peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> has been particularly neglected (Stein, 1999). This relationship spans nonromantic and romantic interest between peers. This paper focuses on peer relationship, as a dimension of overlap and intersection between peer school <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> and dating violence. My project is a qualitative interview-study <b>of</b> the <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> experiences <b>of</b> eighteen 13 to 20 -year-olds, particularly where there is romantic interest involved between harasser and target. The study's findings show school <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> and teen dating violence to overlap and intersect in the areas of behavior (physical or nonphysical), relationship (romantic or nonromantic), and location (more private to more public places at or away from school). Important contextual information about school <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> revealed by the data includes: (1) school <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> occurring in all peer relationships, including dating and ex-dating relationships, (2) patterns <b>of</b> school <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> behavior that resemble obsessive control in stalking and dating violence, (3) the protracted or violent nature of the harassment (like dating violence), and (4) the high levels of upset and injury experienced by the target (similar to dating violence). My results suggest that peer relationship context is critical to understanding significant aspects <b>of</b> peer <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment,</b> including the power and gender dynamics which underlie the behaviors, and to revealing its similarities and overlap with dating violence...|$|R
