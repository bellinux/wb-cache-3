5|$|Despite the truce, the chronicler Ibn Wadih {{mentions}} Arab raids into Asia Minor for {{the years}} 783, 784 and 785. If true, then these would probably represent only minor affairs, as the main sources agree that the truce was mutually respected until spring 785. In that year, as Irene had strengthened her hold over the army and was preparing to confront the iconoclasts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>front,</b> she decided to cease payment of the tribute, and hostilities recommenced. In early 786, the Byzantines scored a major success, sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids {{had spent the last}} five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions. After the accession of Harun al-Rashid to the caliphal throne in the same year, however, the Abbasids regained the initiative. Arab pressure mounted, and in 798 Irene was forced to ask for a peace treaty that repeated the stipulations of the 782 truce.|$|E

During this period-the late sixties and seventies-increased hope for a positive governmental role appeared to be well-founded. The civil rights, feminist, and labor movements had pushed the federal government into expanding civil liberty guarantees and economic protections. Laws were enacted prohibiting sex- and race-based discrimination, health care got a strong boost through the creation of Medicaid and Medicare, and workplace safety guarantees were expanded.

25|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>front</b> {{military}} and political gains were accompanied by economic expansion and repopulation (Schwabenzug), as Austria entered the period of High Baroque with a profusion of new buildings, including the Belvedere (1712–1783) and Karlskirche (1716–1737), exemplified by the great architects of the period, such as Fischer, Hildebrandt and Prandtauer. However the Habsburgs' finances were fragile. They had relied on Jewish bankers such as Samuel Oppenheimer to finance their wars, and subsequently bankrupted him. However the financial system in Austria remained antiquated and inadequate. By the time of Charles' death in 1740 the treasury was almost depleted.|$|E

It was also during Haidallah's rule that slavery was formally abolished in Mauritania, although the practice continues at a diminished level still today. He made a statement announcing the abolition of slavery in July 1980, and this was followed by a legal decree in November 1981.

Over the past several months, there has been unprecedented cooperation between the Dominican Republic and Haiti, with little evidence of a negative impact <b>on</b> <b>domestic</b> politics in <b>the</b> Dominican Republic. In fact, the high ratings of President Leonel Fernández {{and the results of}} the May Parliamentary elections may suggest that how the Fernández administration handled the Haitian crisis did not {{have a negative impact on}} citizens’ perception.

Polls indicate that President Fernández has a 54 percent approval rating. Polls also indicate that Haiti is not among the most pressing issues of concern to Dominican citizens. Instead, 65 percent of the population identifies drug trafficking and corruption as the greatest concerns.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the countless objects created in Barack Obama’s image during the Obama Mania of 2008 – 2009 were more than mere tokens of cool or {{examples}} of the spontaneous, irrational consumption usually held to characterise a mania.

Among the Obamabilia discussed, handcrafted objects take centre stage, as Obama’s message of change and the grass roots activity associated with the 2008 election meshed closely with the aspirations and actions of the craft community. This paper further examines the shifting meanings of Obama-themed material and visual culture leading up to the 2012 presidential election, by analysing both pro- and anti-Obama themed design and craft in relation to each other. While Obama may no longer inspire as many objects proclaiming the message of hope and change key to his first presidential campaign, the craft community are demonstrated to have remained resilient in social and political action through their craft...|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. After {{a period}} of rapid {{progress}} the European Community has lost momentum and direction. Whereas {{a short while ago}} the tide of European integration was running strongly, now the undertow of national interest is once more in evidence. The optimism associated with the Single European Act, the completion of the Single Market and then, the signing of the Maastricht Treaty fuelled expectations of further inexorable advance towards the distant goal of European Union. The revival of anxieties about national sovereignty, precipitated by the Danish referendum in the summer of 1992, dashed these hopes. But perhaps, this was only the catalyst for more deep-seated changes which would have surfaced anyway. The " 1992 " date for completing the Internal Market, which had come to symbolize the spirit of the drive for European integration, was an anticlimax. Its arrival was overshadowed by other more urgent concerns. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> economic front, recession and rising unemployment coupled with turbulence in foreign exchange markets cast a cloud over the process of monetary integration. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> political <b>front,</b> <b>domestic</b> instabilities in several member states and the continuing uncertainties surrounding ratification of the Maastricht Treaty have almost brought the integration process to a standstill...|$|R
40|$|Taking up {{the fight}} to save the {{environment}} has become a serious issue around the world. As such, retail organisations around the world look to their operation management and strategic frameworks to develop a programme that saves energy and reduces emissions, minimising their carbon footprint. The aim {{of this research is}} to compare the operation management strategies for energy savings and emission reduction between Western and Chinese retail companies, including Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Costco, Carrefour, Gome, IKEA, and others that illustrate both the challenges of and solutions for becoming more environmental responsibility. An additional aim is to focus <b>on</b> how <b>the</b> links within supply chain relationships impact the maximisation of energy and emissions savings in terms of how these relationships are handled. The last aim is to present a number of recommendations that could help Chinese retail companies. To achieve these aims, a number of ideas will be considered within the literature review {{as well as in the}} primary research, including face-to-face interview and surveys of both Chinese and UK retailers. There was consensus among Chinese and UK retailers in terms of the importance of incorporating an environmental strategy into their operation management and supply chain relationships in order to reduce their carbon footprint. All respondents also seemed to agree that they were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right path in terms of their tactics and believed that they would stay on that course or make slight alterations if their analyses indicated the need to improve their efforts or the government asked them to do so. They also agreed about the complexity and difficulty involved in becoming more environmentally responsible. Chinese retailers on a domestic level might benchmark the best practices of multinational retail competitors in terms of innovative approaches to reducing energy consumption and emissions whilst lowering costs and gaining new efficiencies. The most challenging aspect may be to convince their domestic suppliers within their supply chain to do the same. The innovative solutions presented within the case studies might be utilised to improve a retailer's reputation and brand name. The issues involved in environmental responsibility are much more complex than originally anticipated. The green retail businesses will need further research over the next few years. The movement to lower emissions and energy consumption will only become a greater topic in the coming years as more companies realise the need to incorporate it into their operation management strategies and supply chain relations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> and global <b>fronts...</b>|$|R
