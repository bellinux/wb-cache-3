5|$|One unusual specimen, {{described}} by Branch and Farrell (1988), from Summer Pride, East London in South Africa, was striped. The pattern consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> (1 scale wide) pale yellowish stripe that {{ran from the}} crown of the head {{to the tip of}} the tail.|$|E

5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E

Along {{with the three}} other {{political}} parties in the centre-right Alliance for Sweden, Reinfeldt presided over a coalition government with the support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> majority in parliament. At the age of 41, he was the third-youngest person to become Prime Minister of Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E

Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes are especially dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them.

5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. Although the entire coastal strip {{is often referred to as}} Soconusco, Soconusco proper is the southeastern portion characterised by a humid tropical climate and rich agricultural lands. The northwestern portion of the coastal strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El Despoblado ("The Unpopulated"); it is generally referred to now as the Isthmus Coast Region (Spanish: Istmo-Costa).|$|E
5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|E
5|$|The search {{team and}} {{equipment}} {{had to be}} organised within four months, to take advantage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> window of calm conditions in the North Atlantic. Organisation of the search was complicated by the presence on board of a documentary team and their film equipment, along with a television journalist who made live news reports via satellite during the search. The search team also planned to stream video from the remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) directly to Channel 4's website.|$|E

5|$|Past Richburg, NY275 {{continues}} on a northeasterly track through the rural town of Wirt, {{running along the}} base <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow,</b> largely undeveloped valley surrounding Little Genesee Creek as East Notch Road. The highway slowly increases in elevation for about , intersecting with the western terminus of CR8 (Inavale Road) and passing a handful of farms on its way toward East Notch, a gap between two large hills that serves as Little Genesee Creek's source. It eventually turns north to traverse the pass before winding its way down the opposite side. A short distance later, NY275 intersects with the northern terminus of CR8 as it curves to take a northwesterly track into the town of Friendship.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} moved westward quickly, {{and moved}} through the southern Lesser Antilles early on September 6. The southern portion of the circulation passed over northeastern Venezuela, though after entering the Caribbean Sea, another reconnaissance flight was unable to confirm {{the existence of a}} low-level circulation. Shortly thereafter, while moving into an area of light wind shear, it was able to organize and strengthen further, and on September 7 the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edith near the island of Curaçao. While initially, a cold-core upper-level low persisted about 750 miles (1200 km) northwest of the storm, Edith moved west-northwestward due to the influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> and persistent ridge of high pressure, which extended from the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm continued into open waters of the Caribbean, the upper-level low gradually weakened and was replaced with an anticyclone. This allowed the storm to strengthen further, and on September 8, Edith became a hurricane in the south-central Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{and associated}} entry complex was constructed between 1854 and 1855 using convict labour. It {{was designed by}} Royal Engineer and Comptroller General Edmund Henderson, and constructed out of limestone. The gatehouse has two towers either side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> gate, reminiscent of those found in 13th century English castles or walled cities. Iron that had been scavenged from shipwrecks was {{used to make the}} gate, while the clock {{at the top of the}} structure was imported from England. As the main entrance, the gatehouse has remained a significant feature and landmark; since the closure of the prison, it has housed a café and office areas. Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} managing as a whole the space <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrowing</b> computation. The aim of our framework is to find <b>a</b> finite representation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite <b>narrowing</b> space. This, in turn, allows us to replace <b>an</b> infinite enumeration <b>of</b> computed answers with an equivalent finite representation. We provide a semidecidable condition for this result. Our framework {{is intended to be}} used by implementations of functional logic programming languages. Our approach borrows from the memoization technique used in the implementation of functional languages. Since narrowing adds non-determinism and unifiers to functional evaluation, we develop a new approach based on graphs to memoize the outcome <b>of</b> <b>a</b> goal...|$|R
5|$|Reinforcement regiments {{were due}} to land by battalion, {{beginning}} with the 18th RCT at 09:30 on Easy Red. The first battalion to land, 2/18, arrived at the E-1 draw 30 minutes late after a difficult passage through the congestion off shore. Casualties were light, though. Despite the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrow</b> channel through the beach obstacles, the ramps and mines there accounted for the loss 22 LCVPs, 2 LCI(L)s and 4 LCTs. Supported by tank and subsequent naval fire, the newly arrived troops took the surrender at 11:30 of the last strong-point defending {{the entrance to the}} E-1 draw. Although a usable exit was finally opened, congestion prevented an early exploitation inland. The three battalions of the 115th RCT, scheduled to land from 10:30 on Dog Red and Easy Green, came in together and on top of the 18th RCT landings at Easy Red. The confusion prevented the remaining two battalions of the 18th RCT from landing until 13:00, and delayed the move off the beach of all but 2/18, which had exited the beach further east before noon, until 14:00. Even then, this movement was hampered by mines and enemy positions still in action further up the draw.|$|E

50|$|This is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} one of the primary problems with differing gauge systems - gauge incompatibility. However, it means that the narrower gauge network must be built to a structure gauge large enough to accommodate the loading gauge of the wider gauge equipment, negating one of the cost advantages <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> gauge construction. Additionally, a large wider gauge wagon balanced on <b>a</b> <b>narrower</b> gauge transporter wagon is not very stable, and is generally restricted to low speeds of 15 mph or so.|$|R
