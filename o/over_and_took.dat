25|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Duffin {{made her}} senior debut for Victoria in the Women's National Cricket League and played in all 11 of their matches for the 2006–07 season. In her first match, against reigning champions New South Wales, she made 12 runs in Victoria's 8/131 and then conceded six runs from her only <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a catch as New South Wales reached their target with three wickets in hand. The next day Victoria won the second match of the double header, but Duffin was neither {{required}} to bat or bowl in the six-wicket win. In her first year, Duffin often batted at No. 7 or lower, and was not a frontline bowler, so she was effectively hidden from much of the play. She batted six times and bowled in seven matches, and in four matches, did neither. Her most productive outing with the bat came in the first match of a double-header against Queensland, when she made 29 not out in a 57-run win. The next day, she took her best bowling figures {{of the season with}} 2/29, but it was not enough to prevent an 80-run defeat. Victoria won six of their eight round-robin matches to qualify second for the three-match finals series, which were hosted by New South Wales in Sydney. In the first match, Duffin scored 28 as the hosts were bowled out for 136. New South Wales scored relatively freely from her bowling in a low-scoring match, taking 19 runs from her five overs as they reached their target of 137 with only one wicket in hand. Duffin neither batted nor bowled in the second match as Victoria levelled the series with an eight-wicket victory to force a deciding third final. She made 12 as Victoria batted first and made 7/205, but the visitors reached the target with three wickets in hand, scoring 16 runs from Duffin's two overs before she was relieved from the attack. Duffin ended her season with 92 runs at 18.40 and three wickets at 39.66 at an economy rate of 3.83.|$|E

2500|$|Best {{suffered}} from alcoholism {{for most of}} his adult life, leading to numerous controversies and, eventually, his death. In 1981, while playing in the United States, Best stole money from the handbag of a woman he did not know in order to fund a drinking session. [...] "We were sitting in a bar on the beach, and when she got up to go to the toilet I leaned <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> all the money she had in her bag." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the night}} wore on, the exhausted, freezing, and soaking wet men aboard the {{overturned}} Collapsible [...] "B" [...] found {{it almost impossible}} to remain on the slick keel. Gracie later wrote that over half the men who had originally reached the collapsible were claimed by exhaustion or cold and slipped off the upturned keel during the night. As dawn broke and it became possible for those in other lifeboats to see them, Second Officer Lightoller (who was also on the collapsible, along with Wireless Operator Harold Bride) used his officer's whistle to attract the other boats' attention; eventually lifeboats Nos. 4 and 12 rowed <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> the remaining men off the overturned boat. Gracie was so tired that he was unable to make the jump himself and was pulled into lifeboat No. 12, the last to reach RMS Carpathia when that ship, captained by Arthur Henry Rostron, arrived on the scene.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian innings started modestly, {{with only}} a total of two {{boundaries}} coming off the blades of the two openers, Sehwag and Chopra, but then in the eighth over, with the scorecard reading 30 for no loss, they cracked two fours off a Gillespie <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> 11 runs off it. In the ninth over, they handed out the same treatment to Bichel as well, carting him for 13 runs to bring a fifty-run partnership from just 9.4 overs. India's first 10 overs yielded 54 runs. But in the fifth and last ball of the eleventh over, Bichel, who was a controversial selection after a poor game in Brisbane, bowled to a straight, canny field by Waugh, and ended Chopra's 27-run stay with an innocuous half-volley, which Chopra drove uppishly towards the bowler. Bichel showed wonderful athleticism in holding on to a low return catch, breaking the 66-run partnership. Later, in the 15th over, by which time Sehwag had already bludgeoned 47 from 41 balls, Bichel [...] "outfoxed" [...] Sehwag with a legcutter which bounced more than expected, resulting in a fatal edge from Sehwag, which was held onto by Hayden (81/2). Sachin Tendulkar, yet to score a run in the series after his ill-fated duck at the Gabba, was distinctly ill at-ease, and was almost run out by Langer. He made a solitary run before getting out to Bichel, whose third wicket reduced the Indians to 83/3. Sourav Ganguly, man of the match in the previous test was the next batsman, but he could hardly do anything to stop the run-glut. He scratched his way to 2, before he was run out, leaving the Indian team reeling at 85/4. VVS Laxman the next man walked in.|$|E
2500|$|The team {{time trial}} went {{about as well}} as the squad could have hoped. They set the best time at the {{intermediate}} time check and at the finish line, the first and only squad to finish under 21 minutes. Though they finished with only five riders, five was all they needed, as the squad's time was taken for the fifth man to cross the line. Pinotti indeed was the first <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> the first pink jersey. It was the second time in his career he held the Giro race lead, having previously held it for four days in the 2008 Giro d'Italia. He made it clear after the stage that the team's focus for stage 2 would be Cavendish, in the sprint. Given that the Giro awards time bonuses for the first three riders to finish a road race stage, that made it extremely likely that Cavendish would take the pink jersey the next day. The team did work for Cavendish in stage 2, and he did become the new race leader, but he missed out on the stage win. 's Alessandro Petacchi opened the sprint first, to the right of Cavendish's last leadout man Renshaw, leaving Cavendish to take the line to Renshaw's left. Just as Cavendish occupied a position with open road in front of him, Petacchi deviated from his line and rode directly in front of Cavendish for a few meters. When Cavendish tried to go around Petacchi, the Italian again changed his line to stay in front of Cavendish. After a moment, both sprinted with open road in front of them, and Petacchi came across the line first by a matter of millimeters. Cavendish was visibly upset, shouting and gesticulating at Petacchi after they crossed the finish line. Cavendish later explained that his frustration was not directed at Petacchi, but at race officials, since he felt he would be relegated if he had sprinted in a similar manner. However, he also said that he never had the intention of appealing the result. His sporting director Valerio Piva also took that stance, stating that Petacchi's sprint was [...] "not really fair play." [...] The next day, Cavendish made a point of apologizing to Petacchi via Twitter for his outburst after crossing the finish line. Cavendish then rode as race leader on stage 3, the day Wouter Weylandt died, finishing well back after repeated mechanical trouble. Sivtsov, Pinotti, and Lewis remained highly placed overall, staying so after the neutralized fourth stage had no effect on any of the race's standings.|$|E
