5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive <b>Opinion</b> v.

In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written <b>opinion,</b> but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{the relationship between}} the level of stock analysts <b>opinions</b> and the dispersion of those <b>opinions.</b> The proposed theory is that analysts notice when there is less agreement and tend to lower their reported <b>opinions</b> in such cases. Hence, the thesis of the paper is that a negative relationship exists between the level of analysts <b>opinions</b> of a given stock and the dispersion of those <b>opinions.</b> Using a sample selection process that controls for outliers and the effect that the varying number-of-analysts per stock might introduce, this paper analyses the <b>opinions</b> of 245 stocks from the Standard and Poor's 500. With respect to the main thesis, all the test statistics have the correct sign; however, some statistics are not significant or are only marginally significant. One innovative random variable used in the tests involves assigning to a stock the cumulative distribution function value associated with the standard deviation of the <b>opinions</b> conditional on the average and number of those <b>opinions.</b> This procedure rescales the data so that comparisons can be made between stocks with different average <b>opinions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This study extends {{research}} on the information content of qualified audit <b>opinions</b> in more developed markets to the emerging capital market in China. It investigates the market reaction to audit <b>opinions</b> of listed Chinese companies on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A sample of 3128 company/year observations was included, with 386 modified audit <b>opinions</b> and 2742 unqualified audit <b>opinions</b> during the investigation period 1999 to 2003. The variable of interest is audit <b>opinions.</b> Control variables include those used in studies of developed countries, such as earnings surprise, concurrent bad news disclosure, audit report delay, leverage, the presence of loss and firm size. Also included are variables controlling for specific Chinese institutional characteristics, such as &# 147;special treatment&# 148;, as well as bull and bear market indicators. When all modified audit <b>opinions</b> are combined, this study does not find evidence that the modified audit <b>opinions</b> have significant information value to Chinese investors. However, when modified audit <b>opinions</b> are classified by type, the market is found to significantly react to qualified audit <b>opinions</b> with explanatory notes and disclaimer audit <b>opinions,</b> which are the severest audit <b>opinions</b> investigated in this study. When the entire sample is partitioned by year, a significant stock price revision to modified audit <b>opinions</b> is documented in 2003. This study also examined in the Chinese context the Melumad and Ziv (1997) model of stock price response to avoidable and unavoidable modified audit <b>opinions.</b> Consistent with Melumad and Ziv (1997) predictions, the market reaction to avoidable audit reports is unclear, while investors view unavoidable audit reports as necessarily negative information. In conclusion, this study finds mixed {{evidence in support of}} the notion that the Chinese stock market views audit <b>opinions</b> as valuable information...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that public knowledge and awareness of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is very limited. As a result, traditional surveys designed to collect public <b>opinions</b> about CCS do in fact assess so-called pseudo <b>opinions.</b> Pseudo-opinions are of very low quality because they are mostly unstable and inconsistent. Therefore, they are not predictive for actual and future public support for or opposition against CCS. As compared to pseudo <b>opinions,</b> <b>opinions</b> expressed after the public has been provided with factual information about CCS are likely to be of higher quality. Focus group discussions and Information-Choice Questionnaires (ICQs) are two research techniques frequently used in the CCS literature that aim to collect such informed public <b>opinions.</b> In this study, we examined which of these two research technique leads to the highest quality <b>opinions</b> (i. e., to <b>opinions</b> that are consistent, stable, and that people are confident about).
