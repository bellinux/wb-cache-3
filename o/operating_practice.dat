"Rock Me" [...] came {{together}} in a single-day collaboration between guitarist Peter Svensson of the Swedish band the Cardigans, Sam Hollander, and Allan 'Kool Kojak' Grigg for One Direction's second studio album, Take Me Home, which was released in November 2012. First, Grigg carried out its mid-tempo beat. [...] "If you can slow a song down to mid-tempo, the girls are just gonna lose their minds," [...] Grigg told Time magazine in 2012. Svensson reflected that Hollander [...] "had {{an idea for a}} title that's like 'rock me' instead of ‘rock you,’ and the melody just came." [...] Co-producers Lukasz 'Dr. Luke' Gottwald and Henry 'Circut' Walter ended up with writing credits on the finished recording too — [...] "standard <b>operating</b> <b>practice,</b> now that the sound of a song has {{as much to do with}} its identity as its lyrics or melody," [...] according to Time magazine correspondent Douglas Wolk.|$|E
2500|$|The CNW {{was known}} for running [...] "left-hand main" [...] on double track mainlines. In other words, traffic was routed by default to the track on the left rather than the track on the right. In the United States, most railroads {{followed}} the [...] "right-hand main" [...] <b>operating</b> <b>practice,</b> while [...] "left-hand main" [...] running was more common in countries where British companies built the railroads. According to a display in the Lake Forest station, {{the reason for this}} was a combination of chance and inertia. When originally built as single-line trackage, the C arbitrarily placed its stations on the left-hand side of the tracks (when headed inbound toward Chicago). Later, when a second track was added, it was placed on the side away from the stations so as not to force them to relocate. Since most passengers waiting at the stations were headed toward Chicago, the inbound track remained the one closest to the station platforms. The expense of reconfiguring signals and switches has prevented a conversion to right-hand operation ever since.|$|E
2500|$|Citing {{conditions}} {{similar to}} those that resulted in the 2005 Texas City Refinery explosion, on 25 April 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) fined BP more than $2.4 million for unsafe operations at the company's Oregon, Ohio refinery. [...] An OSHA inspection resulted in 32 per-instance willful citations including locating people in vulnerable buildings among the processing units, failing to correct de-pressurization deficiencies and deficiencies with gas monitors, and failing to prevent the use of non-approved electrical equipment in locations in which hazardous concentrations of flammable gases or vapors may exist. [...] BP was further fined for neglecting to develop shutdown procedures and designate responsibilities and to establish a system to promptly address and resolve recommendations made after an incident when a large feed pump failed three years prior to 2006. [...] Penalties were also issued for five serious violations, including failure to develop operating procedures for a unit that removes sulfur compound; failure to ensure that operating procedures reflect current <b>operating</b> <b>practice</b> in the Isocracker Unit; failure to resolve process hazard analysis recommendations; failure to resolve process safety management compliance audit items in a timely manner; and failure to periodically inspect pressure piping systems.|$|E

2500|$|Through May 2013, the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests {{based upon}} the CODEX {{standard}} word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. [...] The First Class license required 20 WPM code group and 25 WPM text code proficiency, the others 16 WPM code group test (five letter blocks sent as simulation of receiving encrypted text) and 20 WPM code text (plain language) test. [...] It was also necessary to pass written tests on <b>operating</b> <b>practice</b> and electronics theory. [...] A unique additional demand for the First Class was a requirement of a year of experience for operators of shipboard and coast stations using Morse. [...] This allowed the holder to be chief operator on board a passenger ship. [...] However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high-frequency maritime communications systems (GMDSS) has made them obsolete. [...] (By that point meeting experience requirement for the First was very difficult.) [...] Currently, only one class of license, the Radiotelegraph Operator License, is issued. [...] This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license. [...] For new applicants, it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory and radiotelegraphy practices, as well as 16 WPM codegroup and 20 WPM text tests. [...] However, the code exams are currently waived for holders of Amateur Extra Class licenses who obtained their operating privileges under the old 20 WPM test requirement.|$|E
