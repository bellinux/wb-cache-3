Virtua Fighter, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.s 3D characters have a presence that 2D sprites just can't match. The characters really do seem 'alive', whether they're throwing a punch, unleashing a special move or reeling from a blow... The Saturn version of Virtua Fighter is an exceptional game in many respects. It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound (CD music and clear samples). In the arcades, Virtua Fighter made people stop and look. On the Saturn, it will make many people stop, look at their bank balance and then fork out for Sega's new machine. Over to you, Sony. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210173015/http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/virtua-fighter-review/ |archivedate=December 10, 2014 }} The only other first-party title available on launch day was Wan Chai Connection. Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon, but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn {{proved to be the}} more popular system. Meanwhile, Sega {{released the}} 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at {{less than half of the}} Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day <b>order</b> <b>system</b> that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of propagating waves in unbounded spatial domains {{is a challenge}} common to many branches of engineering and applied mathematics. Perfectly matched layers (PML) are a novel technique for simulating the absorption of waves in open domains. The equations modeling the dynamics of phenomena of interest are usually posed as differential equations (or integral equations) which must be solved at every time instant. In many application areas like general relativity, seismology and acoustics, the underlying equations are <b>systems</b> of second <b>order</b> hyperbolic partial differential equations. In numerical treatment of such problems, the equations are often rewritten as first <b>order</b> <b>systems</b> and are solved in this form.

40|$|Abstract—Fractional <b>order</b> <b>systems,</b> {{which involve}} {{integration}} and differentiation of non integer order, {{are increasingly being}} used in the fields of control systems, robotics, signal processing and circuit theory. Traditionally, the analysis of fractional <b>order</b> <b>systems</b> has been performed using paper-and-pencil based proofs or computer algebra systems. These analysis techniques compromise the accuracy of their results and thus are not recommended to be used for safety-critical fractional <b>order</b> <b>systems.</b> To overcome this limitation, we propose to leverage upon the high expressiveness of higher-order logic to formalize the theory of fractional calculus, which is the foremost mathematical concept in analyzing fractional <b>order</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper provides a higher-order-logic formalization of fractional calculus based on the Riemann-Liouville approach using the HOL theorem prover. To demonstrate the usefulness of the reported formalization, we utilize it to formally analyze some fractional <b>order</b> <b>systems,</b> namely, a fractional electrical component Resistoductance, a fractional integrator and a fractional differentiator circuit.

He seems to have had the sagacity to perceive from the outset that the great evil and danger which he had to fear was the prevalence of the spirit of disorder and misrule among his followers. In fact, nothing but tumult and confusion was to have been expected from such a lawless horde as his, and even after the city was built, the presumption must have been very strong in the mind of any considerate and prudent man, against the possibility of ever regulating and controlling such a mass of heterogeneous and discordant materials, by any human means. Romulus saw, however, that in effecting this purpose lay the only hope of the success of his enterprise, and he devoted himself with great assiduity and care, and at the same time with great energy and success, to the work of organizing it. The great leading objects of his life, from the time that he commenced the government of the new city, were to arrange and regulate social institutions, to establish laws, to introduce discipline, to teach and accustom men to submit to authority, and to bring in the requirements of law, and the authority of the various recognized relations of social life, to control and restrain the wayward impulses of the natural heart.|$|E
