40|$|Information {{asymmetry}} and dynamics. Abstract. The relocation {{dispute is}} a common type <b>of</b> dispute issues. <b>The</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relocation dispute usually lies in the divergence on <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relocation compensation and <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> fighting for it among all the parties. Aiming at <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rubinstein <b>bargaining</b> model for <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> in relocation disputes, this paper, based upon the information asymmetry and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relocation issue, redefines the discount factor as <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> confidence degree.

5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargain.</b> Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E

In the final battle, Fuhito summons Zirconiade, fusing the summon with his own body, and Shears sacrifices himself to save Elfé. Fuhito transforms into a monster, but he is defeated by the Turks. After the battle, Tseng falsely claims that both Veld and Elfé are dead, so as {{to protect them from}} being hunted by Shinra.

5|$|In 1950, Ba Cụt was {{involved}} in a battle with another Hòa Hảo leader, Nguyễn Giác Ngộ. He was defeated and driven from the district of Chợ Mới in February, provoking Soái to attack Ngo. Ba Cụt then moved to Thốt Nốt and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there. The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the Hòa Hảo and gain an anti-Việt Minh ally, and offered material aid, which Ba Cụt accepted. Ba Cụt repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Việt Minh in return for arms and money, but he broke his end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bargain</b> and sometimes fought the Cao Đài instead of the communists. He made five such deals with the French, but he abandoned his military responsibilities each time. It was said that Ba Cụt sometimes broke away with the encouragement of Soái, who was still allied to the French, but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba Cụt weapons to fight the French. The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and unreliability because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment. Some historians have claimed Ba Cụt's anti-French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident. There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French. The other Hòa Hảo commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba Cụt; they were stridently opposed to the Việt Minh due to Sổ's assassination, and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French, but at times they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack.|$|E

40|$|Frequent and {{prolonged}} labour strike {{actions in the}} South African mining industry are widely acknowledged. These strikes continue to negatively impact on the socio-economic factors in the South African society and particularly the businesses. Studies have been conducted on <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> processes to ascertain proper engagement process to follow during conflict resolutions. However, the shortfall in these studies has been identification of appropriate models that reduces or totally eliminate <b>the</b> re-occurrence <b>of</b> frequent labour strikes. Understanding how <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> process, prior and during <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> process, can curb these labour strikes is therefore critical. Data from different bargaining experts were collated and analysed through a Delphi research tool. Results indicated that several steps {{need to be taken}} into accountant before and during <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> process. Such steps include continuous communication between stakeholders and <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> process’s leadership. While labour strikes are as a result of impasses, which inform strike actions, encountered during negotiations, results show that before impasses are encountered it is imperative to manage <b>the</b> <b>bargaining</b> processes prior <b>the</b> formal engagements.

25|$|The Act {{allowed the}} commissioners to lease the tolls for periods {{of up to}} seven years, and the first lease was granted to Charles Chaplin, one of the commissioners who held ten shares, in January 1770.
