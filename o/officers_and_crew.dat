5|$|By {{the end of}} October 1943, Howe and King George V had {{returned}} to Britain. At the end of year, Howe underwent a long overhaul at Devonport, where a number of alterations were made. Her anti-aircraft armament was increased, changes were made to her radar, and her watertight integrity in the stern was improved. Modifications were accomplished in the <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> quarters for operations in tropical climates; these included changes in insulation, and the extensive use of air-conditioning equipment.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew,</b> the Beagle carried several , passengers without an official position. FitzRoy employed a mathematical instrument maker to maintain his 22 marine chronometers kept in his cabin, as well as engaging the artist/draughtsman Augustus Earle {{to go in a}} private capacity. The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage were going to be returned to Tierra del Fuego on the Beagle together with the missionary Richard Matthews.|$|E
5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E

Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21.

5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to {{bear the brunt of}} the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew,</b> Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to Britain the expedition's {{reception}} was initially muted. Markham was present {{to meet the}} ship in Portsmouth when Discovery docked there on 10 September 1904, but no dignitaries greeted the party when it arrived in London a few days later. However, there was considerable public enthusiasm for the expedition, and official recognition followed. Scott was quickly promoted to Captain, and invited to Balmoral Castle to meet King Edward VII, who invested him as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). He also received a cluster of medals and awards from overseas, including the French Légion d'honneur. Polar Medals and promotions were given to other <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> members.|$|E

5|$|Sixty-seven <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> <b>crew</b> of the {{two ships}} were at their stations, and various support {{personnel}} were present such as the three-man civilian train crew and a Marine sentry. Nine Navy officers and 29 armed guards watched over the procedure. A Coast Guard fire barge with a crew of five was docked at the pier.

Aurora was refitted in Clydebank upon her return and was placed in Devonport Reserve in 1904 before she was taken out of service the following year. The ship was sold for scrap to Payton, of Milford Haven, Wales, on 2 October 1907 for £12,700.|$|E
