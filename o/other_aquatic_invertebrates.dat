2500|$|The {{black-necked stilt}} forages by probing and {{gleaning}} primarily in mudflats and lakeshores, {{but also in}} very shallow waters near shores; it seeks out a range of aquatic invertebrates [...] mainly crustaceans and other arthropods, and mollusks [...] and small fish, tadpoles and very rarely plant seeds. Its mainstay food varies according to availability; inland birds usually feed mainly on aquatic insects and their larvae, while coastal populations mostly eat <b>other</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> For feeding areas they prefer coastal estuaries, salt ponds, lakeshores, alkali flats and even flooded fields. For roosting and resting needs, this bird selects alkali flats (even flooded ones), lake shores, and islands surrounded by shallow water.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} {{the use of}} modelled and satellite remote sensing (SRS) data in supporting the research, technology-development and management of marine fishery resources. The value of such methods used in marine fisheries management is emphasized. State of art techniques in fisheries resource management utilizing numerical models, and SRS, separately and jointly, are described here. Numerical models are useful for studying fish and <b>other</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> larval transport. SRS data are used to locate fish stocks, locate areas of reef stress and delineate areas of high productivity {{in the wake of}} cyclone paths. Coupling SRS with models helps to manage fishery resources on an ecosystem scale, generate potential fishing zones (PFZ), forecast ocean state (OSF), detect meso-scale features such as eddies and track cyclones threatening coastal resources. Modelled, SRS and in situ data sets in combination can be used in the estimation of potential fishery resources in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which in turn can help in fishing fleet management. Hence, there is a huge scope for application of numerical modelling and SRS in marine fisheries research and management...|$|R
40|$|In decapod {{crustacean}} and <b>other</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> larvae, {{rates of}} survival, development and growth, {{as well as}} overall physiological fitness are affected by numerous extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Among the principal environmental variables, temperature, salinity, {{quality and quantity of}} nutrition, viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, as well as several chemical parameters of water quality and technical details of the rearing methods may influence the success of larval development in artificial cultures. The strength of those extrinsic effects depends also on interactions with intrinsic factors such as the larval stage, the stage of the moulting cycle, genetic factors (including programmed physiological changes that coincide with ecological transitions due to ontogenetic migrations), and on late effects of previous conditions affecting maternal or embryonic quality. The present review exemplifies the significance of several key factors, using various criteria for the assessment of isolated or combined effects and showing implications for larval rearing in research cultivation or aquaculture. Concluding from this general overview, it is suggested that future work should (1) pay more attention to potentially confounding effects of intrinsic factors, (2) aim at an improved standardization of criteria for effect assessment, (3) simultaneously use various criteria rather than only plain survival and/or development data, and (4) preferentially use sublethal criteria such as rates of growth or morphogenesis, or indices of physiological or biochemical condition. Together, these considerations should reduce misinterpretations of observed effects, enhance the reliability of conclusions and predictions based on rearing experiments, and eventually aid to the development of improved cultivation techniques for both basic scientific research and commercial aquaculture...|$|R

The turbellarian body is elongated, relatively soft, and usually tapered at the ends. Sometimes a short tail-like section or lateral flaps are present near the cerebral region. With the exception of triclads, flatworms are generally not flat- despite their common name. Most microturbellaria are cylindrical in cross-section, with some differentiation of shape of the dorsal and ventral surfaces. Moreover, species that reproduce asexually may be composed of several zooids, giving a chain-like appearance to an individual. Turbellarians may be colourless, white, red, bluish, green, black...|$|R

40|$|Extensive snrveys of the {{distribution}} of chironomid larvae have established the fact that the majority of species are strikingly restricted in their habitat: the causes of this specialization, however, remain largely undetermined. For a few species comprehensive ecological work has made it possible to deduce'the factors important in determining distribution (Thienemann, 1923, 1928; Lenz, 1925), but an ex-perimental attack on the physiology and behaviour of larval and adult chironomids in relation to their choice of habitat remains almost a virgin field. In <b>other</b> groups of <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> experimental work has indicated that related forms from different habitats may have well-marked physiological differences.

Thirty-eight species in eight families and seventeen genera were collected. The thirty-eight species collected include Protoptila cantha Ross, P. tenebrosa (Walker), Neureclipsis bimaculatus (Linnaeus), N. crepuscularis (Walker), Psychomyia flavida Hagen, Hydropsyche bifida Banks, H. bronta Ross, H. recurvata Banks, H. placoda Ross, H. occidentalis Banks, H. guttata Pictet, Cheumatopsyche speciosa (Banks), f. lasia Ross, C. campyla Ross, Agraylea multipunctata Curtis, Hydroptila spatulata Morton, H. ajax Ross, H. comsimilis Morton, H. angusta Ross, Neotrichiahalia Denning, N. ersitis Denning, Mayatrichia ayama Mosely, Phryganeacinerea Walker, Onocosmoecus unicolor (Banks), Anabolia bimaculata (Walker), Asynarchus curtus (Banks), Arthripsodes tarsi-punctatus (Vorhies), A. arielles Denning, A. annulicornis (Stephens), A. sp. 1, Oecetis avara (Banks), Q. inconspicua (Walker), Q. sp. 1, Triaenodes frontalis Banks, Nectopsyche diarina (Ross), N. intervena (Banks), H. exguisita (Walker), and Brachycentrus occidentalis Banks. Mature larvae and pupae of most families were separable to species but immature larvae were usually not separated by keys presented in this study. Hydroptilid larvae and pupae were not separable to species, hydropti 1 id pupae also being inseparable to genus. Pupae of Nectopsyche were not distinguishable to species and adults of Nectopsyche also difficult to separate. Larvae of the bifida group of the genus Hydropsyche and female pupae of H. bifida and H. bronta were not separated to species. Life history patterns of Saskatchewan River system Trichoptera were discussed based mainly on collections of pupae and adults. Species distribution in the Saskatchewan River system was discussed, with emphasis on man's possible role in affecting species distribution and relative abundance. North American distribution patterns exhibited by species collected in this study were related to recent geological events and to patterns exhibited by some <b>other</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> groups...|$|R
50|$|The Clanwilliam yellowfish {{is found}} in large and small rivers, but do not like slowly moving water. Young Clanwilliam yellowfish (below 4 cm/1.6 in long) are found in backwaters and shallow riffles. As they grow older they {{move out of the}} riffles into deeper water but even adults may still be found in {{relatively}} shallow parts of their habitat. The presence of deep pools and dense riparian stands of Palmiet (Prionium serratum, a Thurniaceae) that provide shadow will aid its survival if its home rivers run dry in hot summers. The young eat zooplankton and <b>other</b> small <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> Adults are omnivores, feeding on larger invertebrates and algae. Their breeding season is prolonged and lasts from late spring to summer (about October to December), when the water is at least 20 C. During that time, adults repeatedly move in small groups into shallow riffles where the water is only a few decimetres deep, and deposit their non-sticky eggs there. The hatchlings initially move away from light and will hide between the substrate. In the absence of optimal breeding habitat (such as in dams), it will use any shallow water with generous rocks on the ground.|$|R
