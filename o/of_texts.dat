40|$|Images {{magnified}} by standard methods display a degradation of detail {{that is particularly}} noticeable in the blurry edges <b>of</b> <b>text.</b> Current super-resolution algorithms address the lack of sharpness by filling in the image with probable details. These algorithms break the outlines <b>of</b> <b>text.</b> Our novel algorithm for super-resolution <b>of</b> <b>text</b> magnifies images in real-time by interpolation with a variable linear filter. The coefficients of the filter are determined nonlinearly from the neighborhood {{to which it is}} applied. We train the mapping that defines the coefficients to specifically enhance edges <b>of</b> <b>text,</b> producing a conservative algorithm that infers the detail <b>of</b> magnified <b>text.</b> Possible applications include resizing web page layouts or other interfaces, and enhancing low resolution camera captures <b>of</b> <b>text.</b> In general, learning spatially-variable filters is applicable to other image filtering tasks. 1...|$|R

Another text in the Philokalia, titled The Three Methods of Prayer is also attributed to Symeon—it describes a method of practicing the Jesus Prayer that includes direction on correct posture and breathing while reciting the prayer. It is extremely unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E

5|$|These {{features}} were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement <b>of</b> <b>texts,</b> coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, {{which may be}} far older than {{was assumed to be}} the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence seems to suggest the collection also served—at least partially—as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging for easier retrieval, and arrangement by size, form and content. The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{traditional}} Daoist {{ideas were}} retained in Lingbao cosmology, {{such as the}} idea that the world originated from a type of primordial qi known as yuanqi, and then was divided into heaven and earth. Furthermore, the yuanqi is subdivided into three types of qi that correspond to three deities: the lords of the Celestial Treasure, of the Sacred Treasure and of the Divine Treasure. These three deities later introduced the teachings of the Dongzhen (Perfect Grotto), the Dongxuan (Mysterious Grotto), and of the Dongshen (Divine Grotto). These three teachings form the basis for the later classification <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> in the Daozang.|$|E
5|$|Drawloom: The {{earliest}} confirmed drawloom fabrics {{come from}} the State of Chu and date c. 400 BC. Most scholars attribute {{the invention of the}} drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient Syria since drawloom fabrics found in Dura-Europas are thought to date before 256 AD. Dieter Kuhn states that an analysis <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> and textiles from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) proves that the figured fabrics of that era were also crafted {{with the use of a}} drawloom. The drawloom was certainly known in Persia by the 6th century AD. Eric Broudy asserts there is virtually no evidence of its use in Europe until the 17th century, while the button drawloom was allegedly invented by Jean le Calabrais in the 15th century. Mary Carolyn Beaudry disagrees, stating that it was used in the medieval Italian silk industry.|$|E

5|$|Symeon is {{recognized}} as the first Byzantine mystic to freely share his own mystical experiences. Some of his writings {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> by early Christian mystics on contemplative prayer and hesychast teachings. Symeon wrote and spoke frequently about the importance of experiencing directly the grace of God, often talking about his own experiences of God as divine light. Another common subject in his writings was the need of putting oneself under the guidance of a spiritual father. The authority for many of his teachings derived from the traditions of the Desert Fathers, early Christian monks and ascetics. Symeon's writings include Hymns of Divine Love, Ethical Discourses, and The Catechetical Discourses.|$|E

5|$|The Lingbao School {{began in}} around 400 CE when the Lingbao scriptures were {{revealed}} to Ge Chaofu, the grandnephew of Ge Hong. Ge Chaofu {{claimed that the}} scriptures came {{to him in a}} line of transmission going back to Ge Hong's great-uncle, Ge Xuan (164-244). Ge Chaofu transmitted the scriptures to two of his disciples, and the scriptures quickly gained immense popularity. In 471, Lu Xiujing (406-477) compiled a catalogue of all the Lingbao texts, and also was responsible for reorganizing and standardizing Lingbao ritual. This organization <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> and ritual provided a solid foundation on which the Lingbao School prospered in the subsequent centuries. During the Tang Dynasty, the influence of the Lingbao School declined and another school of Daoism, the Shangqing School, became prominent. Borrowing many Lingbao practices, it was well accepted by the aristocracy and established an influence in court.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of Christianity from {{the sixth century}} brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society. Literary life revolved around the contemplation <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks {{were part of the}} mainstream of European Christian culture.|$|E
5|$|The text {{consists}} of different Bible {{passages from the}} Old and New Testament, {{as well as individual}} verses of hymns by Martin Luther and Adam Reusner, which all together refer to finiteness, preparation for death and dying. There are two distinct parts to the cantata: the view of the Old Testament on death shown in the first part is confronted by that of the New Testament in the second part, leading to a symmetrical structure. The juxtaposition <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> from the Old and New Testament appeared before in the Christliche Betschule (Christian school of prayer) by Johann Olearius. Markus Rathey, professor at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, argued in 2006, that the sermon given at the funeral of Strecker is similar in ideas to the themes of the cantatas. It may be an indication that Bach composed the work for this occasion.|$|E
50|$|Type color <b>of</b> <b>text</b> is {{affected}} by the amount and weight of the strokes on a page. Similar to when writing with a pen on paper, the more layers of strokes, the darker the text. At smaller sizes, darker colored text {{does not necessarily mean that}} text will be more legible. The boldness and weight at this smaller size can actually make a piece <b>of</b> <b>text</b> more difficult to read. For this reason, the fonts that are commonly used to type large blocks <b>of</b> <b>text</b> are not overly dark or heavy on the page. They create a good balance <b>of</b> <b>text</b> color and white space. This balance is important for an attractive and legible piece <b>of</b> <b>text.</b> There are differences between acceptable and legible levels of type color between body text and headings or titles.|$|R
