5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the Baltic, to put Admiral Hipper out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she {{could be used in}} the Baltic. Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the Baltic, but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E

5|$|In Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, {{with the}} Texas Rangers leading the game 7–5, and leading the series by 3 games to 2, Freese came to bat {{in the bottom}} of the ninth with two out and two men on base. With a count of one ball and two strikes, Freese hit a two-run triple off Neftalí Feliz just out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> of Nelson Cruz to tie the game and send it to extra innings. In the 11th inning, again with two strikes, Freese hit a game-winning lead-off, walk-off, solo home-run to deep center field (420feet), to send the World Series to its first Game 7 since 2002. Freese joined Jim Edmonds, the man he was traded for, as the only players in Cardinals history to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run in the postseason. He joined Aaron Boone (2003), David Ortiz (2004) and Hall of Famers Carlton Fisk (1975) and Kirby Puckett (1991) as the only players to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run when their team was facing postseason elimination.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> of many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species {{spend more time on}} the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|E
5|$|The French {{would use}} the lessons learned at Muong Khoua {{and those of the}} 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and {{strangulation}} there. The importance of an air bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, their abilities to isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> of French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the relationship between the movement and the anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) that precede that movement during a <b>reaching</b> task in <b>the</b> cat. We recorded ground reaction forces in all 3 planes from all 4 limbs as well as electromyographic (EMG) activity from limb and axial muscles. <b>The</b> <b>reaching</b> movement was always preceded by an APA that was characterized by a loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaching</b> forelimb and an unloading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support forelimb. This loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaching</b> forelimb was preceded, and accompanied, by increased activity in shoulder and limb extensor muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaching</b> limb; extensor muscle activity in the supporting limb was simultaneously decreased. An important finding from this study was that <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> APA and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement was temporally decoupled. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> EMG activity showed that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscles that we recorded could be classified as either related to the APA or related to the movement. These results support <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> distributed, and perhaps independent, systems for <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> APA and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prime movement. There was also postural activity in the supporting limb during <b>the</b> movement. Analysis <b>of</b> this activity, which is also anticipatory in nature, suggests that it was tightly linked to the movement. We suggest that this postural response is signaled as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> command for movement. Some muscles, particularly <b>the</b> extensors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reaching</b> limb, received convergent input from the command signals for the APA and for the movement...|$|R
