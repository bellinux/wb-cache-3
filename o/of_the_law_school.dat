5|$|When the deanship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>school</b> came open in 1929, Macdonald agonized {{over whether}} he should seek the job. He {{apparently}} had strong support from {{several members of the}} university's board of governors. At the same time however, he was increasingly drawn to politics and accepting the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely. In the end, the job was offered to Sidney Smith, another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school. Macdonald did stay, but only for one more year. In 1930, he resigned so he would be free to enter politics.|$|E

5|$|Theodor Mommsen {{linked the}} {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>school</b> in Beirut {{with the need}} for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into Greek, published and archived. This function was first recorded in 196, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the Gregorian Codex, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times. The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of Caesarea Maritima and Alexandria lacked.|$|E
