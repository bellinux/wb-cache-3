This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{deficiencies}} of folic acid, vitamin B 12, and microelements during pregnancy {{may affect the}} health of newborns. Objectives: To assess the serum levels of folate, vitamin B 12, iron, zinc and copper in healthy women <b>of</b> the <b>childbearing</b> <b>ages</b> in Gorgan, northern Iran. Methodology: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out on 100 women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>ages</b> in northern Iran during November 2007 -March 2008.

5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course.

Isotretinoin use in women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E

This study was planed to illuminate the status of contraception in our region in diabetic population. This cross sectional study was performed in a group of 200 married sexually active premenopausal diabetic women who have been referred for periodic visit to Endocrine and Diabetes clinic of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Face to face interviews were performed by female interviewer. Questions were asked about their awareness and practice of their contraceptive methods and risks of pregnancy in diabetes. Forty two percent of previous conceptions were unwanted. Fifteen percent of diabetic females in childbearing years did not use contraceptive methods. Contraceptive methods commonly used, in the order of frequency, were Tubal Ligation (TL), coitus interrupts, condom, Low Dose (LD) contraceptive pills, Intrauterine Devices (IUD), vasectomy, Depot Medroxy Progesterone Acetate (DMPA) injection and the use of calendar.

The effect of early diagnosis and treatment is monitored through international collaborations. BRCA 1 -associated breast cancer is biologically different from other breast cancers, including a worse prognosis. BRCA 2 -associated breast cancer is, beside early onset, in many ways similar to sporadic breast cancer. Mammography screening of the high risk groups aiming at early diagnosis and treatment, seems promising for familial breast cancer and for BRCA 2 -associated breast cancer, but numbers included for BRCA 2 carriers are limited.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, most of California’s {{population}} growth has been directly attributable to natural increase rather than migra-Summary tion, and this will remain {{the case for the}} foreseeable future.

In this issue of California Counts, we examine trends in fertility rates in order to develop a deeper understanding of this important source of population change. Fertility rates are higher in California than in any developed country in the world. This is partly due to the composition of the state’s population, which includes large numbers of foreign-born women, who tend to have more children than U. S. -born women. Thus, in addition to its direct contribution to state growth, migration also plays an important indirect role in its effect on fertility rates. Among foreign-born Latinas, total fertility rates—a measure of completed family size—average 3. 7 children per woman. In contrast, the state’s lowest fertility rates are among U.

Research on migrant fertility in France (Toulemon, 2004) and Sweden (Andersson, 2004) has identified elevated fertility levels among migrants in the time period immediately after the migration event. In England and Wales research has focused on period measures of fertility rather than estimating if there is an elevated level of fertility among the large number of recent migrants to England and Wales.

5000|$|The clearest {{exposition}} {{of the principles}} of sexual division of labour across the full range of human societies can be summarized by a large number of logically complementary implicational constraints of the following form: if women <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>ages</b> in a given community tend to do X (e.g., preparing soil for planting) they will also do Y (e.g., the planting) while for men the logical reversal in this example would be that if men plant they will prepare the soil. [...] "Entailment Theory and Method: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Sexual Division of Labor" [...] by White, Brudner and Burton (1977, public domain), using statistical entailment analysis, shows that tasks more frequently chosen by women in these order relations are those more convenient in relation to childrearing. This type of finding has been replicated in a variety of studies, including modern industrial economies. These entailments do not restrict how much work for any given task could be done by men (e.g., in cooking) or by women (e.g., in clearing forests) but are only least-effort or role-consistent tendencies. To the extent that women clear forests for agriculture, for example, they tend to do the entire agricultural sequence of tasks on those clearings. In theory, these types of constraints could be removed by provisions of child care, but ethnographic examples are lacking.|$|R

Despite widespread application of rubella vaccination, periodical outbreaks are still being reported worldwide. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine rubella seroprevalence and antibody levels in neonates in Serbia as a proxy of maternal serostatus. Methods ELISA based serological testing for rubella was done in 599 neonates treated at the Institute of Neonatology in Belgrade, from January 2010 to December 2011. All individuals with rubella IgG concentration ≥ 10  IU/ml were considered seropositive for rubella. Results The mean age of enrolled neonates was 18 [*]±[*] 6  days. The overall seroprevalence of rubella IgG antibodies among the tested neonates was 540 / 599 (90. 2  %, 95  % CI: 87. 5 – 92. 3). Seropositivity rate among sera of the neonates enrolled in 2010 was significantly higher than those collected in 2011 (p[*] 30 as compared to those from mothers aged < 20  years (p[*]=[*] 0. 02).
