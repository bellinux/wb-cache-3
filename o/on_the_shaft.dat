5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E

50|$|The warp is {{threaded}} through heddles on different shafts {{in order to}} obtain different weave structures. For a plain weave on a loom with two <b>shafts,</b> for example, <b>the</b> first thread would go through <b>the</b> first heddle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>shaft,</b> and then <b>the</b> next thread through <b>the</b> first heddle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second <b>shaft.</b> <b>The</b> third warp thread would be threaded through <b>the</b> second heddle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>shaft,</b> and so on. In this manner the heddles allow for the grouping of the warp threads into two groups, one group that {{is threaded}} through heddles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>shaft,</b> and <b>the</b> other <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second <b>shaft.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There are 35 mi of tunnels in the mine, {{going down}} to 2065 ft below <b>the</b> surface <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main <b>shaft</b> and 2675 ft <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>shaft.</b> <b>The</b> mine remains at [...] constantly.|$|R
25|$|All {{the plates}} and washers are fitted on and keyed to a sleeve {{threaded}} {{at the ends}} and equipped with nuts and collars for drawing the thick end-plates together or, if desired, the collars may be simply forced onto it and the ends upset. The sleeve has a hole fitting snugly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{to which it is}} fastened as usual.|$|E
25|$|Downshifting {{is similar}} to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear shaft speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a lower gear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> not in use, and then completes the downshift.|$|E
25|$|Post-cranial {{characteristics}} include reduced relative {{size of the}} pubic peduncle of the ilium and {{a fourth}} trochanter that is shifted distally <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of the femur. The pubic peduncle of the ilium is an anterior extension of the ilium, which joins with the pubis. In Genasauria, the relative size of the public peduncle, compared {{to the size of}} the ilium, is reduced. The fourth trochanter is a process (extension) of the femur that serves as an attachment point for tail muscles, mainly for attachment of the Musculus caudofemoralis longus.|$|E

60|$|The Den {{was strangely}} small, {{and soon they}} were on a shabby brae where women in short gowns came to their doors and men in night-caps sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> of their barrows to look at Jean Myles's bairns.|$|R
25|$|Everyone {{can imagine}} how terrified the peasant must have been when he saw Thor making his brows sink down over his eyes; as for what could be seen of the eyes themselves, {{he thought he would}} {{collapse}} at just the very sight. Thor clenched his hands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of the hammer so that the knuckles went white, and the peasant did as one might expect, and all his household, they cried out fervently, begged for grace, offered to atone with all their possessions.|$|E
25|$|Stage 4 {{looks more}} male than female, {{with an empty}} scrotum and a phallus {{the size of a}} normal penis, but not quite free enough of the {{perineum}} to be pulled onto the abdomen toward the umbilicus (i.e., what is termed a chordee in a male). The single small urethral/vaginal opening at the base or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of the phallus would be considered a hypospadias in a male. X-rays taken after dye injection into this opening reveal the internal connection with the upper vagina and uterus. This common opening can predispose to urinary obstruction and infection.|$|E
25|$|Virilization {{of genetically}} female (XX) infants usually {{produces}} obvious genital ambiguity. Inside the pelvis, the ovaries are normal {{and since they}} have not been exposed to testicular antimullerian hormone (MIF), the uterus, fallopian tubes, upper vagina, and other mullerian structures are normally formed as well. However, the high levels of testosterone in the blood can enlarge the phallus, partially or completely close the vaginal opening, enclose the urethral groove so that it opens {{at the base of the}} phallus, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> or even at the tip like a boy. Testosterone can cause the labial skin to become as thin and rugated as a scrotum, but cannot produce palpable gonads (i.e., testes) in the folds.|$|E
50|$|In 1814 Allason visited Greece. He {{claimed to}} have been the first to spot entasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> of Greek columns, {{although}} Charles Robert Cockerell (1788-1863) and Carl Haller von Hallerstein (1774-1817), whom Allason had met while in Athens, had also observed this.|$|R
60|$|The weary hours roll on. Too {{tired to}} stand longer, {{he sits down}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> of a cart, and tries not to think. It is not difficult. Body and mind are alike worn out, and his brain seems filled with uniform dull mist.|$|R
50|$|In weaving, {{the warp}} threads are moved {{up or down}} by <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> This is {{achieved}} because each thread of the warp goes through a heddle <b>on</b> a <b>shaft.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> is raised <b>the</b> heddles are too, and thus the warp threads threaded through the heddles are raised. Heddles can be either equally or unequally distributed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts,</b> depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pattern to be woven. In a plain weave or twill, for example, the heddles are equally distributed.|$|R
25|$|In Doric columns, the top {{is formed}} by a concavely curved neck, the hypotrachelion, and the capital, in Ionic columns, the capital sits {{directly}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> In the Doric order, the capital consists of a circular torus bulge, originally very flat, the so-called echinus, and a square slab, the abacus. In {{the course of their}} development, the echinus expands more and more, culminating in a linear diagonal, at 45Â° to the vertical. The echinus of Ionic columns is decorated with an egg-and-dart band followed by a sculpted pillow forming two volutes, supporting a thin abacus. The eponymous Corinthian capital of the Corinthian order is crowned by rings of stylised acanthus leaves, forming tendrils and volutes that reach to the corners of the abacus.|$|E
25|$|Although {{drilling}} finished on 9 October 2010, Laurence Golborne, Chilean Minister of Mining, {{announced that}} the rescue operation was not expected to begin before 12 October due to the complex preparatory work required on both the escape shaft and the extraction system site. These tasks included a borehole inspection {{to determine how much}} of the shaft needed casing to prevent rockfalls from jamming the escape capsule. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> casing requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the winching rig to raise and lower the capsule had to be poured while the winching rig required assembly. Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and winching system together was required.|$|E
25|$|Watt's next {{improvement}} to the Newcomen {{design was}} {{to seal the}} top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket. Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum {{on the other side of}} the piston. The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke). This increased the theoretical efficiency from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure. Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.|$|E

25|$|From the {{discovery}} of a serious rope-jerk injury around Mallory's waist, which was encircled by the remnants of a climbing rope, it appears that he and Irvine were roped together when one of them slipped. Mallory's body lay 300m below and about 100m horizontal to the location of an ice axe found in 1933, which is generally accepted from three characteristic marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> as belonging to Irvine. The fact that the body was relatively unbroken, apart from fractures to the right leg (the tibia and fibula were broken just above the boot), in comparison to other bodies found in the same location that were known to have fallen from the North-East Ridge, strongly suggests that Mallory could not have fallen from the ice axe site, but must have fallen from much lower down. Wang reportedly found Mallory's ice axe near his body (and took it with him). If this is true, then Mallory not only survived the initial fall with Irvine, but was in possession of his axe until the last seconds before striking a rock that stopped his final fall. When found, his body was sun-bleached, frozen and mummified.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{posterior}} thigh muscles. The biceps femoris has two heads: The long head has its origin on the ischial tuberosity {{together with the}} semitendinosus and acts on two joints. The short head originates from the middle third of the linea aspera <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of the femur and the lateral intermuscular septum of thigh, and acts on only one joint. These two heads unite to form the biceps which inserts {{on the head of}} the fibula. The biceps flexes the knee joint and rotates the flexed leg laterallyâ it is the only lateral rotator of the knee and thus has to oppose all medial rotator. Additionally, the long head extends the hip joint. The semitendinosus and the semimembranosus share their origin with the long head of the biceps, and both attaches on the medial side of the proximal head of the tibia together with the gracilis and sartorius to form the pes anserinus. The semitendinosus acts on two joints; extension of the hip, flexion of the knee, and medial rotation of the leg. Distally, the semimembranosus' tendon is divided into three parts referred to as the pes anserinus profondus. Functionally, the semimembranosus is similar to the semitendinosus, and thus produces extension at the hip joint and flexion and medial rotation at the knee.|$|E
500|$|The arched doorway in {{the porch}} reuses two old carved gravestones. One from the 12th century is cut at its {{head with a}} circle {{containing}} a rough cross of petals and has a decorated key design <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> [...] It is used as the lintel of the doorway. [...] Part of another gravestone, dating from the 9th to the 11th centuries and with a cross in a circle, is set {{to the right of}} the door. Inside, three steps lead up from the nave to the chancel through a decorated chancel arch. A further two steps lead up from the chancel to the sanctuary. [...] The internal woodwork of the roof is exposed. The window in the east wall of the chancel is a pointed arch and has three lights (sections of window separated by mullions) topped with trefoils (a pattern of three overlapping circles). The nave windows are also pointed arches and variously have one, two or three lights topped with trefoils. The windows contain coloured leaded glass rather than stained glass pictures.|$|E

The {{underside}} of the wings are white or brownish grey, the markings prominent or very faint. The antennae are black with white speckling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b> <b>The</b> body is brown with a purple flush on fresh specimens.|$|R
40|$|A novel type of {{integral}} {{squeeze film}} damper (ISFD) is proposed to reduce and isolate vibration excitations of the gear system through bearing to the foundation. Four ISFD designs were tested experimentally with an open first-grade spur gear system. Vibration reduction characteristics were experimentally studied at different speeds for cases where ISFD elastic damping supports were simultaneously installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driving and driven <b>shafts,</b> installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driven <b>shaft,</b> or only installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driving <b>shaft.</b> Experimental {{results show that the}} ISFD elastic damping support can effectively reduce shock vibration of the gear system. Additionally, resonant modulation in gear shafts caused by meshing impact was significantly reduced. Different vibration amplitudes of gear shafts with ISFD installed only on driven or driving shafts were compared. Results indicated that vibration reduction is better when ISFD is only installed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driven <b>shaft</b> than <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driving <b>shaft...</b>|$|R

500|$|Dibnah {{had another}} course of chemotherapy, {{but this time}} the {{treatment}} was unsuccessful. [...] Undeterred, he began to dig a replica coal mine in the back garden of his home. [...] Although the sight of pithead gear may have been considered by his neighbours to be unusual, as a child raised in Bolton he had been surrounded by pits such as Ladyshore Colliery and had long harboured an interest in mining. [...] He had already assembled the wooden pithead gear and was planning to sink a [...] brick-lined shaft below this into the hillside. [...] At the bottom of the shaft, a horizontal tunnel would have led out to the steep side of the valley above which his garden sits. [...] The intention was to have a narrow gauge railway running along the tunnel, back up the hillside on a rope-hauled inclined plane, returning to the pithead. [...] The ultimate aim was to be able to demonstrate the basic working of an early colliery. [...] Seven years before his diagnosis, therefore, Dibnah had sourced drawings of suitable pithead gear and built a frame from timber and iron bolts. [...] He had applied for and was given planning permission to erect the structure, but made no mention of his wish to dig a shaft underneath it. [...] The BBC decided to make a documentary on Dibnah's proposed mine, which would entail his once again travelling around the country, visiting working collieries and heritage mines. [...] Filming started late in 2003, by which time Dibnah and his friend Alf Molyneux had already made a start <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} 16 destroyers, these turbine-driven vessels were triple-screw. The ships' steam {{turbines}} were direct drive and {{arranged in a}} similar manner to Sir Charles Parsons' Turbinia, with a high-pressure turbine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center <b>shaft</b> exhausting to two low-pressure turbines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outboard <b>shafts.</b> Cruising turbines were also fitted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outboard <b>shafts</b> to improve fuel economy at low speeds, a problem that would plague turbine-powered ships until fully geared turbines and higher steam pressures and temperatures were introduced during World War I. To attempt to find a middle ground between the turbines' high efficient speed and the propellers' low efficient speed, <b>the</b> maximum <b>shaft</b> speed was 724 rpm, over twice that of a modern ship.|$|R
