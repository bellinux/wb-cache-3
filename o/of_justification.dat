5|$|Knox's {{powers as}} a preacher {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the chaplain of the garrison, John Rough. While Rough was preaching in the parish church on the Protestant principle of the popular election of a pastor, he proposed Knox to the congregation for that office. Knox did not relish the idea. According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>justification</b> by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and prayers for the dead.|$|E
5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine <b>of</b> <b>justification</b> by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of the sacraments. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{a number of}} important issues regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> for self-indulgence. Justifications are the reasons or explanations that people give themselves in order to permit and rationalise behaving in ways that are inconsistent with their preferred standards (e. g., “Just this once won't hurt!”, “I've had a hard day, I deserve a treat!”, “I can make up for this some other time!”). The primary aim of the thesis was to investigate the impact <b>of</b> using <b>justifications</b> for self-indulgence on self-regulation by investigating four questions: (a) whether or not the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> undermines people's intentions to reduce self-indulgence, (b) when people are most likely to use justifications to self-indulge, (c) whether or not the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> has consequences for the emotions that people anticipate experiencing during and after self-indulgence, and (d) whether or not an intervention designed to prevent the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> would promote effective self-regulation. Unhealthy eating was used throughout as a context for investigating these aims. The findings suggested that the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> {{plays an important role in}} promoting self-indulgence. Specifically, Studies 1 and 2 showed that the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> undermines strong (but not weak) intentions to reduce self-indulgence, such that those with strong intentions were more likely to use justifications and this relationship was associated with greater consumption of unhealthy foods. Study 2 also showed that the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> is causally related to self-indulgence. Priming the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> (in an ostensibly unrelated domain) led participants to indulge in a subsequent taste test (i. e., eat more M&M's relative to unprimed participants). Studies 3 and 4 showed that participants were most likely to use justifications when they experienced self-regulatory conflict. Specifically, Studies 3 and 4 showed that greater conflict (as measured by ratings of the attractiveness and forbiddeness of a temptation) was associated with greater use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> to obtain and consume unhealthy foods. Studies 5 and 6 showed that the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> engenders a mixture of positive and negative anticipated emotions during indulgence, and contrary to peoples' expectations, leads to more anticipated negative emotions after indulgence. Finally, Study 7 showed that the tendency to use justifications can be overcome by using if-then plans called implementation intentions. Participants who formed implementation intentions designed to prevent the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> were more successful in reducing self-indulgence (i. e., their consumption of unhealthy snacks foods) relative to participants without plans. The research described in this thesis has a number of theoretical and applied values. Specifically, the thesis extends existing research on the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> and makes {{a number of important}} contributions to the literature on self-regulation; the thesis identifies the use <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> as an additional explanation for why failures of self-regulation can occur even in those who are strongly committed to achieving important goals and provides an effective intervention for overcoming the impact <b>of</b> <b>justifications.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{explanation}} capability of expert systems is usually listed {{as one of}} the distinguishing characteristics of these systems, {{the explanation}} facilities of most existing systems are quite primitive. Computer generated explanations are typically produced from canned text or by direct translation of the knowledge structures. Explanations produced in this manner bear little resemblance to those produced by humans for similar tasks. The focus of our research in explanation is the production <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> for decisions by expert planning systems. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> written by people for planning tasks has been taken as the starting point. The purpose of this analysis is two-fold. First, analysis of the information content <b>of</b> the <b>justifications</b> will provide a basis for deciding what knowledge must be represented if human-like justifications are to be produced. Second, an analysis of the textual organization <b>of</b> the <b>justifications</b> will be used {{in the development of a}} mechanism for selecting and organizing the knowledge to be included in a computer-produced explanation. This paper describes a preliminary analysis done <b>of</b> <b>justifications</b> written by people for a planning task. It is clear that these justifications differ significantly from those that would be produced by an expert system by tracing the firing of production rules. The results from the text analysis have been used to develop an augmented phrase structured grammar (APSG) describing the organization <b>of</b> the <b>justifications.</b> The grammar was designed to provide a computationally feasible method for determining textual organization that will allow the necessary information to be communicated in a cohesive manner...|$|R

25|$|The words {{represent}} the sociolinguistic dimension and are {{understood as a}} function <b>of</b> <b>justification.</b> Justification systems are seen both {{at the level of}} individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context <b>of</b> <b>justification</b> in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of facial expression, body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood as a function of behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.|$|E
