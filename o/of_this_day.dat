Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E

The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us {{to the foot of the}} cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.|$|E

25|$|Among Sephardi Jews, prayers {{known as}} Selichot (forgiveness) are recited before the regular morning service (these {{are the same}} prayers recited before Rosh Hashanah). In the {{different}} prayers <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>day,</b> Syrian Jews pray in the same maqam (melody) as on the high holidays. In Amsterdam {{and in a few}} places in England, America, and elsewhere, the shofar is also sounded in connection with the processions. The latter practice reflects the idea that Hoshana Rabbah {{is the end of the}} High Holy Day season, when the world is judged for the coming year. Because Hoshanah Rabbah is also linked to the high holidays as well as being a joy filled day some Hasidic communities such as Satmar have the custom of having Birchat Cohanim/Priestly Blessing recited during the Mussaf service. Some communities such as Bobov will only do this if it is on Friday. However this practice is not generally done.|$|E

Between these two extremes, it is easy, from what hath been said, to choose a middle; to be good and loyal subjects, yet, according to your power, faithful assertors of your religion and liberties; to avoid all broachers and preachers of newfangled doctrines in the Church; to be strict observers of the laws, which cannot be justly taken from you without your own consent: In short, 'to obey God and the King, and meddle not with those who are given to change.' ...|$|E
