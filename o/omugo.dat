40|$|Background: The {{development}} of arsenical and diamidine resistance in Trypanosoma brucei {{is associated with}} loss of drug uptake by the P 2 purine transporter {{as a result of}} alterations in the corresponding T. brucei adenosine transporter 1 gene (TbAT 1). Previously, specific TbAT 1 mutant type alleles linked to melarsoprol treatment failure were significantly more prevalent in T. b. gambiense from relapse patients at <b>Omugo</b> health centre in Arua district. Relapse rates of up to 30 % prompted a shift from melarsoprol to eflornithine (a-difluoromethylornithine, DFMO) as first-line treatment at this centre. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the status of TbAT 1 in recent isolates collected from T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness patients from Arua and Moyo districts in Northwestern Uganda after this shift in first-line drug choice. Methodology and results: Blood and cerebrospinal fluids of consenting patients were collected for DNA preparation and subsequent amplification. All of the 105 isolates from <b>Omugo</b> that we successfully analysed by PCR-RFLP possessed the TbAT 1 wild type allele. In addition, PCR/RFLP analysis was performed for 74 samples from Moyo, where melarsoprol is still the first line drug; 61 samples displayed the wild genotype while six were mutant and seven had a mixed pattern of both mutant and wild-type TbAT 1. The melarsoprol treatment failure rate at Moyo over the same period was nine out of 101 stage II cases that were followed up at least once. Five of the relapse cases harboured mutant TbAT 1, one had the wild type, while no amplification was achieved from the remaining three samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing problem}} with drug {{resistance}} in Human African Trypanosomiasis has necessitated {{the implementation of}} screening programmes to monitor for its spread. This thesis describes the study of several factors that can influence the selection and propagation of drug resistance in T. brucei. Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is caused by T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense. The few drugs used {{for the treatment of}} the disease are either toxic, cause severe side effects or suffer from parasite resistance. The T. brucei P 2 transporter, which is encoded by the gene TbAT 1, mediates uptake of melaminophenyl arsenicals and diamidines. Reduced P 2 uptake is associated with drug resistance. A number of point mutations found in a laboratory derived melarsoprol resistant T. brucei stock (STIB 777 R) allowed development of a PCR/RFLP based molecular method to identify resistance alleles. By 1999, 20 - 30 % of patients treated in <b>Omugo,</b> NW Uganda were failing to respond to melarsoprol. PCR/RFLP analysis indicated that mutant alleles accounted for 58. 5 % of those in circulation. Melarsoprol was withdrawn in 2001 and by 2003 mutant TbAT 1 alleles accounted for only 14 % of those in circulation in NW Uganda. The current study aimed to determine the incidence of the PCR/Sfa NI TbAT 1 mutant alleles in 2006, some five years after melarsoprol had been withdrawn as first-line treatment. Successful molecular analysis of 91 of 132 (68. 9 %) T. b. gambiense field isolates from <b>Omugo</b> and Moyo in NW Uganda indicated the presence of only TbAT 1 wild type alleles. Mutant alleles thus appear to have disappeared. This {{may be the result of}} parasite fitness cost following the withdrawal of melarsoprol as a stage II first-line drug from <b>Omugo</b> health centre, Arua, since 2001. This apparent instability of TbAT 1 mutants in the field may be exploited for rational or alternating use of melarsoprol and eflornithine (DFMO) to ensure a longer life for eflornithine, delaying the onset of resistance. Insight into the overall population structure of the T. b. gambiense from <b>Omugo,</b> Arua (N= 54) and Moyo (N= 17) was obtained using mini/microsatellite marker analysis. Genetic diversity was observed to be more intra than inter regional. Multilocus genotype data analysis revealed the <b>Omugo,</b> Arua, population was genetically distinct from the Moyo population (Nei’s genetic distance= 0. 176). The evidence indicated surprisingly little genetic exchange with an excess in homozygosity (Fis > 0) and alleles in linkage disequilibrium (P< 0. 05) within the <b>Omugo,</b> trypanosome population. This excess in homozygosity may be due to population sub-structuring, trypanosome inbreeding, or migration of patients. The latter is likely occurring from the neighbouring T. b. gambiense endemic disease focus in Southern Sudan. The findings suggested that the T. b. gambiense from Arua is not panmictic, clonal or epidemic but there is some level of genetic exchange. The possibility that T. b. gambiense can infect animals raises the prospect that wild or domestic animals may act as a reservoir and that a veterinary link to gambiense Human African Trypanosomiasis exists. Treatment of animals for babesiosis and trypanosomes with diminazene, uptake of which is mediated through TbAT 1 /P 2 could select for P 2 -defective drug resistant trypanosomes, thereby threatening control of the human disease as well. Species detection by PCR for animal and human trypanosomes in dog isolates (N= 190) from the tsetse fly endemic Jos Plataeu, Nigeria did not reveal T. b. gambiense, but multiple infections with T. brucei (95 %), T. vivax (89 %), and subspecies T. congolense forest (54 %) and savannah (50 %) were detected. The dogs were also infected with other parasites, including Babesia canis (22 %) and Hepatozoon canis (16 %). Multiple infections can make correct diagnosis difficult and the infections are likely to be missed by the less sensitive microscopy method. The trypanocidal action of the diamidine group of trypanocides, diminazene, pentamidine and furamidine (DB 75) are principally mediated through the TbAT 1 /P 2. In addition, pentamidine is taken up by two additional T. brucei transporters called High Affinity Pentamidine Transporter (HAPT 1) and the Low Affinity Pentamidine Transporter (LAPT 1). DB 75 also has a secondary unknown route. Loss of TbAT 1 /P 2 leads to significant resistance to DB 75 and diminazene but not pentamidine. Identification of other markers of resistance is necessary to determine if other routes of drug entry do exist apart from P 2 and whether these can be exploited for the delivery of new trypanocides into the trypanosomes. Adaptation of the T. brucei tbat 1 knock-out cell line to higher concentrations of diminazene by in vitro selection for resistance led to loss of HAPT 1. The resultant phenotype was similar to the previously characterised pentamidine resistant clone B 48, but more resistant to diminazene and DB 75. The adapted line was still capable of accumulating 1 µM radiolabelled diminazene suggesting both HAPT 1 and LAPT 1 as possible routes for diminazene uptake. Adaptation of the T. brucei tbat 1 knock-out cell line to a high concentration of DB 75 over the same 6 months period did not lead to increased resistance. Overall the project has confirmed an important role for tbat 1 /P 2 in development of resistance to melarsoprol in the field. Importantly, it appears that removal of the selection pressure of melarsoprol leads to a loss of tbat 1 alleles associated with resistance in a population of trypanosomes capable of genetic exchange in NW Uganda. Although evidence for a dog reservoir for T. b. gambiense in Nigeria was lacking in this study, a risk of selecting resistance in animals must remain high on any list of consideration. I have further shown that the diamidine drug, diminazene, used in veterinary medicine also appears to enter T. brucei via the HAPT 1 transporter, as well as the P 2 transporter. Loss of HAPT 1 through selection with diminazene leads to high level pentamidine resistance, which could indicate a further risk in selection of human infectious trypanosomes also resistant to drugs like pentamidine.

40|$|Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) manifests as {{a chronic}} {{infection}} caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, or {{as a more}} acute form due to T. b. rhodesiense. Both manifestations occur in Uganda and melarsoprol use against the former was jeopardised in the 1990 s as reports of reduced efficacy increased {{to the point where}} it was dismissed as first-line treatment at some treatment centers. Previous work to elucidate possible mechanisms leading to melarsoprol resistance pointed to a P 2 type adenosine transporter known to mediate melarsoprol uptake and previously shown to be mutated in significant numbers of patients not responding to the drug. Our present findings indicate that there is a low prevalence of mutants in foci where melarsoprol relapses are infrequent. In addition we observe that at the <b>Omugo</b> focus where the drug was withdrawn as first line over 6 years ago, the mutant alleles have disappeared, suggesting that drug pressure is responsible for fuelling their spread. Thus constant monitoring for mutants could play a key role in cost-effective HAT management by identifying which foci can still use the less logistically demanding melarsoprol as opposed to the alternative drug eflornithine. What is required now is a simple method for identifying such mutants at the point of care, enabling practitioners to make informed prescriptions at first diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|We report {{efficacy}} and safety outcomes from a prospective case series of 31 late-stage T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis, HAT) patients {{treated with a}} combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine (N+E) in Yumbe, northwest Uganda in 2002 - 2003, following on a previously reported terminated trial in nearby <b>Omugo,</b> in which 17 patients received the combination under the same conditions. Eligible sequential late-stage patients received 400 mg/Kg/day eflornithine (Ornidyl, Sanofi-Aventis) for seven days plus 15 mg/Kg/day (20 mg for children < 15 years old) nifurtimox (Lampit, Bayer AG) for ten days. Efficacy (primary outcome) was monitored for 24 months post discharge. Clinical and laboratory adverse events (secondary outcome) were monitored during treatment. All 31 patients were discharged alive, but two died post-discharge of non-HAT and non-treatment causes, and one was lost to follow-up. Efficacy ranged from 90. 3 % to 100. 0 % according to analysis approach. Five patients experienced major adverse events during treatment, and neutropenia was common (9 / 31 patients). Combined with the previous group of 17 trial patients, this case series yields a group of 48 patients treated with N+E, among whom no deaths judged to be treatment- or HAT-related, no treatment terminations and no relapses have been noted, a very favourable outcome in the context of late-stage disease. N+E could be the most promising combination regimen available for sleeping sickness, and deserves further evaluation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Our {{objective}} was to compare the efficacy and safety of three drug combinations {{for the treatment of}} late-stage human African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. DESIGN: This trial was a randomized, open-label, active control, parallel clinical trial comparing three arms. SETTING: The study took place at the Sleeping Sickness Treatment Center run by Médecins Sans Frontières at <b>Omugo,</b> Arua District, Uganda PARTICIPANTS: Stage 2 patients diagnosed in Northern Uganda were screened for inclusion and a total of 54 selected. INTERVENTIONS: Three drug combinations were given to randomly assigned patients: melarsoprol-nifurtimox (M+N), melarsoprol-eflornithine (M+E), and nifurtimox-eflornithine (N+E). Dosages were uniform: intravenous (IV) melarsoprol 1. 8 mg/kg/d, daily for 10 d; IV eflornithine 400 mg/kg/d, every 6 h for 7 d; oral nifurtimox 15 (adults) or 20 (children < 15 y) mg/kg/d, every 8 h for 10 d. Patients were followed up for 24 mo. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were cure rates and adverse events attributable to treatment. RESULTS: Randomization was performed on 54 patients before enrollment was suspended due to unacceptable toxicity in one of the three arms. Cure rates obtained with the intention to treat analysis were M+N 44. 4 %, M+E 78. 9 %, and N+E 94. 1 %, and were significantly higher with N+E (p = 0. 003) and M+E (p = 0. 045) than with M+N. Adverse events were less frequent and less severe with N+E, resulting in fewer treatment interruptions and no fatalities. Four patients died who were taking melarsoprol-nifurtimox and one who was taking melarsoprol-eflornithine. CONCLUSIONS: The N+E combination appears to be a promising first-line therapy that may improve treatment of sleeping sickness, although the results from this interrupted study do not permit conclusive interpretations. Larger studies are needed to continue the evaluation of this drug combination in the treatment of T. b. gambiense sleeping sickness...|$|E
