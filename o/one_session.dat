In his last Sheffield Shield match, he scored an unbeaten 231 against South Australia {{in less than five}} hours, including 120 runs in <b>one</b> <b>session.</b> This set up a ten-wicket victory. In his final season, Harvey scored 1110 runs at 52.85.|$|E
5|$|Under the Constitution, {{at least}} <b>one</b> <b>session</b> of the Diet must be convened each year. The Cabinet can also, at will, convoke {{extraordinary}} sessions of the Diet and is required to, when a quarter {{or more of}} the total members of either house demands it. During an election, only the House of Representatives is dissolved. The House of Councillors is however, not dissolved but only closed, and may, in times of national emergency, be convoked for an emergency session. The Emperor both convokes the Diet and dissolves the House of Representatives, but only does so on the advice of the Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|After missing {{most of the}} 193435 {{domestic}} season due to injury, McCabe scored an unbeaten 189 in the Second Test of the 193536 tour of South Africa, {{including a}} century in <b>one</b> <b>session,</b> taking Australia {{to the brink of}} a world record-breaking victory on a difficult final-day pitch in poor light before the match was called off. It was one of two Test centuries McCabe made on the tour. The following season, he made five fifties in the first four Tests before scoring a century to help Australia win the deciding final Test against the touring Englishmen. In the First Test of the 1938 tour of England, McCabe played what was regarded as his greatest innings, scoring 232 in four hours, including his last 72 in 28 minutes. Bradman regarded the innings as the greatest batting he ever saw. However, none of McCabe’s three most famous innings resulted in an Australian victory; he has a reputation of being at his best when Australia was in difficulty.|$|E

5|$|By March 2008, the duo had {{recruited}} SebRochford to play drums with Byrne in New York City. Later that month, multi-instrumentalist {{and previous}} Eno collaborator LeoAbrahams was enlisted to perform guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio. Abrahams and Rochford would continue {{working on the}} tracks in Abrahams' studio through May and their work was e-mailed to other collaborators—Byrne attended <b>one</b> <b>session</b> to play guitar. Other musicians worked with Byrne in NewYorkCity and Eno in London, such as frequent Byrne collaborator MauroRefosco, Eno's daughters Darla and Irial, and JarvisCocker of Pulp, who added uncredited guitar in London. The duo attempted to record {{as much of the}} music from home studios as possible and played almost all instrumentation themselves, saving the drums and percussion for the studio. In addition to the tracks that were released, the musicians had some other instrumentals that Byrne did not complete.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, Canadian Brent Moffat set the World Record {{for most}} body piercings in <b>one</b> <b>session</b> (700 piercings with 18g {{surgical}} needles in 1 session of 7 hours, using play piercing where {{the skin is}} pierced and sometimes jewellery is inserted, which is worn temporarily). In December of the same year, Moffat had 900 piercings in 4½ hours. On 4 March 2006, the record was overturned by Kam Ma, who had 1,015 temporary metal rings inserted in 7 hours and 55 minutes. The record for most body piercings with surgical needles was set on 29 May 2008, when Robert Jesus Rubio allowed 900 18-gauge, -long surgical needles to be inserted into his body.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a collision with Esteban Gutiérrez in the Australian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso was ruled out of the event with broken ribs and a pneumothorax, and as a result was replaced with McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Gutiérrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired, mostly caused by the crane during the recovery process and not in the accident itself. Meanwhile, Ferrari were able to use the same engine in Kimi Räikkönen's car as they had done in Australia, even though it had caught fire following a failure of the turbo charger. Swift reactions by the team on the scene prevented damage to the combustion engine, with only the turbo changed for Bahrain. Alfonso Celis Jr. made his first appearance in a Formula <b>One</b> <b>session</b> during the first free practice for Force India.|$|E

5|$|Ireland {{was further}} {{represented}} in the House of Lords by four Lords Spiritual, who sat in rotation for terms lasting <b>one</b> <b>session</b> each. At any one time, an Archbishop and three Bishops represented Ireland, with the seats passing according to a fixed rotation, except that those Lords Spiritual who were also elected to serve as representative peers would be omitted. The rotation was changed by the Church Temporalities Act of 1833, which merged many dioceses and degraded the archbishoprics of Tuam and Cashel to bishoprics. Following its disestablishment in 1871 by the Irish Church Act 1869, the Church of Ireland ceased to send spiritual representatives to the Lords.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{traveled}} to the Oregon Country in 1845. He {{played a central role}} in blazing the last leg of the Oregon Trail, the Barlow Road, with Sam Barlow and others. Specifically, Palmer is noted for having climbed high on Mount Hood to observe the surrounding area when the party ran into difficulty. He wrote a popular immigrant guidebook, co-founded Dayton, Oregon, and served as a controversial Indian Affairs administrator. After Oregon became a state, Palmer served in both branches of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. He was selected as Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives for <b>one</b> <b>session</b> in 1862, and in 1870 lost a bid to become Governor of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{days after}} the Double Tenth, Bishop John Wilson of St Andrew's Cathedral {{was taken to the}} YMCA, and placed in the cell next to Elizabeth. He was {{severely}} beaten for three days before the Japanese accepted that he was not one of the ringleaders in their imagined conspiracy. One night Elizabeth saw Rob Scott, by then badly disfigured {{as a result of the}} beatings and water tortures that he had been subjected to. At the end of <b>one</b> <b>session</b> Scott was told that he had been sentenced to death, and was forced to write a farewell letter to his wife. He was later sentenced to six years' imprisonment in Outram Road Prison instead, the site where convicted sepoy mutineers had been detained and executed by the British Army in 1915.|$|E

5|$|A two-man {{committee}} was created {{with the aim}} of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games. Duncan F. Curry and William F. Ladd were chosen as the committee members, but Ladd withdrew and Adams was named as a substitute. His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games. At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory. A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854. Adams favored nine-inning games, while Curry wanted contests to last seven innings. A convention was scheduled for early 1857, and Adams joined a three-man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates. At the convention, which consisted of <b>one</b> <b>session</b> each in January and February, Adams was voted president. The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven-inning games, but the other teams backed a motion for nine-inning contests, which passed.|$|E
