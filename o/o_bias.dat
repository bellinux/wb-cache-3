40|$|Dry {{deposition}} is {{an important}} removal process controlling surface ozone. We examine the representation of this ozone loss mechanism in the Community Earth System Model. We first correct the dry deposition parameterization by coupling the leaf and stomatal vegetation resistances to the leaf area index, an omission which has adversely impacted over a decade of ozone simulations using both the Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART) and Community Atmospheric Model-Chem (CAM-Chem) global models. We show that this correction increases O dry deposition velocities over vegetated regions and improves the simulated seasonality in this loss process. This enhanced removal reduces the previously reported bias in summertime surface O simulated over eastern U. S. and Europe. We further optimize the parameterization by scaling down the stomatal resistance used in the Community Land Model to observed values. This in turn further improves the simulation of dry deposition velocity of O, particularly over broadleaf forested regions. The summertime surface <b>O</b> <b>bias</b> is reduced from 30 ppb to 14 ppb over eastern U. S. and 13 ppb to 5 ppb over Europe from the standard to the optimized scheme, respectively. O deposition processes must therefore be accurately coupled to vegetation phenology within 3 -D atmospheric models, {{as a first step}} toward improving surface O and simulating O responses to future and past vegetation changes.

Pressure-latitude cross-sections and seasonal time series demonstrate that CMAM reproduces the observed global CO, N 2 O, and CH 4 distributions quite well. Generally, excellent agreement with measurements is found between CO simulations and observations {{in the stratosphere}} and mesosphere. Differences between the simulations and the ACE-FTS observations are generally within 30 %, and the differences between CMAM results and SMR and MLS observations are slightly larger. These differences are comparable with {{the difference between the}} instruments in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. Comparisons of N 2 O show that CMAM results are usually within 15 % of the measurements in the lower and middle stratosphere, and the observations are close to each other. However, the standard version of CMAM has a low N 2 <b>O</b> <b>bias</b> in the upper stratosphere. The CMAM CH 4 distribution also reproduces the observations in the lower stratosphere, but has a similar but smaller negative bias in the upper stratosphere. The negative bias may be due to that the gravity drag is not fully resolved in the model. The simulated polar CO evolution in the Arctic and Antarctic agrees with the ACE and MLS observations. CO measurements from 2006 show evidence of enhanced descent of air from the mesosphere into the stratosphere in the Arctic after strong stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs). CMAM also shows strong descent of air after SSWs. In the tropics, CMAM captures the annual oscillation in the lower stratosphere and the semiannual oscillations at the stratopause and mesopause seen in Aura/MLS CO and N 2 O observations and in Odin/SMR N 2 O observations.

40|$|We {{describe}} the setup and first {{results of an}} inverse modelling system for atmospheric N 2 O, based on a four-dimensional variational (4 DVAR) technique and the atmospheric transport zoom model TM 5. We focus in this study on the European domain, utilizing a comprehensive set of quasi-continuous measurements over Europe, complemented by N 2 O measurements from the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA/ESRL) cooperative global air sampling network. Despite ongoing measurement comparisons among networks parallel measurements at {{a limited number of}} stations show that significant offsets exist among the different laboratories. Since the spatial gradients of N 2 O mixing ratios are of the same order of magnitude as these biases, the direct use of these biased datasets would lead to significant errors in the derived emissions. Therefore, in order to also use measurements with unknown offsets, a new bias correction scheme has been implemented within the TM 5 - 4 DVAR inverse modelling system, thus allowing the simultaneous assimilation of observations from different networks. The N 2 <b>O</b> <b>bias</b> corrections determined in the TM 5 - 4 DVAR system agree within ~ 0. 1 ppb (dry-air mole fraction) with the bias derived from the measurements at monitoring stations where parallel NOAA discrete air samples are available. The N 2 O emissions derived for the northwest European and east European countries for 2006 show good agreement with the bottom-up emission inventories reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Moreover, the inverse model can significantly narrow the uncertainty range reported in N 2 O emission inventories for these countries, while the lack of measurements does not allow to reduce the uncertainties of emission estimates in southern Europe. Several sensitivity experiments were performed to test the robustness of the results. It is shown that also inversions without detailed a priori spatio-temporal emission distributions are capable to reproduce major regional emission patterns within the footprint of the existing atmospheric network, demonstrating the strong constraints of the atmospheric observations on the derived emission...|$|E

A major observational data collation is undertaken, processing 1, 033, 463, 750 measurements of O 3 and some of its major precursors, from 16, 996 sites, through a number of rigorous data quality checks, to ensure data is of a high enough quality for global model evaluation. Through a model–measurement comparison, applying spectral analysis, substantial seasonal <b>biases</b> of surface <b>O</b> 3 in GEOS-Chem are found, with a general overestimation of the seasonal amplitudes in North America and Europe (by up to 16 ppbv), together with delayed phase maxima by 1 – 5 months. The main cause of these biases is found to be homogenous overestimates of summertime O 3 in all observed areas, by a minimum of 10 ppbv. An extensive global sensitivity study is undertaken to evaluate the sensitivity of modelled surface <b>O</b> 3 <b>biases</b> to alterations of anthropogenic emissions, biogenic emissions, and the O 3 dry deposition flux. Constraining model <b>biases</b> jointly by <b>O</b> 3, NO and CO observations yields regional optimal monthly scaling factors. Driving GEOS-Chem with these derived factors results in the modelled summertime overestimates of surface O 3 being removed almost entirely, across all regions. The removal of this bias is dominantly controlled through increases to the summertime O 3 dry deposition flux (by factors of 2 – 4), with modifications to this term providing the only viable pathway for substantial reduction of modelled summertime biases, in all evaluated regions. Surface O 3 is found to be NOx sensitive in all regions, with scalings of VOC emissions generally not imparting significant change on O 3.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{simulation}} {{results from a}} CMAQ model and GOME- 2 NO 2 retrievals over the United States for August 2009 to estimate the model-simulated biases of NO x concentrations over six geological regions (Pacific Coast = PC, Rocky Mountains = RM, Lower Middle = LM, Upper Middle = UM, Southeast = SE, Northeast = NE). By comparing GOME- 2 NO 2 columns to corresponding CMAQ NO 2 columns, we produced satellite-adjusted NO x emission ("GOME 2009 ") and compared baseline emission ("BASE 2009 ") CMAQ simulations with GOME 2009 CMAQ runs. We found that the latter exhibited decreases of − 5. 6 %, − 12. 3 %, − 21. 3 %, and − 15. 9 % over the PC, RM, LM, and SE regions, respectively, and increases of + 2. 3 % and + 10. 0 % over the UM and NE regions. In addition, we found that changes in NO x emissions generally mitigate discrepancies between the surface NO x concentrations of baseline CMAQ and those of AQS at EPA AQS stations (mean bias of + 19. 8 % to − 13. 7 % over PC, − 13. 8 % to − 36. 7 % over RM, + 149. 7 % to − 1. 8 % over LM, + 22. 5 % to − 7. 8 % over UM, + 31. 3 % to − 7. 9 % over SE, and + 11. 6 % to + 0. 7 % over NE). The relatively high simulated NO x biases from baseline CMAQ over LM (+ 149. 7 %) are likely the results of over-predictions of simulated NO x emissions, which could shed light on those from global/regional Chemical Transport Models. We also perform more detailed investigations on surface NO x and O 3 concentrations in two urban and outflow areas, PC (e. g., Los Angeles, South Pasadena, Anaheim, La Habra and Riverside) and LM (e. g., Houston, Beaumont and Sulphur). From two case studies, {{we found that the}} GOME 2009 emissions decreased surface NO x concentrations significantly in the urban areas of PC (up to 30 ppbv) and in those of LM (up to 10 ppbv) during the daytime and that simulated NO x concentrations from CMAQ with GOME 2009 compare well to those of in-situ AQS observations. A significant reduction in NO x concentrations resulted in a comparable increase in surface O 3 concentrations in the urban areas of PC (up to 30 ppbv) and the resulting simulated O 3 concentrations compare well with in-situ surface O 3 observations over South Pasadena, Anaheim, and Riverside. Over Houston, Beaumont, and Sulphur, large reductions in NO x emissions from CMAQ with GOME 2009 coincides with large reduced concentrations of simulated NO x. These concentrations {{are similar to those of}} the EPA AQS NO x observations. However, the resulting simulated increase in surface O 3 at the urban stations in Houston and Sulphur exacerbated preexisting high O 3 over-predictions of the baseline CMAQ. This study implies that simulated low <b>O</b> 3 <b>biases</b> in the urban areas of PC are likely caused by simulated high NO x <b>biases,</b> but high <b>O</b> 3 <b>biases</b> in the urban areas of LM cannot be explained by simulated high NO x biases over the region.

The goals {{achieved by the}} deployment include 1) control of NOx to a desired setpoint, 2) balancing of combustion and reheat steam temperatures across the boiler, and 3) maximization of boiler efficiency.

Comparisons against independent satellite, aircraft, and ozonesonde data show that the data assimilation results in substantial improvements for various chemical compounds.

High-resolution emissions using the bottom-up HERMESv 2. 0 model are essential for improving model performance when increasing resolution on an urban scale, but it is still insufficient.

In the classic example from [5], Alice and Bob are getting a divorce, {{and would like to}} decide who gets the car. They decide to toss a coin for that purpose, but don’t trust each other. In such a scenario, they could instead play any fair game to decide the issue. Motivated by this, we consider the following weaker version of coin-flipping. A weak coin flipping protocol with <b>bias</b> <b>ǫ,</b> is a two-party communication game in the style of [11], in which the players start with no inputs, and compute a value cA,cB ∈ { 0, 1 } respectively or declare that the other player is cheating.

40|$|CALIOPE is a {{high-resolution}} {{air quality}} system which provides forecast for 24 and 48 h since October 2006 for Europe (12 km x 12 km, 1 h) and Spain (4 km x 4 km, 1 h). The meteorological {{model is the}} WRF-ARW model (version 3. 2. 1) initialized by the FNL/NCEP data. The emissions are estimated by means a top-down approach implemented in the High-Elective Resolution Modeling Emission System (HERMES version 2. 0) based on the EMEP inventory for the year 2008. The Chemical Transport Model (CTM) is the CMAQ (version 4. 5) using the CB-IV chemical mechanism and AERO 4 mode for aerosols. Several evaluation studies and near-real time evaluation (NRT) against air quality measurements on an hourly basis support the confidence on the system. The present contribution evaluates the CALIOPE system over Europe using CMAQ CTM version 5. 0 (CB 05 and AERO 5) which is working in forecast mode since 9 April 2012. The comparison between both CMAQ versions is done in terms of gaseous and aerosol concentrations (O 3, NO 2, SO 2, PM 10, and PM 2. 5) at the lowest level. Forecast concentrations are compared against observations on an hourly basis from the European air quality database (Airbase) which classifies stations as background rural/suburban. Results indicate that CMAQv 5. 0 improves O 3 forecast daily cycle, especially at nighttime over suburban stations, where <b>O</b> 3 <b>biases</b> are reduced between 20 and 40 µgm- 3. The CMAQv 5. 0 improves the forecast of NO 2 peaks at suburban stations reducing biases ~ 10 - 20 µgm- 3. PM 10 forecast also improves with the new CMAQ version. Episodes of secondary aerosol formation are now reproduced (i. e. 7 - 14 may 2012), where bias are reduce in ~ 10 - 20 µgm- 3. Furthermore, PM 10 hourly peaks in suburban stations are better reproduced reducing hourly biases ~ 5 - 10 µgm- 3. The contribution also evaluates the effect of using the Kalman filter post-process to reduce systematic bias in both CMAQ versions. Results show that the bias-adjustment technique is more effective over CMAQv 5. 0. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|An {{ensemble}} of regional chemical modeling (WRF/Chem with RADM 2) simulations, satellite, ozonesonde, and surface observations during July 7 - 11, 2007 {{was used to}} examine the horizontal and vertical signature of one of the worst smog events in the eastern U. S. in the past decade. The general features of this event [...] a broad area of high pressure, weak winds and heavy pollution, terminated by the passage of a cold front [...] were well simulated by the model. Average 8 -hr maximum O 3 has a mean (±Σ) bias of 0. 59 (± 11. 0) ppbv and a root mean square error of 11. 0 ppbv. WRF/Chem performed the best on poor air quality days, simulating correctly the spatial pattern of surface O 3. Yet the model underpredicted O 3 maxima by 5 - 7 ppbv in the Northeast and overpredicted by 8 - 11 ppbv in the Southeast. High <b>O</b> 3 <b>biases</b> in the Southeast are explained by overpredicted temperatures in the model (> 1. 5 °C). Sensitivity simulations with 1) accelerated O 3 dry deposition velocity and 2) suppressed multiphase nitric acid formation pushed the model closer to observations. Simulated O 3 vertical profiles over Beltsville, MD showed good agreement with ozonesonde measurements, but the modeled boundary layer depth was overpredicted on July 9, contributing to the low bias over this region. During this severe smog episode, space-borne TES detected high total tropospheric column ozone (TCO) over the Western Atlantic Ocean off the coast near North and South Carolina. The standard product (OMI/MLS) missed the magnitude of these local maxima, but the level- 2 ozone profile (OMI) confirmed the TES observations. HYSPLIT back trajectories from these O 3 maxima intersected regions of strong convection over the Southeast and Great Lakes regions. When lightning NO emissions were implemented in WRF/Chem, the high concentrations of NOx and O 3 off the coast were well reproduced, showing that the exported O 3 was produced by a combination of natural NO and pollutants lofted from the lower atmosphere. Lastly, WINTER MONEX O 3 data from 1978 are presented for the first time here in discussion of open cell convection over Indonesia...|$|R

We characterize potential sampling biases in stratospheric trace gas climatologies of the Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) Data Initiative using chemical fields from a chemistry climate model simulation and sampling patterns from 16 satellite-borne instruments. The exercise is performed for the long-lived stratospheric trace gases O 3 and H 2 <b>O.</b> Monthly sample <b>biases</b> for <b>O</b> 3 exceed 10 % for many instruments in the high latitude stratosphere and in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere, while annual mean sampling biases reach values of up to 20 % in the same regions for some instruments. Sampling biases for H 2 O are generally smaller than for O 3, although still notable in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere and Southern Hemisphere high latitudes. The most important mechanism leading to monthly sampling bias is the non-uniform temporal sampling of many instruments, i. e., {{the fact that for}} many instruments, monthly means are produced from measurements which span less than the full month in question. Similarly, annual mean sampling biases are well explained by non-uniformity in the month-to-month sampling by different instruments. Non-uniform sampling in latitude and longitude are shown to also lead to non-negligible sampling biases, which are most relevant for climatologies which are otherwise free of sampling biases due to non-uniform temporal sampling...|$|R
40|$|Recent brain imaging {{studies using}} {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) have implicated a frontal-parietal network in the top-down control of attention. However, {{little is known about the}} timing and sequence of activations within this network. To investigate these timing questions, we used event-related electrical brain potentials (ERPs) and a specially designed visual-spatial attentional-cueing paradigm, which were applied as part of a multi-methodological approach that included a closely corresponding event-related fMRI study using an identical paradigm. In the first 400 ms post cue, attention-directing and control cues elicited similar general cue-processing activity, corresponding to the more lateral subregions of the frontal-parietal network identified with the fMRI. Following this, the attention-directing cues elicited a sustained negative-polarity brain wave that was absent for control cues. This activity could be linked to the more medial frontal–parietal subregions similarly identified in the fMRI as specifically involved in attentional orienting. Critically, both the scalp ERPs and the fMRI-seeded source modeling for this orienting-related activity indicated an earlier onset of frontal versus parietal contribution (; 400 versus; 700 ms). This was then followed (; 800 – 900 ms) by pretarget biasing activity in the region-specific visual-sensory occipital cortex. These results indicate an activation sequence of key components of the attentional-control brain network, providing insight into their functional roles. More specifically, these results suggest that voluntary attentional orienting is initiated by medial portions of frontal cortex, which then recruit medial parietal areas.

40|$|Upper {{water column}} {{dynamics}} {{in the southern}} South China Sea were reconstructed in order to track changes in {{the activity of the}} East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) since the Last Glacial Maximum. We used the difference in the stable oxygen isotopes (Delta d 18 O) and Mg/Ca-based temperatures (Delta T) of surface-dwelling (G. ruber) and thermocline-dwelling (P. obliquiloculata) planktonic foraminifera and the temperature difference between alkenone- and P. obliquiloculata Mg/Ca-based temperatures to estimate the upper ocean thermal gradient at International Marine Past Global Change Study (IMAGES) core MD 01 - 2390. Estimates of the upper ocean thermal gradient were used to reconstruct mixed layer dynamics. We find that ourDelta d 18 <b>O</b> estimates are <b>biased</b> by changes in salinity and, thus, do not display a true upper ocean thermal gradient. The Delta T of G. ruber and P. obliquiloculata as well as the alkenone and P. obliquiloculata suggest increased surface water mixing during the late glacial, likely due to enhanced EAWM winds. Surface water mixing was weaker during the late Holocene, indicating a weaker influence of winter monsoon winds. The weakest winter monsoon activity occurred between 6. 5 ka and 2. 5 ka. Inferred EAWM changes since the Last Glacial Maximum coincide with EAWM changes as recorded in Chinese loess sediments. We find that the intensity of the EAWM and the East Asian summer monsoon show an inverse behavior during the last glacial and deglaciation but covaried during the middle to late Holocene...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring the 2008 International Polar Year, the POLARCAT (Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport) campaign, {{conducted}} in summer over Greenland and Canada, produced {{a large number}} of measurements from three aircraft and seven ozonesonde stations. Here we present an observation-integrated analysis based on three different types of O 3 measurements: airborne lidar, airborne UV absorption or chemiluminescence measurement, and intensified electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesonde profiles. Discussion of the latitudinal and vertical variability of tropospheric ozone north of 55 ° N during this period is performed {{with the aid of a}} regional model (WFR-Chem). The model is able to reproduce the O 3 latitudinal and vertical variability but with a negative <b>O</b> 3 <b>bias</b> of 6 – 15  ppbv in the free troposphere above 4  km, especially over Canada. For Canada, large average CO concentrations in the free troposphere above 4  km ([*]>[*]  130  ppbv) and the weak correlation (3 and PV suggest that stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) is not the major contributor to average tropospheric ozone at latitudes less than 70 ° N, due to the fact that local biomass burning (BB) emissions were significant during the 2008 summer period. Conversely, significant STE is found over Greenland according to the better O 3 vs. PV correlation ([*]>[*]  40  %) and the higher values of the 75 th PV percentile. It is related to the persistence of cyclonic activity during the summer over Baffin Bay. Using differences between average concentration above Northern and Southern Canada, a weak negative latitudinal summer ozone gradient of − 6 to − 8  ppbv is found in the mid-troposphere between 4 and 8  km. This is attributed to an efficient O 3 photochemical production from BB emissions at latitudes less than 65 ° N, while the STE contribution is more homogeneous in the latitude range 55 – 70 ° N. A positive ozone latitudinal gradient of 12  ppbv is observed in the same altitude range over Greenland not because of an increasing latitudinal influence of STE, but because of different long-range transport from multiple mid-latitude sources (North America, Europe, and even Asia for latitudes higher than 77 ° N). For the Arctic latitudes (>[*]  80 ° N), free tropospheric O 3 concentrations during summer 2008 are related to a mixture of Asian pollution and stratospheric O 3 transport across the tropopause...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive characterization {{of a very}} deep stratospheric intrusion which occurred over the British Isles on 15 August 2007. The signature of this event is diagnosed using ozonesonde measurements over Lerwick, UK (60. 14 ° N, 1. 19 ° W) and is also well characterized using meteorological analyses from the global operational weather prediction model of Météo-France, ARPEGE. Modelled as well as assimilated fields of both ozone (O 3) and carbon monoxide (CO) {{have been used in}} order to better document this event. O 3 and CO from Aura/MLS and Terra/MOPITT instruments, respectively, are assimilated into the three-dimensional chemical transport model MOCAGE of Météo-France using a variational 3 -D-FGAT (First Guess at Appropriate Time) method. The validation of O 3 and CO assimilated fields is done using self-consistency diagnostics and by comparison with independent observations such as MOZAIC (O 3 and CO), AIRS (CO) and OMI (O 3). It particularly shows in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region that the assimilated fields are closer to MOZAIC than the free model run. The <b>O</b> 3 <b>bias</b> between MOZAIC and the analyses is − 11. 5 ppbv with a RMS of 22. 4 ppbv and a correlation coefficient of 0. 93, whereas between MOZAIC and the free model run, the corresponding values are 33 ppbv, 38. 5 ppbv and 0. 83, respectively. In the same way, for CO, the bias, RMS and correlation coefficient between MOZAIC and the analyses are − 3. 16 ppbv, 13 ppbv and 0. 79, respectively, whereas between MOZAIC and the free model they are 6. 3 ppbv, 16. 6 ppbv and 0. 71, respectively. The paper also {{presents a}} demonstration of the capability of O 3 and CO assimilated fields to better describe a stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) event in comparison with the free run modelled O 3 and CO fields. Although the assimilation of MLS data improves the distribution of O 3 above the tropopause compared to the free model run, it is not sufficient to reproduce the STE event well. Assimilated MOPITT CO allows a better qualitative description of the stratospheric intrusion event. The MOPITT CO analyses appear more promising than the MLS O 3 analyses in terms of their ability to capture a deep STE event. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} open the perspectives for using MOPITT CO in the STE studies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a validation of Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) ozone (O 3) profiles {{which are used}} to evaluate stratospheric transport in the chemistry transport model (CTM) Tracer Model version 5 (TM 5) using a linearized stratospheric O 3 chemistry scheme. A comparison of GOME O 3 profile measurements with independent O 3 sonde measurements at midlatitudes shows an excellent agreement. Differences are smaller than 5 %, well within {{the uncertainty of the}} O 3 sonde measurements. Within the tropics, the GOME O 3 profile differences are larger, with a clear lower stratospheric negative <b>O</b> 3 <b>bias</b> with compensating positive biases in the troposphere and higher stratosphere. The TM 5 model with linearized O 3 chemistry simulates realistic lower and middle stratospheric spatial and temporal O 3 variations on both short (daily) and long (seasonal) timescales. Model stratospheric O 3 is significantly overestimated in the extratropics and slightly underestimated in the tropics, as is also shown in a comparison with Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer total O 3 column measurements. This model bias predominantly occurs in the lower stratosphere and is present throughout the year, albeit with seasonal variations: The bias is larger during local winter compared with local summer. The particular spatial and seasonal variations of the model bias suggest a too fast meridional stratospheric transport in TM 5, which agrees with earlier found shortcomings of using winds from data assimilation systems. The model results are very sensitive to the data assimilation method in the numerical weather prediction that provides the model wind fields. A large reduction (up to 50 % of the bias) in modeled lower stratospheric midlatitude O 3 was found when winds from four-dimensional instead of three-dimensional data assimilation were used. Previous work has shown that using different forecast periods was important for improving the age of air. Model results differed with different forecast periods (up to 3 days), although the effect was mainly confined to high-latitude lower stratospheric O 3. Apparently, using different forecast periods is more important for age-of-air calculations than for stratospheric O 3 calculations. A positive bias in the extratropical lower stratosphere of about 20 % remained, possibly related to the lack of heterogeneous polar stratospheric O 3 destruction in TM 5.

These measurements provide a comprehensive data set to evaluate {{the performance of the}} 3 -D Regional Chemical Transport Model (REAM). The model is then applied to analyze the key factors affecting the springtime transitions of trace gas concentrations and export. The global GEOS-CHEM model is used to provide chemical initial and boundary conditions. Generally, the model results are in good agreement with the observations in the troposphere except for a low bias of upper tropospheric <b>O</b> 3; the <b>bias</b> decreases toward the summer and lower latitudes. The rate of observed surface O 3 increase in spring is simulated well by REAM. It is overestimated by GEOS-CHEM over the eastern United States. A key factor driving the model difference is daytime mixing depth. A shallow boundary layer in REAM leads to more efficient removal of radicals and hence slower activation of photochemistry in spring, when the primary radical source is relatively small. Comparison of top-down estimates of fossil fuel NOx emissions between REAM and GEOS-CHEM shows model dependence. The associated uncertainty is up to 20 % on a monthly basis. Averaging over a season reduces this uncertainty. While tropospheric column NO 2 decreases over the continent, it increases over the western North Atlantic due to lightning NOx production. Consequently, the REAM model simulates significant increases of tropospheric O 3 over the region as indicated by column data derived from TOMS-SAGE II. Lightning impact is also evident in model-simulated NOx exports...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe CAMx {{photochemical}} grid {{model was}} used to model ozone (O 3) and particulate matter (PM) over a European modeling domain for calendar year 2006 {{as part of the}} Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII). The CAMx base case utilized input data provided by AQMEII for emissions, meteorology and boundary conditions. Sensitivity of model outputs to input data was investigated by using alternate input data and changing other important modeling assumptions including the schemes to represent photochemistry, dry deposition and vertical mixing. Impacts on model performance were evaluated by comparisons with ambient monitoring data. Base case model performance for January and July 2006 exhibited under-estimation trends for all pollutants both in winter and summer, except for SO 2. SO 2 generally had little bias although some over-estimation occurred at coastal locations and this was attributed to incorrect vertical distribution of emissions from marine vessels. Performance for NOx and NO 2 was better in winter than summer. The tendency to under-predict daytime NOx and O 3 in summer may result from insufficient NOx emissions or overstated daytime dilution (e. g., too deep planetary boundary layer) or monitors that are located near sources (e. g., roadside monitors). Winter <b>O</b> 3 was <b>biased</b> low and this was attributed to a low <b>bias</b> in the <b>O</b> 3 boundary conditions. PM 10 was widely under-predicted in both winter and summer. The poor PM 10 was influenced by underestimation of coarse PM emissions. Sensitivities of O 3 concentrations to precursor emissions are quantified using the decoupled direct method in CAMx. The results suggest that O 3 production over the central and southern Europe during summer is mostly NOx-limited but for a more northerly city, London, O 3 production can be limited either by NOx or VOC depending upon daily meteorological conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWater {{stable isotope}} {{measurements}} (δD and δ 18 O) {{have been conducted}} on the Holocene part of two deep Greenland ice cores (Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) and NorthGRIP), located ∼ 320 km apart. These combined measurements provide the first two continuous Greenland Holocene deuterium excess profiles (d = δD − 8 δ 18 O), a parameter strongly influenced by changes in moisture sources. We discuss here temporal and regional fluctuations of the deuterium excess within central to north Greenland, with a mean temporal resolution of ∼ 4 years. Although GRIP and NorthGRIP exhibit similar annual mean surface temperatures and δ 18 O levels, a significant offset of modern deuterium excess is observed between the two sites. We attribute this offset to a different mix of modern moisture sources, pointing to regional-scale differences in moisture advection toward Greenland. The common long-term deuterium excess Holocene increasing trend is probably related to the increased relative contribution of low-latitude moisture to Greenland snowfall, {{in response to the}} change in the Earth obliquity, as symmetrically observed in Antarctica. Three abrupt declines punctuate the GRIP excess record (8. 2, 4. 5, and 0. 35 ka BP), suggesting associated reorganizations of the northern high latitudes hydrological cycle. The 8. 2 ka BP event is characterized by (1) a rapid cooling followed by a progressive warming and (2) a deuterium excess cooling restricted to GRIP, therefore totally different from rapid events during glacial times. By contrast, the NorthGRIP deuterium excess record is more stable. We propose that a slightly larger proportion of moisture supplied by local storm tracks to GRIP induces an isotopic compensation mechanism between simultaneous site and source temperature coolings, resulting in a rather temperature-insensitive δ 18 O profile, together with well-marked deuterium excess amplitudes. NorthGRIP δ 18 <b>O</b> seems less <b>biased</b> by isotopic processes and should provide a more reliable past temperature record...|$|R

Here we analyze the effect of changing emissions and climate, in isolation and combination, on EUS summertime surface ozone (O 3) over the recent past and the 21 st century in an ensemble of simulations performed with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory CM 3 chemistry-climate model. The simulated summertime EUS <b>O</b> 3 is <b>biased</b> high but captures the structure of observed changes in regional O 3 distributions following NOx emission reductions.

We contrast two different 21 st century scenarios: (i) representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4. 5 and (ii) simulations with well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGG) following RCP 4. 5 but with emissions of air pollutants and precursors held fixed at 2005 levels (RCP 4. 5 _WMGG).
