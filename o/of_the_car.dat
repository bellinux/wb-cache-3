5|$|Abbas Kiarostami's film Ten (2002) was an {{experiment}} that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. Kiarostami fastened cameras to the dashboard of a car, and then allowed his actors to act. There was no film crew in the car, and no director. There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing.|$|E
5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms at one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> There is a baggage rack at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> On some cars these have been replaced with a bicycle rack.|$|E

5|$|In Ardis, Maryland, a {{high-speed}} police chase unfolds at a waterfront. The driver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> Dr. William Secare, is cornered by officers but fights {{them off with}} surprising ease. Secare is shot as he runs up a gangplank and leaps off a ship into the water. The police fail to locate him but discover that his blood is green.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the {{station at the}} time, introduced car parking charges. It was noted that this resulted in less use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> parks, more local street parking and caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005.|$|E
5000|$|The {{regulations}} include sealed engines, gearboxes and differentials. This prevents expensive development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and {{ensures that}} all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> are identical, helping to provide close racing.|$|R

5|$|Press {{coverage}} of the concept XJ220 in 1988 was overwhelmingly positive {{and contributed to the}} decision in 1989 to put the XJ220 into limited production. The production version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was first shown to the public in October 1991, at the Tokyo Motor Show. The first car was released for press review in autumn 1991.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and double wishbone suspension, supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost}} of ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E
50|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{was built}} into <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> with fresh air ducts either end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> and <b>the</b> distribution ducting {{formed by the}} ceiling design.

5|$|The {{main unit}} began its work in August 1976 in Sardinia. Don McLaughlan, {{then head of}} public {{relations}} at Lotus Cars, heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype Lotus Esprit with all Lotus branding taped over, and parked it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences. While moving the car between shoots, Lotus test driver Roger Becker impressed with his handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{and for the rest}} of filming on Sardinia, Becker became the stunt driver.|$|E
5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government, the flag should be flown {{on the right side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> while the flag of the foreign country should be flown on the left side.|$|E
5|$|Troop sleepers, {{generally}} {{intended for}} use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with bunks stacked 3-high, and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were {{laid out in a}} cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car)</b> delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|E
5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
