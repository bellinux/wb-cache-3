25|$|Unlike {{some other}} virtual-machine {{architectures}} {{in which the}} virtual instructions are interpreted at run time, TIMI instructions are never interpreted. They constitute an intermediate compile time step and are translated into the processor's instruction set as the final compilation step. The TIMI instructions are stored within the final program object, {{in addition to the}} executable machine instructions. This is how application objects compiled on one processor family (e.g., the original CISC AS/400 48-bit processors) could be moved to a new processor (e.g., PowerPC 64-bit) without re-compilation. An application saved from the older 48-bit platform can simply be restored onto the new 64-bit platform where the operating system discards the <b>old</b> <b>machine</b> instructions and re-translates the TIMI instructions into 64-bit instructions for the new processor.|$|E

[...] The 1907 Michiganensian [...] opined {{that the team}} was [...] "at its best" [...] against Illinois, with [...] "eleven men in every play." [...] Seward Cramer in the Detroit Free Press wrote that Yost had [...] "three truly great players" [...] in Garrels, Curtis and Loell. [...] He noted the Curtis [...] "played like a fiend" [...] and called Loell [...] "the find of the year." [...] Cramer also {{expressed}} surprise at the improvement over the prior week: [...] "Never has any such improvement been seen in a team in seven days time. [...] Last Saturday, at Columbus, Michigan played a loafing, listless game. [...] The backs did not get into their plays with any quickness. [...] Something {{was wrong with the}} machinery, and during the past week Yost has taken apart the <b>old</b> <b>machine,</b> rearranged the gearing and put in a new driving wheel that makes the whole thing run so much more smoothly that the team that played Ohio State would look like a traction engine beside an easy running tourist auto." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick opined that the team was 50 to 75 percent better against Illinois than it was the prior week.|$|E
