Komisarjevsky, who had photographed the sexual assault of the girl on his cell phone, then provoked Hayes into raping Jennifer. While Hayes was raping her on the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> Komisarjevsky entered the room and announced that William Petit had escaped. Hayes then strangled Jennifer, doused her lifeless body {{and parts of the}} house, including the daughters' rooms, with gasoline. While tied to their beds, both daughters had been doused with gasoline; each had her head covered with a pillowcase. A fire was started, and Hayes and Komisarjevsky fled the scene. Hayley and Michaela both died of smoke inhalation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> {{is a large}} brick Rumford {{fireplace}} with angled cheeks on the firebox. Its mantel is done in a vernacular Greek Revival style, with thin framing pilasters topped by a wide, plain entablature with a molded cornice and plain shelf. Shelving with wide-board sheathing fills out the stone wall to the west. All the other walls are plaster on metal lath over the original plastered stone.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{the houses}} were 10–50 m2 in ground area, and were often {{provided}} with small gardens or vegetable plots, as well as adjoining workshops and storehouses. Inside, {{the houses were}} sometimes partitioned with curtains or wooden partitions, but usually they consisted of a single room; furniture was spartan, consisting of little more than benches and store chests; floors were strewn with rushes or straw; {{the only source of}} heat or light (other than the doorway) was the hearth in the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Rush lights fuelled by mutton fat were available, but they were expensive. A shuttered hole in the roof served as a chimney.|$|E

25|$|Though open-plan, the first-level {{interior}} of the Purcell–Cutts House features individual room areas by virtue of alterations in floor level and breadth of floor space, while the tented ceiling maintains the same height throughout. The ground floor living room area {{at the front of}} the house features a high ceiling, increasing available space for the repeated pairs of art glass windows that comprise the walls of the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> while the dining area behind, set a half-story above, has a low ceiling. The pointed prow separating the dining and living areas creates a small nook, reserved as Edna Purcell’s writing area. The effect of the main level’s design is to maintain intimacy within the larger space, not rendering adjacent spaces automatically visible in main areas of the house, while preserving unity between rooms and the openness of the entire floor.|$|E
500|$|The living room, , had {{at one end}} {{an alcove}} framing a stained glass window, {{a copy of the}} 13th century one in Lorenzkirche in Nuremberg, the {{reproduction}} fabricated in the Netherlands. The room's apex was 36 feet high—a meeting of steeply angled wooden beams resting on [...] thick stone walls. A tall fireplace separated the alcove from the majority of the living room; a large man could stand in its opening. Another fireplace warmed the other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Tapestries hung from the stone walls to add a medieval appearance. Frederick Meyer made furniture for this room, and for all Wyntoon, in European vernacular style.|$|E
500|$|The {{western part}} of the first floor is {{dominated}} by a large formal living room. The room has two entrances, one {{at the front of the}} hall, near the front door and the other at the back end of the hall. This was the room in which Elva Glidden married in the late 19th century. After 1941 the rear part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> or [...] "west" [...] room, was walled off and a second kitchen added. When Jessie Glidden, the last Glidden to occupy the old homestead, moved in 1998, the west room was restored to its original size and the second kitchen removed.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Summertime {{temperatures}} in UK homes are {{a matter of}} increasing concern, particularly because of global warming and an increased incidence of heat waves. Refurbishment adds to uncertainty about <b>the</b> resilience <b>of</b> UK homes to climate change. This paper examines internal summertime temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> and bedrooms <b>of</b> 282 homes in <b>the</b> UK city <b>of</b> Leicester. This is a statistically representative sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city’s housing stock. The generally cool monitoring period included {{a short period of}} hot weather.

In the 230 unheated homes, 28 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> and 88 % of bedrooms were classed as severely overheated, as judged by the static, CIBSE, criteria.

2500|$|The initial {{reception}} was critical: it was {{so small}} that only one person could work in it; some storage spaces intended for raw loose food ingredients such as flour were reachable by children. But the Frankfurt kitchen embodied a standard {{for the rest of}} the 20th century in rental apartments: the [...] "work kitchen". It was criticized as [...] "exiling the women in the kitchen", but post-World War II economic reasons prevailed. The kitchen once more was seen as a work place that needed to be separated from the living areas. Practical reasons also played a role in this development: just as in the bourgeois homes of the past, one reason for separating the kitchen was to keep the steam and smells of cooking out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
