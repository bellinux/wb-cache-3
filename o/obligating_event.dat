40|$|SummaryMutations in the PTEN, TP 53, and RB 1 {{pathways}} are <b>obligate</b> <b>events</b> in {{the pathogenesis}} of human glioblastomas. We induced various combinations of deletions in these tumor suppressors in astrocytes and neural precursors in mature mice, resulting in astrocytomas ranging from grade III to grade IV (glioblastoma). There was selection for mutation of multiple genes within a pathway, shown by somatic amplifications of genes in the PI 3 K or Rb pathway in tumors in which Pten or Rb deletion was an initiating event. Despite multiple mutations within PI 3 K and Rb pathways, elevated Mapk activation was not consistent. Gene expression profiling revealed striking similarities to subclasses of human diffuse astrocytoma. Astrocytomas were found within and outside of proliferative niches in the adult brain...|$|R
40|$|SummaryActivated phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -AKT {{signaling}} {{appears to}} be an <b>obligate</b> <b>event</b> in the development of cancer. The highly related members of the mammalian FoxO transcription factor family, FoxO 1, FoxO 3, and FoxO 4, represent one of several effector arms of PI 3 K-AKT signaling, prompting genetic analysis of the role of FoxOs in the neoplastic phenotypes linked to PI 3 K-AKT activation. While germline or somatic deletion of up to five FoxO alleles produced remarkably modest neoplastic phenotypes, broad somatic deletion of all FoxOs engendered a progressive cancer-prone condition characterized by thymic lymphomas and hemangiomas, demonstrating that the mammalian FoxOs are indeed bona fide tumor suppressors. Transcriptome and promoter analyses of differentially affected endothelium identified direct FoxO targets and revealed that FoxO regulation of these targets in vivo is highly context-specific, even in the same cell type. Functional studies validated Sprouty 2 and PBX 1, among others, as FoxO-regulated mediators of endothelial cell morphogenesis and vascular homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Tumor cells utilize glucose as {{a primary}} energy source and require ongoing lipid {{biosynthesis}} for growth. Expression of DecR 1, an auxiliary enzyme in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, is significantly diminished in numerous spontaneous mammary tumor models and in primary human breast cancer. Moreover, ectopic expression of DecR 1 in ErbB 2 /Neu-induced mammary tumor cells is sufficient to reduce levels of ErbB 2 /Neu expression and impair mammary tumor outgrowth. This correlates with a decreased proliferative index and reduced rates of de novo fatty acid synthesis in DecR 1 -expressing breast cancer cells. Although DecR 1 expression does not affect glucose uptake in ErbB 2 /Neu-transformed cells, sustained expression of DecR 1 protects mammary tumor cells from apoptotic cell death following glucose withdrawal. Moreover, expression of catalytically impaired DecR 1 mutants in Neu-transformed breast cancer cells restored Neu expression levels and increased mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. These results argue that DecR 1 is sufficient to limit breast cancer cell proliferation through its ability to limit the extent of oncogene expression and reduce steady-state levels of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, DecR 1 -mediated suppression of tumorigenesis can be uncoupled from its effects on Neu expression. Thus, while downregulation of Neu expression may contribute to DecR 1 -mediated tumor suppression in certain cell types, {{this is not an}} <b>obligate</b> <b>event</b> in all Neu-transformed breast cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of very dense genetic maps is changing in a fundamental way {{the methods used}} to identify the genetic basis of both rare and common inherited traits. The ability to directly compare the genomes of two related individuals and quickly identify those regions that are inherited identical-by-descent (IBD) from a recent common ancestor would be of utility {{in a wide range}} of genetic mapping methods. Here, we describe a simple method for using dense SNP maps to identify regions of the genome likely to be inherited IBD by family members. This method is based on identifying <b>obligate</b> recombination <b>events</b> and examining the pattern of distribution of such events along the genetic map. Specifically, we use the length of a consecutive set of biallelic markers that have a high probability of having avoided such <b>obligate</b> recombination <b>events.</b> This ``SNP streak" is derived from subsets of samples within a pedigree and allows us to make statistical inferences about the ancestry of the region(s) containing stretches of markers with these properties. We show that the use of subsets of more than two samples has the advantage of identifying shorter shared subsegments as significant. This mitigates the effects of errors in SNP calls. We provide specific examples of microarray-based SNP data, using a family with a complex pedigree and with a rare form of inherited kidney disease, to illustrate this approach. ...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: FASAB staff prepares memos {{and other}} {{materials}} to facilitate discussion of issues at Board meetings. This material is presented for discussion purposes only; it {{is not intended to}} reflect authoritative views of the FASAB or its staff. Official positions of the FASAB are determined only after extensive due process and deliberations. At the August meeting the Board agreed with staff recommendations for issues 1 - 6 and 10 identified in the August staff memorandum. See Appendix 1 for a table of the decisions. The objective of the October 2005 session on social insurance is to discuss the alternatives for issues number 7 and 8, i. e., display, disclosure, and required supplemental information (RSI). Regarding issue 9 and the additional social insurance programs, without objection the staff will develop the initial draft of the exposure document assuming the approach recommended in August is tentatively acceptable. For Railroad Retirement, an analogy will be drawn to Social Security and Medicare. For Unemployment Insurance and Black Lung Benefits, the SFFAS 17 requirements will be continued. The members will be able to review the approach when the provisions are fleshed out. Also, the staff is presenting three other questions for discussion. The first question, which arose at August meeting, asks whether the only “obligating event ” for social insurance is meeting the 40 quarters condition; or, whether increments in the liability for work after 40 quarters should be described as <b>obligating</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
40|$|Heterotrimeric G protein α (Gα) {{subunits}} possess intrinsic GTPase {{activity that}} leads to functional deactivation with a rate constant of ≈ 2 min- 1 at 30 °C. GTP hydrolysis causes conformational changes in three regions of Gα, including Switch I and Switch II. Mutation of G 202 →A in Switch II of Gαi 1 accelerates the rates of both GTP hydrolysis and conformational change, which {{is measured by the}} loss of fluorescence from Trp- 211 in Switch II. Mutation of K 180 →P in Switch I increases the rate of conformational change but decreases the GTPase rate, which causes transient but substantial accumulation of a low-fluorescence Gαi 1 ·GTP species. Isothermal titration calorimetric analysis of the binding of (G 202 A) Gαi 1 and (K 180 P) Gαi 1 to the GTPase-activating protein RGS 4 indicates that the G 202 A mutation stabilizes the pretransition state-like conformation of Gαi 1 that is mimicked by the complex of Gαi 1 with GDP and magnesium fluoroaluminate, whereas the K 180 P mutation destabilizes this state. The crystal structures of (K 180 P) Gαi 1 bound to a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog, and the GDP·magnesium fluoroaluminate complex provide evidence that the Mg 2 + binding site is destabilized and that Switch I is torsionally restrained by the K 180 P mutation. The data are consistent with a catalytic mechanism for Gα in which major conformational transitions in Switch I and Switch II are <b>obligate</b> <b>events</b> that precede the bond-breaking step in GTP hydrolysis. In (K 180 P) Gαi 1, the two events are decoupled kinetically, whereas in the native protein they are concerted...|$|R
40|$|The DYT 1 gene {{responsible}} for early-onset, idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD) in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, {{as well as}} in one large non-Jewish family, has been mapped to chromosome 9 q 32 - 34. Using (GT) n and RFLP markers in this region, we have identified <b>obligate</b> recombination <b>events</b> in some of these Jewish families, which further delineate the area containing the DYT 1 gene to a 6 -cM region bounded by loci AK 1 and ASS. In 52 unrelated, affected Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, we have found highly significant linkage disequilibrium between a particular extended haplotype at the ABL-ASS loci and the DYT 1 gene. The 4 /A 12 haplotype for ABL-ASS is present on 69 % of the disease-bearing chromosomes among affected Jewish individuals and on only 1 % of control Jewish chromosomes (χ 2 = 91. 07, P «. 001). The allelic association between this extended haplotype and DYT 1 predicts that these three genes lie within 1 – 2 cM of each other; on the basis of <b>obligate</b> recombination <b>events,</b> the DYT 1 gene is centromeric to ASS. Furthermore, this allelic association supports the idea that a single mutation event is {{responsible for}} most hereditary cases of dystonia in the Jewish population. Of the 53 definitely affecteds typed, 13 appear to be sporadic, with no family history of dystonia. However, the proportion of sporadic cases which potentially carry the A 12 haplotype at ASS (8 / 13 [62 %]) is similar to the proportion of familial cases with A 12 (28 / 40 [70 %]). This suggests that many sporadic cases are hereditary, that the disease gene frequency is greater than 1 / 15, 000, and that the penetrance is lower than 30 %, as previously estimated in this population. Most affected individuals were heterozygous for the ABL-ASS haplotype, a finding supporting autosomal dominant inheritance of the DYT 1 gene. The ABL-ASS extended-haplotype status will provide predictive value for carrier status in Jewish individuals. This information can be used for molecular diagnosis, evaluation of subclinical expression of the disease, and elucidation of environmental factors which may modify clinical symptoms...|$|R
40|$|An {{autosomal}} recessive form of juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) (MIM 600116) is a levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism whose pathological finding {{is a highly}} selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra. By linkage analysis of diallelic polymorphism of the Mn-superoxide dismutase gene (SOD 2), we found a family with AR-JP showing perfect segregation of the disease with the SOD 2 locus. By extending the linkage analysis to 13 families with AR-JP, we discovered strong evidence for the localization of the AR-JP gene at chromosome 6 q 25. 2 - 27, including the SOD 2 locus, with the maximal cumulative pairwise LOD scores of 7. 26 and 7. 71 at D 6 S 305 (theta =. 03) and D 6 S 253 (theta =. 02), respectively. Observation of <b>obligate</b> recombination <b>events,</b> as well as multipoint linkage analysis, placed the AR-JP gene in a 17 -cM interval between D 6 S 437 and D 6 S 264. Delineation of the AR-JP gene {{will be an important}} step toward our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying selective degeneration of the nigral neurons...|$|R
40|$|Lysine 622 in the ATP-binding {{domain of}} P 100 gag-mil, the {{translation}} {{product of the}} v-mil oncogene of MH 2, has been replaced with methionine using oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. This substitution results in the inactivation of the serine/threonine-specific autophosphorylation of P 100 gag-mil in vitro, indicating that this activity is an intrinsic property of the viral protein. This substitution also suppresses two of the biological properties of MH 2 which have previously {{been shown to be}} dependant upon the expression of v-mil, namely, the production of chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (cMGF) by v-myc-transformed chicken macrophages and the sustained proliferation of chicken neuroretina cells. These data strongly suggest that the biological properties of v-mil are mediated by the phosphorylation at serine/threonine residues of key cellular substrates. In contrast to the in vitro situation, both the mutant and wild-type proteins appear to be phosphorylated at the same sites and to the same extent in either transformed fibroblasts or macrophages. This, together {{with the fact that the}} sites phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro are essentially different indicate that most of the phosphate associated with P 100 gag-mil in transformed cells does not result from an <b>obligate</b> autophosphorylation <b>event</b> but from the phosphorylation by as yet uncharacterized cellular kinase(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{characteristics of}} the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of sex chromosomes remain elusive. Despite significant genome-sequencing efforts, the PAR of highly differentiated avian sex chromosomes remains to be identified. Here we use linkage analysis together with whole-genome re-sequencing to uncover the 630 -kb PAR of an ecological model species, the collared flycatcher. The PAR contains 22 protein-coding genes and is GC rich. The genetic length is 64 cM in female meiosis, consistent with an <b>obligate</b> crossing-over <b>event.</b> Recombination is concentrated to a hotspot region, with an extreme rate of 4700 cM/Mb in a 67 -kb segment. We find no signatures of sexual antagonism and propose that sexual antagonism may have limited influence on PAR sequences when sex chromosomes are nearly fully differentiated and when a recombination hotspot region is located close to the PAR boundary. Our results demonstrate that a very small PAR suffices to ensure homologous recombination and proper segregation of sex chromosomes during meiosis.

40|$|A {{series of}} in vitro protein-RNA binding studies using {{purified}} native (C 1) 3 C 2 and (A 2) 3 B 1 tetramers, total soluble heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), and pre-mRNA molecules differing {{in length and}} sequence have revealed that a single C-protein tetramer has an RNA site size of 230 to 240 nucleotides (nt). Two tetramers bind twice this RNA length, and three tetramers fold monoparticle lengths of RNA (700 nt) into a unique 19 S triangular complex. In the absence of this unique structure, the basic A- and B-group proteins bind RNA to form several different artifactual structures which are not present in preparations of native hnRNP and which do not function in hnRNP assembly. Three (A 2) 3 B 1 tetramers bind the 19 S complex to form a 35 S assembly intermediate. Following UV irradiation to immobilize the C proteins on the packaged RNA, the 19 S triangular complex is recovered as a remnant structure from both native and reconstituted hnRNP particles. C protein-RNA complexes composed of three, six, or nine tetramers (one, two, or three triangular complexes) nucleate the stoichiometric assembly of monomer, dimer, and trimer hnRNP particles. The binding of C-protein tetramers to RNAs longer than 230 nt is through a self-cooperative combinatorial mode. RNA packaged in the 19 S complex and in 40 S hnRNP particles is efficiently spliced in vitro. These findings demonstrate that formation of the triangular C protein-RNA complex is an <b>obligate</b> first <b>event</b> in the in vitro and probably the in vivo assembly the 40 S hnRNP core particle, and they {{provide insight into the}} mechanis...|$|R
40|$|Two genetic loci, RP 2 and RP 3, for X-linked {{retinitis}} pigmentosa (XLRP) have been localized to Xp 11. 3 - 11. 23 and Xp 21. 1, respectively. RP 3 appears {{to account for}} 70 % of XLRP families; however, mutations in the RPGR gene (isolated from the RP 3 region) are identified in only 20 % of affected families. Close location of XLRP loci at Xp {{and a lack of}} unambiguous clinical criteria do not permit assignment of genetic subtype in a majority of XLRP families; nonetheless, in some pedigrees, both RP 2 and RP 3 could be excluded as the causative locus. We report the mapping of a novel locus, RP 24, by haplotype and linkage analysis of a single XLRP pedigree. The RP 24 locus was identified at Xq 26 - 27 by genotyping 52 microsatellite markers spanning the entire X chromosome. A maximum LOD score of 4. 21 was obtained with DXS 8106. Haplotype analysis assigned RP 24 within a 23 -cM region between the DXS 8094 (proximal) and DXS 8043 (distal) markers. Other chromosomal regions and known XLRP loci were excluded by <b>obligate</b> recombination <b>events</b> between markers in those regions and the disease locus. Hemizygotes from the RP 24 family have early onset of rod photoreceptor dysfunction; cone receptor function is normal at first, but there is progressive loss. Patients at advanced stages show little or no detectable rod or cone function and have clinical hallmarks of typical RP. Mapping of the RP 24 locus expands our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity in XLRP and will assist in development of better tools for diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|HUMAN stromelysin- 3, a {{new member}} of the matrix {{metalloproteinase}} family, is expressed in tissues undergoing the active remodelling associated with embryonic development, wound healing and tumour invasion(1 - 3). But like all {{other members of the}} matrix metalloproteinase gene family, stromelysin 3 is synthesized as an inactive precursor that must be processed to its mature form in order to express enzymic activity(4, 5). Here we identify stromelysin- 3 as the first matrix metalloproteinase to be discovered that can be processed directly to its enzymically active form by an <b>obligate</b> intracellular proteolytic <b>event</b> that occurs within the constitutive secretory pathway. Intracellular activation is regulated by an unusual 10 -amino-acid insert sandwiched between the pro- and catalytic-domains of stromelysin- 3, which is encrypted with an Arg-X-Arg-X-Lys-Arg recognition motif for the Golgi-associated proteinase, furin, a mammalian homologue of the yeast Kex 2 pheromone convertase(6, 7). A furin-stromelysin- 3 processing axis not only differentiates the regulation of this enzyme from all previously characterized matrix metalloproteinases, but also identifies pro-protein convertases as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in matrix-destructive disease states...|$|R
40|$|Detailed linkage and {{recombination}} rate maps {{are necessary to}} use the full potential of genome sequencing and population genomic analyses. We used a custom collared flycatcher 50 K SNP array to develop a high-density linkage map with 37 262 markers assigned to 34 linkage groups in 33 autosomes and the Z chromosome. The best-order map contained 4215 markers, with a total distance of 3132 cM and a mean genetic distance between markers of 0. 12 cM. Facilitated by the array being designed to include markers from most scaffolds, we obtained a second-generation assembly of the flycatcher genome that approaches full chromosome sequences (N 50 super-scaffold size 20. 2 Mb and with 1. 042 Gb (of 1. 116 Gb) anchored to and mostly ordered and oriented along chromosomes). We found that flycatcher and zebra finch chromosomes are entirely syntenic but that inversions at mean rates of 1. 5 – 2. 0 event (6. 6 – 7. 5 Mb) per My have changed the organization within chromosomes, rates high enough for inversions to potentially {{have been involved with}} many speciation events during avian evolution. The mean {{recombination rate}} was 3. 1 cM/Mb and correlated closely with chromosome size, from 2 cM/Mb for chromosomes > 100 Mb to > 10 cM/Mb for chromosomes < 10 Mb. This size dependence seemed entirely due to an <b>obligate</b> recombination <b>event</b> per chromosome; if 50 cM was subtracted from the genetic lengths of chromosomes, the rate per physical unit DNA was constant across chromosomes. Flycatcher recombination rate showed similar variation along chromosomes as chicken but lacked the large interior recombination deserts characteristic of zebra finch chromosomes. © Wiley.

40|$|We {{present an}} approach, called the "Shadow Method," for the {{identification}} of disease loci from dense genetic marker maps in complex, potentially incomplete pedigrees. "Shadow" is a simple method based on {{an analysis of the}} patterns of <b>obligate</b> meiotic recombination <b>events</b> in genotypic data. This method can be applied to any high density marker map and was specifically designed to exploit the fact that extremely dense marker maps are becoming more readily available. We also describe how to interpret and associate meaningful P-Values to the results. Shadow has significant advantages over traditional parametric linkage analysis methods in that it can be readily applied even in cases in which the topology of a pedigree or pedigrees can only be partially determined. In addition, Shadow is robust to variability in a range of parameters and in particular does not require prior knowledge of mode of inheritance, penetrance or clinical misdiagnosis rate. Shadow can be used for any SNP data, but is especially effective when applied to dense samplings. Our primary example uses data from Affymetrix 100 k SNPChip samples in which we illustrate our approach by analyzing simulated data as well as genome-wide SNP data from two pedigrees with inherited forms of kidney failure, one of which is compared with a typical LOD score analysis.
