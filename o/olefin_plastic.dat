40|$|Conventional wood plastic {{composites}} (WPCs) {{in general}} combine wood residuals with thermoplastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The basic idea {{in this work}} is to replace these <b>olefin</b> <b>plastic</b> matrixes in WPCs with a so-called biobased plastic, namely poly(lactic acid) (PLA). To reduce the water sensitivity of such biocomposites, for typical outdoor use, the idea is also to incorporate a modified wood component. The aim of this work was to study the microstructure of injection moulded WPCs based on PLA and modified wood, and to investigate some of their micromechanical behaviour. Four different PLA/wood formulations (weight-% ratio 50 / 50) were studied: PLA combined with 1) unmodified MDF fibres, 2) acetylated MDF fibers: 3) acetylated wood particles: and 4) thermally modified wood particles. The processing effects on the form {{and shape of the}} wood component were studied by a matrix extraction procedure combined with light microscopy. The microstructure of the WPCs were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a sample preparation technique based on UV laser ablation, i. e. a surface preparation procedure allowing microscopic observations without microtoming. Microtensile testing was performed on samples prepared from the core and skin layers of the WPC samples. It was observed that the processing of the WPCs resulted in severe damage and fragmentation of the wood fibres and particles. Especially, the processing with a thermally modified wood component yielded a lot of wood cell wall fragments/fines. Good dispersion of the wood reinforcements in the PLA matrix was observed in all cases, even though the distribution and orientation of the fibres varied between different regions in the samples. No principal fibre orientation was outlined in the core, while closer to the surface regions the fibres tend to orient in the flow direction. Supposedly a turbulence effect {{at the end of the}} moulded samples also induced disorientation of the fibres. Long and slender shape, i. e. a higher aspect ratio, of the wood components were as expected found to be more efficient as a reinforcement than particulate shaped ones. The composites with acetylated MDF fibers were also observed to be weaker than composites with unmodified ones. On the other hand, SEM observations of fracture surfaces exhibited better reinforcement-matrix interaction for the modified wood than for the unmodified wood. Although the fracture surfaces observations outlined the importance of fibre orientation, with a more brittle type of failure in the core and fibre breakage or debonding closer to the surface, there was no significant difference found between mechanical properties for the core and skin layer specimens. Other factors have therefore to be investigated in order to explain the rather uniform strength measurements within different regions in the composites. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
50|$|Ambre Energy is {{planning}} to build and operate a clean coal gasification plant at Felton Valley, 30 km south west of Toowoomba, Queensland. The plan includes construction of an open-pit coal mine, and carbon capture facility. At the final stage, the plant is expected to produce enough gas for production of 2.8 million tonnes per year of dimethyl ether and generate 650 MW of electricity. It {{is also expected to}} produce by-products for fertilizer production, and <b>olefins</b> and <b>plastics</b> manufacturing.|$|R
40|$|A novel metal-based {{chelating}} {{method has}} been used to provide an order of magnitude increase in immunoassay performance on cyclic <b>olefin</b> copolymer (COC) <b>plastics</b> compared with passive binding. COCs are hydrophobic, and without surface modification they are often unsuitable for applications where protein adhesion is desired. When interacting with the bare plastic, the majority of the bound proteins will be denatured and become nonfunctional. Many of the surface modification techniques reported to date require costly equipment setup or the use of harsh reaction conditions. Here, we have successfully demonstrated the use of a simple and quick metal chelation method to increase the sensitivity, activity, and efficiency of protein binding to COC surfaces. A detailed analysis of the COC surfaces after activation with the metal complexes is presented, and the immunoassay performance was studied using three different antibody pairs...|$|R
50|$|Formed in 1939 by {{the merger}} of Nihon Electrical Industries and Showa Fertilizers, Showa Denko K.K. (SDK) {{manufactures}} chemical products and industrial materials. SDK's products serve {{a wide array of}} fields ranging from heavy industry to the electronic and computer industries. The company is divided in five business sectors: petrochemicals (<b>olefins,</b> organic chemicals, <b>plastic</b> products), aluminum (aluminum cans, sheets, ingots, foils), electronics (semiconductors, ceramic materials, hard disks), chemicals (industrial gases, ammonia, agrochemicals), and inorganic materials (ceramics, graphite electrodes). Showa Denko has more than 180 subsidiaries and affiliates including Showa Denko America in New York, NY, USA. The company has vast overseas operations and a joint venture with Netherlands-based Montell and Nippon Petrochemicals to make and market polypropylenes. In March 2001, SDK merged with Showa Denko Aluminum Corporation to strengthen the high-value-added fabricated aluminum products operations, and is today developing next-generation optical communications-use wafers.|$|R
5000|$|Flexible Thermo Polyolefin- correct {{acronym for}} the product TPO"Flexible"-retains {{flexibility}} [...] "Thermo"-can be reheated again and again, does not cure". [...] "Polyolefin"-a polymer produced from a simple olefin. Flexible Thermo Poly-Olefin is the exact physical and chemical name given to the product [...] "TPO" [...] Thermo <b>Plastic</b> <b>Olefin.</b> Although TPO exhibits the positive characteristics of other Thermo Plastics, it does not however have any [...] "plasticizers" [...] added to the product like other Thermoplastics. This mis-categorization made sense when the product {{was introduced in the}} early 1990s and was unproven in the industry. TPO was categorized with Thermoplastic membranes that were similar in look and performance but were far from their real chemical and physical characteristics of the TPO membrane. TPO was formulated to fix all the problems associated with other Thermoplastic membranes. Having no plasticizers and chemically being closer to rubber but having better seam, puncture, and tear strength, TPO was touted to be white weldable rubber of the future. From 2007-2012 reported sales of TPO roofing products by all six major U.S. manufacturer's report materials and accessories sales quadrupling all other flat roofing materials. Gross sales of TPO membrane roofing in U.S. exceeds all other flat roof types combined. TPO's rapid market acceptance over the last twenty years by contractors, architects, engineers, and the market in general shows it is living up to its original purpose and it's here to stay.|$|R
