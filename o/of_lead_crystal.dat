25|$|The {{brilliance}} <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>crystal</b> {{relies on}} the high refractive index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures {{the degree to which}} a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be achromatic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Because of {{the broad}} {{interest}} in high energy and nuclear physics community, mass production capacities <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> tungstate <b>crystals</b> have been established. The optical and scintillation properties <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> tungstate <b>crystals,</b> 20 each from two major vendors, were evaluated. The transmittance, emission and excitation spectra, light output and light response uniformity of these samples were measured. The degradations of these properties under irradiation, and the emission weighted radiation induced absorption coefficient () were also studied. It was found that currently mass-produced <b>lead</b> tungstate <b>crystals</b> are radiation hard enough for radiation environments where expected dose rates do not exceed a few hundred rad/h.

50|$|From 1897 onwards, {{the company}} was {{dominated}} by the Durand family, who eventually purchased the firm entirely in 1926.To this day, the family {{continues to be the}} sole proprietors. The firm adopted a number of practices that positioned it to become one of Europe's leading mass production glassmakers. Examples include the usage of tank furnaces (1933), the construction of modern glass presses (1947), the use of automatic blowing machines (1950), the usage of industrial tempering (1963) and the automation <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>crystal</b> production (1968).|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, ornate cast ormolu forms with long, curved arms and many candles {{were in the}} homes of many in the growing {{merchant}} class. Neoclassical motifs became an increasingly common element, mostly in cast metals but also in carved and gilded wood. Chandeliers made in this style also drew heavily on the aesthetic of ancient Greece and Rome, incorporating clean lines, classical proportions and mythological creatures. Developments in glassmaking later allowed cheaper production <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>crystal,</b> the light scattering properties of which quickly made it a popular addition to the form, leading to the crystal chandelier.|$|E

Since then the Glass Sellers Company has continued, in various ways to support the art of glassmaking, consolidating this in the main, in two awards for Glass Art. The Glass Sellers Prize used to be an annual award but since 2008 has been linked to the British Glass Biennale and is awarded biennially.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was educated}} in Paris and Vienna, {{where he met}} František Křižík, and became {{interested}} in electricity at the 1883 International Electricity Exhibition in Vienna.

50|$|It is {{not known}} why Ravenscroft decided to sever his ties with the London Glass Sellers’ Company and leave the glass-making {{business}} in 1679 (his strong Roman Catholic beliefs might have made him unpopular), but his style <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>crystal</b> glass became fashionable in England and within 20 years of his patent some 100 glass makers in England were producing lead crystal glass. Ravenscroft did not “invent” lead crystal glass, as others had already discovered the advantages of adding lead oxide to glass, but he did improve the process. More than a dozen of Ravenscroft’s pieces are known to exist (see table below), and the “robust simplicity” of his designs is still admired.|$|E
50|$|Ravenscroft {{moved to}} London by 1666 and {{continued}} {{working in the}} import/export business, trading goods such as currants, glass, and lace. There are differing accounts of Ravenscroft’s role in the invention and subsequent development <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>crystal</b> glass. This much is generally accepted to be true: During the years Ravenscroft lived in Venice (sometime between 1651 and 1666) {{he was involved in}} the glass trade, not as a craftsman but as a merchant, so he knew and associated with glassmakers in Italy. By the time Ravenscroft moved back to England several glassmakers there had already started manufacturing glassware that attempted to mimic Italian cristallo, and Ravenscroft decided to start his own glass-making business while still running his import/export business.|$|E

50|$|There is {{some debate}} over how, when, and why Ravenscroft was {{inspired}} to use lead {{in the production of}} glass. Some believe that he accidentally discovered that adding lead oxides to the glass mixture lent the final product special qualities, while others believe that he learned the technique in Venice. The use of lead in glass was known in Italy as proved by 12% lead being discovered in the white cameo layer of The Portland Vase, a famous Roman artefact in the British Museum Whatever the origin of the idea, Ravenscroft believed that he had a unique product to offer the English market, so he applied to King Charles II for a patent in 1674 to establish his right to be sole manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>crystal</b> glass in England. He produced lead crystal glass for a period of only five years, dissolving his manufacturing business in 1679. His patent expired in 1681.|$|E
50|$|Blown glass {{has been}} an {{important}} industry in the state since the early 20th century, especially in Tonalá and Tlaquepaque. Initially, it was developed to make bottles for the tequila industry. Since then, it has developed into the making of various utilitarian and decorative objects, using a variety of techniques. Traditional colors for glass pieces include cobalt blue, amethyst and green. Blown glass remains true to traditional forms as well as division of labor, with workshops having apprentices and workers under a master craftsman. However more modern setups have come into play since the mid 20th century, when Jose Camarasa began to manufacture glass prisms for light fixtures and lamps in Tlaquepaque. He also makes ornamental and utilitarian pieces <b>of</b> <b>lead</b> <b>crystal,</b> with the red pieces particularly prized. Metals include iron, gold, tin, copper, and silver to make fine and everyday objects. Tin is worked from sheets to make decorative objects such as mirror frames and Christmas decorations. Wrought iron is principally worked in Guadalajara, and in Sayuda where they make knives, blades and machetes and is home to the Knife Museum. Silver is worked into jewelry (earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc.) in Guadalajara, which is one of Mexico’s main centers for this work. Pewter is worked into bowls, plates, frames and more.|$|E
