What are the rules that apply to workers from the new member states compared to those that apply to workers from the old member states? How are these rules administered? And what are the social rights of workers from the new member states, e. g., in the form of access to social benefits? These are some of the questions addressed in this report.

40|$|Sweden did {{not apply}} any <b>transitional</b> <b>rules</b> for {{migrants}} coming from the ten new European Union member states in May 2004. The migration to Sweden from these countries also increased, especially from Poland and the Baltic states, even if not {{to the same extent}} as the immigration to Ireland and the UK (two countries with transitory rules of minor importance). The composition of the migrants changed. While earlier many more women than men arrived, now the gender composition is much more even. In this paper the labour market situation is studied for people living in Sweden at the end of 2005 who were either born in one of new member states or born in Sweden. The immigrants are represented in all sectors of the economy but overrepresented in some sectors. Their wages controlling for education are somewhat lower than those for natives. The labour market situation is rather good for the new immigrants and they are not overrepresented in different income transfer programs. The knowledge of these conditions may explain that Sweden abstained from introducing <b>transitional</b> <b>rules</b> also when Bulgaria and Romania became members of the European Union in January 2007...|$|R

40|$|Ecological {{assessment}} of wetland environments requires {{the use of}} computational tools that would allow the integration of ecological features and water flow. Such is the case of eco-hydraulic models which can be used to generate valuable information and study different scenarios in wetland systems. In the case of the Macquarie Marshes, semi-arid Australia, vegetation species are highly dependent of inundation times, frequency of inundation, water depths and timing. Regulations of the past few decades have modified the hydraulic regimes of the site and which led to a detriment of the plant communities. The development of an eco-hydraulic model that integrates the dynamic of the vegetation and water regimes {{requires the use of}} <b>transitional</b> <b>rules</b> that link flow regime characteristics to plant status. This research intends for a description of the change in the status of plant communities of the Macquarie Marshes and to link these changes with time aggregated characteristics of the flow regime. We make use of a quasi- 2 D hydrodynamic model in order to determine flood patterns within the site. This model has previously been implemented for the Macquarie Marshes revealing a good performance level. Quarterly vegetation maps for different years will be analyzed against the description of the hydraulic regime. Obtaining these relations will aid the current development of an eco-hydraulic model for the site by providing relations that can be used as <b>transitional</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} reasons why CEO may have lowered recidivism when <b>other</b> <b>transitional</b> jobs programs did not. One potential explanation {{relates to the}} structure of CEO’s transitional jobs component, in which participants are placed in small crews that are closely supervised by a CEO staff person. The <b>other</b> <b>transitional</b> jobs programs that were tested did not use this model. It may be that something about the inter-personal dynamic within the crew, or in the relationship between the supervisor and the participants, led to the kind of attitudinal changes that criminologists believe are necessary to lower recidivism. The study did not explicitly test for these effects, but a survey showed that program group members {{were more likely to report}} that there was a person in their lives that they could turn to for advice and support.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the current}} Slovenian {{political and economic}} situation through interpretations of old socialist regime’s modernisation.

Between 1990 / 1991 and 2008 Slovenia seemed to be a politically more or less stable and economically well performing country. But after 2008 a negative trend hit the whole society, causing political instabilities and economic stagnation, reflected in negative macroeconomic indicators (i. e. GDP, GDP p. c.
