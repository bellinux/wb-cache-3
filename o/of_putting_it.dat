5|$|Shortly before {{approaching}} {{the town of}} the first Gym Leader, the protagonist first encounters Team Magma/Aqua in the Petalburg Woods, {{where he or she}} rescues a worker from Devon (a company that manufactures Pokéballs) and recovers Devon merchandise. Upon arriving in Fallarbor Town (after defeating the third Gym Leader), the protagonist discovers that Professor Cozmo, an astronomer, has been kidnapped by Magma/Aqua. The protagonist traces them to a cave, Meteor Falls, but is too late to stop them from escaping to Mt. Chimney with a meteorite. The protagonist follows Magma/Aqua to Mt. Chimney where they are preparing to use the meteorite to alter the climate of the region. The protagonist defeats the Team's leader, however, and returns the meteorite to Professor Cozmo. Shortly after the protagonist defeats the fifth Gym Leader (the protagonist's father, the first time such a character appears), Magma/Aqua again attempts to change the region's climate by stealing a Castform, a Pokémon with the ability to change the weather, from the Weather Institute. After the protagonist defeats the sixth Gym Leader, Magma/Aqua steals an orb with the ability to control a legendary Pokémon (Groudon in Ruby, Kyogre in Sapphire). Magma/Aqua then steals a submarine from Captain Stern in Slateport City; the protagonist, however, infiltrates the team's hideout, but fails to prevent the submarine from being used. Magma/Aqua, then travel with the orb to the Seafloor Cavern, where Groudon or Kyogre resides; the team then uses the orb to awaken the legendary Pokémon, but they have chosen the wrong one and have instead enraged the Pokémon instead <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> under their thrall. Once awakened, the Pokémon travels to the Cave of Origin and causes a region-wide drought (Ruby) or severe rainstorms (Sapphire). When the protagonist defeats (or captures) the Pokémon, the region's weather returns to normal.|$|E

25|$|Immediately after Dušan's death (20 December 1355), {{his wife}} Empress Helena {{was found in}} Serres. She started to exert her {{imperial}} control on the region.

How the Empress ended up in Serres and started to rule it is unknown, it exists sources saying {{she was in the}} region staying away from the harsh winter in the north, just when her husband died. As she was energetic and smart (although not so talented), she might have foreseen the crumbling of the Empire, and sought to rule this region. If this version is correct, Vojihna and his son-in-law Uglješa Mrnjavčević (the son of Vukašin Mrnjavčević) were obliged to work for her as they had done to Dušan, although as the future will tell; with less enthusiasm and fidelity.
