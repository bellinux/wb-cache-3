5|$|Once at Bougainville, Mikawa {{spread his}} ships <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> wide area {{to mask the}} {{composition}} of his force and launched four floatplanes from his cruisers to scout for Allied ships in the southern Solomons.|$|E
5|$|Not {{unlike the}} circuit riders in the Episcopal and Methodist traditions, the presbyteries often sent out licentiates to {{minister}} in multiple congregations that were spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> wide area. To meet {{the need for}} educated clergy, Princeton Theological Seminary and Union Presbyterian Seminary were founded in 1812, followed by Auburn Theological Seminary in 1821.|$|E
5|$|The Second Battle of Bapaume {{was carried}} <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> period {{of two weeks}} and {{involved}} the divisions of IV Corps; the British 5th, 37th, 42nd, and the 63rd Divisions along with the New Zealand Division. On 29 August, elements of the New Zealand Division, after heavy fighting in the days prior, occupied Bapaume as the defending Germans withdrew. It then pushed onto the Bancourt Ridge, {{to the east of}} Bapaume.|$|E

2500|$|Test {{spraying}} of an [...] "anti-scattering agent" [...] on {{the ground}} to prevent further spread of radioactive materials from the site is carried <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> area of about 1200m2.|$|R
5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is the angle at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
5|$|In July 1893 {{a peasant}} conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian {{contracts}} for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented {{them to the}} landowners. When those refused to negotiate, a strike against landowners and against state taxes broke <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> large part of western Sicily. The so-called Patti di Corleone (Corleone Covenants), are considered by historians {{to be the first}} trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893. Railwaymen of Catania and Palermo, the sulphur-miners and many other workers followed their example winning higher wages or better working conditions.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
50|$|In {{recognition}} of its historic architecture, the Griffith Breese Farm was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Four buildings, spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> area of 65 acre, qualified as contributing properties.|$|R

50|$|Elmwood Place is a {{historic}} farmstead in the southwestern corner of Union County, Ohio, United States. Located along State Route 161 near the community of Irwin, the farmstead comprises six different buildings spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> area of 9 acre.|$|R
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> {{larger number of}} individuals and therefore {{is less likely to}} wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Hype Williams and was filmed in downtown Los Angeles. Filming of the video involved a partial closure of the 2nd Street Tunnel and part of downtown Los Angeles spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> 48-hour period. Kesha explained the idea behind the video {{as well as the}} experience during an interview with MTV News; she said that the video was different from her other videos, noting {{that it was going to}} show a sexier side of herself.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} {{the launch of the}} telescope, the {{returned}} images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, the {{elevator}} (pitch control) system in Tucker's aerobatic aircraft broke during a practice aerobatic flight, {{forcing him to}} bail <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> empty farm field in Coushatta, Louisiana. He was uninjured, but the aircraft he was flying was destroyed.|$|R

50|$|Cuz-Cuz {{is home to}} one of {{the largest}} {{concentrations}} of petroglyphs from the Molle culture. They are spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> area of approximately 35 square kilometers. This site seem to form part of a large ancient astronomical observatory, with the petroglyphs being their astronomical records.|$|R
5|$|As Longstreet's left division, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, advanced, they {{unexpectedly}} found Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps {{directly in}} their path. Sickles had been {{dissatisfied with the}} position assigned him on {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile (800m) to the west— centered at the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard—he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road, moving away from Cemetery Ridge. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> longer front than their small corps could defend effectively. The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00p.m. After failing to attend a meeting at this time of Meade's corps commanders, Meade rode to Sickles' position and demanded an explanation of the situation. Knowing a Confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered, Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would have landed too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung <b>out</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land and bring in the heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. They jumped from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E
