While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica and a number of his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>and</b> allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E

5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of Vitozzi's {{declarations}} and the testimony of Giacomo Ascrittore, a regular police informer {{and member of the}} Camorra, the local police and judiciary of Naples identified Gaetano Amodeo and Tommaso De Angelis as the real killers. However, the murder investigation was transferred to the Carabinieri and delegated to Captain Carlo Fabbroni. Fabbroni accused the Naples police of inefficiency and corruption. The investigation got new momentum when Gennaro Abbatemaggio, a young camorrista and a former Carabinieri informer serving a jail sentence in Naples, testified that the decision to kill Cuocolo, suspected of being a police spy, had been taken at a meeting at the restaurant chaired by Alfano.

5|$|Bernard Siegel, an {{attorney}} from Florida, learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> {{felt that a}} hearing should be held about Eve's welfare. In January 2003, he initiated legal proceedings, seeking to bring the clone's parents to court so its health could be verified. Raël and Boisselier attacked the filing {{as an attempt to}} take a child from loving parents and announced that, in protest, they would not provide DNA for testing. An arraignment occurred on January 24 and was televised live on CNN; Boisselier and Clonaid's vice president, Thomas Kaenzig, were subpoenaed in lieu of the child's parents. In courtroom testimony, the vice president of Clonaid said he knew very little about the clone, and that Boisselier controlled all the information. She did not attend the hearing, and Kaenzig provided little information, angering the judge, who threatened contempt of court charges. Boisselier attended a second hearing on January 29, telling the court that the child was in Israel. The judge then ruled that the court had no jurisdiction. In late January, the science editor announced that he suspected the cloning announcements were a hoax. Around that time, Boisselier held a press conference at which she announced that the cloned baby's parents had cut off contact with her and would never speak to the press.|$|E
5|$|Due {{in large}} part to surplus {{revenues}} from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. The spending issue in part led to the defeat of the Republicans in the 1890 mid-term elections. Cleveland defeated Harrison for re-election in 1892, due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending. Harrison returned to private life and his law practice in Indianapolis. In 1899 Harrison represented the Republic of Venezuela in their British Guiana boundary dispute against the United Kingdom. Harrison traveled to the court of Paris as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>and</b> after a brief stay returned to Indianapolis. He died at his home in Indianapolis in 1901 of complications from influenza. Although many have praised Harrison's commitment to African Americans' voting rights, scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below-average, and rank him in the bottom half among U.S. presidents. Historians, however, have not questioned Harrison's commitment to personal and official integrity.|$|E
40|$|Background. A community-wide {{outbreak}} of cryptosporidiosis occurred in Dallas County during <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 2008. A subset of cases occurring with onset of illness within a 2 week interval was epidemiologically linked to 2 neighborhood interactive water fountain parks. ^ Methods. A {{case control study}} was conducted to evaluate risk factors associated with developing illness with cryptosporidiosis from <b>the</b> fountain parks. <b>Cases</b> were selected from a line list from the epidemiological study. The selection for the controls was either healthy family members or a daycare center nearby. <b>Cases</b> <b>and</b> controls were not matched. ^ Results. Interviews were completed for 44 fountain park attendees who met <b>case</b> definition <b>and</b> 54 community controls. Twenty-seven percent (27. 3 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>and</b> 13. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controls were between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> 0 – 4 years. Thirty-nine percent (38. 6 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>and</b> 24. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controls were between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> 5 – 13 years. Fourteen percent (13. 6 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>and</b> 33. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controls were between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> 14 – 31 years. Twenty percent (20. 5 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>and</b> 29. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controls were between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> 32 – 63 years. 47. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>and</b> 42. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controls were males. Fountain park attendees who reported having been splashed in the face with water were 10 times more likely to become ill than controls (OR = 10. 0, 95 % CI = 2. 8 – 35. 1). Persons who reported having swallowed water from the interactive fountains were 34 times more likely to become ill than controls (OR = 34. 3, 95 %CI = 9. 3 – 125. 7). ^ Conclusion. Prompt reporting of cases, identification of outbreak sources, and immediate implementation of remediation measures were critical in curtailing further transmission from these particular sites through <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. This investigation underscores the potential for cryptosporidiosis outbreaks to occur in interactive fountain parks, and the need for enhanced preventive measures in these settings. Education <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public regarding avoidance of behaviors such as drinking water from interactive fountains is also an important component of public health prevention efforts. ...|$|R
