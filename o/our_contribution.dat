500|$|Charles Eaton died in Frankston on 12November 1979. Survived by {{his wife}} and two sons, he was cremated. In {{accordance}} with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the Kookaburra, from an RAAF Caribou on 15April 1981. His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of Karama, Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to Darwin International Airport, and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is also honoured with a display at the Northern Territory Parliament, and a National Trust memorial at Tennant Creek Airport. At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, Air Commodore Mark Lax, recalling Eaton's search-and-rescue missions between the wars, commented: [...] "Today, we might think of Eaton perhaps as the pioneer of <b>our</b> <b>contribution</b> to assistance to the civil community—a tradition that continues today. Perhaps I might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned—the amazing location of missing yachtsmen Thierry Dubois, Isabelle Autissier and Tony Bullimore by our P-3s that guided the Navy to their eventual rescue. My observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected, supportive and responsive to the wants and needs of the Australian community." ...|$|E
500|$|Sex {{has also}} become an {{important}} book in the LGBT community. Ben Shapiro, author of Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future, wrote that due to its iconic status [...] "Sex adorns the coffee tables of hundreds of gay men and sperm banks". Mark Blankenship, from the LGBT-oriented website New Now Next stated that [...] "literature changed forever" [...] with the publishing of Sex. Madonna's portrayal of lesbian love scenes in the book sparked debates about her own sexual orientation. This was an adjunct to the singer's public relationship with comedian Sandra Bernhard, with whom she cavorted around, visiting lesbian night-clubs as well as partying. The LGBT community felt {{it was an important}} portrayal for them. They debated whether Madonna was [...] "ripping" [...] them off for publicity. As Carolin Grace from Diva magazine noted: [...] "Madonna became meaningful in early nineties, when Sex came out, and at that point lesbian culture was really changing." [...] She noted how women were coming out about their sexuality and the book's handling of the taboo issue were [...] "a legacy, <b>our</b> <b>contribution</b> to the show. The lesbian sub-cultural references borrowed by Madonna aren't our only possessions." [...] O'Brien argues in her book , that the book had a confusing philosophy. According to the female critics, who pointed out the vacuousness of Madonna's remarks about porn and abuse, the singer did not have a correct idea that behind these fantasies the [...] "reality is too hard for her to endure", referring to the daily hustles that women have to face at red light districts and brothels. The author felt that despite the courageous premise of genuine exploration of queer sex, the book crossed over into pornography and a wrong portrayal for the community, while being flippant and commercial. She drew an example of the death of pornographic actor Joey Stefano, one of the models of the book, from drug overdose. Stefano had been thrilled {{to be a part of}} the book, but was underpaid. Once Madonna and her team were done with the shoot, [...] "they packed up and left the Gaiety... They left behind the mundane reality and the boys who have to deal with it seven days a week." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his studies}} in the USSR, Elbegdorj learned about Glasnost, the {{concepts}} such as {{freedom of speech and}} economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience, despite attempts of repression from the Politburo-authority of the government, and threats by his employer to lose his job. At the end of a speech at the Young Artists' Second National Congress on 28 November 1989, Elbegdorj said that Mongolia needed democracy and appealed to youth to collaborate to create democracy in Mongolia. He told the audience [...] "We consider that Perestroika is a timely and brave step.

I don't know how much <b>our</b> <b>contribution</b> is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." [...] He expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions. In June 2012, Romney's domestic policy advisor Oren Cass told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "He's a supporter of renewable energy, as long as it's anything that would be economically competitive. He doesn't know the extent to which climate change is occurring or that human activity is causing it.... What you won't see are mandates or taxes or regulations that interfere with economic activity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September, Opposition and Commonwealth Liberal Party leader Joseph Cook {{addressed}} {{parliament in}} support of conscription: [...] "There are some that {{do not believe in}} the compulsion of men, who say that Australia has done enough ... I hope there are few men in the parliament who believe that ... We are proud of what the Empire has done, and <b>our</b> <b>contribution</b> must be adequate, and in every way worthy of that effort ... To [...] now would be a national sin, a national calamity. As opposition leader, Cook had opposed almost no government measures throughout 1916, and Hughes and his faction were becoming increasingly distant from the bulk of the ALP and aligning much more with the conservative opposition. When the second reading of the Military Service Referendum bill was moved, it carried 46 to 10 in the House and 19 to 9 in the Senate. In neither house did any member of the opposition vote against the bill [...] the against vote came entirely from Labor detractors. [...] Upon the second moving of the Referendum Bill, Frank Tudor resigned from Hughes' cabinet. A group of 15 representatives and 12 senators, led by Frank Brennan and Myles Ferricks, opposed the bill at every stage {{on the grounds that it}} was a question of conscience on which no majority, no matter how large, had a right to impose its will on the minority. Hughes stared down his enemies within the party and committed himself fully to the campaign: [...] "For myself, I say that I am going into this referendum campaign as if it were the only thing for which I lived." ...|$|E
