40|$|An {{automatic}} rotor <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> {{system was}} developed and successfully used during a wind tunnel test of a full-scale UH- 60 rotor system with Individual Blade Control (IBC) actuators. The <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system allowed rotor trim to be set more quickly, precisely and repeatably than in previous wind tunnel tests. This control system also allowed the rotor trim state to be maintained during transients and drift in wind tunnel flow, and through changes in IBC actuation. The ability to maintain a consistent rotor trim state was key to quickly and accurately evaluating the effect of IBC on rotor performance, vibration, noise and loads. This paper presents details of the design {{and implementation of the}} <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system including the rotor system hardware, <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> requirements, and <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> hardware and software implementation.

40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{wind tunnel}} test to evaluate the effects of Individual Blade Control (IBC) on the performance, vibration, noise and loads of a UH- 60 A rotor was recently completed in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel [1]. A key component of this {{wind tunnel test}} was an automatic rotor <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system that allowed the rotor trim state to be set more precisely, quickly and repeatably than was possible with the rotor operator setting the trim condition manually. The <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system was also able to maintain the desired trim condition through changes in IBC actuation both in open- and closed-loop IBC modes, and through long-period transients in wind tunnel flow. This ability of the <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system to automatically set and maintain a steady rotor trim enabled the effects of different IBC inputs to be compared at common trim conditions and to perform these tests quickly without requiring the rotor operator to re-trim the rotor. The <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> system described in this paper was developed specifically for use during the IBC wind tunnel tes...|$|R

5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was.

This could have been countered by the use of <b>trim</b> <b>controls,</b> but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary <b>trim</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been renewed {{interest}} in solar sails as an alternative means of space propulsion. Many different attitude control systems have been designed for Solar Sails {{taking advantage of the}} centre-of-mass(cm) /centre-of- pressure(cp) offset. Most of these proposed systems are at best theoretical and have not been demonstrated. In this paper we build upon a previous proposed scalable bus-based attitude control system for solar sails, which utilised a <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> mass actuator to change the centre of mass and highly reective panels to create a windmill torque, achieving 3 -axis control. As part of testing the proposed system, we have built and demonstrated a <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> mass actuation mechanism for solar sails, taking advantage of an air-bearing table to achieve a virtually frictionless attitude test environment. This is the first known attempt at construction and demonstration of a solar sail attitude control system based on the change in the cm with respect to the cp. In this paper we seek to investigate the control algorithms involved and the obstacles concerned in building a <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> mass actuator for a solar sail.

40|$|RCR Energy Systems builds {{industrial}} heating plants and their control systems. In these the excess air (above the stoichiometric ratio) for combustion {{is a process}} variable and its setpoint is determined using a look-up table. RCR aims to improve the efficiency of wood-fired, thermal-oil heating plants by {{using a combination of}} carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> to automatically adjust the excess air setpoint. Heating plants require the correct amount of oxygen for combustion. Too little excess air does not allow complete combustion, producing a loss in efficiency and wasted fuel. Too much excess air reduces the flame temperature with a consequent drop in heat transfer rate and loss of efficiency. The aim of the project was to explore the advantages of carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen <b>trim</b> <b>control,</b> as well as its application, design and implementation in trimming excess oxygen setpoint, to a lower, but still safe operating level. Various carbon monoxide monitoring and oxygen <b>trim</b> <b>control</b> schemes were researched with the most suitable being implemented on an industrial system using a combined carbon monoxide and oxygen measurement analysers.

40|$|Small {{packaged}} boilers {{are used}} to generate steam or hot water for industrial, commercial and institutional power plants. Due to their small size and relatively small fuel capacity, they have not received the energy saving attention that larger industrial boilers have. That situation is changing as energy deregulation brings gas prices into parity with oil. This paper describes a recent development brought on by these rising fuel costs and the technological break through of low cost microprocessor controls and inexpensive oxygen sensors to measure excess oxygen in the boiler flue gas. The new developments make possible low cost, continuous, automatic optimization of boiler performance by direct control of air/fuel ratio using flue gas analysis <b>trim</b> <b>control.</b> New mechanical interfaces capable of modifying {{the relationship between the}} air and fuel linkage on existing boilers without expensive jackshaft modification or installation difficulties has significantly reduce the installed cost.
