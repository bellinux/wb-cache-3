5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he was glad to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|A National Army relief column {{including}} the detachments under Husher, Fleetwood and Devine assembled at Lurkers' Ridge {{during the morning}} of 12 February. Under the command of Captain Tony Clark, it flanked through the townships south of the Alamo, engaging ZIPRA guerrillas along the way, then turned north to relieve Dyck. The Elands led the way, with Devine himself standing upright in the turret {{of one of them}} with a machine gun. At one point this was shot <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> prompting him to briefly stop the advance so he could jump down into the street to collect it. By the time the relief column reached the Alamo at 13:00, C Company had been pocketed for 16 hours. Four wounded 1RAR soldiers were evacuated, and Dyck left the building to point out targets for Devine's armoured cars. During the afternoon, A Company relieved D Company at Lurker's Ridge, and the ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas withdrew into the townships and the surrounding country, sporadically exchanging fire. Devine was sent to Essexvale to engage the rest of ZIPRA's armoured battle group, which surrendered when he arrived; the T-34 tanks were later found by the Zimbabwe National Army to be nonfunctional. By the evening of 12 February, the rebellion was over.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{returned}} to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered {{to be one of}} the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With the Bulls trailing 86–83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and hit a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting the Utah lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward Karl Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and took the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> for a steal. Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan gave Chicago an 87–86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his Bulls career. Afterwards, John Stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship and second three-peat. Once again, Jordan was voted the Finals MVP, having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding Game 6. Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tim Duncan are tied for second place with three apiece. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history. Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.|$|E

25|$|The Titans {{took the}} ensuing kickoff {{and drove to}} the Patriots 33-yard line. But two penalties, a 10-yard {{intentional}} grounding call and a holding penalty, pushed them back 20 yards. McNair threw an 11-yard completion on the next play, but after that, Drew Bennett had the ball knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on fourth down and 12, and the Titans turned the ball over on downs with 1:38 left.|$|E

25|$|When the American Civil War {{erupted in}} 1861, Hoff {{volunteered for the}} U.S. Army and was {{assigned}} as Surgeon, with the rank of Major, to the 3rd New York Infantry Regiment.

25|$|After {{doing his}} normal pre-jump show {{and a few}} warm up approaches, Knievel began his real approach. When he hit the takeoff ramp, he felt the {{motorcycle}} unexpectedly decelerate. The sudden loss of power on the takeoff caused Knievel to come up short and land on the safety ramp which {{was supported by a}} van. This caused the handlebars to be ripped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> as he tumbled over them onto the pavement where he skidded into the Dunes parking lot.|$|E
25|$|Although the Vikings {{held the}} wind {{advantage}} {{again during the}} final quarter, the Giants defense managed to shut them down to preserve the victory. The Vikings had a great chance {{to tie the game}} when Carter caught a deep pass from backup quarterback Sean Salisbury and appeared to be {{on his way to a}} sure touchdown, but safety Myron Guyton caught up with him from behind and knocked the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> Jackson recovered it for the Giants on the Vikings 15-yard line to put the game away.|$|E

He was fielding in the covers when Ashley Mallett hit a lofted drive towards his area. He made an amazing effort to take the catch but it bounced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> when he hit the ground awkwardly. When he went to get up, he felt a stabbing pain in his back and {{he was unable to}} move. He spent the next few weeks in an Adelaide hospital flat on his back.|$|E

25|$|Arthur {{proceeds}} {{to get the}} play verified and published, with Random House shouldering {{the burden of the}} authentication process. When his editor offers to take the play <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> Arthur insists that it's his family's project, and {{he wants to be a}} part of it, and is tasked with writing the play's Introduction. He begins to believe that, without question, The Tragedy of Arthur was written by William Shakespeare, and as he works on the publication of the text, Arthur remains preoccupied with Petra, and ultimately starts sleeping with her despite her relationship with Dana. After his father's death, however, Arthur discovers an index card with details of the play on it, and becomes convinced that it's evidence that the play is a forgery. Furthermore, his father's will dictates that the profit from the publication of the quarto be devised between Arthur, Dana, their mother, and his former business associate, Charles Glassow. The will also requires that the play be published as the work of William Shakespeare, and that any effort made by Arthur to dispute the play's authenticity will result in his share of the profits being retained.|$|E
25|$|Florida {{entered the}} 2012 matchup with their arch-rivals holding a 7–0 {{record and a}} No. 2 ranking while Georgia came in 6–1 and ranked No. 12, making the contest a key game {{in the race for}} the SEC East title. Both teams {{featured}} had strong defenses and ball control offenses, so the contest was unsurprisingly low scoring. Florida was down 17–9 late in the 4th quarter when they mounted a potential game-tying drive deep into Georgia territory. Gator quarterback Jeff Driskel completed a pass over the middle to tight end Jordan Reed, who appeared to be heading to the endzone before Bulldog outside line-backer Jarvis Jones punched the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and Georgia recovered in the back of the endzone for a touchback. The lost fumble was Florida's sixth turnover of the game and allowed Georgia to hold on for the win. The teams finished the regular season tied for first in the SEC East with identical 7–1 records in conference play, but by virtue of their head-to-head victory over the Gators the Bulldogs advanced to the SEC Championship game, losing to eventual BCS national champion Alabama.|$|E
25|$|Utah {{began its}} next {{possession}} with two quick completions of 11 yards {{to move the}} drive to the Midshipmen 49-yard line. Johnson continued to move the ball, picking up yardage {{through the air and}} on the ground. As Utah reached Navy territory, however, the Midshipmen's defense stiffened. Inside the 10-yard line, Utah had three tries to cross the goal line and earn a touchdown. On the third play inside the ten, Utah wide receiver Jereme Brooks caught a pass from Brian Johnson. As he extended the ball toward the goal line, he was hit by Navy cornerback Ketric Buffin. Brooks lost control of the ball, which came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> hitting the pylon {{at the corner of the}} end zone. According to NCAA rules, the pylon was both out of bounds and in the end zone. Therefore, the fumble should have been considered a touchback, with Navy awarded possession at its own 20-yard line. Instead, officials ruled that Brooks had been out of bounds before fumbling and Utah maintained possession. After the game, officials acknowledged the mistake. Utah had one more chance to score, but turned the ball over on downs after failing to cross the goal line on a run from inside the 1-yard line.|$|E

25|$|Dallas scored {{first on}} a 14-play, 88-yard drive in which Troy Aikman {{completed}} four passes to Michael Irvin for 65 yards {{and finished the}} drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Perhaps the key point of the game occurred on the next series when Minnesota running back Amp Lee caught a short pass from quarterback Brad Johnson {{and appeared to be}} on his way for a 43-yard touchdown. But Cowboys safety George Teague caught up with Lee at the 1-yard line and poked the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. Dallas then drove 70 yards, including a 22-yard carry by Herschel Walker, to go up 10-0 on Chris Boniol's 28-yard field goal. Five plays after the ensuing kickoff, Teague stripped the ball from Vikings running back Leroy Hoard. Defensive back Deion Sanders recovered the fumble and lateraled it to Shante Carver, who was tackled on the Minnesota 37, and Emmitt Smith took off for a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then during Minnesota's next possession, Teague intercepted a pass from Johnson and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 24-0 lead with 8:36 left in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|Some 200 {{yards in}} advance of our position, which we were holding at a terrible cost, was a fence built high and strong. The troops in advance had tried to scale the fence and reform under that hell of fire. They were {{actually}} torn in shreds and wedged into the fence. The cry came to us for volunteers to pull down the fence. Instantly there sprang from the long line, fast being shortened as the ranks closed up over the dead, seventy-six volunteers. We ran straight for the fence amid a hail of iron and lead, the dead falling all about us, but to reach the fence was our only thought. A part of the force reached it, and, as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> by rifle-shots. The fence leveled, we made the attempt to return, {{and it was as}} hot for us on the retreat, as it had been on the advance. Few escaped death or wounds. I had almost regained my regiment, when I was hit. The line then successfully pressed on, and the 'Sunken Road,' or ' Bloody Lane,' as it is now known, was within our lines.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid a big kickoff return, Matt Prater kicked the second half kickoff short, hitting {{the ground at the}} Seattle 12-yard line. But it did not stop Harvin from picking the ball out of the air and taking off for an 87-yard {{touchdown}} return that increased Seattle's lead to 29–0. The touchdown took place 12 seconds into the second half, exactly {{the same amount of time}} that the Seahawks took to score the safety in the first half. It was also the first time that consecutive Super Bowls had kickoff returns for touchdowns (Jacoby Jones' return in Super Bowl XLVII being the previous one, which was also the second half opening kickoff). After an exchange of punts, Eric Decker gave Denver good field position with a 9-yard return to the Denver 45. Two plays later, Manning completed a 23-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas, but cornerback Byron Maxwell knocked the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and Malcolm Smith recovered it, returning the ball seven yards. An unnecessary roughness penalty against Denver added 15 more yards onto the end of the play, giving Seattle the ball at the Denver 42-yard line. Two plays later, Russell Wilson hit tight end Luke Willson for a 12-yard completion on third-and-7 and later completed a 19-yard pass to Ricardo Lockette. On the next play, he threw a short pass to Jermaine Kearse, who broke four tackles as he took off for a 23-yard touchdown reception bringing the score to 36–0.|$|E
