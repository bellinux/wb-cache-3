5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy is}} heavily reliant upon {{remittances}} from overseas Filipinos, which surpass {{foreign direct investment}} {{as a source of}} foreign currency. Remittances peaked in 2010 at 10.4% of the national GDP, and were 8.6% in 2012 and in 2014, Philippines total worth <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> remittances was US$28 billion. Regional development is uneven, with Luzon – Metro Manila in particular – gaining most of the new economic growth {{at the expense of the}} other regions, although the government has taken steps to distribute economic growth by promoting investment in other areas of the country. Despite constraints, service industries such as tourism and business process outsourcing have been identified as areas with some of the best opportunities for growth for the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to diversify the economy and make it less {{dependent}} on export goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange,</b> although it is threatened by {{the negative effects of}} the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own. Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed {{as one of the best}} places to retire to in the world, with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index. This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. In 2016, Malaysia ranked the fifth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire. Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to verify, based on the {{portfolio}} balance exchange rate determination theory, the impact <b>of</b> the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> swaps offered by the Central Bank of Brazil on the attributes <b>of</b> the local <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interest rate term structure. For this, it is used the Principal Component Regression. As a complementary analysis the volatility <b>of</b> the local <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interest rate term structure and the volatility <b>of</b> the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> spot were studied. The results concerning the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> swaps were in accordance with those expected by the theory, and show that they do change the local <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interest rate term structure. On the other hand, the swaps known as reversal <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> swaps showed results that point out that the offer of this product by the Central Bank had no impact on the level <b>of</b> the local <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interest rate market.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{influence}} <b>of</b> the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rates {{variation on the}} returns and volatility of the stock prices from the Romanian capital market {{for the period of}} time January 2000 - December 2012. This period was split in four sub-samples corresponding to different stages of the Romanian financial markets evolution. The GARCH models employed in this investigation provided different results. For the transition period January 2000 - December 2007 we found no evidence <b>of</b> the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market on the Bucharest Stock Exchange. During a period of time between the Romania’s adhesion to European Union and the announcement of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy the results indicate a significant impact <b>of</b> the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rates on the stock returns. For the period from September 2008 to February 2010 we find that <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rates influenced not only the stock returns but also their volatility. However, between March 2010 and December 2012 the impact <b>of</b> the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> market on the Romanian capital market was limited to the returns. We conclude that influence <b>of</b> the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rates variation on the returns and volatility of the stock prices depended on the factors such as the foreign capitals inflows, the global crisis effects and the perceptions of the national economy. ...|$|R
