25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
500|$|The band {{met while}} {{studying}} Music Technology at Staffordshire University, but living in Birmingham and playing at venues {{such as the}} jug of ale and the flapper & firkin they got their record deal. Tom Smith Interview in 2015 [...] "Birmingham is very important" [...] he explains. [...] "Looking back further it was where we all lived together in the early years, played all those flapper and jug of ale shows, and then got our record deal". [...] "We've always said although only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> brought up there, Birmingham was the band's home".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, {{and the band}} stayed at the Sunset Marquis Hotel during the sessions. [...] Nimrod took four months to record; Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy recording time to spending [...] "a little too much time" [...] playing pool and foosball during the sessions. [...] The recording schedule, which lasted from noon to {{two in the morning}} every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily. [...] Bassist Mike Dirnt recalled, [...] "One night <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> walking down the halls knocking on people's doors while naked." [...] Another incident involved drummer Tre Cool throwing his hotel room television set out of his window. [...] Armstrong noted, [...] "There was a lot of glass. [...] You have to live that arrogant lifestyle every now and then." [...] To keep the band focused, Cavallo enlisted his father and manager Pat Magnarella to supervise the group.|$|E
60|$|Hip. Come, come, we dally; Would <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> dead, {{no matter}} which! [They fight nearer.|$|R
5000|$|... 2. Each {{and every}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> {{creating}} the future, every day, whether {{we do so}} consciously or not.|$|R
60|$|We have {{arranged}} that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> {{to stay within}} call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.|$|R
500|$|Saunders {{was among}} {{a party of}} men {{evacuated}} from Crete by a British submarine in May 1942, and returned to Australia in October. He rejoined his old unit, the 2/7th Battalion, which had re-formed in Palestine and been brought back to Australia {{along with the rest}} of the 6th Division to help defend against the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. In November 1942, Saunders' younger brother Harry, who had enlisted shortly after him in 1940, was killed in action while serving in New Guinea with the 2/14th Battalion. When Harry had joined up, Reg recalled, [...] "I was angry because I was the only one that was supposed to go.... with two of us there, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> going to get killed..." [...] The elder Saunders subsequently served in New Guinea as well, fighting in the Salamauaâ€“Lae campaign in mid-1943 where, having again been promoted temporary sergeant, he took over command of a platoon when its commander was wounded in action. For his leadership, he was recommended for a commission by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn. When Guinn told him of his plan, Saunders laughed and said, [...] "I don't want to be an officer... I'd rather be Regimental Sergeant Major". Guinn responded, [...] "Christ, they don't make boys RSMs".|$|E
2500|$|According to Swift, {{she wrote}} the song [...] "about an awkward {{situation}} where, well... Let me just preface by saying that I have happened to run into exes in strange places lately. This is about one of those situations where the strange place that I ran into him was an awards show. I was seated a couple of seats {{away from him and}} there was so much that needed to be said, and neither <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> willing to say it. We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't even know. It was just miserable. I was telling my Mom about it later, and I said I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. And then I was like, [...] "Gotta go. Bye!" [...] And my Mom is used to that at this point so, that's what this song is about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Och, the thundering villains!' he exclaimed; 'the hathen thieves! And {{to think}} that not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> there {{to give them a}} bating.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't grumble," [...] said Ingleby, who {{had almost}} {{expected}} this. [...] "Still I {{should like to}} point out that only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> responsible." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}}. Arafat is {{the most}} responsible for the failure. President Arafat failed and the Palestinian government failed, the Palestinian political factions failed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the good? <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> enough. I {{might as}} well stay here and nose round a bit longer. Something MIGHT turn up. One never knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should he}} think {{differently}} if <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> captured while tryin' {{to communicate with}} the besieged, sir?" [...] Sergeant Corney asked, curiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Och, the thundering villains!" [...] he exclaimed; [...] "the heathen thieves! And {{to think}} that not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> there {{to give them a}} bating." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Simon Bunce did mutter such things, {{and that}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> as great an {{innocent}} as the other,' said Hal, 'but I trust my hermit's love.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Distributed {{knowledge}} {{is related to}} the concept Wisdom of the crowd. Distributed knowledge reflects the fact that [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> smarter than all of us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> unique. There is {{a divine}} purpose behind {{the life of}} {{everyone}} who comes into the world. We have something to learn from everyone.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> {{to fall in}} defence of his country, we have {{a mother}} in Sparta who would think and write so too," [...] says George.|$|R
60|$|When the {{men went}} on deck we lads followed, {{as a matter}} of course; but never <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> called upon to perform any part in the labor.|$|E
6000|$|... "It doesn't seem {{possible}} that we can accomplish very much," [...] I said with a long drawn sigh; [...] "but we must do as he would if <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> missing." ...|$|E
60|$|Mary and I {{had a great}} dislike to {{be called}} children. Properly understood, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> a lady aged ten, {{and the other was}} a gentleman aged thirteen. We left the good bailiff indignantly, and went away together, hand in hand, to the cottage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, hadn't {{you better}} call {{them up and}} see? We are giving you the first chance of doing it out <b>of</b> courtesy, but <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> a good operator." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{echoed the}} counsellors, [...] "we swear it, all of it, and while <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> left alive the oath shall be fulfilled, O White Bird of good omen." ...|$|R
60|$|For each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> at sea, each {{in his own}} ship; {{and each}} must sail her and steer her, as best he can, or sink and drown for ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{she must}} have had an immense deal of powder in her magazine; the shock was {{something}} terrible. Although we were over there in that battery, every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> thrown {{to the ground and}} several were killed. Two of the guns were dismounted." ...|$|E
60|$|A. Ah! that's just it! That's it exactly. You see, we were twins--defunct and I--and we got {{mixed in}} the bathtub when we were only two weeks old, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> drowned. But we didn't know which. Some think it was Bill. Some think it was me.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{perhaps not}} heretics; {{but we are}} rich, {{and the father of}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> a Jew, and there is {{something}} else in this house which even a true son of Holy Church might desire," [...] and he looked at the door through which Margaret had passed to her chamber.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You keep {{on trying}} for it,' I tells him, 'and I'll do the same. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> bound {{to get a}} rope over its horns before long. Well, so- long, Jacksy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear {{you were}} not born a diplomat, sir," [...] says Patty. [...] "You agree that we are beautiful, yet to hear that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> more so is small consolation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{occurs to}} me that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} for some irregularity in the work upon this ranch, and that the beast it a trifle uncertain in his moods," [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|Late, {{according}} to mediaeval hours, was the return, and Ebbo {{spoke in a}} tone of elation. [...] "The Kaisar was most gracious, and the king knew me," [...] he said, [...] "and asked for thee, Friedel, saying <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> nought without the other. But thou wilt go to-morrow, for we are to receive knighthood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{yet it was}} all useless. The {{next morning}} the first <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> smitten with the plague--a little nurse-girl in the family of Professor Stout. It {{was no time for}} weak-kneed, sentimental policies. On the chance that she might be the only one, we thrust her forth from the {{building}} and commanded her to be gone.|$|E
6000|$|In came Humphrey. [...] "Well, have ye {{heard the}} news? But I see you have. 'Tis {{a very strange}} thing that {{whenever}} one of Egdon folk goes to church some rum job or other {{is sure to be}} doing. The last time <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> there was when neighbour Fairway went in the fall; and that was the day you forbad the banns, Mrs. Yeobright." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, [...] "if only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> to escape, I think you fellows {{will agree with}} me that {{it ought to be}} Belmont, since he is the married man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Until {{you change}} your mind, or <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> dead. If {{you get tired of}} it in the meanwhile, you can always go back to the Old Country for a few months or so." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{hearing this}} the herald shouted back {{that we should}} every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>be</b> dead before noon if he had his way. Still, he would report my words {{faithfully}} to Quabie and bring his answer.|$|R
