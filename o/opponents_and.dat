5|$|Defensively he {{made use}} of poke checks to take the puck from his <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> excelled at getting to loose pucks and {{clearing}} {{them out of the}} defensive zone. He was adept at keeping opposing forwards from creating offence from behind the net.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Miller {{achieved}} {{more success}} as a footballer, following his brothers in joining the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1937. A defender, Miller initially played on the half-back flank before moving to full back during his third season, in 1939. At this stage, he lacked the strength to hip and shoulder his <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> relied on his running ability and accurate kicking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the game, both teams {{defeated}} their remaining <b>opponents,</b> <b>and</b> LSU captured the SEC Championship, after they defeated Georgia 42–10. On December 4, 2011, the final Bowl Championship Series standings were released with LSU ranked No.1 and Alabama ranked No.2 {{to set up a}} rematch in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. In the rematch, Alabama defeated LSU 21–0 and captured the 2011 national championship.|$|E
50|$|This move {{sees the}} {{attacker}} kneel behind a sitting <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> wrap around one arm under the <b>opponent's</b> chin <b>and</b> lock their hands. As with a sleeper hold, this move {{can also be}} performed from a standing position. Another variation of this hold, {{referred to as a}} bridging reverse chinlock, sees the attacking wrestler crouch before a face down <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> wrap around one arm under the <b>opponent's</b> chin <b>and</b> locking their hands before applying a bridge.|$|R

5|$|Tactical Realism: a {{variation}} of the standard competitive multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and teamwork, removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements, the ability to mark <b>opponents,</b> <b>and</b> the ability to see teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system.|$|E
5|$|The 1900 Michigan team {{compiled}} {{an overall}} record of 7–2–1 under first-year head coach Langdon Lea. However, {{the season was}} considered a disappointment as the Wolverines finished in fifth place in the Western Conference with a 3–2 record against Western Conference <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> a loss to rival Chicago. In January 1901, coach Lea resigned as Michigan to accept a position as the head football coach at Princeton.|$|E
5|$|The 1948 season saw Maryland {{slide to}} a 6–4 record, but they {{delivered}} four shutouts and lost {{two of their}} games by a combined three points. Two of their four losses came against ranked conference <b>opponents,</b> <b>and</b> a third was a 34-point shutout {{at the hands of}} Vanderbilt. Future two-time Heisman runner-up Charlie Justice helped North Carolina to a 29-point romp over the Terrapins.|$|E
50|$|Innovated by Jun Akiyama, {{and also}} called a T-bone suplex (named by former wrestler Tazz), the {{attacker}} stands facing his <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> positions himself {{under one of}} the <b>opponent's</b> arms <b>and</b> wraps his arm around the <b>opponent's</b> neck <b>and</b> back (this position {{is similar to that of}} a side slam) and then grabs the waist or leg of the <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> tosses him backwards, over the attacker's head. Several other variations exist, such as the wrist-clutch exploder suplex and the bridging exploder suplex. Shelton Benjamin, as seen in the adjacent picture, performs a combination exploder suplex/powerslam as a finishing maneuver.|$|R
50|$|The {{attacker}} {{places his}} leg behind the knee of the <b>opponent,</b> <b>and</b> while twisting the <b>opponent</b> sideways <b>and</b> backwards, sweeps {{him over the}} attacker's leg and throws him down (twisting backward knee trip).|$|R
50|$|A wrestler puts {{one hand}} under the <b>{{opponent}}'s</b> armpit <b>and</b> hold another hand over the opponent's hand. Wrestlers have to grip both hands from <b>opponents</b> behind <b>and</b> start to wrestle. The purpose is to drop opponent on its back or lift the <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> drop on the ground. The first one to perform the winning moves three times wins.|$|R
5|$|The Honolulu Advertiser {{reported}} that the Senate Democratic leadership reconsidered {{their support for the}} bill because of the large demonstration of <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> their pressure on senators to oppose the bill. It found that some senators privately suggested the bill's delay in committee or a proposed amendment to the bill were ways to avoid taking a vote following the controversy.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{features}} other modes: Color Edit, a palette swap editor {{that allows the}} player to customize nearly {{every aspect of the}} characters, including buckles and hair; Training, in which a player can practice with (and against) computer-controlled <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> Arcade, similar to the survival mode featured in other fighting games.|$|E
5|$|The only points {{allowed by}} the team were in a 3 to 2 loss to Northwestern in a game played in a heavy {{rainstorm}} on a field covered in mud five or six inches deep in some places. Michigan shut out seven of its eight <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> allowed only four first downs {{in the last three}} games of the season.|$|E

50|$|RESPECT.FC's rules differ {{somewhat}} {{from the}} North American Unified Rules. Among {{the differences are}} the allowance of knees {{to the head of}} downed <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> stomp kicks to the body, while elbows to the head of downed <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> soccer kicks are prohibited. Similar to the Unified Rules, fights have 3 rounds each lasting 5 minutes. Title Fights are 5 rounds.|$|R
5|$|The tie-breaking {{rules have}} changed over the years, with the most recent changes being made in 2002 to {{accommodate}} the league's realignment into eight four-team divisions; record vs. common <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> {{most of the other}} criteria involving wins and losses were moved up higher in the tie-breaking list, while those involving compiled stats such as points for and against were moved to the bottom.|$|E
5|$|This result marked Manchester United's {{first defeat}} of 1999. It {{was the second}} {{consecutive}} year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described it as psychological boost to beat his <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> felt the win showed that his team were ready for the upcoming season. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, on the other hand, believed the defeat highlighted his players needed more game time.|$|E
5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both of scoring {{and setting up}} goals, due to his passing accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, balance, and excellent dribbling skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat <b>opponents,</b> <b>and</b> withstand physical challenges. Despite his talent, he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour and aggression on the pitch. His turbulent and often unhealthy lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to have affected his career.|$|E
50|$|The quarter nelson {{involves}} {{putting one}} hand on the opponent's neck, passing the free arm under the arm of the <b>opponent,</b> <b>and</b> locking the free arm to the other arm by clasping the wrist. In amateur wrestling a strong quarter nelson can be used to secure a pin, or to control the <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> advance into a more dominant position.|$|R

5|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, {{they agreed that}} Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new {{civilian}} government could be formed. However, because of their disunity, the trio did little. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh. The US military commander in Vietnam William Westmoreland deplored the concessions Khánh made to political <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> lobbied Washington for permission to attack North Vietnam, saying that Khánh could not survive without it.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{established}} a Palestinian police force, named the Preventive Security Service (PSS), that became active on 13 May. It was mainly composed of PLA soldiers and foreign Palestinian volunteers. Arafat assigned Mohammed Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub {{to head the}} PSS. Amnesty International accused Arafat and the PNA leadership for failing to adequately investigate abuses by the PSS (including torture and unlawful killings) of political <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> dissidents {{as well as the}} arrests of human rights activists.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, civil strife {{broke out in}} Corinth between the {{democratic}} party and the oligarchic party. The democrats, supported by the Argives, launched an attack on their <b>opponents,</b> <b>and</b> the oligarchs were driven from the city. These exiles went to the Spartans, based at this time at Sicyon, for support, while the Athenians and Boeotians came up to support the democrats. In a night attack, the Spartans and exiles succeeded in seizing Lechaeum, Corinth's port on the Gulf of Corinth, and defeated the army that came out to challenge them the next day. The anti-Spartan allies then attempted to invest Lechaeum, but the Spartans launched an attack and drove them off.|$|E

5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold <b>opponents,</b> <b>and</b> use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his <b>opponents</b> <b>and</b> {{hope that they}} crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|Cielo started {{competing}} in backstroke. In the region at the time, Guilherme Guido stood {{out as the}} opponent to beat. Guido defeated Cielo repeatedly in freestyle, while Cielo won the backstroke events. However, at a certain point, Guido began to lose to freestyle <b>opponents,</b> <b>and</b> began {{competing in}} backstroke events. He defeated Cielo, who then decided not swim backstroke anymore. At age 15, Cielo attended a series of trainings in Florida, USA, and returned home, willing to defeat Guido. When Cielo and Guido were reunited in a 100m freestyle contest, Guido fell behind and lost. From then on, Guido focused on backstroke, reversing positions with Cielo.|$|E
50|$|Also {{referred}} to as a neckscissors, this hold sees a wrestler approach a supine <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> sit next to them before turning onto their side towards the <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> wrapping their legs around either side of the opponent's head, crossing the top leg after it has gone around the opponent's chin. The wrestler then tightens his grip to choke an opponent by compressing their throat.|$|R
50|$|The move is a {{standard}} facebreaker which involves the wrestler facing an <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> grabbing him or her by the head or hair <b>and</b> pulling the <b>opponent's</b> face down, dropping {{it on to the}} wrestler's knee. Often used by a wrestler to stun an <b>opponent</b> <b>and</b> set him or her up for another move. Many other facebreakers use the knee to inflict the damage; one variation sees the wrestler apply a standing side headlock, and simultaneously pull the <b>opponent</b> forward <b>and</b> smash the wrestler's knee to the opponent's head.|$|R
