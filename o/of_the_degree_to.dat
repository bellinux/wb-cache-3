As a result, modern historians have often {{considered}} it a cause of the later Wars of the Roses; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at Clyst (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near Exeter, which resulted in loss of life.|$|E

Verifying absolute satisfaction (true or false) of these requirements is challenging. Instead, we analyse requirements that admit flexible degrees of satisfaction.

The resulting analysis method provides a partial ordering of system designs, identifying trade-offs between different requirements in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> {{which they are}} satisfied.

Warning that there is a [...] "widely held fear of children and young people" [...] in the UK, the report says: [...] "The incessant portrayal of children as thugs and yobs" [...] not only reinforces the fears of the public but also influences policy and legislation."

2500|$|Canada lies {{somewhere between}} British and American {{usage of the}} degree and {{terminology}} of [...] "doctor". Research doctorates â PhDs and ScDs â are entitled to use the title [...] "doctor". Healthcare professions for which members may be called by the title of doctor are: medicine, dentistry, clinical psychology, optometry, chiropractic, veterinary medicine, podiatry and, more recently, pharmacy. In Alberta, Registered Nurses or Nurse Practitioners with an earned doctoral degree may use the title [...] "doctor" [...] in conjunction with professional practice. Members of these professions generally complete a minimum of 2 years of undergraduate studies, followed by a four- to six-year professional program (considered, despite the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree,</b> <b>to</b> be at bachelor's-level) to earn the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.), Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.), Doctor of Optometry (O.D.), Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) or Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.). In some provinces {{it is also possible}} to earn the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M) or Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.). In some provinces, such as Ontario, psychologists take a PhD in Psychology rather than the PsyD degree. In Ontario, only chiropractors, dentists, medical doctors, optometrists and psychologists can use the title [...] "doctor", when offering or purporting to offer health related services, while registered naturopathic doctors (N.D.) may only use the title [...] "doctor" [...] in written format if they also use the phrase, [...] "naturopathic doctor" [...] immediately following their name.
