500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it against you for the rest <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>career.</b> I've experienced that." ...|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 was the band's first {{release on}} Geffen, which absorbed sister label MCA Records in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had {{attempted}} to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract {{that they would have}} an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. [...] "Geffen came down and heard three songs and they said, 'This is the best record you've ever done, this is the record <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>career,</b> take as much time as you want, call us when it's done.' It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you're in the entertainment business, you've got to put creative first. It's an art, you've got to look at it like an art, treat it like an art, and then you'll get the best product in the long run." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 8, 2002 Smith learned via a {{phone call}} he had been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first ballot by {{receiving}} 91.7% of the votes cast. As it happened, the Olympic torch was passing through St. Louis {{on its way to}} Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Smith served as a torchbearer in a ceremony with St. Louis Rams' quarterback Kurt Warner that evening. Smith was inducted into the Hall of Fame during ceremonies on July 28, 2002. During his speech, he compared his baseball experiences with the characters from the novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, after which his son Dustin presented his Hall of Fame plaque. Days later on August 11, Smith was back at Busch Memorial Stadium for the unveiling of a statue in his likeness made by sculptor Harry Weber. Weber chose to emphasize Smith's defensive skills by showing Smith stretched horizontal to the ground while fielding a baseball. At the ceremony Weber told Smith, [...] "You spent half <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>career</b> up in the air. That makes it difficult for a sculptor to do something with it." ...|$|E
