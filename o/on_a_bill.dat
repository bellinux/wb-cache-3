5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began {{negotiating}} with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option {{would be unlikely to}} succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that would grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
