A historical analysis of episodes of rising rates show the value in distinguishing between orderly and disorderly rising rates regimes. Risk parity has weaker performance in disorderly rising rates environments but its performance over time is not dependent on falling bond yields.|$|E

5|$|Although {{international}} agreement on staging (INSS) has been used, {{the need for}} an international consensus <b>on</b> <b>risk</b> assignment has also been recognized in order to compare similar cohorts in results of studies. Beginning in 2005, representatives of the major pediatric oncology cooperative groups have met to review data for 8,800 neuroblastoma patients treated in Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia between 1990 and 2002. This task force has proposed the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) classification system. Retrospective studies revealed the high survival rate of 12–18 month old age group, previously categorized as high-risk, and prompted the decision to reclassify 12–18 month old children without N-myc (also commonly referred to as MYCN) amplification to intermediate risk category.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal risky {{investment}} problem with fewer restrictions on utilities, and more structure <b>on</b> <b>risks,</b> {{than does the}} current literature. It uses discrete random variables defined on a common domain, hereafter called standardized variables, to obtain new results without important loss of generality. The optimal amount of investment in a single risky asset does not always decrease as risk increases in the Rothschild-Stiglitz ([1970, 1971]; hereafter RS) sense. However, by using standardized variables to define wealth dependent measures of risk and return, the paper finds necessary and sufficient conditions <b>on</b> <b>risks</b> such that an increase in risk does cause decreasing optimal risky investment. The paper thus complements the RS results. For investment in two risky assets, the paper uses standardized variables to find conditions <b>on</b> <b>risks</b> such that the riskier asset's demand to decrease (increase) as the Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion index increases (decreases), and thereby complements Ross' [1981] results. ...|$|R

40|$|A central {{assumption}} {{in sociology}} {{is that the}} view <b>on</b> the <b>risk</b> is essentially a construction rather than a strictly objective perspective. However, this approach {{has a tendency to}} forget objective knowledge and tangible facts. Our research <b>on</b> <b>risks</b> in high mountains compares the available information <b>on</b> <b>risks</b> (scientific literature, safety information, media coverage and political discourse) with our empiric observations. Our work shows that there are differences caused by lack of fundamental reflection on the definition of the risk as a social construction. We propose to reconsider the definition of the risk with concepts closely connected to risk such as: uncertainty, emotion, phobia and danger, and to point out problems of confusion in several works of authors (e. g. those dealing with sensational activity, such as bungee jumping, as if it was dangerous).

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{strategy}} that is based <b>on</b> <b>risk</b> is portfolio theory. This suggests that a reasonable response to uncertainty {{is to have a}} wide portfolio of possible responses. In the case of climate change, mitigation can be viewed as an effort to reduce the chance of climate change impacts (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.24). Adaptation acts as insurance against the chance that unfavourable impacts occur. The risk associated with these impacts can also be spread. As part of a policy portfolio, climate research can help when making future decisions. Technology research can help to lower future costs.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between measuring and improving software quality in an embedded system (with emphasis <b>on</b> <b>risk</b> management) and software quality in business software (with emphasis on cost and maintainability management) is becoming somewhat irrelevant.

This convergence is most visible in mobile computing: a user who accesses an ERP application on their smartphone is depending on the quality of software across all types of software layers.|$|E
