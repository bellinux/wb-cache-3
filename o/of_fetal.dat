5|$|During {{the last}} three months <b>of</b> <b>fetal</b> development, the sebaceous glands of the fetus produce vernix caseosa, a waxy white {{substance}} that coats the skin to protect it from amniotic fluid.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are first}} {{visible from the}} 13th to the 16th week <b>of</b> <b>fetal</b> development, as bulgings off hair follicles. Sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that {{gives rise to the}} {{epidermis}} of the skin. Overexpression of the signalling factors Wnt, Myc and SHH all increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland presence.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level <b>of</b> <b>fetal</b> morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to examine the very low frequency periodic components <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> heart rate during labor in relation to the oxygen saturation <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> arterial blood. In order to analyze and quantify the periodic dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> heart rate variability in the very low frequency (VLF) range, we apply the matching pursuits (MP) method. This method has the ability to identify multiple periodicities in a highly nonstationary signal and we focus on the sinusoidal-like activities between 0. 01 and 0. 04 Hz. We demonstrate that the VLF activity <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> heart rate is increased when the oxygen saturation <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> arterial blood is diminished below the threshold value of 30 % and the umbilical artery pH is lower than 7. 15...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> face is {{an important}} part of every ultrasound examination since detailed facial examination can provide many information alerting the examiner about possible associated anomalies. Face and the brain have the same embryonic origin. By using 2 and 3 D ultrasound techniques, it is possible to obtain clear images <b>of</b> different <b>fetal</b> face defects. Incorporation of the 4 D ultrasonography made it possible to examine fetal behavior including fetal face movements. In that way using the ultrasound in the examination <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> face provides many new information not just about the morphology but also about neurological development and function <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> face...|$|R

5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages <b>of</b> <b>fetal</b> development in humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half <b>of</b> <b>fetal</b> development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages <b>of</b> <b>fetal</b> development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E

25|$|Addition of {{formaldehyde}} to maternal {{blood samples}} increases the percentage <b>of</b> free <b>fetal</b> DNA. The purpose of formaldehyde is to stabilize intact cells, and inhibit further release of maternal DNA. The mean percentage <b>of</b> free <b>fetal</b> DNA in maternal blood ranges from 0.32% to 40%, {{with a mean}} percentage of 7.7 without formaldehyde-treatment. The mean percentage <b>of</b> free <b>fetal</b> DNA with formaldehyde treatment was 20.2%. However, Benachi et al. in 2005 and Chinnapapagari et al. 2005 have highlighted the range of results from 5% to 96%. Another way to increase the fetal DNA is based on physical length <b>of</b> DNA fragments. <b>Fetal</b> DNA is smaller in size, and can comprise up to 70% of total cell-free DNA.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{documented}} {{cases of}} postmortem fetal extrusion were {{described in the}} medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the {{short amount of time}} elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery <b>of</b> <b>fetal</b> remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred prior to burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Heather Brooks dies in {{the premier}} of season ten. She goes {{to search for}} Dr. Webber and finds him lying in the {{basement}} of the hospital. Trying to save Dr. Webber, she accidentally steps into a puddle and electrocutes herself while hitting her head as she falls. Bailey moves a cancer patient in Webber's room to force some perspective and make him take the treatment. Also introduced in the tenth season was Dr. Karev's estranged father Jimmy Evans (James Remar) who tries to form a relationship with his son but fails repeatedly and ultimately dies in a botched surgery. The conclusion of season 10 has Cristina leaving Grey Sloan for Dr. Burke's job overseas while Dr. Ross makes a last-minute decision to follow her in order to study under her. Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) unknowingly drops a bombshell that she is the adopted love child of Dr. Webber and the late Dr. Grey, which makes for yet another half sister of Dr. Meredith Grey. Also, Dr. Yang leaves her seat on the board to Dr. Karev while Dr. Webber all but promises the seat to Dr. Bailey. Introduced in season eleven is Dr. Nicole Herman (Geena Davis), who is Chief <b>of</b> <b>Fetal</b> Surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial. Dr. Herman mentors Arizona Robbins in a fetal surgery fellowship, and plays in a twelve episode arc before departing after episode fourteen.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the {{daughter}} of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow doctors Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules. They are overseen during their internship by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident who works for attending Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), the head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest; Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), the head of cardio who becomes Yang's fiancee; and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, and lover of Ellis Grey decades ago. The residents are later joined by Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and April Kepner (Sarah Drew), former Mercy-West residents who join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger in the sixth season. Throughout the first six seasons, Burke, O'Malley and Stevens all depart the series. In addition to Webber, Burke, and Shepherd, the surgical wing is primarily supervised by Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), as head of OB/GYN, neonatal, and fetal surgery; Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), a resident who later becomes head of orthopedic surgery, who left Seattle {{at the end of the}} twelfth season; Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), as head of plastics; Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), as head of trauma; Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), as head of pediatric surgery, and later head <b>of</b> <b>fetal</b> surgery; Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), as head of cardio; Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), as head of cardio; and Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), Derek's sister who is hired to replace him as head of neuro.|$|E

40|$|Various {{methods have}} been used for the {{diagnosis}} <b>of</b> congenital <b>fetal</b> arrhythmias. Currently, M-mode echocardiography is the most widely used method. However, good tracings are often difficult to obtain because <b>of</b> unfavorable <b>fetal</b> positions, resulting in long durations of examination. In early gestation, the fetal heart is often too small for clear M-mode echocardiography. Doppler velocity waveforms <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> inferior vena cava represent the right atrial activity, whereas those of the aorta reflect ventricular contraction. Because of the proximity of the vessels, it is early to obtain simultaneous recording in opposite channels of Doppler waveforms from both vessels. A visual relationship between the atrial and ventricular contractions may be clearly established and a diagnosis may be made. The findings of simultaneous pulsed Doppler velocimetry <b>of</b> the <b>fetal</b> aorta and inferior vena cava were assessed in different types <b>of</b> congenital <b>fetal</b> arrhythmia: congenital heart block, premature atrial ectopic contractions, premature ventricular ectopic contractions, and supraventricular tachycardia. The correct diagnosis was made as early as 13 weeks' gestation, showing the application of this method in early pregnancy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
