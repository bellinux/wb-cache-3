25|$|The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in a {{subjective}} style {{from the point}} of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes.

25|$|Hopper's solitary {{figures are}} mostly women—dressed, semi-clad, and nude—often reading <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> out a window, {{or in the}} workplace. In the early 1920s, Hopper painted his first such images Girl at Sewing Machine (1921), New York Interior (another woman sewing) (1921), and Moonlight Interior (a nude getting into bed) (1923). Automat (1927) and Hotel Room (1931), however, are more {{representative}} of his mature style, emphasizing the solitude more overtly.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth in}} the IT sector is {{attributed}} to increased specialisation, and an availability of a large pool of low-cost, highly skilled, fluent English-speaking workers – matched by increased demand from foreign consumers interested in India's service exports, <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> to outsource their operations. The share of the Indian IT industry in the country's GDP increased from 4.8% in 2005–06 to 7% in 2008. In 2009, seven Indian firms were listed among the top 15 technology outsourcing companies in the world.|$|E

25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{can prevent}} {{the most common}} types of infection. To be most effective, they should be used before an infection occurs and are therefore recommended {{between the ages of}} nine and 13. Cervical cancer screening, such as with the Papanicolaou test (pap) <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> at the cervix after using acetic acid, can detect early cancer or abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. This allows for early treatment which results in better outcomes. Screening has reduced both the number and deaths from cervical cancer in the developed world.|$|E
25|$|Departures {{this summer}} include long time Lyonnais Juninho, who, after {{spending}} a respectable eight seasons at the club, moved to Qatari club Al-Gharafa. Defender Sandy Paillot joined fellow Ligue 1 club Grenoble for a fee of €2 million {{after spending a}}lmost a year-and-a-half on loan at the club. Also during this summer window, a host of youth players who were either deemed surplus to requirements <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> to find some significant playing time departed the club. Pierrick Valdivia, Ayan Si-Mohamed and Alexis Carra moved to Sedan, Stade Reims and Italian club Vicenza, respectively. Midfielder Romain Dedola and defender Morgan Ancian both joined Strasbourg, while Quentin Barlet and Jérémy Dequelson joined lesser rivals Lyon Duchère. Another youth player, Jérémy Pied, joined Metz on loan for the entire 2009–10 season with hopes that the player will receive greater playing time.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of fluid}} in the semicircular canals signals the brain about the {{direction}} and speed of rotation of the head – for example, whether we are nodding our head up and down <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> from right to left. Each semicircular canal has a bulbed end, or enlarged portion, that contains hair cells. Rotation of the head causes a flow of fluid, which in turn causes displacement of the top portion of the hair cells that are embedded in the jelly-like cupula. Two other organs {{that are part of}} the vestibular system are the utricle and saccule. These are called the otolithic organs and are responsible for detecting linear acceleration, or movement in a straight line. The hair cells of the otolithic organs are blanketed with a jelly-like layer studded with tiny calcium stones called otoconia. When the head is tilted or the body position is changed with respect to gravity, the displacement of the stones causes the hair cells to bend.|$|E

500|$|The game's soundtrack is {{best known}} for two tracks: [...] "Liberi Fatali", a Latin choral piece that is played during the {{introduction}} to the game, and [...] "Eyes on Me", a pop song serving as the game's theme, performed by Chinese singer Faye Wong. Reviewers were generally pleased with the music, although several cited issues while comparing the score to previous games <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> at individual tracks.|$|E
500|$|The game's theme song, [...] "Believe in the Spirit", was composed, {{written and}} sung by Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia. Prior to coming on board, she had little {{knowledge}} of the Mana series. As with her previous compositions for video games, Kokia {{tried to get a}} feel for the game's atmosphere before starting, either through playing the game directly <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> at behind-the-scenes material related to the game's world. With [...] "Believe in the Spirit", she worked to create a song that would appeal to both players and the production team. The track was performed using strings, a tin whistle, an acoustic guitar and percussion. The arrangement was done by Mina Kubota.|$|E
500|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} Alpocalypse tour, Yankovic stated in an {{interview}} with The Morning Call that he had one more album on his contract; the paper and other sources took to mean that this album would be his last. Yankovic later clarified that this was the last album on the current recording contract with his label, that he is currently [...] "weighing his options" [...] for renewing the contract <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> to another publisher, and {{made it clear that he}} was not retiring from music in the foreseeable future. In a later interview with NPR's Weekend Edition, he stated that this might be his last conventional album, turning instead to more frequent releases of singles and EPs. For an LP, Yankovic stated that given the time lapse between the beginning of the process and the release of the finished product, [...] "chances are a lot of the material is going to be somewhat dated by the time it comes out".|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that Anderson was {{constantly}} playing [...] "a mother who's always crying, shouting <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> miserable" [...] in the episode. They wrote that the episode's [...] "characters no longer make sense" [...] and that the plot has [...] "been so required to dance through the little conspiracy hoops that there's no consistency any more." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the idea to suggest that Mulder died in the episode, {{due to the fact}} that Carter announced Duchovny would return for the season finale. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticised the plot of the episode, saying that it [...] "throws up many elements that we've seen the series do better elsewhere...in the hope that something will stick".|$|E
500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|In Gender Advertisements, {{he writes}} about how gender is {{represented}} in the advertising we all absorb in our everyday lives. [...] He explains relative size, feminine touch, function ranking, the family, the ritualization of subordination, and licensed withdraw. [...] Relative size means that the women represented in advertisements are generally shown shorter or smaller in comparison to men. [...] Feminine touch is when a woman touches a man or an object {{in a way that}} is very loose, and not gripping the object tightly. [...] Function ranking represents a hierarchy in the images, by way that the man is shown in front and largest in front of women and children. [...] The family is typically depicted in a way that gives the father and a son a close relationship, and the mother and a daughter a close relationship. [...] The ritualization of subordination is when women are shown in a lower ranking or worth of an image, and they are smaller, underneath, and overall of lesser importance to men. [...] Finally, licensed withdrawal is when a women is shown as not interested in the camera, <b>or</b> <b>looking</b> off into the distance with head and body cant. Goffman analyzes all of these topics in a very in-depth and easy to understand format.|$|E
