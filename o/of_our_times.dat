5|$|From the {{distance}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times,</b> Diefenbaker's {{role as a}} prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|In modern history, orators such as Henry Clay would mimic Demosthenes's technique. His {{ideas and}} {{principles}} survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times.</b> Hence, he constituted {{a source of}} inspiration for the authors of The Federalist Papers (a series of 85 essays arguing for the ratification of the United States Constitution) and for the major orators of the French Revolution. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau was among those who idealised Demosthenes and wrote a book about him. For his part, Friedrich Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired.* P. J. M. Van Tongeren, Reinterpreting Modern Culture, 92.|$|E

25|$|Yogananda envisioned “World Brotherhood Colonies” {{as places}} where {{harmonious}} people could {{support each other}} in the balanced development of body, mind, and soul through the teachings of Yoga. He spoke of “plain living and God thinking,” a simple but effective formula to tap into the spiritual reality that flows like a deep river beneath the chaos <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times.</b> Song of the Morning Ranch is the ideal location for such a colony, nested as it is within a state forest teaming with God’s boundless variety of life forms, and the deep quiet and peace conducive to inner revelation.|$|E
25|$|Andrew K. Burroughs (26 May 1953 Beckenham, Kent - 15 March 2014) was a British physician, {{researcher}} and teacher. He is renowned for his wide {{contribution to the}} field of Hepatology; he has been termed one of the greatest hepatologists <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times</b> and the true representative of Dame Sheila Sherlock's legacy. He was awarded the Lyon Jones Senior Scholarship, the Bromley Undergraduate Scholarship, the Robert Grieve Memorial Prize in Anatomy, the Augusta Lipkin Prize in Biochemistry, the George Holt Bronze Medal in Physiology, the J Hill Abram Prize in Medicine, the Henry Briggs Memorial Prize in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the William James Eastwood Prize in Orthopaedic Surgery. After working as a House Surgeon and House Physician at the Walton Hospital in Liverpool, he became a Senior House Office in Medicine at the Broadgreen Hospital of the same city, finally becoming a locum Senior Registrar in Gastroenterology at the Broadgreen Hospital for the last months of 1978.|$|E

Spins editor, Brian Josephs, complimented the song's reggae production and the group's sensual performance; however, he had a negative view of Fetty Wap's appearance commenting that the rapper [...] "fails to come off here as much more than Default Guest Rapper". However, Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic felt that [...] "All In My Head (Flex) brings in the most exuberant rapper <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times,</b> Fetty Wap, to very catchy effect." ...|$|E

500|$|Conspiracy Encyclopedia {{was listed}} as {{required}} reading in a 2008 course on conspiracy at Harvard University.

The encyclopedia is recommended for further reading by David Southwell and Sean Twist in their book Unsolved Political Mysteries. Writing for The Star, James Mitchell observed, [...] "There's a huge amount packed in here, simply presented." [...] Mitchell concluded, [...] "Read the Conspiracy Encyclopedia, and you'll either have your worst fears confirmed that there's a grand, unified conspiracy affecting everything... or less exciting, {{that most of the}} time, vanilla rules: What {{you see is what you}} get!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to a reviewer's criticism of Bond as villainous, Fleming said in a 1964 Playboy interview {{that he did not}} consider his character to be particularly evil or good: [...] "I don't think that he is necessarily a good guy or a bad guy. Who is? He's got his vices and very few perceptible virtues except patriotism and courage, which are probably not virtues anyway... But I didn't intend for him to be a particularly likeable person." [...] Fleming agreed with some critics' characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer, but expressed that he was a product of his time: [...] "James Bond is a healthy, violent, noncerebral man in his middle-thirties, and a creature of his era. I wouldn't say he's particularly typical <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times,</b> but he's certainly of the times." ...|$|E

500|$|The Kazon were {{inspired}} by Los Angeles gangs, and were referenced in a [...] "shorthand 'Crips' and 'Bloods' fashion". The idea for the Kazon as warrior sects, {{as opposed to a}} unified race, was introduced by Taylor, who drafted them as [...] "three gangs, with constantly shifting relationships and allegiances. Just as we think we have sorted it out, the balance shifts again." [...] While discussing the Kazon's original inspiration, Taylor viewed them as a way [...] "to address the tenor <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times</b> and what [...] was happening in our cities and recognizing a source of danger and social unrest". Piller further described the premise for the Kazon as rooted in gang violence and warfare by clarifying: [...] "Our intention was to create a sort of disorganized anarchy, them-against-them as much as them-against-us." ...|$|E
500|$|Analysis in {{secondary}} sources and books on Six Feet Under have compared the training in [...] "The Plan" [...] {{to the current}} incarnation of Erhard's trainings, Landmark Education. [...] Reading Six Feet Under: TV to Die For by Akass et al. have compared [...] "The Plan" [...] to est and The Forum. [...] Akass cites the episode while analyzing the phenomenon of self-improvement, and notes that: [...] "Repairing her shingles often leaves Ruth in shackles." [...] She writes that: [...] "the series performs the logic of self-help, both its silly and seductive sides." [...] However, she {{also points out that}} Ruth's rant {{at the end of her}} seminar is cathartic for Ruth, and she ends her analysis of the episode by asking: [...] "So, what do we make <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times</b> when all this supposed nonsense actually works?" ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson is {{particularly}} known for playing reticent women, and Sands describes her as [...] "the best actress <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times</b> on suffering borne with poignant dignity". According to Kate Kellaway of The Guardian, she specialises in playing [...] "a good {{woman in a}} frock". She also plays many haughty characters, with a [...] "bracing, nanny-like demeanour", but she is noted for her ability to win the empathy of audiences. Thompson belongs {{to a group of}} highly decorated British actresses including Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham Carter who are known for appearing in [...] "heritage films" [...] and typically showing [...] "restraint, rendering emotions through intellect rather than feelings, and a sense of irony, which demonstrates the heroine's superior understanding". Projecting a typically [...] "British image", Thompson's often dogmatic and tight-jawed manner has also been compared to Maggie Smith.|$|E

500|$|Dylan biographer Howard Sounes {{described}} [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] as a [...] "grim masterpiece." [...] The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing folk-blues riffs and up {{and down}} chord progressions. Author Sean Wilentz has noted that the song's chord structure is similar to that used by the Everly Brothers' in their hit recording of [...] "Wake Up Little Susie". The lyrics of [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] express Dylan's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture, but unlike those in his earlier protest songs, do not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions. In his book Bob Dylan, Performing Artist, author Paul Williams has suggested that the song addresses [...] "the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times</b> is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming at us from every direction." [...] Williams {{goes on to say that}} the song successfully paints a portrait of an [...] "alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'." [...] As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Louise Flavin {{has noted}} that Thompson's {{screenplay}} contains significant alterations to the characters of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood: in the novel, the former embodies [...] "sense", i.e. [...] "sensible" [...] in our terms, and the latter, [...] "sensibility", i.e. [...] "sensitivity" [...] in our terms. [...] Audience members are meant to view self-restrained Elinor as the person in need of reform, rather than her impassioned sister. To heighten the contrast between them, Marianne and Willoughby's relationship includes an [...] "erotic" [...] invented scene in which the latter requests a lock of her hair – a direct contrast to Elinor's [...] "reserved relationship" [...] with Edward. Lee also distinguishes them through imagery – Marianne is often seen with musical instruments, near open windows, and outside, while Elinor is pictured in door frames. Another character altered for modern viewers is Margaret Dashwood, who conveys [...] "the frustrations that a girl <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>times</b> might feel at the limitations facing her as {{a woman in the}} early nineteenth century." [...] Thompson uses Margaret for exposition in order to detail contemporary attitudes and customs. For instance, Elinor explains to a curious Margaret – and by extension, the audience – why their half-brother inherits the Dashwood estate. Margaret's altered storyline, giving her an interest in fencing and geography, also allows audience members to see the [...] "feminine" [...] side of Edward and Brandon, as they become father or brother figures to her. The film omits the characters of Lady Middleton and her children, {{as well as that of}} Ann Steele, Lucy's sister.|$|E
