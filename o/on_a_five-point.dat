25|$|Kieskompas (Electoral Compass) was {{launched}} by the newspaper Trouw {{in cooperation with the}} VU University Amsterdam in order to compete with the Stemwijzer. This system was supposed to give considerably more information. Here voters could show their support for thirty six propositions <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> scale. Next they show whether they thought the current cabinet had performed well. Finally Kieskompas showed users their attitude towards party leaders as competent and trustworthy. The voters were shown a two-axis system (similar to a Nolan Chart) and their own position as well as the position of each party in this chart. It stated which party was the closest to them and which party the farthest. It also gave them the possibility to see which coalition best matched their political preferences.|$|E
25|$|General {{seismic risk}} in France is {{categorised}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> scale, with zone 1 being very low risk, through to zone 5 {{in areas with}} a 'very strong' risk. In Metropolitan France the areas of highest risk are rated at 4, 'strong', and {{are located in the}} Pyrenees, Alps, the south of the Haut-Rhin département, the Territoire de Belfort and a few communes in Doubs. A new zoning map comes into force on 1 May 2011, which significantly increases the rating for many areas. The major nuclear research facilities at Cadarache are located in a zone 4 area near the fault that caused the 1909 Lambesc earthquake, while the Marcoule research centre and the nuclear power plants at Tricastin, Cruas, Saint-Alban, Bugey and Fessenheim (near the fault that caused the 1356 Basel earthquake) are all within zone 3. A further 6 plants lie within zone 2.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{multitude of}} scholastic {{studies have shown}} that the linguistic styles of GLB and straight people are not mutually exclusive. Munson et al. (2006), for instance, examined the gradient nature of perceived sexual orientation by having 40 listeners rate 44 talkers' sexual orientation <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> equally appearing interval scale. The 44 talkers included equal number of GLB and straight people. When averaged across the 40 listeners, ratings for individual talkers showed some overlap between GLB and straight people. For example, the two men who were tied with the most-gay average ratings included one self-identified straight man, and one self-identified gay man. While there are group level differences between GLB and straight people in the gay soundness of their voices, overlap does exist, providing a serious challenge to a simple model in which speech differences were the inevitable consequence of sexual orientation. The fact that there is no clean cut between the linguistic patterns of GLB and straight people suggests that too many generations in the study of language and gender can be dangerous.|$|E
40|$|Candidate {{selection}} {{is a major}} function exercised by political parties. Yet they differ a lot regarding who selects their candidates, varying on both dimensions of inclusiveness and centralisation. One can wonder whether these variations in the modes of candidate selection do really matter. The paper classifies ten Belgian political parties, for two federal elections – a regular (2007) and an early election (2010) – <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-points</b> inclusiveness scale summarizing selection modes. Based on this scale, the paper empirically tests the impact of candidate selection modes {{on the degree of}} mass – elite ideological congruence, using positions of candidates and voters on the left-right scale and on the authoritarian-libertarian scale. Our results confirm that selection matters. More exclusive selectorates tend to select candidates being ideologically closer to their voters...|$|R

Using a {{stereoscopic}} {{clearing protocol}} and scanning electron microscopy, we investigated {{the extent and}} nature of microleakage in a total-etch, current-generation dentin adhesive by a wet-bonding technique under different handling conditions. The hypotheses were that inadequate light curing of the primer or incomplete drying of the primer solvent might adversely affect the sealing ability of an acetone-containing adhesive system. The study consisted of three experimental groups: (I) a control group with an adequate light source and with the primer solvent completely dried; (II) an "inadequate-light" group; and (III) an "incomplete evaporation of primer solvent " group. The extent of microleakage after silver staining and clearing of the specimens was scored based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> modified <b>five-point</b> scale. Nonparametric statistica...|$|R
25|$|In {{the gold}} medal game, both the USA and Spain entered the game undefeated. The USA started well, opening up an early 7–2 lead, but Spain came back strong. The lead changed hands in the first half, with the USA holding <b>on</b> to <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> lead at halftime. The USA scored the first six points {{of the second half}} to push the lead to double-digits, but Spain cut the lead back to just two points {{at the end of the}} third period. Spain hit three {{pointers}} in the final period and took the lead; the game was tied at 71 points each late in the game. The USA team outscored Spain by just 6–4 over the remaining time to win the game and {{the gold medal}}. Spain's Ángela Salvadores scored 40 points for her team and was awarded the tournament MVP honors, but it wasn't quite enough. USA's Lauren Cox scored 20 points, while the team set a USA U17 record for blocked shots, with eight. USA’s Joyner Holmes and Katie Lou Samuelson were named to the all-tournament team.|$|R
25|$|On 4 January 1974, Harry Schwarz met and had {{discussions with}} Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) Buthelezi, Chief Executive Councillor {{of the black}} {{homeland}} of KwaZulu. They agreed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> plan for racial peace in South Africa that {{became known as the}} Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith. The declaration's purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa for racial peace in South Africa. It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all with a Bill of Rights to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. The concept of a non-discriminatory society had been outlined in the 'Act of Dedication' of 1973 that Schwarz had written, while Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal. Schwarz had called for the Transvaal and South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the act. While the United Party Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused for it to come to debate. The principles of the act were adopted at the 1973 National United Party Congress.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{complained about}} the game's low level of {{interactivity}} due {{to most of the}} gameplay time being spent watching television with Pikachu. Summarizing the gameplay in general as [...] "weak", GameSpot's Ricardo Torres argued that the game's promising ideas were fundamentally deadened by [...] "the gimmick of having to 'virtually' watch television programs" [...] and the long stretches of time this entails. Leeper claimed that Pikachu [...] "will be content much longer than you will" [...] and decried the channels' non-interactive nature while praising the unlockable status of a few. Darryl Vassar of GameSpy went even further and claimed that there was [...] "no gameplay". He gave the game only one star out of five as a result, despite calling the animation quality and Pokémon voices [...] "decent". Tokyo Drifter found its low interactivity and slow pace to be the two biggest barriers for Pokémon fan enjoyment, and gave the game a 3.0 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> scale. Irwin stated that the player would desire more interactivity and condemned the programs overall, with the exception of Pichu Bros, which she called [...] "the only worthwhile programming".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the compilation album was positive overall; many reviewers appreciated the album in its entirety but criticized select tracks. The AU Review Robert Lyon awarded the album a score of 8.2 on a 10-point scale. Lyon thought [...] "Clap Your Hands" [...] began the album [...] "brilliantly" [...] and complimented additional individual tracks, but noted the compilation offered no previously unreleased material and that the bonus DVD was only available through select retailers. Mikey Cahill of News Limited awarded the album four points <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> scale. He wrote listeners {{have the ability to}} [...] "visualise Sia's animated exterior singing each note loud and proud" [...] and summarized the album in one word: [...] "respectable". Freya Davies of ArtsHub suggested [...] "Bring Night" [...] would have been a better opening track. Davies criticized select tracks, such as [...] "Destiny" [...] and [...] "Day Too Soon" [...] due to Sia's [...] "inarticulate" [...] singing, but also complimented faster tempo songs which highlighted her [...] "vocal strength" [...] ("Titanium" [...] and [...] "Buttons"). Davies concluded: [...] "Sia's ability to combine cult and popular appeal is successfully demonstrated by the strength of this compilation album. Its weaknesses are momentary; overall, it is a fun salute to the past 15 years and a respectable look to the future." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{majority}} of pastoralists and agropastoralists questioned in the testing phase believed they perceived {{climate change and}} {{that the level of}} awareness was explained in terms of its impact <b>on</b> local agriculture. <b>A</b> question was therefore added and survey instrument modified to elicit the level of climate change perception through its impact <b>on</b> agriculture using <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> Likert scale; 1) no perception and thus no perception of impact on agriculture; 2) climate change has been noticeable but has not significantly impacted agriculture; 3) climate change has been noticeable and has impacted agriculture to a certain extent; 4) climate change has been noticeable with <b>a</b> substantial impact <b>on</b> agriculture and 5) climate change has been noticeable and has completely changed the way farming is done.

2500|$|Behavioral Checklists and Scales: {{behaviors}} are more definite than traits. [...] The critical incidents method (or critical incident technique) concerns [...] "specific behaviors indicative of {{good or bad}} job performance". [...] Supervisors record behaviors of what they judge to be job performance relevant, and they keep a running tally of good and bad behaviors. [...] A discussion on performance may then follow. [...] The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) combine the critical incidents method with rating scale methods by rating performance on a scale but with the scale points being anchored by behavioral incidents. [...] Note that BARS are job specific. In the behavioral observation scale (BOS) approach to performance appraisal, employees are also evaluated {{in the terms of}} critical incidents. In that respect, it is similar to BARS. However, the BOS appraisal rate subordinates on the frequency of the critical incidents as they are observed to occur over a given period. The ratings are assigned <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>five-point</b> scale. The behavioral incidents for the rating scale are developed {{in the same way as}} for BARS through identification by supervisors or other subject matter experts. Similarly, BOS techniques meet equal employment opportunity because they are related to actual behavior required for successful job performance.|$|E
