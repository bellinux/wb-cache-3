This resulted in smaller apparent partition coefficients of the total <b>organic</b> <b>nitrate</b> species under high chamber RH.

The ozone concentration has steadily increased over the last century, reaching levels where plant damage occurs. ^ It is known that VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and NOx (NO and NO 2) from industrial as well as biogenic sources make control of regional tropospheric ozone difficult. For this reason, it is important to understand the mechanism for VOC oxidation, and the relationship between molecular structure and atmospheric radical chemistry. Tropospheric ozone is formed from the OH oxidation of VOCs in the presence of NO. Organic nitrates are also formed through this process. Formation of organic nitrates is a termination step, which competes with ozone formation. <b>Organic</b> <b>nitrate</b> formation from OH oxidation of n-alkenes and n-alkenes has been studied.

40|$|The {{production}} of atmospheric organic nitrates (RONO 2) {{has a large}} impact on air quality and climate due to their contribution to secondary organic aerosol and influence on tropospheric ozone concentrations. Since organic nitrates control the fate of gas phase NO x (NO + NO 2), a byproduct of anthropogenic combustion processes, their atmospheric production and reactivity is of great interest. While the atmospheric reactivity of many relevant organic nitrates is still uncertain, one significant reactive pathway, condensed phase hydrolysis, has recently {{been identified as a}} potential sink for <b>organic</b> <b>nitrate</b> species. The partitioning of gas phase organic nitrates to aerosol particles and subsequent hydrolysis likely removes the oxidized nitrogen from further atmospheric processing, due to large <b>organic</b> <b>nitrate</b> uptake to aerosols and proposed hydrolysis lifetimes, which may impact long-range transport of NO x, a tropospheric ozone precursor. Despite the atmospheric importance, the hydrolysis rates and reaction mechanisms for atmospherically derived organic nitrates are almost completely unknown, including those derived from α -pinene, a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) {{that is one of the}} most significant precursors to biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA). To better understand the chemistry that governs the fate of particle phase organic nitrates, the hydrolysis mechanism and rate constants were elucidated for several organic nitrates, including an α -pinene-derived <b>organic</b> <b>nitrate</b> (APN). A positive trend in hydrolysis rate constants was observed with increasing solution acidity for all organic nitrates studied, with the tertiary APN lifetime ranging from 8. 3  min at acidic pH (0. 25) to 8. 8  h at neutral pH (6. 9). Since ambient fine aerosol pH values are observed to be acidic, the reported lifetimes, which are much shorter than that of atmospheric fine aerosol, provide important insight into the fate of particle phase organic nitrates. Along with rate constant data, product identification confirms that a unimolecular specific acid-catalyzed mechanism is responsible for <b>organic</b> <b>nitrate</b> hydrolysis under acidic conditions. The free energies and enthalpies of the isobutyl nitrate hydrolysis intermediates and products were calculated using a hybrid density functional (ω B 97 X-V) to support the proposed mechanisms.

We therefore examined the release of nitric oxide from <b>organic</b> <b>nitrates</b> {{by means of a}} difference-spectrophotometric method and found that our results correlated well with the extent of enzyme activation. The more NO. was liberated from the compounds in question, the higher was the enzyme activation observed. When the examined nitrates were used in a concentration which caused a half-maximal enzyme stimulation, the result was a NO. liberation of striking uniformity. This correlation also applied to SIN- 1 for which it has been assumed up to now that the intact molecule itself is able to stimulate the enzyme and not the nitric oxide released from it. We found the reaction between <b>organic</b> <b>nitrates</b> and cysteine to be highly dependent on temperature, while the extent of the observed enhancement increased with the number of nitrate groups per molecule. We also studied the potential effects of certain compounds on non-enzymatic NO. release and found that, in addition to methylene blue, thionine and brilliantcresyl blue, but not ferricyanide, were also effective inhibitors. So it seems likely that both an enzymatic and a non-enzymatic mode of inhibition of enzyme activity does exist. Since oxyhemoglobin is an effective scavenger of nitric oxide, its addition can inhibit enzyme activation by nitrovasodilators.

Gruetter: Mechanism of {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} relaxation by <b>organic</b> <b>nitrates,</b> nitrites, nitroprusside and nitric oxide: Evidence for {{the involvement of}} S-nitrosothiols as active inter-mediates. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 218 : 739 - 749, 1981. The objective {{of this study was}} to ascertain whether the vaso-dilator effect of <b>organic</b> <b>nitrates</b> and nitrites, NaNO 2, nitroprus-side and NO could be attributed to the formation and action of short-acting intermediate S-nitrosothiols. Recent studies from this and other laboratories have suggested that cyclic GMP may be involved in the vascular smooth muscle relaxant re-sponse to nitrogen oxide-containing vasodilator drugs. In this study, partially purified guanylate cyclase from bovine coronary artery was activated by glyceryl trinitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, amyl nitrite, NaNO 2, nitroprusside and NO, but this enzyme activation required the presence of-SH groups in the form of added thiols. Glyceryl trinitrat...|$|R
