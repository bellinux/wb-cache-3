5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher <b>opacity</b> has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower <b>opacity</b> means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high <b>opacity</b> can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the <b>opacity</b> is {{dominated}} by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as the cube of the star's mass. For stars below 10 , the <b>opacity</b> becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass. For very low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere {{also contribute to the}} <b>opacity.</b> Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the <b>opacity</b> of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the <b>opacity.</b> This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} lung abnormalities on serial thin-section computed tomographic (CT) scans {{in patients}} with {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) during acute and convalescent periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serial thin-section CT scans in 30 patients (17 men, aged 42. 5 years ± 12. 2 [SD]) with SARS were reviewed by two radiologists together for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities: ground-glass <b>opacities,</b> ground-glass <b>opacities</b> with superimposed linear <b>opacities,</b> consolidation, reticular pattern, and mixed pattern (consolidation, ground-glass <b>opacities,</b> and reticular pattern). Scans were classified according to duration in weeks after symptom onset. Longitudinal changes of specific abnormalities were documented in 17 patients with serial scans obtained during 3 weeks. Each lung was divided into three zones; each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement. Summation of scores from all six lung zones provided overall CT score (maximal CT score, 24). RESULTS: Median CT scores increased from 1 in the 1 st week to 12. 5 in the 2 nd week. Ground-glass <b>opacities</b> with or without smooth interlobular septal thickening and consolidation were predominant patterns found during the 1 st week. Ground-glass <b>opacities</b> with superimposed irregular reticular <b>opacities,</b> mixed pattern, and reticular <b>opacities</b> were noted from the 2 nd week and peaked at or after the 4 th week. After the 4 th week, 12 (55 %) of 22 patients had irregular linear <b>opacities</b> with or without associated ground-glass <b>opacities</b> and CT scores greater than 5; five of these patients had bronchial dilatation. When specific <b>opacities</b> were analyzed in 17 patients, consolidation generally resolved completely (n = 4) or to minimal residual opacities; six (55 %) of 11 patients with ground-glass <b>opacities</b> had substantial residual disease (CT scores > 5) on final scans. CONCLUSION: There is a temporal pattern of lung abnormalities at thin-section CT in SARS. Predominant findings at presentation are ground-glass <b>opacities</b> and consolidation. Reticulation is evident after the 2 nd week and persists in half of all patients evaluated after 4 weeks. Long-term follow-up is required to determine whether the reticulation represents irreversible fibrosis. © RSNA, 2004. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Objectives We {{report the}} mineral (hydroxyapatite) density {{of sound and}} opaque areas in DMH molars with sound parts of (carious) {{deciduous}} teeth serving as controls. Methods Twenty-nine extracted second primary molars obtained from 15 children were studied. Thirteen of these molars were DMH molars with yellow <b>opacities,</b> seven were DMH molars with white <b>opacities,</b> three DMH molars with brown <b>opacities</b> and eleven were molars without DMH. Prior to microCT scanning, the teeth were mounted in impression material (Impregum®) and stored in water with a thymol crystal. Spot analysis and line scans were performed in areas with <b>opacities</b> and in sound areas. An ANOVA test and t-tests were used to test if {{there were significant differences}} between the groups. Results The average densities of the hydroxyapatite in yellow and brown <b>opacities</b> (1368 mg HA/cm 2 and 1407 mg HA/cm 2, respectively) were significantly lower than in clinically unaffected enamel (1747 mg HA/cm 2) of DMH molars or of sound molars (1758 mg HA/cm 2).

5|$|The {{radiation}} zone is {{the region of}} the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high <b>opacity</b> (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium.

All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher <b>opacity</b> or both.|$|E

5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low <b>opacity,</b> because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E

The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula.

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{shapes of}} small <b>opacities</b> {{on the chest}} radiographs of 895 British coalminers have been studied. The aims were to determine whether irregular (as distinct from rounded) small <b>opacities</b> can be identified reproducibly, whether their occurrence is related to dust exposure, and whether they are associated with excess prevalence of respiratory symptoms or impairments of lung function. Six of the doctors responsible for regular radiological surveys of all British coalminers each classified all 895 radiographs twice and independently, using the International Labour Organisation's 1980 classification system. The majority view was that 39 films showed predominantly irregular small <b>opacities,</b> 131 showed predominantly small rounded <b>opacities,</b> and 587 showed no small <b>opacities.</b> Readers' opinions varied about the presence and shapes of shadows on the other 138 films. In general, consistency between readers (and within readers on repeated viewings) was satisfactory. The occurrence and profusion of irregular shadows were related significantly both to the men's ages and additionally to their cumulative exposure to respirable coalmine dust as determined from 15 years' dust monitoring close to where the miners had worked. For any given level of exposure, the average level of profusion of the small irregular <b>opacities</b> was less than the corresponding profusion of small rounded <b>opacities.</b> The prevalence rates of chronic cough and phlegm, and of breathlessness, were higher in those with small irregular <b>opacities</b> than in those with no small <b>opacities</b> (category 0 / 0), but the differences {{were not statistically significant}} after adjustment for other factors including smoking habits. The presence of irregular (but not rounded) small shadows was associated with an impairment in respiratory function averaging about 190 ml deficits in both FEV 1 and FVC. These deficits were not explicable in terms of the men's ages, body sizes, and smoking habits and they were in addition to the lung function losses attributable to the miners' dust exposure as such. It is concluded that the presence and profusion of small irregular <b>opacities</b> should be taken into consideration when assessing the severity of coalworkers' simple pneumoconiosis...|$|R
