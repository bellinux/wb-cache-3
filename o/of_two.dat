Whenever available in the collection, otoliths from three distinct specimen sizes were illustrated and photographed in order to show their variation during development. For each characteristic the frequency of occurrence was calculated within each length class (TL) and among length classes (during development) and differences were analyzed by a multiple &# 967;² test (significance 0. 05) ...|$|R

50|$|Before 1948 {{there was}} no {{professional}} football league in Colombia. The first clubs were formed in Barranquilla and Bogotá: Barranquilla FC, Polo Club, Escuela Militar and Bartolinos, although the game {{took a while to}} develop in popularity. The 1918 Campeonato Nacional was the first tournament played between Colombian clubs, followed by the Copa Centenario Batalla de Boyacá. Independiente Medellín, founded on 15 April 1913, is the oldest club that remains as a professional club.The first tournament was organised by Colombian Football Federation and DIMAYOR in 1948.

40|$|Two insulin {{receptor}} mRNA {{species are}} expressed in human tissues {{as a result of}} alternative splicing of exon 11. This event is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. To date, there is little information about the relative abundance <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> receptor protein isoforms on the cell surface. The aim of the present investigation was to assess whether the tissue-specific expression <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> insulin receptor mRNA species is paralleled by a similar pattern of expression <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> receptor protein isoforms. To this end, we assessed the relative distribution <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> receptor variants in various human tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. A PCR-based technique was used to measure the relative abundance <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> mRNA species, and two immunological assays were used to measure the relative steady-state expression <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> receptor protein isoforms. The expression <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> insulin receptor protein isoforms followed the tissue-specific pattern of expression <b>of</b> the <b>two</b> mRNA species...|$|R
