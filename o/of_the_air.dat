Raised to air marshal, he took up the position of Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Staff in January 1954, and was knighted a year later. During his tenure in the RAAF's senior role, McCauley focused on potential deployments to Southeast Asia—particularly Vietnam—and threats from the north, commencing redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin and recommending purchase of a light supersonic bomber to replace the Air Force's English Electric Canberra. After retiring from military life in March 1957, he chaired various community and welfare organisations, serving as Federal President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force Association for ten years.

5|$|The Deputy Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Staff at the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Bostock was considered a leading candidate for the position of Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Staff in 1942 but was passed over in favour of Air Commodore George Jones, a friend of twenty years. Appointed Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command soon after, Bostock became involved in a bitter and long-running dispute with Jones over control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force in the South West Pacific. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a journalist and later a Federal Member of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Deputy Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Staff {{position}} that Bostock occupied at {{the outbreak of}} World War II was a new one that initially augmented, and later supplanted, an existing Assistant Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Staff role. Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy {{had the authority to}} act in place of the Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Staff (CAS) if required. This increased status saw Bostock given a place on Australia's Joint Planning Committee. He was the RAAF's delegate to a defence conference in Singapore in October 1940, where the Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese, and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period, becoming acting air commodore on 1June 1940 and substantive air vice marshal on 1October 1941. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 New Year Honours.|$|E
