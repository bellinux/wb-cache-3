5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from {{the far side of the}} river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 4S {{can play}} music, movies, {{television}} shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone 4S uses a large font that allows users plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling {{is achieved by}} swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls {{can be used to}} pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.|$|E

While {{in favor of}} the One Laptop per Child initiative for providing education to children in the developing world at a cheaper rate, he has pointed out that a $2,000 library can serve 400 children, costing just $5 a child to bring access {{to a wide range of}} books in the local languages (such as Khmer or Nepali) and English; also, a $10,000 school can serve 400–500 children ($20–$25 a child). According to Wood, these are more appropriate solutions for education in the dense forests of Vietnam or rural Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|After the war, the Macks {{wanted to}} expand the seating {{capacity}} again, in a park that was running out <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> expand into. In 1949, they proposed erecting the ultimate spite fence: a new double-deck seating section in right field that would boost the park's capacity to 50,000. The {{problem was that the}} home plate-to-right field axis was the shorter dimension of the Shibe block rectangle, and since the new stand could not intrude into the play area, its fascia would {{have to be in the}} plane of the existing right field fence while its hindquarters would have to protrude out back, dangling some 15 feet above the west sidewalk of North 20th Street and forming a covered arcade walkway. The $2.5-million proposal galvanized the 20th Street neighbors against the A's again, and this time the legal team could not overcome the zoning issues.|$|E

[...] Channing Freeman from Sputnikmusic praised Cyrus' vocals, writing, [...] "the chorus is so good, with a pulsing beat that allows Miley plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> show off her voice (which is and always has been lovely)" [...] although criticized the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{called the}} song a [...] "perfect kickoff to {{the career of}} Justin Bieber", noting the song had an effect of a younger Chris Brown, commended the {{production}} of The-Dream and Tricky Stewart for making the single contemporary and commercial. However Lamb criticized the song for being too [...] "generic", and that Bieber had little room to show his voice. Billboards Michael Menachem called the song [...] "a hallmark pop song that also taps into a prevalent teen hip-hop aesthetic". He also compared Bieber to Brown on the track, and said that [...] " [...] tenor brings to mind [...] vocal debut on [...] "Run It!" [...] in 2005, when he, too, was 15 and {{on the cusp of}} stardom". Unlike Lamb, Menachem said the song gave Bieber's vocals plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> shine as he confidently breaks into the chorus. Leah Greenblat of Entertainment Weekly named the song one of the hottest songs of fall of 2009, saying that Bieber's [...] "pop-soul bonafides with this refreshingly age-appropriate chronicle of young love." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Andy Battaglia {{felt that}} [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] gave the album an [...] "opening charge {{by way of}} a raucous marching-band beat and panting {{attempts}} to squeeze a lot of words into closing musical corners". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as [...] "fantastic, legs-in-the-air". Paul Flynn of the same publication wrote that it [...] "further relegated the other members of Destiny's Child to the position of Beyoncé's backing singers". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media who complimented Jerkins's [...] "incredible" [...] drum programming and the [...] "mind-boggling" [...] backing track felt that it lacked a tune: [...] "The vocals are too breathy, too whiny, and too processed, and the song's one thrilling moment-- near the end, where the harmonies get a bit <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> play off each other with ABBA-esque rococo aplomb-- lasts only for a second." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols deemed its production [...] "nifty" [...] with a [...] "rat-a-tat drum line percussion propelling" [...] but felt that it contained a single hook expanded into an entire song. Lindsey Weber from Vulture criticized Williams' contribution to the bridge, describing it as [...] "weak".|$|E
500|$|The Ice Warriors were a {{well-known}} villain {{of the original}} Doctor Who series. They appeared alongside the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in The Ice Warriors (1967) and The Seeds of Death (1969) and returned in the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) stories The Curse of Peladon (1972) and The Monster of Peladon (1974). Showrunner Steven Moffat had originally been hesitant {{to bring back the}} Ice Warriors, worrying that they were seen as [...] "the default condition for what people thought of as rubbish Doctor Who monsters— things that moved very, very slowly and spoke in a way that meant you couldn't hear a word they said." [...] Writer Mark Gatiss, however, was a fan of the Ice Warriors' stories and had been campaigning to bring them back. In a phone conversation with Moffat that was originally supposed to be about their show Sherlock, Gatiss pitched new and [...] "very clever ideas" [...] {{of what to do with}} the Ice Warriors, and Moffat agreed. What sold Moffat were the submarine setting and seeing what the Ice Warriors looked like underneath their suits. Gatiss felt that the Ice Warriors had a lot of gaps in their timeline and had not been featured in a while, which allowed a lot <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> explore them.|$|E

500|$|... "Nothin' on You" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Billboards Evan J. Nabavian gave the song a 4 out of 5 starts, denoting that the song explores the swell appeal [...] "between Mars' delicately delivered melodies and B.o.B.'s Southern twang." [...] He {{compared it to}} Lupe Fiasco's duet with Matthew Santos' [...] "Superstar" [...] (2007), [...] "especially its feel-good, singalong hook". The review concluded with positive feedback for the recording's lyrics and references. The same rating was give by Nick Levine of Digital Spy. He called the track a [...] "smash" [...] and praised its piano and hook. Levine concluded that although it doesn't show the same class as [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) by Jay Z and Alicia Keys, [...] "it's all so goddamn catchy you'd be a fool to give a hoot." [...] Lee Tyler from Blues & Souls awarded the single 8 out of 10 stars, calling it a [...] "delight" [...] from its beginning until the end. He said [...] "Whilst not being content to just please the ear... seems to laden with instant charisma, stopping only to refresh the parts others cannot reach of late". Tyler opined that it wouldn't surprise him if Gym Class Heroes sang the track, [...] "is sweet in it's up lifting melody, while giving the rapper plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> flex his prowess." [...] Richard of DJBooth enhanced the way B.o.B. [...] "drops lovestruck bars as agile as they are flattering," [...] and the [...] "silky-smooth bridge and chorus" [...] Mars uses to seduce [...] "the woman in question". Angus Batey thought the song would have stuck out in 2010, even without B.o.B's verses, since is a clear departure from the [...] "in-the-club, eyeing-up-the-booty cliches {{that have come to}} pass for romance in hip-hop".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] an A-, and wrote, [...] "Irreverent camp that's infested with laughs (and creepy-crawlies) but throws credibility out the window." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A and {{compared it to}} the previously Morgan-penned [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", writing, [...] "So! This is the second Darin Morgan episode I've had to write about, and once again, I'm not sure I've done it justice. [...] The comedy here can be broad, but there's always enough self-aware commentary buried in it that it never becomes simplistic. While [...] "Bruckman" [...] dealt with the misery of knowing all the answers, [...] "Coprophages" [...] looks at {{how easy it is}} to convince yourself you know what's going on, even when you don't. It'd be better to believe in a bunch of bugs from outer space coming down to earth to mess with our minds, than it would be to accept the more likely truth that bugs like shit—and around here, there's always plenty to go around." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode an 8/10 and praised the episode's self-parodying style, saying, [...] "Overall, this episode was a rare self-contained parody, well written by Darin Morgan. By standing on its own outside of continuity, the episode gives itself plenty <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> send-up the series premise and its early internet fandom. There’s no real sense of resolution, but that’s really incidental to the point of the parody." [...] Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his second favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files.|$|E

Maury Chaykin has doubtless immersed himself in the Wolfe novels, for he brings to his interpretation of the part both a detailed knowledge of what Stout wrote and an unexpectedly personal touch of insight. He plays Wolfe as a fearful genius, an aesthete turned hermit who has withdrawn from the world (and from the opposite sex) in order to shield himself — against what?

2500|$|Two {{major reasons}} were {{the impetus for}} the {{construction}} of the Hutt Valley Branch between Petone and Waterloo: first, the Petone Workshops had reached the end of their useful life; second, with increasing traffic demands on the line between Petone and Haywards and the lack <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> double-track the line on its existing route meant a new main line had to be built. [...] The line was surveyed between 1924 and 1925, with a short industrial branch leaving the Hutt Valley Branch at Woburn to serve the new Hutt Workshops. [...] On 26 May 1927 the rails reached Waterloo, which was then in the middle of open fields.
