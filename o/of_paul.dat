The two passages each describe the experience <b>of</b> <b>Paul's</b> traveling companions during the revelation, with Acts 9:7 (the author's description of the event) stating that Paul's traveling companions heard the voice that spoke to him; and Acts 22:9 (the author's quotation <b>of</b> <b>Paul's</b> own words) traditionally stating they did not.|$|R

40|$|The {{issue as}} to what {{constitutes}} the "heart of Pauline theology" is a contentious one in academic debates. The traditional view is the one fostered by the Reformers and perpetuated by generations of Protestants namely that "justification by faith" {{is the key to}} Paul's theology. Unfortunately, upon careful reading <b>of</b> <b>Paul's</b> letters, the inadequacy of such a view becomes apparent as such a focus would fail to cast the net broadly enough to capture all <b>of</b> <b>Paul's</b> theological concerns. In saying this and without denying the presence of other determining factors, especially Christology and eschatology, shape the framework <b>of</b> <b>Paul's</b> pneumatology. There is no doubt that in their eschatological significance, the death and resurrection <b>of</b> Christ control <b>Paul's</b> teaching on the work of the Spirit within the lives of believers. It could then be argued that as part of the fundamental core <b>of</b> <b>Paul's</b> understanding <b>of</b> the Gospel, the Spirit is rather close to the centre of things...|$|R
