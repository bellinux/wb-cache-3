5|$|The {{entirety}} of Pacific City may be explored {{from the start}} of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city. Once a supply point is unlocked, the player has the <b>option</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> there to travel to any other supply point, restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently add them to their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down.|$|E

They demanded that Israel recognize the right of all refugees who so wished to settle in Israel, but to address Israel's demographic concerns, they promised that the right of return would be implemented via a mechanism agreed upon by both sides, which would try to channel a majority of refugees away from the <b>option</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> to Israel. According to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, some of the Palestinian negotiators were willing to privately discuss a limit {{on the number of}} refugees who would be allowed to return to Israel.

These refugees numbered approximately 711,000 to 725,000 at the time. Today, they and their descendants number about four million, comprising about half the Palestinian people. Since that time, the Palestinians have demanded full implementation of the right of return, meaning that each refugee would be granted the <b>option</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> to his or her home, with property restored, and receive compensation. Israelis asserted that allowing a right of return to Israel proper, rather than to the newly created Palestinian state, would mean an influx of Palestinians that would fundamentally alter the demographics of Israel, jeopardizing Israel's Jewish character and its existence as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of the new lighthouse and signal station in 1968, the 1896 Caloundra Head Lighthouse had been threatened with demolition. To save the structure it was moved in 1970 by the Golden Beach Power Boat Club to Woorim Park, adjacent to their new clubhouse site, where it was hoped it could continue as a tourist attraction. Some {{attempts were made to}} conserve the exterior, but, over the decades, continued deterioration and lack of a viable use for the structure meant that its future was threatened again. Several options for relocating the lighthouse were put forward, however the closure of the Caloundra Signal Station in 1992 meant that the <b>option</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> the 1896 lighthouse to its original position on Canberra Terrace became a possibility. After years of lobbying, especially by the Lions Club of Caloundra, and a $50,000 grant from the Caloundra City Council, an attempt to re-locate the lighthouse on 22 March 1999 saw the timber frame give way when the lighthouse was being positioned on a truck. After repairs, the lighthouse was successfully re-positioned on its original site in Canberra Terrace on 11 June 1999. The tower and lantern were restored, including strengthening of the timber structure, replacement and repairs to the cladding, repair of the lantern roof and repainting of the exterior. In late 2007 the Friends of the Caloundra Lighthouses was formed to assist in the conservation of both lights, which were leased to the Sunshine Coast Regional Council in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Njegoš's {{writings}} {{have received}} {{varying degrees of}} scholarly and critical attention since his death. Some studies {{have been written about}} Luča mikrokozma, though very little has been written about Lažni car Šćepan mali, which Djilas believes contains some of Njegoš's finest verse. Of all Njegoš's writings, the one that {{has been the subject of}} most scholarly analysis is Gorski vijenac, which virtually all critics regard as his finest work. It is also his most famous, having been reprinted more than 120 times between 1847 and 1996. By 1913, Gorski vijenac had been translated into ten different languages. It has been translated into English twice– once by James W. Wiles, in 1930, and the second time by Vasa D. Mihailovich, in 1986. Set in the early 1700s, the epic revolves around Njegoš's ancestor, vladika Danilo, as he ponders what to do with the Montenegrins who have converted to Islam amid increasing Ottoman encroachment. Danilo knows that every Montenegrin has a responsibility towards his family and towards his clan, for to kill a fellow Montenegrin would elicit a blood feud, but he also realizes that each man has a duty towards his faith and towards his nation, and that these two strains of responsibility are completely irreconcilable. Ultimately, the Montenegrin Christians give their Muslim kin the <b>option</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> to Christianity or facing death. On Christmas Day, those that refuse to comply are killed and their villages burned. In light of its subject matter, Gorski vijenac became a source of considerable controversy during and after the Yugoslav Wars, when critics began to re-examine the text within the context of the conflicts' many atrocities. Judah goes as far as to call it a [...] "paean to ethnic cleansing". He writes: [...] "In the wake of another Balkan War, its significance is that of a missing link. It helps explain how the Serbian national consciousness has been molded and how ideas of national liberation became inextricably intertwined with killing your neighbour and burning his village." [...] Some scholars have even claimed that the epic is based on a historical massacre from the late 17th century. Djilas notes that no such event is mentioned in an authoritative history of Montenegro that was written by Danilo's successor, Vasilije, and published in 1756. Thus, Djilas concludes that the Christmas Day massacre is either entirely fictional or that the elimination of Montenegrin Muslims occurred in stages over a long period of time, as opposed to a single atrocity eradicating them all. Srdja Pavlović contends that the massacre is a conflation of two historical events– the widespread conversion of Montenegrins to Islam in 1485 and the expulsion of the Medojević family from Montenegro in 1704, following a property dispute. There is no scholarly consensus as to whether the Christmas Day massacre ever occurred.|$|E

One <b>of</b> the <b>options</b> <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> these territories back {{to be of}} avail is creation of favorable conditions for safe reuse of contaminated lands by means of culturing the nonfood market oriented products. Relatively high biomass yield of the short rotation willow varieties allows suggesting this crop {{to be used as}} a renewable resource of local fuel. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate feasibility of culture of the fast growing willow plantations in contaminated lands. The study includes assessments of environmental constrains and economical effects. A number of field tests of Salix viminalis were can%d out in Belarus. Two types of soil, peaty and sandy, were examined. In addition to investigation of some parameters important for biomass-to-energy conversion, i. e. growing conditions and yield, the study was focused on accumulation ability of the given variety in extracting radionuclides from contaminated soil. Taking into account he obtained data on the soil-to-plant 137 Cs transfer factor for willow wood, this crop may not be applicable as a fuel if its biomass is extracted from the area of contamination of higher than 740 kBq/m 2 (approx. 20 Ci/km 2).

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{concludes that}} options are mispriced {{based on the}} high average returns, CAPM alphas, and Sharpe ratios of various put selling strategies. One criticism of these conclusions is that these benchmarks are ill suited to handle the extreme statistical nature <b>of</b> <b>option</b> <b>returns</b> generated by nonlinear payoffs.
