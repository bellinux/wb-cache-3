It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the conquest}} of central Vietnam by the Viet and the decline and {{eventual}} fall of Champa, the Mỹ Sơn complex fell into disuse and was largely forgotten. It was rediscovered in 1898 by the Frenchman M. C. Paris. A year later, members of the scholarly society called École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO) began to study the inscriptions, architecture, and art <b>of</b> <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn.</b> In 1904, they published their initial findings {{in the journal of}} the society called Bulletin de l'École française d'Extrême Orient (BEFEO). Henri Parmentier gave a description of the ruins at Mỹ Sơn, and M. L. Finot published the inscriptions that had been found there.|$|E
25|$|Indrapura ("City of Indra") was {{the capital}} of Champa from about 875 to about 1000. It was located {{at the site of}} the modern village of Dong Duong, near the modern city of Da Nang. Also in the region of Da Nang are the ancient Cham city of Singhapura ("City of the Lion"), the {{location}} of which has been identified with an archaeological site in the modern village of Trà Kiệu, and the valley <b>of</b> <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn,</b> where a number of ruined temples and towers can still be viewed. The associated port was at modern Hội An. The territory once controlled by this principality included present-day Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị, and Thừa Thiên–Huế provinces.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the extant}} temples at Mỹ Sơn, {{such as the}} Isanabhadresvara, {{were built in the}} 10th century AD. Unfortunately, the {{inscriptions}} from this period have not survived, except in fragmentary form. At the beginning of the 10th century, the Cham center of power was at Đồng Dương, not far from Mỹ Sơn. By the end of the century, it had been displaced southward to Bình Định Province on account of military setbacks in wars with the Viet. However, Cham kings continued periodically to renovate the temples at Mỹ Sơn and even to build new foundations. The latest significant Cham record at Mỹ Sơn is a pillar inscription of King Jaya Indravarman V dated 1243 AD. By the early 15th century, the Cham had lost their northernmost lands, including the area <b>of</b> <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn,</b> to the Viet.|$|E

25|$|The {{historic}} {{territory of}} Champa roughly equals the South Central Coast region, {{although it has}} at times extended well into the North Central Coast and its influence also extended into the Central Highlands. Except for its first capital, all of Champa's political centers were located in the South Central Coast. Some of the earlier capitals, {{as well as the}} religious center <b>of</b> <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn</b> and the port city of Hội An were located in the territory of present-day Quảng Nam Province. Probably due to defeats in wars against Đại Việt the political center shifted further south to Vijaya in what is now Bình Định Province. After the fall of Vijaya to Vietnam in 1471, Champa had to retreat to the southern principality of Panduranga (now at Phan Rang in Ninh Thuận Province), while much of occupied Champa continued to exist as a sort of protectorate within Vietnam for some time.|$|E

500|$|After Shishakli {{came into}} {{conflict}} with the Ba'athists that year {{as a result of}} the former's authoritarian manner of governance, Atrash moved to Homs, a hotbed of opposition to Shishakli's rule, where he helped coordinate the supply of arms to insurgents in Jabal al-Druze. He was arrested by the authorities for a second time in May, during the peak of the unrest. He had been released both times because of his father's popularity at the national level; by releasing Atrash, Shishakli attempted to gain the appeasement of Sultan. In response to Atrash's second release from prison, Sultan said [...] "I didn't ask Shishakli for the freedom <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>son.</b> I asked him for the freedom of my country." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1937, news {{surfaced}} {{that the}} widow {{and father of}} Erik Storm {{filed a lawsuit against}} the Norwegian Air Lines. The father, Major B. Storm, stated that his goal was [...] "rehabilitation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>son</b> as well as compensation". The family had received [...] of insurance money, but reportedly wanted more, and also desired to have the airline take the responsibility for the accident. The family sent a formal petition to the Parliament of Norway asking for further accident investigation, but after acquiring statements from the Chief of Police of Sogn and the Riksadvokaten and cycling the case through Ministry of Defence, the Parliament declared that no action should be taken. In addition, the lawsuit was dropped, after the airline reached an [...] "agreement" [...] with Storm's family, and had a letter publicly printed in which Storm was cleared of all responsibility for the accident.|$|E
500|$|In late 1594, {{she began}} a furious {{campaign}} for custody of Henry, recruiting a faction of supporters to her cause, including the chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane. Nervous of the lengths to which Anne might go, James formally charged Mar in writing never to surrender Henry to anyone except on orders {{from his own}} mouth, [...] "because in the surety <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>son</b> consists my surety", nor to yield Henry to the Queen even {{in the event of}} his own death. Anne demanded the matter be referred to the Council, but James would not hear of it. After public scenes in which James reduced her to rage and tears over the issue, Anne became so bitterly upset that in July 1595 she suffered a miscarriage. Thereafter, she outwardly abandoned her campaign, but it was thought permanent damage had been done to the marriage. In August 1595, John Colville wrote: [...] "There is nothing but lurking hatred disguised with cunning dissimulation betwixt the King and the Queen, each intending by slight to overcome the other." [...] Nevertheless, the Queen had six more children by James.|$|E

500|$|Ebrey {{states that}} {{meritocracy}} {{and a greater}} sense of social mobility were also prevalent in the civil service examination system, as the government held a list of all examination graduates, showing that only roughly half of those who passed had a father, or grandfather, or great-grandfather who served as a government official. However, Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes state that this fact, first presented by Edward A. Kracke in 1947 and supported by Sudō Yoshiyuki and Ho Ping-ti, emphasizes the role of the nuclear family and only demonstrates three paternal ascendants of the candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, {{and the role of the}} extended family. Male children with fathers who were incumbents in office had the advantage of early education and experience, as they were often appointed by their father to low-level staff positions. Yet with the so-called 'protection' (yin or yin-bu 荫补/蔭補) privilege this arrangement was extended to close relatives, as an elder brother, uncle, father-in-law, and even father-in-law to one's uncle could help one secure a future in office. The Song era poet Su Shi (1037–1101) wrote a poem called On the Birth <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Son,</b> poking fun at the situation of children from affluent and politically connected backgrounds having the upper edge over bright children of lower status: ...|$|E
