5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains <b>of</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason). Quatermass theorises {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened; megalithic sites such as prehistoric stone circles are in fact markers where beacons have been left by the alien force for its next visit. Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering. When they are attacked, Annie drives their car into the underground car park beneath the stadium where she crashes the vehicle and is killed. The lightning strikes the stadium.|$|E
40|$|Background: Vertigo is not {{a disease}} but {{a symptom of a}} disease. Vertigo causes by the {{disturbance}} in the Vestibular system. In the <b>elderly</b> <b>people’s</b> case, the decrease of the vestibular system can cause balance disturbance. It happens because the changes of the progressive fragmentation of statoconia utricle and saccule which cause the reduction <b>of</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>people’s</b> response toward the gravity acceleration and make them fall. The symptoms of vertigo can be measured by vertigo symptom scale- short form (VSS- FS) in which if the total score is e”= 20 {{it can be said that}} it is vertigo positive. Research purposes: to know the relation between vertigo and the fall history <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> in Surakarta Research benefit: to be able to know the relation between vertigo and the fall history <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> in Surakarta. Research method: this research is an observational research with cross sectional approach. The sampling technique used is simple random sampling with 71 samples to find out the relation between vertigo and the fall history <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> <b>people.</b> The measurement <b>of</b> vertigo uses Vertigo Symptom Scale- short form (VSS-SF) by summing up the score in every number whereas the measurement of the fall history uses Wilhan research questionnaire, 2009 by identifying the fall history. The correlation test uses Chi Square test with 95 % degree of confident. Research findings: Based on Chi-Square test, it is known that p-value score is 0, 001 < 0, 005 so H 0 is declined and Hα is accepted.

The main purpose of this thesis work {{is to find out}} the needs <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> and design appropriate technological solution for the <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> addressing those needs using User Centered Design Approach. Various data collection methods such as semi-structured thematic interviews, observation and diary method were utilized to collect user needs. Then user data were consolidated using affinity diagram and the needs were classified using Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Based on the user studies and the literature review of existing technologies, the need for social technology was figured out and the design phase involved the development of Social TV prototype. The design process was iterative in terms of creating scenarios and storyboards as well as User Environment Design to attain simplicity in design. Then the mid-fidelity prototype of social TV named ElderTV was developed to demonstrate the concept. The evaluation of the prototype was conducted utilizing sociability heuristics for social TV where the designed prototype was compared against each heuristics rules and these rules served as design guidelines during the design phase of the prototype. The resulted social TV concept for <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> is designed to address elderly peoples’ needs to strengthen the existing social ties. The concept is expected to extend TV viewing activity <b>of</b> the <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> into shared experience by allowing them to communicate with a circle of friends and families.

25|$|Neprilysin-deficient {{knockout}} mice show both Alzheimer's-like behavioral {{impairment and}} amyloid-beta deposition in the brain, providing strong {{evidence for the}} protein's association with the Alzheimer's disease process. Because neprilysin {{is thought to be}} the rate-limiting step in amyloid beta degradation, it has been considered a potential therapeutic target; compounds such as the peptide hormone somatostatin have been identified that increase the enzyme's activity level. One hypothesis for the strong dependence of Alzheimer's incidence on age focuses on the declining production of somatostatin in the brains <b>of</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>people,</b> which thus depresses the activity of neprilysin and promotes aggregation of unprocessed amyloid beta. Declining neprilysin activity with increasing age may also be explained by oxidative damage, known to be a causative factor in Alzheimer's disease; higher levels of inappropriately oxidized neprilysin have been found in Alzheimer's patients compared to cognitively normal elderly people.|$|E

The playwright had intended her to open the play on Broadway, but Lawrence's husband thought it was too British for the American market.

25|$|The {{protests against}} the Oresharski cabinet were {{supported}} by 60 percent of Bulgarians, according to a poll by the independent Alpha Research {{for the month of}} November. Research conducted by the Sofia Open Society Institute (analyzing the political situation in the country {{over the course of the}} June and July months) reveals that the most active participants in the protests tended to be young (aged below 30 years), were based in the capital Sofia, leaned to the centre-right or right of the political spectrum and possessed a higher than average income. The middle class social stratum from Sofia has been singled out as constituting a core of the protest. Similarly, Leviev-Sawyer believes that even during its short escalation phase in late July 2013, the demonstrations retained features of protests typical of the middle class. A generational gap as well as an urban-rural divide have been a feature of the public reactions to the demonstrations, with those residing in non-urban areas and aged over 60 on the whole significantly less supportive of the protests. Goranova identifies the primacy of economic over political concerns due to poverty, the presence of remnants of feudalist structures in the smaller cities and villages (causing a certain built-in reluctance to protest due to fears of job losses), the significant proportion <b>of</b> <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> (who have a natural aversion to instability) and the lack of sufficient trust in the youth as some of the reasons for the lacking protest activities outside the major cities. In addition, members of ethnic minority groups were generally not as favorably disposed to the protests, with this finding especially applicable to ethnic Turks and Romani people who typically declared a lesser willingness to participate in demonstrations in comparison to ethnic Bulgarians. Confederation of Labour Podkrepa president Konstantin Trenchev, in an August 2013 interview, did not call for national strike action against the government, but cautioned that conditions may become ripe for resorting to such activities at some point in the autumn.
