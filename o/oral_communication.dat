40|$|This is an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} effects of the oral and written informative communication on sex and sexuality. The experiment was conducted at SMA in Bandung, the first class students being the experiment subjects. From the population (340 students), 78 students were picked up at random. The subjects were divided at random into three groups: the "oral" group (the listening group), the "written" group (the reading group), and the control group. Tests were given to the first group and the second group before and after the treatment, while test I and test II were given to the control group. The experiment aimed to test the following hypothesis: (1) There is {{a significant difference between the}} oral group and written group in their average knowledge on sex and sexuality; (2) There is a Significant difference between the male group and the female group exposed to both <b>oral</b> informative <b>communication</b> and written informative communication in their average knowledge on sex and sexuality; (3) There is a significant difference between the malegroup and the female group exposed to the <b>oral</b> informative <b>communication,</b> and between the male group and the female group exposed to the written informative communication in their average knowledge on sex and sexuality; (4) There is a significant difference between the male group exposed to the <b>oral</b> informative <b>communication</b> and the male group exposed to the written informative communication, and between the female group exposed to the <b>oral</b> informative <b>communication</b> and the female group exposed to the written informative communication in their average knowledge on sex and sexuality. Having been analyzed by the t and t 2 ̆ 7 tests, it was found that the second hypothesis was not accepted, while the others were accepted. It was also found that: (1) The <b>oral</b> informative <b>communication</b> was more effective than the written informative <b>communication.</b> (2) The <b>oral</b> informative <b>communication</b> was more effective on the male group, and the written informative communication was more effective on the female group...|$|R

I collected data to see how emphasizing <b>oral</b> and written <b>communication</b> affected small-group work, usage of precise mathematical vocabulary, and student attitudes toward mathematics. <b>Oral</b> and written <b>communication</b> allowed students to periodically evaluate their own learning and their involvement in math class. I discovered {{that the vast majority}} of students enjoyed working in small groups, and when they got to work in small groups, they felt more confident in their solutions to problems. Data on the use of precise mathematical vocabulary showed increased student awareness in the importance of its usage. Student attitudes toward mathematics remained positive, and students grew more confident in their mathematical skills throughout the research. As a result of this research, I plan to continue the use of small-group work, provide instruction in precise mathematical vocabulary, and emphasize <b>oral</b> and written <b>communication</b> strategies...|$|R
25|$|The {{university}} requires {{students to}} have completed 12 general education requirements in order to graduate, with some exceptions depending on the school. These include courses in aesthetics, global inter-dependencies, humanities, laboratory science, composition and <b>oral</b> <b>communication,</b> mathematics, physical activity and wellness, social science and U.S. pluralism. Individual schools within the University have additional requirements. Students in Harpur College must complete a minimum of 126 credits to graduate. Most classes at Binghamton are worth four credits, rather than the more usual three. The typical undergraduate's course load thus consists of four courses (for 16 credits) rather than the usual five (for 15 credits).|$|E
25|$|Biliteracy: The {{state of}} being literate in two or more languages. To be biliterate has a {{stronger}} and more specified connotation than the claim of being simply bilingual. This is because with the change of the term from 'lingual' to 'literate' {{and the concept of}} reading and writing, which are in addition to simply speaking. In bilingualism the extent of fluency in each language is in question. One can be anywhere on the spectrum from comfortable <b>oral</b> <b>communication</b> in certain social contexts to fluency in speaking, reading and writing. With the term biliteracy, however, it is understood that fluency in both reading and writing are present.|$|E
25|$|Course {{distribution}} requirements were abolished in the 1970s, {{but were}} reinstated by a faculty majority vote in 1981, {{as a result}} of an initiative by <b>oral</b> <b>communication</b> and film professor Barbara Kaster. She insisted that distribution requirements would ensure students a more well-rounded education in a diversity of fields and therefore present them with more career possibilities. The requirements of at least two courses in each of the categories of Natural Sciences/Mathematics, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Humanities/Fine Arts, and Foreign Studies (including languages) took effect for the Class of 1987 and have been gradually amended since then. Current requirements require one course each in: Natural Sciences, Quantitative Reasoning, Visual and Performing Arts, International Perspectives and Exploring Social Differences. A small writing-intensive course, called a First Year Seminar, is also required.|$|E

2500|$|Engineering {{notation}} (often named [...] "ENG" [...] {{display mode}} on scientific calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation {{in that the}} exponent n is restricted to multiples of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of m is in the range 1 ≤ |m| < 1000, rather than 1 ≤ |m| < 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding SI prefixes, which facilitates reading and <b>oral</b> <b>communication.</b> For example, [...] {{can be read as}} [...] "twelve-point-five nanometers" [...] and written as , while its scientific notation equivalent [...] would likely be read out as [...] "one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight meters".|$|E

[...] The helper must hand the builder the tools he or she may need, which requires effective <b>oral</b> <b>communication.</b> [...] The builder succeeds by requesting tools from the assistant by usually using single word utterances, such as 'hammer' or 'nail'. [...] Thus, when the helper hands the tool to the builder, the game incorporates action with language, a key therapy technique. [...] The assistant would then hand the builder the requested tool. [...] Success of the game occurs when the builder's requests are specific to ensure successful building.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extent and}} the impact of writing are disputed. Historian Anthony Reid argues that {{literacy}} was pervasive even on a popular level, especially for women. On the other hand, Stephen C. Druce contends that writing was restricted to the high elite. William Cummings has asserted that writing, by being perceived as more authoritative and supernaturally potent than <b>oral</b> <b>communication,</b> wrought profound social changes among the Makassar. These included a new stress on detailed genealogies and other forms of continuities between the past and present, a more stringently enforced social hierarchy centered on the divine descent attributed to nobility, the emergence and codification of the concept of a Makassar culture, and the [...] "centralizing of Gowa" [...] by which connections to Gowa became the greatest source of legitimacy for regional Makassar polities. Cumming's arguments have been contested by historians such as Ian Caldwell, who argues that authority derived from the spoken word more so than literacy and that histories from other Makassar areas reject a Gowa-centered view of legitimacy.|$|E
2500|$|Stuttering, {{also known}} as stammering, is a speech {{disorder}} in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The term stuttering is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by people who stutter as blocks, and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually vowels or semivowels. According to Watkins et al., stuttering is a disorder of [...] "selection, initiation, and execution of motor sequences necessary for fluent speech production." [...] For many people who stutter, repetition is the primary problem. The term [...] "stuttering" [...] covers {{a wide range of}} severity, encompassing barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe symptoms that effectively prevent <b>oral</b> <b>communication.</b> In the world, approximately four times as many men as women stutter, encompassing 70 million people worldwide, or about 1% of the world's population.|$|E
2500|$|External and {{internal}} {{factors have been}} attributed to the decline of Igbo language usage. Preference for the English language in post-colonial Nigeria has usurped the Igbo language’s role and function in society, as English is perceived by Igbo speakers as the language of status and opportunity. This perception may be a contributor to the negative attitude towards the Igbo language by its speakers across the spectrum of socio-economic classes. [...] Igbo children’s reduced competence and performance has been attributed in part to the lack of exposure in the home environment, which impacts intergenerational transmission of the language. English is the official language in Nigeria and is utilized in government administration, educational institutions, and commerce. Aside from its role in numerous facets of daily life in Nigeria, globalization exerts pressure to utilize English as a universal standard language in support of economic and technological advancement. A 2005 study by Igboanusi and Peter demonstrated the preferential attitude towards English over the Igbo language amongst Igbo people in the communication, entertainment, and media domains. English was preferred by Igbo speakers at 56.5% for <b>oral</b> <b>communication,</b> 91.5% for written communication, 55.5-59.5% in entertainment, and 73.5-83.5% for media.|$|E
