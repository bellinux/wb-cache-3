5|$|According to the American Academy <b>of</b> <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates <b>of</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the topic of low civic <b>and</b> {{political}} participation <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> youth in the Czech Republic. Participatory democracy theory and theory of civil society are used as starting values. The work deals mainly with organized civic <b>and</b> political participation <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> youth. It is shown, based on several international studies, that in comparison with other states the civic and political participation <b>of</b> Czech <b>children</b> <b>and</b> youth is <b>of</b> the significantly lower level. Area of youth participation falls within the national policy on youth and therefore this work describes basic public-policy documents {{that are related to}} the topic <b>of</b> participation <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> youth.

25|$|DSPD often {{coordinates}} and collaborates {{with other}} state agencies {{to provide care}} for recipients of ID/RC HCBS waiver serves. Perhaps the strongest inter-agency partnership exists between the Division and the Division <b>of</b> <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> Family Services. These two state agencies often work together on crossover issues regarding their two respective populations. The most common crossover issue involves children who have experienced traumatic abuse or neglect and demonstrate extreme behavioral issues. Unfortunately, victims of acute abuse and neglect also experience significant developmental delays and thus qualify for services. In cases where these children have no other family or guardians, DSPD steps in to provide long-term care. Often, the child remains in the custody and guardianship <b>of</b> <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> Family Services. Division and Child and Family Services staff work closely together in these cases to ensure that services are administered appropriately and {{that the child is}} safe and healthy.|$|E

25|$|Child and {{adolescent}} psychiatry sometimes uses specific manuals {{in addition to}} the DSM and ICD. The Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC:0-3) was first published in 1994 by Zero to Three to classify mental health and developmental disorders in the first four years of life. It has been published in 9 languages. The Research Diagnostic criteria-Preschool Age (RDC-PA) was developed between 2000 and 2002 by a task force of independent investigators with the goal of developing clearly specified diagnostic criteria to facilitate research on psychopathology in this age group. The French Classification <b>of</b> <b>Child</b> <b>and</b> Adolescent Mental Disorders (CFTMEA), operational since 1983, is the classification of reference for French child psychiatrists.|$|E

40|$|Crime <b>and</b> {{offending}} by <b>children</b> <b>and</b> {{young people}} has received attention in political, academic and media rhetoric for decades.

The Transforming Youth Custody report found 50 per cent <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people aged 15 - 17 years-old were entering custody with literacy levels the equivalent <b>of</b> <b>children</b> aged 7 - 11 years-old. From the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people entering custody, 18 per cent had statements of special educational needs and 36 per cent of young men ceased attending school at 14 years-old.

Placing the series in Salt Lake City, the international headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is enough to blur the line between the modern Church and the program's subject matter, and to reinforce old and long-outdated stereotypes.
