Alternatively, an <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavenger</b> (e.g. iron(II) salts, tin(II) salts, or organometallic compounds) can be added to the polymer formulation, reacting with the oxygen present in the polymer matrix in shorter timeframe than the hydrolysis of the blocked leuco dye takes.|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} that the {{hydroxyl}} radical scavengers sodium benzoate, phenol, dimethyl sulfoxide, sodium formate, and mannitol protect chicken erythrocyte (Ec) target cells from lysis by K-cells in plaque assays. The protection afforded by benzoate, phenol, mannitol, and dimethyl sulfoxide was abrogated if the target cells were pretreated with sodium chromate. Neither superoxide dismutase nor catalase protected Ec target cells, indicating that superoxide and H 2 O 2 are not involved in lysis. The lysis obtained on chromium-treated Ec target cells in the presence of benzoate, phenol, and mannitol is likely due to singlet oxygen, because 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane and bilirubin, singlet <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavengers,</b> protected chromium-treated Ec target cells in the presence of phenol.

40|$|Exposure to visible-light {{causes the}} {{photoinactivation}} of certain bacteria {{by a process}} that is believed to involve the photo-stimulation of endogenous intracellular porphyrins. Studies with some bacterial species have reported that this process is oxygen-dependent. This study examines the role of oxygen in the visible-light inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus. Suspensions of S. aureus were exposed to broadband visible-light under both oxygen depletion and oxygen enhancement conditions to determine whether these environmental modifications had any effect on the staphylococcal inactivation rate. Oxygen enhancement was achieved by flowing oxygen over the surface of the bacterial sample during light inactivation and results demonstrated an increased rate of staphylococcal inactivation, with approximately 3. 5 times less specific dose being required for inactivation compared to that for a non-enhanced control. Oxygen depletion, achieved through the addition of <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavengers</b> to the S. aureus suspension, further demonstrated the essential role of oxygen in the light inactivation process, with significantly reduced staphylococcal inactivation being observed in the presence of <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavengers.</b> The {{results of the present study}} demonstrate that the presence of oxygen is important for the visible-light inactivation of S. aureus, thus providing supporting evidence that the nature of the mechanism occurring within the visible-light-exposed staphylococci is photodynamic inactivation through the photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins...|$|R
50|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>scavengers</b> or <b>oxygen</b> {{absorbers}} help remove oxygen from {{a closed}} package.

This is usually done by dosing alkaline agents into the feed water, such as sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) or ammonia. Corrosion in boilers is due to the presence of dissolved oxygen, dissolved carbon dioxide, or dissolved salts.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} shear rate and oxygen injury during {{atomization}} {{and the combination}} of these factors on the survival of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris in spray drying was studied using laboratory and pilot scale spray dryers. The atomization was carried out using a two-fluid nozzle in the laboratory study and a two-fluid nozzle or rotary atomizer in the pilot scale study. The extent of oxygen-induced death was determined using ascorbic acid in the feed and atomizing the feed with gaseous nitrogen. The lowest levels of bacterial death were observed at lowest characteristic shear rate and in the presence of nitrogen and ascorbic acid. Quantitative analysis showed that lower shear rate, creating an oxygen-limiting environment during atomization and drying, and using <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavengers</b> in the feed were successful in enhancing bacterial survival in spray drying. We also report for the first time that, at least for L lactis, the extent of death during the atomization stage far outweighs death during the drying stage, and that the majority of bacterial death (up to 93 %) occurs during the atomization stage. The death of bacteria was found to be less when using a rotary atomizer or when using a two-fluid nozzle atomizer at lower flow rate. This work shows that bacterial death during spray drying can be minimized by using <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavengers</b> such as ascorbic acid and/or an anaerobic atomizing medium (such as nitrogen), and by altering the spraying conditions.

50|$|It is {{probable}} that {{in the presence of}} molecular oxygen and {{as a direct result of}} the photoirradiation of the photosensitiser molecule, both Type-I and II pathways play a pivotal role in disrupting cellular mechanisms and cellular structure. Nevertheless, considerable evidence suggests that the Type-II photo-oxygenation process predominates in the induction of cell damage, a consequence of the interaction between the irradiated photosensitiser and molecular oxygen. Cells in vivo may be partially protected against the effects of photodynamic therapy by the presence of singlet <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavengers</b> (such as histidine). Certain skin cells are somewhat resistant to PDT in the absence of molecular oxygen; further supporting the proposal that the Type-II process is at the heart of photoinitiated cell death.|$|R

50|$|A {{significant}} {{development in}} the field of gel dosimetry occurred when results of using an alternative polymer gel dosimeter formulation were published by Fong et al in 2001. This new type of polymer gel dosimeter, known as MAGIC gel, bound atmospheric oxygen in a metallo-organic complex thus removing the problem of oxygen inhibition and enabling polymer gels to be manufactured on the bench-top in the laboratory. This created what was to be known as a normoxic gel dosimeter, compared with the previous PAG formulation which subsequently became known as a hypoxic gel dosimeter. The MAGIC polymer gel formulation consisted of methacrylic acid, ascorbic acid, gelatine and copper. The principal behind the MAGIC gel is in the ascorbic acid <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavenger.</b> Ascorbic acid binds free oxygen contained within the aqueous gelatine matrix into metallo-organic complexes and this process is initiated by copper sulphate. It was subsequently shown by De Deene et al in 2002 that other antioxidants could be used in the manufacture of normoxic gels including tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride, having first been suggested to Baldock by Billingham in 1996. Numerous authors subsequently published results of work investigating different compositions and formulations of normoxic polymer gel dosimeters and were summarised by Senden. Other work has also included the development of less toxic polymer gels.|$|E
40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>scavengers</b> {{are used}} in active {{packages}} to protect the food against deteriorative oxidation processes. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} possibilities to produce oxygen-scavenging packaging materials based on oxygen-reducing enzymes. The enzymes were incorporated into a dispersion coating formulation applied onto a food-packaging board using conventional laboratory coating techniques. Various enzymes were used: a glucose oxidase, an oxalate oxidase and three laccases originating from different organisms. All of the enzymes were successfully incorporated into a coating layer and could be reactivated after drying. For {{at least two of the}} enzymes, re-activation was possible not only by using liquid water but also by using water vapour. Re-activation of the glucose oxidase and a laccase required relative humidities of greater than 75 % and greater than 92 %, respectively. Catalytic reduction of oxygen gas by glucose oxidase was promoted by creating an open structure through addition of clay to the coating at a level above the critical pigment volume concentration. Migration of the enzyme and the substrate was reduced by adding an extrusion-coated liner of polypropylene on top of the coating. For the laccase-catalysed reduction of oxygen it was possible to use lignin derivatives as substrates for the enzymatic reaction. The laccase-catalysed reaction created a polymeric network by cross-linking of lignin-based entities, which resulted in increased stiffness and increased water-resistance of biopolymer films. The laccases were also investigated with regard to their potential to function as <b>oxygen</b> <b>scavengers</b> at low temperatures. At 7 °C all three laccases retained more than 20 % of the activity they had at room temperature (25 °C), which suggests that the system is also useful for packaging of refrigerated food...|$|R
