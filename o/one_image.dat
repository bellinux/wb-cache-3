5|$|Along {{with other}} family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived {{together}} {{off and on}} for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F. Ellet. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland. Only <b>one</b> <b>image</b> of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.|$|E
5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. <b>One</b> <b>image</b> was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E

5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from <b>one</b> <b>image</b> to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} of binocular rivalry dealt more with how it occurs than why it occurs. Dutour {{speculated that the}} alternations could be controlled by attention, a theory promoted {{in the nineteenth century}} by Hermann von Helmholtz. But Dutour also speculated that the alternations could be controlled by structural properties of the images (such as by temporary fluctuations in the blur of <b>one</b> <b>image,</b> or temporary fluctuations in the luminance of <b>one</b> <b>image).</b> This theory was promoted in the nineteenth century by Helmholtz's traditional rival, Ewald Hering.|$|E
25|$|When <b>one</b> <b>image</b> is {{presented}} to one eye and a very different image {{is presented}} to the other (also known as dichoptic presentation), instead of the two images being seen superimposed, <b>one</b> <b>image</b> is seen for a few moments, then the other, then the first, and so on, randomly {{for as long as}} one cares to look. For example, if a set of vertical lines {{is presented to}} one eye, and a set of horizontal lines to the same region of the retina of the other, sometimes the vertical lines are seen with no trace of the horizontal lines, and sometimes the horizontal lines are seen with no trace of the vertical lines.|$|E

25|$|A literal {{term for}} SSTV is {{narrowband}} television. Analog broadcast television requires at least 6MHz wide channels, because it transmits 25 or 30 picture {{frames per second}} (in the NTSC, PAL or SECAM color systems), but SSTV usually only takes up {{to a maximum of}} 3kHz of bandwidth. It is a much slower method of still picture transmission, usually taking from about eight seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the mode used, to transmit <b>one</b> <b>image</b> frame.|$|E

Binocular rivalry occurs between any stimuli that differ sufficiently, including simple stimuli like lines of different orientation and complex stimuli like different alphabetic letters or different pictures such as of a face and of a house.|$|E
25|$|The fee plugs {{which had}} aired {{in the middle}} of the show on the CBS version were {{featured}} during the closing credits. The ticket plugs were now shown on every episode.

25|$|With the {{overthrow}} of classical perspective and its implicit staticity quasi-complete, the new concept of mobile perspective, first propounded by Metzinger in his 1910 publication Note sur la peinture, implied explicitly the dynamism of motion within multiple-spatial dimensions. In the article Metzinger notes the similarities between Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, stressing the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, with Metzinger flanked between, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in <b>one</b> <b>image,</b> each recording varying experiences {{over the course of}} time.|$|E

25|$|Because Gaspra's {{position}} was only known to within about 200km before the encounter, and the camera's {{field of view}} was only about 5° across, Galileo would not know where to point to capture images of the asteroid once it was closer than 70,000km. This would render the encounter not very interesting scientifically. To overcome this problem, a pioneering optical navigation campaign was implemented by the Galileo spacecraft team to reduce the uncertainty of Gaspra's position using images captured during the approach to Gaspra. This was spectacularly successful and allowed the spacecraft to obtain images from as close as 5300km. At this closest range, the pointing was still not known quite accurately enough, but the camera actually took a 51 image mosaic so as to capture Gaspra on at least <b>one</b> <b>image.</b> Similar optical navigation techniques have been used on all spacecraft flybys of asteroids since.|$|E
