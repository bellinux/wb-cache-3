50|$|In {{addition}} to its use as a fertilizer, potassium chloride is important in many industrialized economies, where it is used in aluminium recycling, by the chloralkali industry to produce potassium hydroxide, in metal electroplating, oil-well drilling fluid, snow and ice melting, steel heat-treating, in medicine {{as a treatment for}} hypokalemia, and water softening. Potassium hydroxide is used for industrial water treatment and is the precursor of potassium carbonate, several forms of potassium phosphate, many <b>other</b> <b>potassic</b> chemicals, and soap manufacturing. Potassium carbonate is used to produce animal feed supplements, cement, fire extinguishers, food products, photographic chemicals, and textiles. It is also used in brewing beer, pharmaceutical preparations, and as a catalyst for synthetic rubber manufacturing. These non-fertilizer uses have accounted for about 15% of annual potash consumption in the United States.|$|R
40|$|A Field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Agricultural Research Station, Bhavanisagar, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, India on Typic Ustrothent with cotton cultivar MCU- 7 during 1998 - 99 {{to find out the}} influence of nitrogenous fertilizer rates, phosphorous and potash fertilizers and plant growth regulator i. e. chlormequatchloride on growth, yield and quality of cotton. The treatments consisted of three nitrogen rates (60, 80 and 100 kg ha) along with phosphorous and potassic fertilizers and two chlormequatchloride formulations (50 % AS, 30 mL ha, 50 % AS, 60 mL ha, 10 % AS, 150 mL ha and 10 % AS, 300 mL ha were the four levels). The field {{experiment was}} laid out in split plot design with three replications. The spraying of the chlormequatchloride was done during flowering phase of cotton viz., 60, 70, 80 and 90 days after sowing. Adopting all the recommended package of practices the crop was grown to maturity and harvested. The results showed that the height of the cotton plant was markedly increased with graded doses of N and reduced to the chlormequatchloride treatments. There was profuse vegetative growth of the test crop of MCU- 7 cotton at 100 kg of N ha. With reference to the yield attributes, chlormequatchloride sprayed in two formulations (chlormequatchloride 50 % AS, 30 mL ha x 4 applications at 60, 70, 80, 90 days interval and 10 % AS, 150 mL ha x 4 applications at 60, 70, 80, 90 days interval) and with increased N rates had produced more number of monopodia, sympodia and bolls as compared to control that did not receive chlormequatchloride. The boll weight was also profoundly increased.

40|$|Zeolite N, an EDI type {{framework}} structure with ideal chemical formula K 12 Al 10 Si 10 O 40 Cl 2 • 5 H 2 O, was produced from kaolin between 100 oC and 200 oC in a continuously stirred reactor using potassic and potassic+sodic liquors containing {{a range of}} anions. Reactions using liquors such as KOH, KOH + KX (where X = F, Cl, Br, I, NO 3, NO 2), K 2 X (where X=CO 3), KOH + NaCl or NaOH + KCl were complete (> 95 % product) {{in less than two}} hours depending on the batch composition and temperature of reaction. With KOH and KCl in the reaction mixture and H 2 O/Al 2 O 3 ~ 49, zeolite N was formed over a range of concentrations (1 M < [KOH] < 18 M) and reaction times (0. 5 h < t < 60 h). At higher temperatures or higher KOH molarity, <b>other</b> <b>potassic</b> phases such as kalsilite or kaliophyllite formed. In general, temperature and KOH molarity defined the extent of zeolite N formation under these conditions. The introduction of sodic reagents to the starting mixture or use of one potassic reagent in the starting mixture reduced the stability field for zeolite N formation. Zeolite N was also formed using zeolite 4 A as a source of Al and Si albeit for longer reaction times at a particular temperature when compared with kaolin as the source material...|$|R
40|$|Located at the {{volcanic}} {{front in the}} western Mexican arc, in the Colima Rift, is the active Volcán Colima, which lies on {{the southern end of}} the massive (∼ 450  km 3) Colima-Nevado volcanic complex. Along the margins of this andesitic volcanic complex, is a group of 11 scoria cones and associated lavas, which have been dated by the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method. Nine scoria cones erupted ∼ 1. 3  km 3 of alkaline magma (basanite, leucite-basanite, minette) between 450 and 60  ka, with > 99 % between 240 and 60  ka. Two additional cones (both the oldest and calc-alkaline) erupted < 0. 003  km 3 of basalt (0. 5  Ma) and < 0. 003  km 3 of basaltic andesite (1. 2  Ma), respectively. Cone and lava volumes were estimated with the aid of digital elevation models (DEMs). The eruption rate for these scoria cones and their associated lavas over the last 1. 2  Myr is ∼ 1. 2  km 3 /Myr, which is more than 400 times smaller than that from the andesitic Colima-Nevado edifice. In addition to these alkaline Colima cones, two <b>other</b> <b>potassic</b> basalts erupted at {{the volcanic}} front, but ∼ 200  km to the ESE (near the historically active Volcán Jorullo), and were dated at 1. 06 and 0. 10  Ma.

40|$|The Harrington Peak Quadrangle {{is located}} within the Caribou National Forest of {{southeast}} Idaho. Within this quadrangle are outcrops of olivine trachyte of Pliocene(?) age overlying sedimentary rocks of Mississippian to Tertiary age. The region contains thrust faults and later normal faults (generally trending north-south} formed during Basin and Range extension. The Largest outcrop of olivine trachyte (approximately 1 1 / 2 X 3 km) probably formed {{as the result of}} a fissure eruption. Two other outcrop areas show evidence of being sites of local extrusion. Whole-rock chemical analyses revealed the olivine trachyte to have moderate amounts of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, high MgO and CaO, and K 2 O in excess over Na 2 O (approximately 2 : 1). Mineralogical characteristics include microphenocrysts of Mg-rich olivine and diopsidic augite in a groundmass of Ba-rich sanidine, diopsidic augite, Fe-Ti oxides, and less commonly phlogopite and/or plagioclase. The olivine trachyte closely resembles the ciminites from the Viterbo region of Italy and has some petrological and mineralogical similarities to many <b>other</b> continental <b>potassic</b> volcanic rocks. The olivine trachyte may have formed by partial melting of a heterogenous mica peridotite mantle source enriched in incompatible elements during a previous tectonic event...|$|R
40|$|Diamonds {{have been}} {{discovered}} {{in a variety of}} potassic ultramafic rocks including group-I and group-II kimberlites, olivine lamproites and aillikites, all of which are macroscopically similar and can be difficult to differentiate when viewed under the microscope. However, group-I kimberlites, and to a much lesser extent group-II kimberlites and olivine lamproites, are known to contain economic concentrations of diamonds. This study addresses the problem of distinguishing among different types of kimberlitic and related rocks by developing a geochemically-based method for classifying them. Geochemical methods have been largely ignored in the classification of kimberlites and related rock types due to high concentrations of xenoliths. However, this problem can be largely overcome by only selecting matrix material for analysis. An evolving kimberlitic magma will become enriched or improvished in Si due to the fractionation of olivine and phlogopite, depending on the initial Si concentration of the magma. As they have low Si concentrations, group-I kimberlites and aillikites can be separated from group-II kimberlites and meimechites, which have higher Si concentrations for any Mg content. Furthermore, since aillikites and meimechites are relatively rich in Fe compared to group-I and group-II kimberlites, these rock types form four separate fields on a Si vs. Fe discrimination diagram. Similar rock-type separation is observed when the ratio of La to Yb is plotted against the ratio of Sm to Yb. Kimberlite and <b>other</b> <b>potassic</b> ultramafic rocks were sampled from nine areas in Quebec: the Otish Mountains, Wemindji, Torngat Mountains, Desmaraisville, Temiscamingue, Ile Bizard, Lac Leclair, Baie James and Ayer's Cliff regions. Major and selected trace element concentrations were determined by XRF analysis for all samples, while a subset of representative samples was selected for trace element analysis by ICP-MS. Electron microprobe analyses of unaltered olivine and phlogopite were also conducted. Of the 37 samples that were classified both mineralogically and chemically, 23 or 62 % were correctly classified using Fe and Si. This number increases to 84 %, if the REE are used in conjunction with Si and Fe. The Si vs. Fe discrimination diagram separates group-I kimberlite from most aillikite and meimechite rocks and group-II kimberlite/olivine lamproite rocks from most aillikite and meimechite rocks. Therefore, major and trace element geochemistry offers an important tool for the classification of kimberlitic rocks. Vasilenko et al. (2002) and Francis (2003) both suggested that diamond grades can be correlated with the major element compositions of the kimberlites. The data collected in this study confirm the inverse relationship between TiO 2 concentration and diamond grade. The lowest TiO 2 values were obtained on samples from the Otish Mountains and Renard samples in particular. Other areas of Quebec are characterized by higher TiO 2 contents with most samples containing greater than 2 wt% TiO 2. Therefore, the kimberlitic rocks from the Renard locality have the greatest potential for an economic diamond deposit. The origin of this correlation needs to be explored, however, because it is unclear whether this is a feature of the mantle source, or reflects the survivability of diamonds within the kimberlites...|$|R
40|$|Lamproite volcanoes are {{uncommon}} in the geological record but are exceptionally well {{preserved in the}} Betic Cordilleras of SE Spain, where they erupted during the Late Miocene (Tortonian to Messinian stages). The parent melts {{are thought to have}} been channelled through major lithospheric faults to erupt at or near the faulted margins of Neogene sedimentary basins. Lamproite magmas are thought to be relatively CO 2 -poor (< 1 wt %) and are typically characterised by an effusive eruption style and the development of lava lakes and scoria cones. Cabezo María is a relatively small (∼ 550 m diameter) lamproite volcano that was emplaced within the shallow-water marine-influenced Vera Basin. The lamproites are compositionally {{similar to those of the}} Roman Province and generally less potassic (K 2 O< 5 wt%) than <b>other</b> (ultra-) <b>potassic</b> rocks in SE Spain (e. g. Cancarix, Fortuna). The initial eruption stages were dominated by explosive magma-water interactions and the formation of peperites. These are characterised by angular fragments of glassy lamproite lavas (and isolated lobes) incorporated in sediments, locally showing the effects of thermal metamorphism. Further, elutriation pipes and ‘jigsaw-fit’ textures are observed in the peperites. The lavas and peperites are overlain by outward-dipping well-stratified scoria deposits defining part of a cinder cone, which is inferred to have emerged above sea level. Steep internal contacts with inward-dipping, structureless breccias likely represent the inner wall deposits of a central conduit. The deposits are cross-cut by late-stage dykes, which supplied fissure eruptions of geochemically similar lavas capping the scoria cone. The transition from explosive to effusive behaviour may reflect the decreased availability of water, possibly due to downward migration of the feeder conduit below the level of water-saturated sediments...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative {{petrographic}} {{study of}} selected clastic horizons within the Eocene section of Hole 516 F has revealed {{the presence of}} abundant fine-grained lithic fragments, probably volcanic, along with coarser fragments of quartz and feldspar apparently derived from a nearby plutonic terrain. In detail, poor sorting, presence of graded bedding, and an abundance of clay suggest these are turbidite horizons locally derived from a mixed volcanic/plutonic terrain, possibly with some direct contribution from contemporary volcanic ash falls. A progressive increase in plutonic versus volcanic components with time is, however, more consistent with an erosional origin {{for most of this}} material. Unusual euhedral dark biotite is abundant in several of the lower clastic horizons; it is most easily interpreted as microphenocrysts weathered in situ out of alkalic volcanic ash. Biotite separated from Sample 516 F- 76 - 4, 107 - 115 cm, has been dated by the K-Ar method at about 46 Ma. Alkaline volcanoes active on the Rio Grande Rise in the middle Eocene would be the most probable source of this ash and would be consistent with <b>other</b> evidence for <b>potassic,</b> alkaline volcanism along the Rio Grande Rise and at the Tristan da Cunha hot spot...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEarth's {{continental}} {{crust is}} dominantly made of buoyant, felsic igneous material (granitoids), that were ultimately {{extracted from the}} mantle {{as a result of}} Earth's differentiation. Since felsic melts are not in chemical equilibrium with the mantle, they can originate either from melting of older crustal lithologies, or from differentiation of a primitive mantle melt; only the latter case will contribute to crustal growth. To understand the mechanisms of continental crust growth and differentiation through time, it is therefore necessary to unravel the respective contribution of these two different mechanisms in the genesis of granitoid suites. In modern Earth, granitoids are chiefly generated in convergent plate boundaries (subduction and collision). This paper examines the granitic suites in a late-collision environment, the Variscan French Massif Central (FMC), and compares them with the suites found in an oceanic arc. We therefore describe, and compare, two end-members sites of granite generation. In the FMC, several main types of granites are described. Muscovite and Cordierite bearing Peraluminous Granites (resp. MPG and CPG) contain large amounts of inherited zircons, and their chemistry demonstrates that their sources were older crustal material (resp. Metasediments and metaigneous). On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>Potassic</b> Calc-alkaline Granites (KCG), associated to potassic diorites (vaugnerites) do not contain inherited zircons, and ultimately derive from the vaugnerites. The vaugnerites in turns form by partial melting of a mantle contaminated by the regional crust. Therefore, although they are isotopically similar to the crust, the KCG are net contributors to crustal growth. Thus we conclude that although late-orogenic settings are dominated by crustal melting and recycling, they may be sites of net crustal growth, even though this is not visible from isotopes only. In contrast, arc granitoids are purely or almost purely mantle derived. However, the preservation potential of arcs is much smaller than the preservation of late-orogenic domains, such that at the scale of a whole orogenic belt, late-orogenic magmatism is probably as important as arc magmatism. Finally, we speculate that the situation may have been similar in the Archaean, or even more skewed towards late-orogenic sites (or similar environments, dominated by melting of a altered mafic protocrust), owing to the hotter mantle and less stable subductions during that period...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The Mount Fubilan Intrusion {{is part of}} a geologically young hypabyssal {{stock in}} the Star Mountains of Papua New Guinea. This stock was mapped as the Ok Tedi Intrusive Complex and divided into four {{separate}} bodies: the Mount Fubilan, Sydney Intrusion, Kalgoorlie, and Ningi Intrusions. Hydrothermal fluids caused alteration of the Mount Fubilan, and parts of the <b>other</b> intrusions, to <b>potassic</b> and propylitic mineral assemblages and deposited gold and copper. This investigation documents similarities and differences between the least-altered intrusive rocks of the complex and those that have undergone potassic metasomatism. The study involved detailed petrographic examination of more than two hundred thin-sections, major-oxide and trace element chemistry, and microprobe analyses of individual minerals. The magmas that crystallized to form the stock are shown to be intermediate in composition between andesite and latite. They were quartz-saturated, metaluminous, weakly iron-rich, and crystallized under oxidizing conditions. The principal mineral phases in the least-altered intrusive rocks are andesine, pyroxene, orthoclase, and quartz. The accessory mineral suite in least-altered rocks includes biotite, sphene, apatite, magnetite, and zircon. Hornblende is present in a few samples Magmatic pyroxene is diopsidic in composition; hornblendes is cdenitic; and biotite is annitic. Potassic alteration has converted andesine to orthoclase, or mixtures of albite and orthoclase, ferro magnesian minerals to hydrothermal biotite, sphene to rutile, and magnetite to pyrite and chalcopyrite. Hydrothermal biotite is phlogopitic in composition. Gold and copper were concentrated in the zone of potassic alteration. The mineralogical transformation of the intrusive rocks of the Mount Fubilan and associated intrusions was caused by the infiltration of hydrothermal fluids that deposited potassium, gold, and copper and that leached and removed virtually all other rock constituents. Leached components were transported away from the zone of potassic alteration and deposited in peripheral parts of the intrusive complex to form propylites, endoskarn, and massive replacement bodies or removed from the system entirely. The Mount Fubilan intrusion was closely similar in chemistry and mineralogy to the other intrusions of the complex prior to alteration. Petrochemical differences between the Mount Fubilan Intrusion and the other intrusions were produced entirely by hydrothermal alteration...|$|R
