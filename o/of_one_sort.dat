5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E
25|$|Many Christians {{support their}} churches and pastors with {{monetary}} contributions <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another. Frequently these monetary contributions are called tithes – {{whether or not}} they actually represent ten percent of anything. Some claim that as tithing was an ingrained Jewish custom by the time of Jesus, but no specific command to tithe appears in the New Testament.|$|E

25|$|All {{the major}} {{continental}} European railways used 0-6-0s <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another, though usually {{not in the}} proportions used in the United Kingdom. As in the United States, European 0-6-0 locomotives were largely restricted to switching and station pilot duties, though they were also widely used on short branch lines to haul passenger and freight trains. On most branch lines, though, larger and more powerful tank engines tended to be favoured.|$|E
25|$|The {{cycle and}} motor {{manufacturing}} industries brought into existence {{a wide variety}} of subsidiary trades. Most notably these were general engineering, metal casting, drop forging, chain-making and the manufacture of instruments and gauges, machine tools, and all types of electrical equipment. The manufacture of aircraft, aero engines and related equipment also took place in Coventry as early as 1916, and during World War II the aircraft industry dwarfed all other local industries. With the outbreak of war many of the motor firms switched to aircraft work, and the whole of Coventry's industrial skills and resources turned to war production <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, marine {{forensic}} investigators {{considered that}} {{an explosion in}} the ship's steam-generating plant could be a plausible explanation for the second explosion. However, accounts from the few survivors who managed to escape the forward two boiler rooms reported that the ship's boilers did not explode. Leading Fireman Albert Martin later testified he thought the torpedo actually entered the boiler room and exploded between a group of boilers, which was a physical impossibility. It is also known the forward boiler room filled with steam, and steam pressure feeding the turbines dropped dramatically following the second explosion. These point toward a failure, <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another, in the ship's steam-generating plant. It is possible the failure came, not directly from one of the boilers in boiler room no. 1, but rather in the high-pressure steam lines to the turbines.|$|E

25|$|The {{first flight}} of the N-9M {{occurred}} on 27 December 1942 with Northrop test pilot John Myers at the controls. During the next five months, 45 flights were made. Nearly all were terminated by mechanical failures <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another, the Menasco engines being {{the primary source of}} those problems. After roughly 22.5 hours of accumulated flight time, the first N-9M crashed approximately 12miles (19km) west of Muroc Army Air Base on 19 May 1943. The pilot, Max Constant, was killed as he attempted to recover the aircraft from a right-hand, 60° nose-down spin. The investigation found that Constant had suffered control reversal, the control column had been pressed against his chest during his recovery attempt from the steep spin, preventing him from parachuting to safety. Steps were taken to fix this problem and prevent it from happening on other N-9M test aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The restorers, by {{assuming}} that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made {{that all of the}} shadowy layer of animal glue and [...] "lamp black", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts and painted definition by later restorers in attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted [...] "buon fresco" [...] would remain.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, Sinatra's {{career was}} {{facilitated}} by developments in technology. As disc jockey Jonathan Schwartz said, [...] "Never before {{had there been}} {{an opportunity for a}} popular singer to express emotions at an extended length". In the words of author John Lahr, [...] "as many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme". Santopietro writes that through the 1950s, well into the 1960s, [...] "every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art".|$|E

500|$|Films noir tend {{to revolve}} around heroes {{who are more}} flawed and morally {{questionable}} than the norm, often fall guys <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as [...] "alienated"; {{in the words of}} Silver and Ward, [...] "filled with existential bitterness". Certain archetypal characters appear in many films noir—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking is rampant. From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: Laura, The Killers, The Naked City, and Touch of Evil.|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it.

60|$|In {{the face}} of these facts, it does not seem easy to aver that <b>one</b> kind <b>of</b> age, <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> 'culture' is more {{favourable}} to the occurrence of, or belief in, these phenomena than another. Accidental circumstances, an increase, or a decrease of knowledge and education, an access of religion, or of irreligion, a fashion in intellectual temperament, may bring these experiences more into notice at one moment than at another, but they are always said to recur, at uncertain intervals, and are always essentially the same.|$|R

2500|$|For example, amābit, [...] "he (or she or it) will love", {{is formed}} {{from the same}} stem, amā-, to which a future tense marker, -bi-, is suffixed, and a third person {{singular}} marker, -t, is suffixed. There is an inherent ambiguity: -t may denote more than one grammatical category: masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. A major task in understanding Latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context. All natural languages contain ambiguities <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another.|$|E
2500|$|Composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono, Milton Babbitt, Charles Wuorinen and Jean Barraqué used serial {{techniques}} <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> {{or another}} in most of their music. [...] Other composers such as Béla Bartók, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten, John Cage, Aaron Copland, Olivier Messiaen, Arvo Pärt, Walter Piston, Ned Rorem, Alfred Schnittke, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Igor Stravinsky used serialism only for some of their compositions or only for some sections of pieces, as did some jazz composers such as Yusef Lateef and Bill Evans.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas {{collaborated with}} Arnold Foster, a pupil of Vaughan Williams, {{on a set}} of {{arrangements}} of twelve Manx songs, published by Stainer & Bell in 1928.

Further to the 36 songs published in these collections, a number of further songs remained unpublished during her lifetime. However, from the total of 46 songs that Douglas claimed to have collected, it has been comprehensively argued that 21 of these were [...] "composed songs <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>sort</b> or another" [...] that originated with Douglas herself.|$|E
