5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) and half a dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> raining down on them.|$|E
5|$|After {{five days}} and {{multiple}} attempts to rescue Hambleton, five aircraft {{had been shot}} down and another 16 seriously damaged, 10 service members had been killed or were missing in action, two were POWs, and two were behind front lines also waiting to be rescued. On April 8, Gen. Creighton Abrams was briefed on the high losses in the several failed attempts to rescue Hambleton and Clark. He ordered that no further air CSAR would be attempted, but that given Hambleton's Top Secret clearance and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> and counter-measure technology, that every effort {{should be made to}} bring him out.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in {{the side}} of a disused chalk quarry, the most {{prominent}} feature of the complex is an immense concrete dome, to which its modern name refers. It was built above a network of tunnels housing storage areas, launch facilities and crew quarters. The facility was designed to store a large stockpile of V-2s, warheads and fuel and was intended to launch V-2s on an industrial scale. Dozens <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> a day were to be fuelled, prepared and launched in rapid sequence against London and southern England.|$|E
50|$|Variants <b>of</b> the <b>missile</b> {{have been}} {{designated}} 3M80M, 3M82 (Moskit M). The P-270 designation {{is believed to}} be the initial product codename for the class <b>of</b> <b>missile,</b> with the Russian Ministry of Defense GRAU indices (starting with 3M) designating the exact variant <b>of</b> the <b>missile.</b> The 3M80 was its original model. The 3M80M model (also termed 3M80E for export) was a 1984 longer range version <b>of</b> the <b>missile,</b> with the latest version with the longest range being the 3M82 Moskit M. The ASM-MSS / Kh-41 variant is the 1993 air-launched version <b>of</b> the <b>missile.</b>|$|R

5|$|Once the fleets {{were close}} enough, exchanges <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> began, ranging from {{combustible}} projectiles to arrows and javelins. The aim {{was not to}} sink ships, but to deplete {{the ranks of the}} enemy crews before the boarding actions, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Zeus had {{initially}} been proposed {{in an era}} when ICBMs were extremely expensive and the Soviet fleet was thought to contain a few dozen missiles. At a time when the US deterrent fleet was based entirely on manned bombers, even a small number <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> aimed at Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bases presented a serious threat. Two Zeus deployment plans were outlined. One was a heavy defensive system that would provide protection over the entire continental United States, but require as many as 7000 Zeus missiles. McNamara supported a much lighter system that would use only 1200 missiles.|$|E
5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did have hundreds <b>of</b> <b>missiles,</b> they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} a favourable omen {{during the night}} Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions {{into a state of}} dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in a barrage <b>of</b> <b>missiles.</b> Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, weapons, and maneuverability. Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. Weapons are categorized into three different types: primary weapons, secondary weapons, and countermeasures. Primary weapons {{range from a}} variety of laser weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream of burning fuel. Secondary weapons include different types <b>of</b> <b>missiles,</b> while countermeasures range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary weapons consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary weapons and countermeasures require their own ammunition suppliers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the U.S. Army started to {{formulate}} {{requirements for the}} replacement of its helicopters then in service, {{which resulted in the}} launch of the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program. Nearly a decade later, following the refinement of requirements, evaluation of submissions, and the rebranding of the programme as the Light Helicopter (LX) program, during April 1991, the Army announced the selection of the Boeing–Sikorsky team's design as the contest winner, shortly after which a contract for construction of prototypes was awarded. The Comanche was to incorporate several advanced elements, such as stealth technologies, and a number of previously untried design features. Operationally, it was to employ advanced sensors in its reconnaissance role, where it was intended to designate targets for the AH-64 Apache. It was also armed with a single Gatling gun and a limited number <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> and rockets for light attack duties.|$|E

5|$|His {{research}} and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted {{the government to}} initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crores for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a step {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. The proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers <b>of</b> <b>missiles,</b> such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|Samus Aran is {{typically}} seen wearing the Power Suit, a powered exoskeleton which protects her from most dangers she encounters {{and can be}} enhanced by power-ups collected during gameplay. In regard to offense, the Power Suit boasts the Arm Cannon, which can fire various energy beams, charge beams to shoot an extra-powerful blast, or launch a limited number <b>of</b> <b>missiles.</b> The Power Suit can also be reconfigured into a small, spherical form called the Morph Ball, which allows her to roll through tight areas, such as tunnels, and use Bombs. The Power Suit is also equipped with a Grapple Beam, {{which can be used}} to tether onto objects to cross large distances, such as chasms. Additionally, its visor can be used to scan objects to learn more about them, a feature that has been used since Metroid Prime. Aside from her Power Suit, Samus is also in possession of a Gunship, which is used in the games to save progress and restore her health and ammunition.|$|E

5|$|The JF-17 has a {{defensive}} aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite {{housed in a}} fairing {{at the tip of}} the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors <b>of</b> <b>missiles</b> across a 360-degree coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Westland Apache {{experienced}} {{delays in}} entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development problems were noted, including {{a lack of}} the ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a risk of damage to the tail rotor and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing <b>of</b> <b>missiles,</b> both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike the body of the aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These problems were corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire missiles are routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that full operational capability was set to be achieved by 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{strategic}} threat changed dramatically during the period that Zeus was being developed. Originally expected to face only a few dozen ICBMs, a nationwide defense was feasible, although expensive. In 1957, growing fears of a Soviet sneak attack led it to be repositioned {{as a way to}} protect Strategic Air Command's bomber bases, ensuring a retaliatory strike force would survive. But when the Soviets claimed to be building hundreds <b>of</b> <b>missiles,</b> the US faced the problem of building enough Zeus missiles to match them. The Air Force suggested they close this missile gap by building more ICBMs of their own instead. Adding to the debate, a number of technical problems emerged that suggested Zeus would have little capability against any sort of sophisticated attack.|$|E
