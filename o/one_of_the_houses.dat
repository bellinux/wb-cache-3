5|$|During Keyser's lordship, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales listed Adminston as a {{possible}} name for the village. On his death in 1929, his wife, Mary, continued to occupy the house until she died in 1938. The estate was auctioned off in September 1938, and many lots were purchased by their occupiers. The manor house was bought by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) for £16,000. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> in the village is recorded as having fetched £1,375. As AEI's chairman, Felix Pole became the de jure Lord of the Manor upon their purchase of Aldermaston Court.|$|E
5|$|Dyrham Park was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> {{used as a}} filming {{location}} for the 1993 Merchant Ivory film The Remains of the Day (others included Badminton House and Powderham Castle). The house was used for outdoor and garden scenes in the 1999 BBC mini-series Wives and Daughters. In 2003, it was the filming {{location for}} the BBC One series Servants. An aerial view of Dyrham Park was featured in the opening title sequence of the 2008 film Australia.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels for two nights to allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from inside <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses,</b> the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside {{the house in the}} same scene made use of one of the basements.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The {{story of how the}} robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} to Ball, {{along with his}} parents, and a sister who died in infancy, appears on the exterior wall of {{the southwest corner of}} Holy Trinity Church in Lenton. Another memorial tablet is present inside the same church, mounted on the north wall and bearing the RFC and RAF motto Per Ardua ad Astra, along with decorations of medals and royal arms. In 1967, the Albert Ball VC Scholarships were instituted at his alma mater, Trent College. A propeller from one of Ball's aircraft and the original cross from his grave in France are displayed at the college's library and chapel, respectively. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> at Nottingham High's Junior School is also named after Ball.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{development}} at this time consisted of new residential areas away from the old city centre. Queen Square was the first speculative development by John Wood, the Elder, who lived in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> The Circus consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give {{a clue to the}} design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. The most spectacular of Bath's terraces is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood. Gay Street links Queen Square to The Circus. All of which were designed by John Wood, the Elder in 1735 and completed by his son John Wood, the Younger.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the white}} stone mosque, one village mill, the village health center, {{and a few}} {{partially}} destroyed houses remain on the site. The mosque has {{been converted into a}} carpentry workshop and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> has been made into a chicken coop. The health center and grain mill are deserted, and the school is gone. The cemetery remains, but it is in a neglected state; the tomb of Yusuf al-Hamdan, a prominent nationalist who fell in the 1936 revolt, is clearly visible. The surrounding lands are planted with almond trees, wheat, and barley; they also contain animal sheds, a fodder plant, and a pump installed on the spring of 'Ayn al-Hajja. The site is tightly fenced in and entry is blocked.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} ripe for {{redevelopment}} by the landholding elite, {{who wished to}} have suitably grand townhouses to occupy while attending Parliament and the court. The vestiges of the Privy Garden became {{the site of a}} new street. In 1808 a row of houses called Whitehall Gardens was constructed on the site. Behind each house, long grassy gardens planted with rows of trees led directly down to the river, until they were cut off by the construction of the Victoria Embankment along the river bank between 1865 and 1870. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> between 1873 and 1875, while Sir Robert Peel lived in another (and died there in 1850 after falling from his horse on Constitution Hill). The trees outside the front entrance to Whitehall Gardens were the last survivors of the original Privy Garden, and stood until as recently as the late 1930s.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> in College Gardens fell vacant and was {{converted}} into a second preparatory department in 1950. It became known as Fullerton House, named after William Fullerton {{who had been a}} governor, Chair of the Board and founder of Downey House. Extensions to this were made to the adjacent house in 1957. The existing preparatory department, Downey House, also received extension works in 1954. In 1959 a boathouse for rowing was built at Lockview Road in Stranmillis whereas the college had relied on outside clubs.|$|E
25|$|Accommodations at {{the site}} consist of three {{lighthouse}} keeper's cottages, constructed from concrete blocks, set on high blocks with reinforced concrete beams. The cottages have timber floors and wide timber verandahs, enclosed with pivoting storm screens. The original roofing was corrugated galvanised iron, replaced by corrugated asbestos cement roofing in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> Originally, a breezeway divided the houses into two sections, one comprising three rooms and one comprising two larger rooms, with a corridor between them leading to the double doors to the verandah. The building has been altered, and the original breezeway has been converted to a living area.|$|E

25|$|John Fisher {{was born}} in Beverley, Yorkshire, in 1469, the eldest son of Robert Fisher, a {{modestly}} prosperous merchant of Beverley, and Agnes, his wife. He {{was one of four}} children. His father died when John was eight. His mother remarried and had five more children by her second husband, William White. Fisher seems to have had close contacts with his extended family all his life. Fisher's early education was probably received in the school attached to the collegiate church in his home town. He attended Beverley Grammar School, an old foundation claiming to date from the year 700. In the present day, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> at the school is named in Fisher's honour.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{the palace}} {{underwent}} major renovation of its facade. Over the years, the exterior had undergone various alterations, but the plasterwork as originally {{applied in the}} 1670s was largely intact. The roof was covered with tar shingles until the 19th century, when these were replaced with tin. The palace was restored in stages during the 1990s. The disposition of the rooms in the royal apartments was restored, and the 18th-century furnishings {{were placed in the}} correct context. One of the most important features of the restoration was the reproduction of the 1760s wallpaper, the original of which was found in isolation on an attic beam in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> on the estate. Old linen towels were transformed into royal wallpaper.|$|E
