A slimmer series 1-6 box set was released in 2010 in Region 2.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> the Grave was a British BBC {{television}} dark comedy sitcom series {{written by}} David Renwick. There were six series and seven Christmas specials over an eleven-year period, from early 1990 to late 2000. The first five series were broadcast between January 1990 and January 1995. For {{the next five}} years, the show appeared only as Christmas specials, followed by one final series in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Salmon {{agreed not}} to {{broadcast}} the episode at Christmas. It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000, forty minutes in length, rather than usual thirty. The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It! The <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>In</b> The Grave Story, a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which {{looked back at the}} hit sitcom. The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "foot" [...] {{was used}} in Middle English to mean [...] "a person" [...] (c. 1200).The {{expression}} [...] "...to put <b>one's</b> best <b>foot</b> foremost first recorded 1849 (Shakespeare has the better foot before, 1596)". The expression to [...] "...put <b>one's</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> (<b>one's)</b> mouth [...] "say something stupid" [...] was first used in 1942.

5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} <b>One</b> <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> the Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
5|$|The stones {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (<b>one</b> <b>foot)</b> <b>in</b> width, and 0.1 metres (4 inches) thick. The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived {{to the present}} were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common construction material for important structures and elite residences during that time period. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed {{in a similar manner}} using lime mortar, with most foundations no greater than <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> depth and filled with stones. Where foundations were used, they tended to be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and architraves that have been carved or inlaid with porcelain.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar could detect the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be seen, some <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|E

25|$|After {{giving up}} 34 {{unanswered}} points, Oakland {{finally managed to}} drive 82 yards down the field and score on a 39-yard touchdown pass from Gannon to receiver Jerry Porter.
