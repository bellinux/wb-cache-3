In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs till weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the <b>open</b> <b>terrain</b> of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves. Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other large mammals.|$|E

5|$|M. alcathoe has the highest-frequency {{echolocation}} call of any European Myotis. In <b>open</b> <b>terrain,</b> {{the call}} has an average duration of 2.5ms, {{but it may}} be up to 4ms long. At the beginning, its frequency is around 120kHz, but it then falls fast, subsequently falls slightly slower, and at the end falls faster again. The call reaches its highest amplitude at around 53kHz. It terminates at around 43 to 46kHz; this characteristic is especially distinctive. In different experiments, the time between calls was found to be around 85 and 66ms, respectively. The high-pitched call may be an adaptation to the animal's occurrence in dense vegetation.|$|E

5|$|A fossil {{discovered}} in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota may possibly be C.dirus; if so, this fossil {{is one of the}} earliest specimens on record. It was catalogued as Canis cf. C.dirus (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain). The fossil of a horse found in the Horse Room provided a uranium-series dating of 252,000 yearsYBP and the Canis cf. dirus specimen was assumed to be from the same period. C.armbrusteri and C.dirus share some characteristics (synapomorphies) that imply the latter's descent from the former. The fossil record suggests C.dirus originated around 250,000YBP in the <b>open</b> <b>terrain</b> of the mid-continent before expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor C.armbrusteri. The first appearance of C.dirus would therefore be 250,000YBP in California and Nebraska, and later {{in the rest of the}} United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, but the identity of these earliest fossils is not confirmed.|$|E

50|$|The {{roads of}} the Muisca people were unpaved, {{which makes it}} hard to {{identify}} them in archaeological excavations. Some of the roads were trade routes, with the eastern neighbours (Llanos Orientales), in the north with the Guane people and in the west with the Panche and Muzo, others were sacred routes. Examples of holy roads, used for pilgrimages, were found in Guasca and Siecha. Routes communicating Muisca territories with cotton producing areas ran through Somondoco and Súnuba. The roads crossing the mountains surrounding the Altiplano were narrow, making it more difficult for the Spanish conquistadores to cross them, especially with horses. Once they reached the <b>open</b> <b>terrains</b> of the Bogotá savanna, movement became easier.|$|R

5|$|Manco Inca had {{gathered}} more than 30,000troops at Ollantaytambo, among them, {{a large number}} of recruits from tribes of the Amazon Rainforest. Manco Inca's forces were a militia army made up mostly of conscripted farmers with only rudimentary weapons training. This was the regular fare in the Inca Empire, where military service was a duty for all married men between 25 and 50 years old. In combat, these soldiers were organized according to their ethnic group and led into battle by their native leaders, called kurakas. They used melee weapons such as maces, clubs and spears as well as ranged weapons such as arrows, javelins, and slings; protective gear included helmets, shields, and quilted cloth armor. Against the conquistadors, wooden clubs and maces with stone or bronze heads were rarely able to penetrate Spanish armor; slings and other missile throwing weapons were somewhat more effective due to their accuracy and the large size of their projectiles. Even so, Inca soldiers were no match for the Spanish cavalry in <b>open</b> <b>terrain</b> so they resorted to fighting on rough terrain and digging pits in open fields to hinder the mobility of horses.|$|E

The route heads northeast around the reservoir as a two-lane highway, intersecting CR13 (Stryker Road) in an area of open fields before crossing Schoharie Creek a short distance downstream from the Gilboa Dam. On the opposite bank of the creek, the highway quickly passes through the small hamlet of Gilboa, located at a junction with CR17 (Flat Creek Road). Outside of Gilboa, NY990V turns to the southeast, paralleling {{the eastern edge of the}} reservoir as it runs through a stretch of forests and passes directly south of Gilboa-Conesville Central School.

5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly {{began to focus}} more on the relationships between the coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the <b>open</b> <b>terrain</b> at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius {{heard the}} Allied army {{was on the}} march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into <b>open</b> <b>terrain</b> where he could use his cavalry. The Allied army, {{under the command of}} the regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect {{themselves}} against such tactics. After several days of maneuver and stalemate, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards the Allies' original positions. This maneuver went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away near Plataea. Seeing that the Persians might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward. However, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius's bodyguard and killed him. After this the Persian force dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly, but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Greeks, finalising the Greek victory.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{inaccurate}} {{though to}} depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have {{had more to do}} with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices—using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in <b>open</b> <b>terrain</b> and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than the Europeans.|$|E
