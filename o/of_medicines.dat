5|$|Throughout the post-communist period, the {{pharmaceutical}} industry has mainly been an obstacle to reform.

Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort.

5|$|Although {{there were}} many other small {{pharmaceutical}} companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and Company distinguished itself from the others by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and its strong focus on quality.

Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's. He insisted on quality assurance and instituted mechanisms {{to ensure that the}} drugs being produced would be effective and perform as advertised, had the correct combination of ingredients, and had the correct dosages <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> in each pill.
