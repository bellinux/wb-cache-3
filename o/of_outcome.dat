5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality <b>of</b> <b>outcome.</b> The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Acute liver {{failure is}} the {{appearance}} of severe complications rapidly after {{the first signs of}} liver disease (such as jaundice), and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage (loss of function of 80–90% of liver cells). The complications are hepatic encephalopathy and impaired protein synthesis (as measured by the levels of serum albumin and the prothrombin time in the blood). The 1993 classification defines hyperacute as within 1 week, acute as 8–28 days, and subacute as 4–12 weeks. It reflects the fact that the pace of disease evolution strongly influences prognosis. Underlying cause is the other significant determinant <b>of</b> <b>outcome.</b>|$|E
25|$|Within the Liberal Democrats, the {{two main}} ideological strands are social liberals and the {{classical}} liberals, the latter supporting economic liberalism. The principal {{difference between the two}} is that the classical liberals tend to support greater choice and competition and aim to increase social mobility through economic deregulation and creation of opportunity, whereas the social liberals were more commonly associated with directly aiming to increase equality <b>of</b> <b>outcome</b> through state intervention. Correspondingly, classical liberals tended to favour cutting taxes for the poorest in order to increase opportunity, contrasting with social liberals, who would rather see higher spending on public services and the disadvantaged in order to reduce income inequality.|$|E

For example, the parties may have selected the particular law to evade the operation of otherwise mandatory provisions of the law which has the closest connection with the contract. The parties are not free to put themselves above the law and, in such cases, it will be for the parties to prove that there is a valid reason for selecting that law other than evasion.|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of {{treatments}} for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) previously focused on symptom control, but attention {{has shifted to}} functional <b>outcomes.</b> The effect <b>of</b> different ADHD treatment periods and modalities (pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and combination) on long-term outcomes {{needs to be more}} comprehensively understood. A systematic search of 12 literature databases using Cochrane's guidelines yielded 403 English-language peer-reviewed, primary studies reporting long-term outcomes (≥ 2 years). We evaluated relative effects of treatment modalities and durations and effect sizes <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> reported as statistically significantly improved with treatment. The highest proportion <b>of</b> improved <b>outcomes</b> was reported with combination treatment (83 % <b>of</b> <b>outcomes).</b> Among significantly improved outcomes, the largest effect sizes were found for combination treatment. The greatest improvements were associated with academic, self-esteem, or social function <b>outcomes.</b> A majority <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> improved regardless <b>of</b> age of treatment initiation (60 %- 75 %) or treatment duration (62 %- 72 %). Studies with short treatment duration had shorter follow-up times (mean 3. 2 years total study length) than those with longer treatment durations (mean 7. 1 years total study length). Studies with follow-up times < 3 years reported benefit with treatment for 93 % <b>of</b> <b>outcomes,</b> whereas those with follow-up times ≥ 3 years reported treatment benefit for 57 % <b>of</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Post-hoc analysis indicated that this result was related to the measurement <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> at longer periods (3. 2 versus 0. 4 years) after treatment cessation in studies with longer total study length. While the majority <b>of</b> long-term <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> ADHD improve with all treatment modalities, the combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment was most consistently associated with improved long-term outcomes and large effect sizes. Older treatment initiation age or longer durations did not markedly affect proportion <b>of</b> improved <b>outcomes</b> reported, but measurement <b>of</b> <b>outcomes</b> long periods after treatment cessation may attenuate results...|$|R

25|$|The {{timing of}} the dose of the drug is an {{important}} determinant <b>of</b> <b>outcome,</b> in addition to how much is used, for how long, {{and what kind of}} care is rendered after birth. Drug use in the first trimester is the most harmful to the fetus in terms of neurological and developmental outcome. The effects of PCE later in a child's life are poorly understood; there is little information about the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on children over age five. Some studies have found PCE-related differences in height and weight while others have not; these differences are generally gone or small by the time children are school age. Much is still not known about what factors may exist to aid children who were exposed to cocaine in utero. It is unknown if the effects of PCE are increased once children reach adolescence, or whether the neural rewiring that occurs during this developmental period attenuates the effects. A review of 27 studies performed between 2006 and 2012 found that cognitive development was mildly to moderately affected in PCE adolescents, but it was not clear how important these effects were in practical terms.|$|E
