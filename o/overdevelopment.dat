5|$|In 1924, Los Angeles imposed height {{restrictions}} {{throughout the}} city, effectively prohibiting {{the construction of}} any building taller than Los Angeles City Hall (454ft/138 m). It was intended to address local concerns about growing congestion and <b>overdevelopment</b> at the time. That height limit was lifted in Downtown Los Angeles by the city government in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Legal & General {{worked with}} the local {{community}} to secure support for the project, establishing the St Giles Renaissance Forum in 2002 as {{a focal point for}} local residents, community groups and stakeholders to collaborate on plans to regenerate St Giles. Plans for the development were unveiled in February 2004 and in January 2005 Legal & General made a planning application to begin construction. The scheme was opposed by a number of local residents' groups which complained that it would constitute an <b>overdevelopment</b> of the site, would put too much strain on local transport and that there was too little residential accommodation on the site.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} community {{issue is}} potential <b>overdevelopment,</b> with high-density housing development occurring around the new Wolli Creek railway station. This {{area in the}} northern part of Arncliffe, officially became the separate suburb of Wolli Creek in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Since the Navy's departure, {{tensions}} on {{the island}} have been low, although land speculation by foreign developers and fears of <b>overdevelopment</b> have caused some resentment among local residents, and there are occasional reports of lingering anti-American sentiment.|$|E
25|$|St Kilda Road was annexed in the 1960s {{and given}} the {{postcode}} of Melbourne 3004 to stimulate office development along the strip and reduce pressure on <b>overdevelopment</b> of the Hoddle Grid. The result was the demolition {{of many of the}} street's grand mansions.|$|E
25|$|While having fully {{developed}} tourist facilities, the island has not experienced the <b>overdevelopment</b> found {{on some other}} islands and consequently caters for visitors attracted by its rugged natural beauty. Nonetheless, it remains a popular destination for predominantly but not exclusively German, British, French and Italian tourists.|$|E
25|$|At {{this same}} time, the Lowell City Development Authority created a Comprehensive Master Plan which {{included}} recommendations for zoning adaptations within the city. The city's original zoning code was adopted in 1926 and was significantly revised in 1966 and 2004, with changes included {{to respond to}} concerns about <b>overdevelopment.</b>|$|E
25|$|While winning many travel {{industry}} awards as Best Island In The World {{in recent years}} concerns have been raised by locals and environmentalists about the <b>overdevelopment</b> of Maui. A number of activist groups, including Save Makena have {{gone as far as}} taking the government to court {{to protect the rights of}} local citizens.|$|E
25|$|During thelarche, the {{developing}} breasts are sometimes of unequal size, and usually the left breast is slightly larger. This condition of asymmetry is transitory and statistically normal in female {{physical and sexual}} development. Medical conditions can cause <b>overdevelopment</b> (e.g., virginal breast hypertrophy, macromastia) or underdevelopment (e.g., tuberous breast deformity, micromastia) in girls and women.|$|E
25|$|The Holdfast Shores development, {{starting}} in the late 1990s, included {{the construction of the}} Marina Pier apartment building with its own private marina in Glenelg North, and the Pier Hotel. The development was met with strong opposition, from both local residents and the City of Holdfast Bay, fearing <b>overdevelopment</b> would ruin the area. Parts of the plan were scaled back, with the Platinum Apartment building scaled down from fifteen stories to nine, and the cinema complex cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The {{abnormal}} {{enlargement of}} the breast tissues to a volume {{in excess of the}} normal bust-to-body proportions can be caused either by the <b>overdevelopment</b> of the milk glands or of the adipose tissue, or by a combination of both occurrences of hypertrophy. The resultant breast-volume increases can range from the mild (<300 gm) to the moderate (ca. 300–800 gm) to the severe (>800 gm). Macromastia can be manifested either as a unilateral condition or as a bilateral condition (single-breasted enlargement or double-breasted enlargement) that can occur in combination with sagging, breast ptosis that is determined by {{the degree to which the}} nipple has descended below the inframammary fold (IMF).|$|E
25|$|There is {{one major}} piece of {{evidence}} suggesting that abnormal connectivity occurs in autism. Autistic brains are known to develop very rapidly early in life, and this could cause problems {{in the development of}} cortical connections. It has been suggested that this early <b>overdevelopment</b> may be a cause for the impaired connectivity in autism. Diffusion tensor imaging studies of autistic brains are consistent with this idea, as they show reduced myelination (see:Myelin) in the areas of the brain that deal with social cognition and theory of mind, or one’s ability to comprehend what another person may be thinking. This provides further evidence for underconnectivity of the autistic brain.|$|E
25|$|Another measurement, {{calculated}} {{as part of}} a wider assessment of water management in 2007, aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used. It therefore divided water scarcity into 'physical' and 'economic'. Physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed, such as when there is <b>overdevelopment</b> of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater. Water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live.|$|E
25|$|A woman {{develops}} large breasts usually during thelarche (the pubertal breast-development stage), but large breasts {{can also}} develop postpartum, after gaining weight, at menopause, and at any age. Whereas macromastia usually develops in consequence to the hypertrophy (<b>overdevelopment)</b> of adipose fat, {{rather than to}} milk-gland hypertrophy. Moreover, many women are genetically predisposed to developing large breasts, the size and weight of which often are increased either by pregnancy or by weight gain, or by both conditions; there also exist iatrogenic (physician-caused) conditions such as post–mastectomy and post–lumpectomy asymmetry. Nonetheless, it is statistically rare for a young woman to experience virginal mammary hypertrophy that results in massive, oversized breasts, and recurrent breast hypertrophy.|$|E
25|$|Megalencephaly (or macrencephaly, {{abbreviated}} MEG) is {{a growth}} development disorder {{in which the}} brain is abnormally large. It {{is characterized by a}} brain with an average weight that is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean of the general population. Megalencephaly is usually diagnosed at birth and is confirmed with an MRI. A mutation in the PI3K-AKT pathway {{is believed to be the}} primary cause of brain proliferation and ultimately the root cause of megalencephaly. This mutation has produced a classification of brain <b>overdevelopment</b> that consists of two syndromes including, megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus (MPPH). Approximately 1 out of 50 children (2%) are said to have the characteristics of megalencephaly in the general population. There are several neuropsychiatric disorders linked with megalencephaly, however, studies have shown that autism is the most prevalent association with the malformation of MEG. Although no treatment currently exists for megalencephaly, management methods are focused at reducing deficits linked with autism. Most recent research is targeted at creating inhibitors to reduce the mutational pathway that causes megalencephaly.|$|E
500|$|The Nature Conservancy became {{concerned}} about <b>overdevelopment</b> in 1978 and launched its largest fundraising project to that date. Collecting over $500,000 they purchased [...] of Lower Table Rock, creating the Lower Table Rock Preserve. Projects include prescribed burning and invasive species removal. In 1981, the Youth Conservation Corps constructed the Upper Table Rock Trail. A year later, {{through the efforts}} of John Ifft, the Lower Table Rock Trail was constructed; the first [...] were built by a Central Point Boy Scout troop, and the rest was built by the Oregon Department of Forestry. In 1984, the Table Rocks were designated an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management.

2500|$|With {{increased}} {{industrialization and}} land use changes, many of the nation's eastern trout rivers were polluted or experienced elevated water temperatures, reducing the range of native brook trout. Smallmouth bass were often introduced to northern rivers with increased water temperatures and slowly became a popular gamefish with many anglers. [...] Equally adaptable to large, cool-water impoundments and reservoirs, the smallmouth also spread far beyond its original native range. Later, smallmouth populations also began to decline after years of damage caused by <b>overdevelopment</b> and pollution, {{as well as a}} loss of river habitat caused by damming many formerly wild rivers to form lakes or reservoirs. In recent years, a renewed emphasis on preserving water quality and riparian habitat in the nation's rivers and lakes, together with stricter management practices, eventually benefited smallmouth populations and has caused a resurgence in their popularity with anglers.|$|E
2500|$|The present {{council is}} {{composed}} of four Labor councillors, four independents and four Liberals. The current mayor is Lucille McKenna, the Council's first woman mayor. [...] Current local issues in the area include the redevelopment of Ashfield Mall and concerns about <b>overdevelopment</b> in general; construction of the M4 East tunnel because it might lead to increased traffic pollution; and the general state of the commercial area, which one councillor labelled 'Trashfield'. Also contentious is Ashfield Council itself. In 2003, it was described by the Daily Telegraph {{as one of the}} worst councils in Sydney after one councillor took out a restraining order against another. Since then another councillor has been sacked for not being a bona fide resident of the municipality while other councillors have made outspoken comments on issues such as the Iraq War, bird flu, the Monarchy and 30km/h speed limits within residential areas.|$|E

2500|$|Chester Borough {{split from}} Chester Township in 1930 over the {{creation}} of sewer and water infrastructure in the more densely settled center of the municipality. The residents of the rural portions of the Township {{did not wish to}} financially support the construction and maintenance of a public sewer or water utility. Since that time rural Chester Township has relied upon individual private wells for water and septic systems for wastewater treatment while the Borough is primarily, although not entirely, served by public sewer and water. Concerns over the extension of utilities into the rural Township with the resultant potential for large scale growth served as an impediment to consolidation. The prohibition of utility extensions supported by the NJ State Plan and codified in the Highlands Water Protection Act, along with the development restrictions contained in the Highlands Act have lessened those concerns. Additionally, an aggressive land conservation program in the Township has resulted in over 40% of the [...] Township being placed into permanent preservation, further lessening worries about potential <b>overdevelopment.</b> The two municipalities currently share a common K-8 school district, volunteer fire department, library, first aid squad and other municipal services.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, the MAS and WPBO took {{a public}} stand {{calling for the}} {{transfer}} of the entire Whitefish Point Light Station to the USFWS. U.S. Rep.

[...] The USFWS's request to Stupak for {{the transfer of the}} light station was made public with assurances that no changes would be made to the GLSHS museum operation. A group called the Friends of Whitefish Point organized over their opposition of <b>overdevelopment</b> and private ownership of the light station property. [...] They presented a petition with 1,600 signatures to Stupak that supported the transfer of the entire light station property to USFWS. [...] In 1995, Stupak announced that he hadn't made a final decision, saying, [...] "To tell those people [...] they can no longer run their museum because Fish and Wildlife wants it would be wrong."

2500|$|Flooding is a {{recurring}} problem in Houston. [...] It is especially severe in low-lying {{areas on the}} far east end of town along the San Jacinto River. The flat wetlands and paved-over coastal prairie around Houston drain slowly and easily flood. The area is drained by a network of bayous (small, slow-moving rivers, often dredged and enlarged to increase volume) and man-made drainage ditches, which are usually dry most of the year. [...] Due to the ubiquity of <b>overdevelopment</b> and the huge amounts of concrete in the city, drainage is insufficient during times of especially heavy rainfall. [...] In fall, cool fronts bring in rainstorms and flooding is not uncommon. This might flood certain low-lying intersections, but doesn't generally affect citizens or {{the business of the}} city. [...] However, occasionally very heavy thunderstorms dump so much water on the city that widespread congestion and even property damage in low-lying areas result. [...] Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 was so severe that many parts of town that had never flooded before were flooded seriously. [...] Interstate 10 near downtown, which is below grade, was covered by over [...] of water. Another storm happened in June 2015 (Tropical Storm Bill) that had a similar impact on Houston, causing several highways to be closed due to the bayou overflowing; this event followed flooding from May 24-26. Another similar storm in April 2016 resulted in widespread, severe flooding across Houston and surrounding suburbs in an event later known as the [...] "Tax Day Floods". On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston causing severe widespread damage and at least 14 deaths. In real life, Houston is becoming a Western Hemisphere equivalent of Kolkata, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh (flooding in these Indian Subcontinent cities is 200% more severe than the upper Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast because of the Indian Ocean Monsoon which is the most treacherous in the world where rainfall totals average over 100 inches a year where flood levels are higher.|$|E
