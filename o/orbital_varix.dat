40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{pulsating}} enophthalmos secondary to <b>orbital</b> <b>varix</b> associated with orbital bony defects. A 64 -year-old female with pulsating enophthalmos of the right eye {{was found to have}} a right orbital mass with bony defects of the orbit. Valsalva maneuver failed to induce proptosis. The diagnosis of <b>orbital</b> <b>varix</b> was confirmed by exploratory orbitotomy. During general anesthesia for orbitotomy, proptosis of the right eye was noted. Ophthalmologists {{should be aware of the}} association between orbital varices and cranial bony defects and encephaloceles. Proptosis induced by general anesthesia and positive pressure ventilation suggests an underlying distensible venous anomaly. Venkatesh C Prabhakaran, Dinesh Selv...|$|E
40|$|Three {{patients}} {{have been described}} with a thrombosed <b>orbital</b> <b>varix.</b> The clinical, imaging, surgical, and pathologic features of this disorder are described. A pathophysiologic mechanism has been proposed and this entity has been placed in the spectrum of orbital vascular lesions.

40|$|Enophthalmos is a {{relatively}} frequent and misdiagnosed clinical sign in orbital diseases. The knowledge of the different etiologies of enophthalmos and its adequate management are important, because in some cases, {{it could be the}} first sign revealing a life-threatening disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of enophthalmos. The main etiologies, such as trauma, chronic maxillary atelectasis (silent sinus syndrome), breast cancer metastasis, and <b>orbital</b> <b>varix,</b> will be discussed. Its objective is to enable the reader to recognize, assess, and treat the spectrum of disorders causing enophthalmos...|$|E

40|$|Colour Doppler imaging (CDI) is {{a recent}} {{development}} in ultrasonography. It allows simultaneous two-dimensional structural imaging and Doppler evaluation of blood flow. Quantitative information on flow velocity is obtained by pulsed Doppler spectral analysis, the colour information being used to choose the vessel of interest. Using this technique the authors examined a patient with an <b>orbital</b> <b>varix</b> previously diagnosed by clinical findings and computed tomography. Dynamic evaluation with real-time direct imaging of flow facilitated the diagnosis of this orbital disorder {{without the need for}} any contrast material. This technique may prove to be a useful adjunct to computed tomography for the evaluation of suspected vascular lesions of the orbit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe term orbital tumor {{covers a}} wide range of benign and {{malignant}} diseases affecting specific component of the orbit or developing in contact with them. They are found incidentally or may be investigated as part of the assessment of a systemic disorder or because of orbital signs (exophthalmos, pain, etc.). Computed tomography, MRI and Color Doppler Ultrasound (CDU), play a varying role depending on the clinical presentation and the disease being investigated. This article reflects long experience in a reference center but does not claim to be exhaustive. We have chosen to consider these tumors from the perspective of their usual presentation, emphasizing the most common causes and suggestive radiological and clinical presentations (progressive or sudden-onset exophthalmos, children or adults, lacrimal gland lesions, periorbital lesions and enophthalmos). We will describe in particular muscle involvement (thyrotoxicosis and tumors), vascular lesions (cavernous sinus hemangioma, <b>orbital</b> <b>varix,</b> cystic lymphangioma), childhood lesions and orbital hematomas. We offer straightforward useful protocols for simple investigation and differential diagnosis. Readers who wish to go further to extend their knowledge in this fascinating area can refer to the references in the bibliography...|$|E
40|$|To present our {{experience}} of removing middle to deep orbital tumors {{using a combination of}} minimally invasive soft tissue approaches, sometimes under local anesthesia. Methods. In this retrospective case series, 30 patients (13 males and 17 females) underwent tumor removal through eyelid crease (17 eyes), conjunctival (nine eyes), lateral canthal (two eyes), and transcaruncular (two eyes) approaches. All tumors were located in the posterior half of the orbit. Six cases were removed under monitored anesthesia care with local block, and 24 were under general anesthesia. Results. The median (range) age and follow-up duration were 48. 5 (31 – 87) years old and 24. 5 (4 – 375) weeks, respectively. Visual acuity and ocular motility showed improvement or no significant change in all but one patient at the latest followup. Confirmed pathologies revealed cavernous hemangioma (15 cases), pleomorphic adenoma (5 cases), solitary fibrous tumor (4 cases), neurofibroma (2 cases), schwannoma (2 cases), and <b>orbital</b> <b>varix</b> (1 case). None of the patients experienced recurrence. Conclusions. Creating a bony marginotomy increases intraoperative exposure of the deep orbit but adds substantial time and morbidity. Benign orbital tumors can often be removed safely through small soft-tissue incisions, without bone removal and under local anesthesia...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} technetium Tc 99 m (Tc- 99 m) {{red blood}} cell scintigraphy as a diagnostic tool for orbital cavernous hemangioma and to differentiate between orbital masses {{on the basis of}} their vascularization. Methods: We performed Tc- 99 m {{red blood cell}} scintigraphy on 23 patients (8 female and 15 male; mean age, 47 years) affected by an orbital mass previously revealed with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and suggesting cavernous hemangioma. In our diagnosis, we considered the orbital increase delayed uptake with the typical scintigraphic pattern known as perfusion blood pool mismatch. The patients underwent biopsy or surgical treatment with transconjunctival cryosurgical extraction when possible. Results: Single-photon emission tomography (SPET) showed intense focal uptake in the orbit corresponding to radiologic findings in 11 patients who underwent surgical treatment and pathologic evaluation (9 cavernous hemangiomas, 1 hemangiopericytoma, and 1 lymphan gioma). Clinical or histologic examination of the remaining 22 patients revealed the presence of 5 lymphoid pseudotumors, 2 lymphomas, 2 pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal gland, 1 astrocytoma, 1 ophthalmic vein thrombosis, and 1 <b>orbital</b> <b>varix.</b> Conclusions: The confirmation of the preoperative diagnosis by Tc- 99 m red blood cell scintigraphy shows that this technique is a reliable tool for differentiating cavernous hemangiomas from other orbital masses (sensitivity, 100 %; specificity, 86 %) when ultrasound, CT, and MRI are not diagnostic. Unfortunately, Tc- 99 m red blood cell scintigraphy results were positive in 1 patient with hemangiopericytoma and 1 patient with lymphangioma, which showed increased uptake in the lesion on SPET images because of the vascular nature of these tumors. Therefore, in these cases, the SPET images have to be integrated with data regarding clinical preoperative evaluation and CT scans or MRI studies. On the basis of our study, a complete diagnostic picture, CT scans or MRI studies, and scintigraphic patterns can establish the preoperative diagnosis of vascular orbital tumors such as cavernous hemangioma, adult-type lymphangioma, and hemangiopericytoma...|$|E
