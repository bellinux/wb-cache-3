The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and <b>outlet</b> <b>works.</b> The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{plants have}} been planted on the {{downstream}} face of the dam wall, ensuring that the dam blends with the surrounding landscape. Parallel to the dam's construction alien vegetation {{was removed from the}} upper river catchment, significantly increasing the amount of water available for storage and for indigenous plant species. The scheme was designed to maintain the ecological integrity of the river, including through the release of specific volumes of water for this purpose. The releases of low flows and high flows coincide as closely as possible with natural flows. The <b>outlet</b> <b>works</b> of the dam have been designed for a peak release of up to 200 m³ per second, making it the first dam in South Africa where provision is made for flood releases for environmental purposes.|$|E

500|$|Actual {{construction}} {{began in}} July 1966 with clearing {{of the dam}} and reservoir site, construction of access roads, foundation preparations and excavations for the future <b>outlet</b> <b>works.</b> A diversion tunnel to allow the river to bypass the dam site was excavated between 1966 and December 1973. The Corps opened bids for construction of the main dam on October 10, 1972. Melones Contractors (a consortium formed by Guy F. Atckinson Company, Gordon H. Ball, and Arundel Corp.) won the primary construction contract for $109.7 million, while Allis-Chalmers and General Electric took an $11.5 million contract to provide turbines and hydroelectric generating equipment. During reservoir clearing operations, the USACE spent about $28 million relocating roads and bridges in the future reservoir space. Foundation work for the dam itself began on March 6, 1974 with the first embankment material placed in January 1976. Much of the embankment fill came from an excavation shortly northwest of the dam, which would later serve as the dam's spillway. During the height of construction in the summer, the total workforce reached about 800, while averaging between 500–600 in the winter months.|$|E
500|$|Spring Creek Reservoir is the {{artificial}} lake formed behind the dam. The reservoir is used mostly for flood control storage, and is rarely filled to its [...] capacity. During the dry season, water from Spring Creek pools in a small, stagnant pond retained behind the dam, depositing contaminated sediment and acidic mine {{waste in the}} reservoir space. When flows from the Shasta Dam, upstream on the Sacramento River, are sufficient to flush contaminated water away, water held in the reservoir is released through the <b>outlet</b> <b>works</b> into the Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. Despite this operation strategy, the reservoir was eventually deemed inadequate for the watershed, and can be filled to capacity by a single heavy storm event. Uncontrollable spills frequently poured into the Sacramento River during floods, through the crest spillway of the dam, which lacks gates. As a result, numerous fish kills have occurred during these sudden releases of contaminants, a major {{one of which was}} in 1969. Due to this consistent acid pollution from the reservoir, most large fish spawn downstream of Red Bluff Diversion Dam, a dam also on the Sacramento River near Red Bluff, California.|$|E

The intakes provide a maximum hydraulic head (water pressure) of [...] as the water reaches a speed of about [...] The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and <b>outlet</b> <b>works</b> (jet-flow gates) are rarely used. The jet-flow gates, located in concrete structures [...] above the river, and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, {{may be used to}} divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are only used to drain water from the penstocks for maintenance. Following an uprating project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2.4 megawatt Pelton turbine-generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of 2080 megawatts. The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10.348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2.648 TWh in 1956. The average power generated was 4.2 TWh/year for 1947–2008. In 2015, the dam generated 3.6 TWh.|$|E

This helps alleviate tensile stress for when the reservoir is not only full but empty. The dam's <b>outlet</b> <b>works</b> consist of two discharge pipes, capable of releasing up to [...] each.
