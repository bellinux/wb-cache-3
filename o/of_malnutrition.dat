5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition.</b> India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E

Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> and hypoxia. In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|When maize {{was first}} {{introduced}} into farming systems other than those used by traditional native-American peoples, it was generally welcomed with enthusiasm for its productivity. However, a widespread problem <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> soon arose wherever maize was introduced as a staple food. This was a mystery, since these types <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> were not normally seen among the indigenous Americans, for whom maize was the principal staple food.|$|E

40|$|Chronic malnutrition, {{including}} stunting, is {{an important}} example of a global challenge that spans multiple sectors, specifically health, agriculture, and the environment. The objective {{of this paper is}} to review current knowledge on the causes and consequences <b>of</b> chronic <b>malnutrition</b> and their relationship with multiple sectors. Understanding the causes includes approaching chronic malnutrition from the basic, underlying, and immediate levels. The causes reach from macro-level environmental influences to specific micronutrient intake. In order to effectively address stunting, it is important to understand the timing of stunting and the ability of individuals to catch-up in terms of linear growth, cognitive ability, and immune function. The consequences <b>of</b> chronic <b>malnutrition</b> are transgenerational, and they have an impact at the individual, community, and national level in the short- and long-term. There are still many gaps in knowledge regarding both the causes and consequences <b>of</b> chronic <b>malnutrition,</b> particularly when it comes to the interaction with agriculture and the environment, and understanding these gaps is important to addressing the burden <b>of</b> chronic <b>malnutrition</b> through evidence-based interventions...|$|R

25|$|In Australia {{malnutrition}} or risk <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> {{occurs in}} 80 percent {{of elderly people}} presented to hospitals for admission. Malnutrition and weight loss can contribute to sarcopenia with loss of lean body mass and muscle function. Abdominal obesity or weight loss coupled with sarcopenia lead to immobility, skeletal disorders, insulin resistance, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. A paper from the Journal of the American Dietetic Association noted that routine nutrition screenings represent one way to detect and therefore decrease the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> in the elderly.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the prevalence <b>of</b> acute <b>malnutrition</b> in children under five is widely used {{for the detection of}} emergencies, planning interventions, advocacy, and monitoring and evaluation. This study examined PROBIT Methods which convert parameters (mean and standard deviation (SD)) of a normally distributed variable to a cumulative probability below any cut-off to estimate acute malnutrition in children under five using Middle-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC). We assessed the performance of: PROBIT Method I, with mean MUAC from the survey sample and MUAC SD from a database of previous surveys; and PROBIT Method II, with mean and SD of MUAC observed in the survey sample. Specifically, we generated sub-samples from 852 survey datasets, simulating 100 surveys for eight sample sizes. Overall the methods were tested on 681 600 simulated surveys. PROBIT methods relying on sample sizes as small as 50 had better performance than the classic method for estimating and classifying the prevalence <b>of</b> acute <b>malnutrition.</b> They had better precision in the estimation <b>of</b> acute <b>malnutrition</b> for all sample sizes and better coverage for smaller sample sizes, while having relatively little bias. They classified situations accurately for a threshold of 5 % acute malnutrition. Both PROBIT methods had similar outcomes. PROBIT Methods have a clear advantage in the assessment <b>of</b> acute <b>malnutrition</b> prevalence based on MUAC, compared to the classic method. Their use would require much lower sample sizes, thus enable great time and resource savings and permit timely and/or locally relevant prevalence estimates <b>of</b> acute <b>malnutrition</b> for a swift and well-targeted response...|$|R

25|$|In {{emergency}} situations {{where there is}} a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, protein-energy malnutrition is most common among young children. Marasmus, a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. Kwashiorkor, a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> in young children, and can negatively affect physical and mental development. Both types <b>of</b> <b>malnutrition</b> can make opportunistic infections fatal. In these situations, MSF sets up Therapeutic Feeding Centres for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.|$|E
