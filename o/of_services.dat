40|$|The main {{objective}} of this bachelor thesis is an analysis <b>of</b> denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks and the subsequent simulation of selected denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks. To achieve {{the goal of this}} thesis, the initial point in theoretical part consists of the defined main terms related to denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks. These terms are: cyber attacks, denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attack and distributed denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks. Further in this part of this thesis is defined description of the person who executes denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks and motives, which lead the person to these acts. At the conclusion of the theoretical part of the thesis are mentioned several classifications <b>of</b> denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks. The practical part of the thesis is then focused on the analysis of the most frequent denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks and their possible defense. Furthemore, this section also includes a general defense against denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks and the known examples <b>of</b> denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks younger than two years. Based on the acquired knowledge about the denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks, is in the conclusion of the practical part of the thesis made simulation of two selected methods <b>of</b> denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks...|$|R

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> from a user {{perspective}} of a transportation facility or service is a fundamental concept of the Highway Capacity Manual. In determining quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> an arterial, six levels <b>of</b> <b>service</b> thresholds are defined in the Highway Capacity Manual based on average through vehicle speed. In fact, the arterial level <b>of</b> <b>service</b> {{is not so much}} describing the quality <b>of</b> transportation <b>service</b> provided by the facility, as much as the quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> provided to through motorized vehicles (i. e., automobile users). Although this quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> concept does address the primary mode of travel, it does not address the quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> the arterial provides to other major potential modes: transit, pedestrian and bicycle. Proposed levels <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual for pedestrians and bicyclists are essentially based on how crowded the respective modal facilities are. However, recent research on pedestrian and bicycle quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> indicate that the most important factors are lateral separation of the mode from motorized vehicles, and motorized vehicle volume, speed, and type. For scheduled fixed route bus users the most important factors for quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> along an arterial are frequency of transit vehicles (headways and hours <b>of</b> <b>service)</b> and pedestrian access. This paper presents methods of determining the level <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to scheduled fixed route bus users, pedestrians and bicyclists on arterials as well to through vehicles. It is based on level <b>of</b> <b>service</b> research for the individual modes, with a more comprehensive arterial approach based on research being conducted in Florida. It also presents Florida’s proposed multimodal arterial quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> approach at a planning level and how future editions of the Highway Capacity Manual could be structured to take a more multimodal analysis approach. 1...|$|R

The thesis {{is based on an}} analysis of current legislation, which is in the introductory chapter supplemented for completeness with historical excursus to the development of this area of law in past. The thesis is for clarity divided according to the individual manners <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Each <b>of</b> these methods <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> documents is subject to detailed analysis, and there is pointed out on shortcomings with respect to every manner <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> The aim is not only to analyze comprehensively the issue <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in civil proceedings, but also to point out the application problems that may arise today in connection with the contemporary legislation in practice.
