The gap between Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher fell by one second after the McLaren driver {{encountered}} lapped traffic on lap 30. Ralf Schumacher lost sixth position to teammate Button after making a mistake on the same lap, while Frentzen pulled off the track at the entry of First Curve to retire from a hydraulic pump issue which caused his gearbox to fail. Michael Schumacher closed the gap to Häkkinen by 0.7 seconds by lap 31, although he made minor contact with Zonta two laps later. Further down the order, Heidfeld overtook Trulli for 13th position on lap 34. The second round of pit stops began on the same lap when Irvine made a pit stop. Häkkinen made his second stop on lap 37, and came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane 25.8 seconds behind rival Michael Schumacher but ahead of Coulthard. Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull away from Häkkinen. Coulthard, Barrichello and Button remained in third, fourth and fifth positions respectively, during their second stops on lap 38 and 39.

5|$|After {{dreaming of}} {{spectacular}} horrors, Houdini awakens {{at the bottom}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he is somewhere in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark {{in an attempt to}} find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling {{down a flight of stairs}} and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature is merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.|$|E
5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit {{stops to}} change to {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the Spoon Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> combined nanoscale topography and surface chemistry on lipid vesicle adsorption and supported bilayer formation on well-controlled model surfaces. To this end, we utilized colloidal lithography to nanofabricate pitted Au-SiO 2 surfaces, where the top surface and <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> consisted <b>of</b> silicon dioxide whereas <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> was made <b>of</b> gold. <b>The</b> diameter and height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> were fixed at 107 and 25 nm, respectively. Using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) technique and {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), we monitored the processes occurring upon exposure of these nanostructured surfaces to a solution of extruded unilamellar 1 -palmitolyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) vesicles with a nominal diameter of 100 nm. To scrutinize <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> surface chemistry, we studied two cases: (1) the bare gold surface at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> and (2) <b>the</b> gold passivated by biotinamidocaproyl-labeled bovine serum albumin (BBSA) prior to vesicle exposure. As in our previous work on pitted silicon dioxide surfaces, we found that <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> edges promote bilayer formation on the SiO 2 surface for the vesicle size used here in both cases. Whereas {{in the first case}} we observed a slow, continuous adsorption of intact vesicles onto the gold surface at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pits,</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> BBSA in <b>the</b> second case prevented <b>the</b> adsorption <b>of</b> intact vesicles into <b>the</b> <b>pits.</b> Instead, our experimental results, together with free energy calculations for various potential membrane configurations, indicate <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a continuous, supported lipid bilayer that spans across <b>the</b> <b>pits.</b> These results are significantly important for various biotechnology applications utilizing patterned lipid bilayers and highlight <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combined QCM-D/AFM approach to study <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> lipid bilayer formation on nanostructured surfaces...|$|R
5|$|Gutiérrez lost ninth {{position}} on lap 30 {{when he was}} passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water on the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane straight and used DRS.

Button recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds {{by the beginning of}} lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth {{position on}} the lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; it took longer than expected because his pit crew changed his steering wheel, and he came out behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton; Rosberg made his second pit stop (for new intermediate tyres) on lap 33, and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36. Ricciardo took the lead until his pit stop during that lap and came out behind the two Mercedes drivers, Vettel and Button.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1983 amateur fossil hunter William J. Walker {{discovered}} a large claw, a phalanx bone, {{and part of}} a rib in Smokejacks Pit, a clay pit near Ockley in Surrey, England. The tip of the claw was missing, but Walker found it a week later. British palaeontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner examined the finds at the Natural History Museum of London and found more bones at the site on 7 February, but the entire skeleton could not be collected until May and June due to conditions at the pit. A team of eight museum staff members and several volunteers excavated two tonnes of matrix. Walker donated the claw to the museum, and the Ockley Brick Company (owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pit)</b> donated the rest of the skeleton and provided equipment. The area had been explored for 200 years, but no similar remains had been found before.|$|E
5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pit,</b> the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In <b>the</b> {{rear section}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{automotive}} exhaust systems condensates bearing appreciable chloride ion concentrations and often low pH-values together with particles of electrochemical active soot {{can lead to}} pronounced <b>pitting</b> corrosion on <b>the</b> inner surfaces. For selection of an appropriate material that can enable cost-effective construction, <b>the</b> corrosion resistance <b>of</b> different candidate grades has to be rated. Design/methodology/approach: <b>The</b> different types <b>of</b> occurring corrosion, both general attack and pitting corrosion demands a combination of evaluation methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrosion attack: mass loss measurements and <b>the</b> measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average depth <b>of</b> {{a certain number of}} pits with an optical 3 D-Measuring System MicroCAD were used. Findings: The two methods for <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrosion attack provide <b>the</b> same ranking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials. Both methods are complementary to each other and together they provide a noticeable differentiation between some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigated materials. Research limitations/implications: <b>The</b> average depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> gives no information about <b>the</b> entire rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrosion attack, about <b>the</b> total number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pits</b> and their depth. In the future, research with the same optical 3 D-Measuring System MicroCAD and new software will be carried out. This will form a structured analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>pits</b> for <b>the</b> quantification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrosion. Practical implications: A higher quantification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pitting</b> corrosion leads to a better rating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different stainless steel grades for using them in <b>the</b> wet section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automotive exhaust systems. Originality/value: <b>The</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pitting</b> corrosion by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new measurement methods with the optical 3 D-Measuring System MicroCAD is more accurate, work fast and is an obligatory complement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous methods <b>of</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pitting</b> corrosion: mass loss and <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deepest <b>pit...</b>|$|R

5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E

They discover that the Thugs, led by their high priest Mola Ram, are in possession {{of three of the}} five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the final two stones. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is whipped and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, which places him in a trance-like state where he begins to mindlessly serve the Thugs. Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Shorty is put to work in the mines alongside the enslaved children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch, shocking him out of the trance. After defeating Chattar Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pit</b> just in time before it has a chance to enter the fire. They go back to the mines to free the children, but Indy is caught up in a fight with a hulking overseer. The Maharajah, who was also entranced, attempts to cripple Indy with a voodoo doll. Shorty spars with the Maharajah, ultimately burning him to snap him out of the trance. With his strength returned, Indy kills the overseer.
