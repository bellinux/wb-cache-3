25|$|The primary {{national}} laws were {{the liberty of}} wombs (Libertad de Vientres) and of the slaves entering the territory (1813), the suppression of entailed states (mayorazgo) (1813) and of emphyteusis (1826), and the suppression of gentilic retract (1868), that gave the right to re-acquire family real estate sold to a stranger to the nearest relative of the <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> (up to the 4th grade of kinship).|$|E
25|$|Because the <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> was {{no longer}} in business, and a new {{manufacturer}} could not be qualified before 2010, when the shuttles were scheduled to be retired, NASA decided to continue operations with the existing tanks. Therefore, {{to reduce the risk of}} failure and the cumulative effects of load, the vessels were maintained at 80 percent of the operating pressure as late in the launch countdown as possible, and the launch pad was cleared of all but essential personnel when pressure was increased to 100 percent. The new launch procedure was employed during some the remaining launches of Atlantis, but was resolved when the two COPVs deemed to have the highest risk of failure were replaced.|$|E
25|$|Android has {{an active}} {{community}} of developers and enthusiasts {{who use the}} Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system. These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, with a comparable level of quality; provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the HP TouchPad. Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided by the <b>original</b> <b>vendor,</b> {{such as the ability}} to overclock or over/undervolt the device's processor. CyanogenMod was the most widely used community firmware, and CyanogenMod has been discontinued and LineageOS is the successor of CyanogenMod.|$|E
5000|$|InterSystems {{was founded}} in 1978 by Phillip T. (Terry) Ragon, its current CEO as of 2015. The firm {{was one of the}} <b>original</b> <b>vendors</b> of M-technology (aka MUMPS) systems, with a product called ISM. Over the years, it {{acquired}} several other MUMPS implementations: DTM from Data Tree (1993); DSM from Digital (1995); and MSM from Micronetics (1998); making InterSystems the dominant M technology vendor.|$|R

5000|$|Lack {{of an open}} {{standard}} {{can also}} become problematic for the customers, as in case of the <b>original</b> <b>vendor's</b> inability to fix a certain problem that is an artifact of technical limitations in the original product. The customer wants that fault fixed, but the vendor has to maintain that faulty state, even across newer revisions of the same product, because that behaviour is a de facto standard and many more customers {{would have to pay}} the price of any break in interoperability caused by fixing the original problem and introducing new behaviour.|$|R
25|$|Some drives use special {{techniques}}, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN, {{to write}} more data onto a given disc; these techniques are inherently {{deviations from the}} Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group {{and will not be}} archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2GiB with GigaRec or 1.8GiB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). The greatest risk in using such a proprietary data storage format, assuming that it works reliably as designed, is that it may be difficult or impossible to repair or replace the hardware used to read the media if it fails, is damaged, or is lost after its <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> discontinues it.|$|E
5000|$|The data {{itself may}} be encumbered, e.g. by patents or pricing, {{leading to a}} {{dependence}} of all competing solutions on the <b>original</b> <b>vendor,</b> and possibly leading a revenue stream from the competitors' customers back to the <b>original</b> <b>vendor.</b> This revenue stream is only {{a result of the}} original product's market dominance and not a result of any innate superiority.|$|E

6000|$|... "We are at {{all times}} {{only too happy to}} meet your wishes. We beg, with regard to the desire of your Lordship, {{expressed}} by Mr. Harker on your behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The <b>original</b> <b>vendors</b> are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever of him.|$|R
50|$|The {{animation}} for {{the characters}} was animated by Sullivan Bluth Studios {{and directed by}} David Steinberg, who replaced Kurtz & Friends and director Bob Kurtz who were the <b>original</b> <b>vendors.</b> Universal wanted the ride film to have a classical animation look, with full feature-quality using the Hanna-Barbera characters. Kurtz & Friends had already been hired by Hanna-Barbera to contribute sequences for Jetsons: The Movie so they were a natural choice for animating the characters. Midway through production Bob Kurtz and his company resigned from the project citing creative differences, so Universal contacted Bluth's company, whom worked with Universal in the past, to do animation for the ride.|$|R
50|$|In {{many cases}} the EMC version of a switch will have {{customized}} EMC firmware, which will improve larger SAN design and/or compatibility between multi-vendor products. These customizations are usually created by the <b>original</b> switch <b>vendor</b> to EMC's requirements.|$|R
5000|$|The data is {{provided}} by the <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> on a discretionary basis, who has every interest in blocking the effective implementation of competing solutions, and may subtly alter or change its product, often in newer revisions, so that competitors' implementations are almost, but not quite completely interoperable, leading customers to consider them unreliable or of a lower quality. These changes can either not be passed on to other vendors at all, or passed on after a strategic delay, maintaining the market dominance of the <b>original</b> <b>vendor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Quebec {{put into}} law [...] "Bill 25" [...] in June 2012, making it illegal for ticket brokers to resell {{a ticket for}} more than the face value of the ticket without first obtaining {{permission}} from the ticket's <b>original</b> <b>vendor.</b> Brokers reselling tickets are required to inform consumers the tickets are being resold, and must tell consumers {{the name of the}} ticket's <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> and the original face value price. The penalty to violating the law includes fines of $1,000 to $2,000 for the first offense, and as much as $200,000 for repeated violations.|$|E
50|$|Word {{processing}} templates are ordinarily {{included as}} a regular featurein most word processing software. In addition, users of such softwareoften {{have the option to}} create and save their own templates, to acquire them from the <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> of the software, or from third parties.|$|E
50|$|The <b>original</b> {{hardware}} <b>vendors</b> are in {{some cases}} supportive of these efforts (Linksys with the WRT54G) or at the least tolerate {{the use of such}} software by end users (see TiVo hacking). Others {{go to great lengths to}} try and stop these alternative implementations.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 March 2014, the Supreme Court {{affirmed the}} ruling of the Jerusalem District Court {{regarding}} ownership. The {{court found that}} the <b>original</b> <b>vendors</b> had {{turned a blind eye}} to the fact that the buyer was a strawman working for a Jewish group. The court determined that the property should only be handed over after approval of the Minister of Defense to register the property in the name of the settlers. The ruling also did not oblige the Government to register the settler’s rights. The court however ruled that the purchasers still owed the vendor $217,000 on the transaction, and could not reinhabit the property until the outstanding sum had been paid. [...] Peace Now called the potential new settlement [...] "a disaster-in-the-Making".|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{can spend}} their time reverse engineering, {{performing}} reverse analysis, or making substantive contributions to digital forensics science. Although work {{in all of these}} areas is important, it is the scientific breakthroughs that are the most critical for addressing the challenges that we face. Reverse Engineering is the traditional bread-and-butter of digital forensics research. Companies like Microsoft and Apple deliver computational artifacts (operating systems, applications and phones) to the commercial market. These artifacts are bought and used by billions. Some have evil intent, and (if society is lucky), the computers end {{up in the hands of}} law enforcement. Unfortunately the <b>original</b> <b>vendors</b> rarely provide digital forensics tools that make their systems amenable to analysis by law enforcement. Hence the need for reverse engineering.

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007, the <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> was removed and {{services}} were redesigned and improved using Meridian Environmental Technology. The effort to redesign and improve service undertaken of 2007 to revamp WYDOT's 511 Travel Information telephone service is paying benefits this winter, based on recent customer feedback.|$|E
50|$|Return to vendor (RTV) {{refers to}} the process where goods are {{returned}} to the <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> instead of the distributor. In many cases the RTV was originally returned to the seller by the end consumer. While RTV transactions usually occur between the seller and the vendor, in some instances the end consumer will return the product directly to the vendor, sidestepping the distributor.|$|E
50|$|VistaJet's {{business}} model is said by Flohr to be {{a reaction to}} his experience of fractional jet ownership, where usage prices tend to be lower but the overall cost of ownership is potentially greater. Fractional owners have no secondary market to sell their fraction to, other than the <b>original</b> <b>vendor,</b> who sets the price and is, in effect, in a monopoly purchaser position.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>{{original}}</b> switch <b>vendor</b> {{can usually}} be deciphered from the EMC model name. Typically, model numbers {{are the same as}} the original number and the model name is suffixed with a letter denoting the original brand - B or M, for Brocade Communications Systems and McData (which was acquired by Brocade) respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Situated in {{the midst}} of Downtown in the area where the city was born in 1781, Olvera Street is home to dozens of craft shops, {{restaurants}} and businesses with roving troubadours. This pedestrian mall is a block-long narrow, tree-shaded, brick-lined marketplace where some merchants are descended from the <b>original</b> <b>vendors</b> who opened shops when Olvera Street was created in 1930. The exterior facades of the brick buildings enclosing Olvera Street and on the small vendor stands lining its center are colorful piñatas, hanging puppets in white peasant garb, Mexican pottery, serapes, mounted bull horns, and oversized sombreros. Olvera Street attracts almost two million visitors per year who can find the customs and trades of the Mexican and Latino traditions of Los Angeles commemorated in an walkable outdoor shopping mall. As a tourist attraction, Olvera Street pays homage to a romantic vision of old Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|Levy {{further criticised}} Keene for selling {{three of his}} own {{companies}} to Brain Games Network PLC (BGN) for £220,000 despite their being [...] "virtually worthless". The three companies had between them [...] "a total capital and reserves of only £2,300". At much the same time, according to Levy, BGN purchased a web site and two domain names from Chess and Bridge Limited. However, they made the purchase in two stages. The first of these stages was its sale to Giloberg Finance Limited, owned by Keene's associate Alan Lubin: the second was the immediate sale of the same items, by Giloberg, to BGN. The first sale was for approximately £60,000 (in fact $100,000) and the second was for £290,000, hence making Giloberg [...] "an instant profit of approximately £230,000" [...] and raising {{the question of why}} BGN should have paid a sum much greater than the <b>original</b> <b>vendors</b> considered the items were worth.|$|R

50|$|Those {{who support}} the {{existence}} of the secondary ticket market say it is merely a natural phenomena with the potential to garner greater economic efficiency for buyers and sellers. “A ticket never moves into the secondary market in the first place unless the <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> has been paid their asking price. Moreover, the originator would benefit from the seat being filled as this would improve souvenir sales and concessions.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, {{a third-party}} software component is a reusable software component developed {{to be either}} freely distributed or sold by an entity other than the <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> of the development platform. The third-party software component market thrives because many programmers believe that component-oriented development improves the efficiency {{and the quality of}} developing custom applications. Common third-party software includes macros, bots, and software/scripts to be run as add-ons for popular developing software.|$|E
40|$|It is an {{important}} trend to expand the use of bibliographic records from the supply chain for libraries. However, what are the sources of vendors’ bibliographic records? Their quality? How do libraries deal with these bibliographic records? Are they satisfied them? This study first drawn 1, 080 bibliographic records from 29 e-book products, and MarcEdit was used to check their quality and 14 % were found to contain errors. Secondly, this study interviewed 12 vendors {{and found out that}} bibliographic records of western books were mostly copied from the OCLC, and there were also bibliographic records from the <b>original</b> <b>vendors</b> who commissioned outsource companies to do the cataloging process. In addition, there were those cataloged by Taiwanese manufacturers themselves. Lastly, this study sent questionnaires to Taiwan Academic E-Book & Database Consortium members to survey their satisfaction on bibliographic records provided by vendors and their recommendations thereof. This study shows that most libraries have inputted the bibliographic records of the e-books into their OPAC system and are generally satisfied with the bibliographic records provided by the vendors, though opinions vary on the accuracy of these records...|$|R

AirSend had been implemented {{by a number}} of CG manufacturers including VizRT and Chyron. In order to quickly bring these products into the NDI space, NewTek created a new driver to replace the existing AirSend driver, which could be installed on these existing AirSend compatible devices, instantly converting them to NDI compatible devices with no change required by the <b>original</b> CG <b>vendors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ontario.2048 is a {{computer}} virus, discovered in September 1992. It is {{the third and final}} known variant of the Ontario family, both chronologically and in complexity. Because of its rather extreme differences from the <b>original</b> virus, some <b>vendors</b> identify it {{as a member of a}} separate family - hence the alias Bootache.2048.|$|R

5000|$|Even {{when the}} <b>original</b> <b>vendor</b> is {{genuinely}} interested in promoting a healthy competition (so {{that he may}} also benefit from the resulting innovative market), post-facto interoperability may often be undesirable as many defects or quirks can be directly {{traced back to the}} original implementation's technical limitations. Although in an open process, anyone may identify and correct such limitations, and the resulting cleaner specification may be used by all vendors, this is more difficult post-facto, as customers already have valuable information and processes encoded in the faulty but dominant product, and other vendors are forced to replicate those faults and quirks even if they could design better solutions, for the sake of preserving interoperability. Alternatively, {{it can be argued that}} even open processes are subject to the weight of past implementations and imperfect past designs, and that the power of the dominant vendor to unilaterally correct or improve the system and impose the changes to all users facilitates innovation.|$|E
5000|$|UCSD p-System was one {{of three}} {{operating}} systems, along with PC DOS and CP/M-86, that IBM offered for its <b>original</b> IBM PC. <b>Vendor</b> SofTech Microsystems emphasized p-System's application portability, with virtual machines for 20 CPUs as of the IBM PC's release.
