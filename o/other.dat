40|$|TRANSMISSIBLE spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a {{group of}} fatal {{neurodegenerative}} diseases in which an abnormal isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPSc) accumulates in tissues of the central nervous system. Accumulation of PrPSc occurs in the retina, a rostral projection of the central nervous system, of both natural and nonnatural host species with TSEs (Foster and <b>others</b> 1999, Spraker and <b>others</b> 2002, Head and <b>others</b> 2003, 2005, Hamir and <b>others</b> 2004, 2005, Kercher and <b>others</b> 2004, Greenlee and <b>others</b> 2006, Hortells and <b>others</b> 2006). In retinas from scrapie-affected sheep, PrPSc accumulation is primarily observed in {{the inner and outer}} plexiform layers, and in the ganglion cell layer (Jeffrey and <b>others</b> 2001, Greenlee and <b>others</b> 2006). Recent studies have reported few (Hortells and <b>others</b> 2006) or no (Greenlee and <b>others</b> 2006) histological lesions in the retinas of sheep affected with scrapie.
