25|$|During the {{depression}} of 1873–96, most European countries experienced a drastic fall in prices. Still, many corporations {{were able to}} reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates, and, as a result, industrial production increased by 40% in Britain and by over 100% in Germany. A comparison of capital formation rates {{in the two countries}} helps to account for the different industrial growth rates. During {{the depression}} the British ratio of net national capital formation to net national product fell from 11.5% to 6.0% while Germany's rose from 10.6% to 15.9%. In essence, {{during the course of the}} depression, Britain took the course of static supply adjustment while Germany stimulated effective demand and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting capital formation. For example, Germany dramatically increased investment with regard to social <b>overhead</b> <b>capital,</b> such as in the management of electric power transmission lines, roads, and railroads, while this input stagnated or decreased in Britain and the investment helped to stimulate industrial demand in Germany. The resulting difference in capital formation accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production in the two countries and the different growth rates during and after the depression.|$|E

MethodsThe cost approaches were compared independently for appendectomy, hip replacement, cataract, and stroke in representative general hospitals in The Netherlands for 2005. ResultsHourly rate allocation and inpatient day allocation produce estimates that are not significantly different from weighted service allocation. ConclusionsHourly rate allocation may be a strong alternative to weighted service allocation for hospital services with a relatively short inpatient stay.

This less competitiveness encourage the demand for Islamic products may fall leaving the Islamic banks. Good debtors opted for conventional loans since the interest rates paid were relatively lower and the rest (the bad debtors) successfully made their way to Islamic banks. Therefore, the nonperforming financing of Islamic banks is high.

Secondly, the techniques of economic evaluation which follow from this definition are introduced: they are cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis. Thirdly, a list of costs which should be considered for inclusion in either {{of these types of}} evaluation is provided, this listing being based on the concept of opportunity cost. Problems of measurement and valuation of costs are then outlined, focussing in particular on inflation, discounting, marginal costing, patient-based versus per diem costing, allocating <b>overheads,</b> costing <b>capital</b> and equipment and adjusting distorted market valuations.

The intuition behind the paper is that materials input is likely to be measured with less cyclical error than labor and capital input, and materials are likely to be used in strict proportion to value added. In that case, materials growth provides a good measure of the unobserved changes in capital and labor input. I find that labor hoarding and cyclical capital utilization are quanititatively significant: the true growth of variable labor and capital inputs is, on average, almost twice the measured change in the capital stock or labor hours. More than half of that is caused by the presence of overhead inputs in production; the rest is due to cyclical factor utilization...|$|R

Even though inpatient days, outpatient visits, and daycare treatments are frequently the main drivers of total treatment costs, their unit costs often lack generalizability. Therefore, we aimed to determine the unit costs of inpatient hospital days, outpatient visits, and daycare treatments specifically for oncological and hematological diseases in The Netherlands from the hospital's perspective. MethodsUnit costs were collected from 30 oncological and hematological departments of 6 university and 24 general hospitals. Costs included direct labor and indirect labor, hotel and nutrition, <b>overheads</b> and <b>capital.</b> Ordinary least squares regression models were constructed to examine the degree of association between unit costs and hospital and hospital department characteristics. All costs were based on Euro 2007 cost data. ResultsAt university hospitals, the unit costs per inpatient day were determined at € 633 in oncological and € 680 in hematological departments. At general hospitals, the mean costs per inpatient day were € 400. Unit costs for inpatient hospital days, outpatient visits. and daycare treatments equalled the relative ratio 100 : 21 : 44. Direct labor costs were the major cost driver and the type of hospital (university, yes/no) was a strong predictor of unit costs.

In other words the research suggests that although 3 D printed parts created on different machines might appear physically identical, their energy costs will be anything but.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} I examine, from a policy perspective, the {{contribution}} of non-formal adult education (NFAE) to social sustainability through its contribution to vocational learning. I draw on five country case studies of NFAE in the Asia-Pacific region: Australia, Fiji, India, the Philippines, and Thailand. Vocational learning can enhance social sustainability because it facilitates the development of individual capacity for meaningful, productive, and competitive engagement in income generation. The case studies highlight a number of common qualities in {{the contribution of}} NFAE to vocational learning. NFAE was found {{in each of the}} countries to be an important provider of vocational education and a contributor more broadly to vocational learning outcomes. That contribution was facilitated by the low <b>capital</b> <b>overheads</b> and the high situational responsiveness and cost effectiveness of provision in the NFAE sector. The sector's involvement in vocational education also raised a number of tensions, which need to be considered in policy initiatives and reviews. The democratic, participative, community-based, and humanistic nature of NFAE provision, and its commitment to social justice, also benefit its promotion of informed, active, and responsible citizenship, which itself encourages productive self-employment or cooperative enterprise.

40|$|Productivity is a {{significant}} issue in the US auto industry that is often viewed as {{the success or failure}} that a vehicle assembly plant can make or break their production schedule. In other words, productivity is often looked at {{in terms of the number}} of assembled vehicles produced per year. While high production volume is an important indicator in a manufacturing environment, it certainly does not necessarily imply high productivity. By definition, Productivity is the ratio of output (number of vehicles produced) divided by all input resources such as labor, material, <b>capital,</b> <b>overhead,</b> health and energy costs. Improvement in productivity can be achieved in two ways: a reduction of inputs while output remains constant, or an increase in output while inputs remain constant. Energy is the single most controllable cost parameter in the input parameters of the productivity equation. In today’s competitive marketplace, energy efficiency can provide means to improve productivity through reducing the manufacturing energy cost. This paper addresses this missing link between energy and productivity in U. S. auto industry. Furthermore, it outlines a methodological approach for driving improvements in energy usage in a major vehicle assembly plant in US. It is hoped that efforts in this direction would pave the road to better understand role of energy as an important factor in the assembly plant’s vision to productivity improvement...|$|R
40|$|Environmental impacts {{are caused}} the by {{consumption}} {{of material and}} energy or the release of emissions. They can be reduced by optimizing corporate material and energy flows based {{on the principles of}} eco-efficiency management. The basis for this is a higher transparency on corporate material flows. It can be reached by setting up an environmental controlling. The most practicable instrument within environmental controlling is the application of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPI). They can be used to efficiently monitor and control material and energy efficiently on a continuous basis. In the presented dissertation, a procedure model is described for the introduction of an integrative environmental controlling and the development of the required information supply using an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP System). The development of the EPI system’s information supply uses the ERP System as an information source and as a basis to implement the IT support of the EPI system. The material master data in the ERP System is enhanced by an EPI key. Booking locations (cost center groups, cost centers or storage locations) are attributed to EPIs. Existing material bookings are classified according to their movement type and are attributed to the respective EPIs with booking rules. The material bookings goods receipt/good issue, confirmed production order, <b>overhead</b> order, <b>capital</b> spending order, and inventory difference adjustment are used. Information not available in the ERP System is identified in other information systems and imported into the ERP System. Additional data required is acquired separately. Finally, an IT support for the EPI system is implemented using functionalities in the ERP System to administrate corporate performance indicators. The practical implementation of the procedure model is described based on its application with two industrial companies. In both cases, the ERP System SAP R/ 3 by SAP AG was used. It was shown that the developed EPI System supplies structured information on corporate material flows and increases the transparency on material and enegry flows in the company. Thus, a basis for the systematic reduction of material and energy consumption and the emission of pollutants was created. The achieved solution also serves to give account to stakeholders customers, shareholders, employees and public authorities. Internal reports (to inform cost center responsibles or employees) as well as external reports (e. g. on CO 2 or VOC emissions or on the consumption of substances containing heavy metals) can be generated more easily...|$|R
