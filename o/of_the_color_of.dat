5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1874 {{as a species}} of Boletus, the fungus has also been classified in the genus Leccinum because of the scabers on the stipe, or in Tylopilus because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the spore print. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that the lilac-brown bolete was separate from both of these genera, and merited placement in a new genus. Sutorius was created to contain this bolete and the closely related Australian species S.australiensis.|$|E

25|$|In this assessment, {{a person}} is asked to select a card from a deck with {{different}} mandalas (designs enclosed in a geometric shape) and then must choose a color from a set of colored cards. The person is then asked to draw the mandala from the card they choose with an oil pastel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> their choice. The artist is then asked to explain {{if there were any}} meanings, experiences, or related information related to the mandala they drew. This test is based on the beliefs of Joan Kellogg, who sees a recurring correlation between the images, pattern and shapes in the mandalas that people draw and the personalities of the artists. This test assesses and gives clues to a person's psychological progressions and their current psychological condition (Malchiodi 1998).|$|E
25|$|On weekdays {{that are}} not major feasts Vespers {{features}} hardly any ceremonies and the celebrant wears the usual choir dress. However, on Sundays and greater feasts Vespers may be solemn. Solemn Vespers differ in that the celebrant wears the cope, he is assisted by assistants also in copes, incense is used, and two acolytes, a thurifer, {{and at least one}} master of ceremonies are needed. On ordinary Sundays only two assistants are needed while on greater feasts four or six assistants may be used. The celebrant and assistants vest in the surplice and the cope, which is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the day. The celebrant sits at the sedile, in front of which is placed a lectern, covered with a cloth in the color of the day. The assistants sit on benches or stools facing the altar, or if there are two assistants, they may sit at the sedile next to the celebrant (the first assistant in the place of the deacon and the second assistant in place of the subdeacon).|$|E

On September 1, 1945, Samuel K. Allison used the occasion of the announcement of the founding of the Institute for Nuclear Studies to call for freedom to research and develop atomic energy. He told the press that if controls were not removed, nuclear scientists might turn to the study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> butterfly wings.

500|$|Both Lilium and Tulipa are {{susceptible}} {{to a group of}} five viruses of the Potyviridae family, specifically the potyvirus (named for Potato virus Y) group, which includes the Tulip-breaking Virus TBV and the Lily streak virus (Lily mottle virus, LMoV) [...] resulting in 'breaking' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the flowers. The viruses are transmitted by aphids. This breaking effect was of economic importance during the tulip mania of the seventeenth century, because it appeared to be producing new varieties. In modern times tulip breeders have produced varieties that mimic the effect of the virus, without being infected. One of these varieties is known as 'Rembrandt', after the Dutch artist of that name. Contemporary tulip owners commonly had Rembrandt and other artists paint their flowers to preserve them for posterity, hence the 'broken' tulips were known as Rembrandt tulips at that time. Another modern variety is 'Princess Irene'. One of the tulip breaking viruses is also named the Rembrandt tulip-breaking virus (ReTBV).|$|E
500|$|Various {{authorities}} have treated the taxon {{as either a}} Boletus, Leccinum, or Tylopilus, depending on which morphological characteristics they deemed most significant. Rolf Singer initially considered the species most appropriately placed in Tylopilus {{on account of the}} reddish-brown spore print, a taxonomic opinion shared by Alexander H. Smith and Harry Thiers, who wrote [...] "Concerning whether or not the species should be placed in Leccinum, we can only say that the color of the stipe ornamentation is merely a reflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the stipe generally and that it does not change color in a characteristic pattern as it ages. For this reason we exclude it from Leccinum and agree with Singer that it is a Tylopilus." [...] Later however, Singer thought the somewhat scabrous ornamentation of the stipe justified a placement in Leccinum. René Pomerleau had previously (1959) placed the species in Leccinum, but this transfer was invalid, as no basionym was specified.|$|E

[...] At times, when the tree bares its pale blossoms and big blue flies, emerald fruit beetles and cicadas in great numbers fly about, everything is immersed in pure blue. [...] Then, as the bronzer foliage takes on more mature tones, the sky is radiant and streaked with green and orange, and then again, further into autumn, the leaves take on violet tones something <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> a ripe fig, and this violet effect manifests itself most fully with the contrast of the large, whitening sun within its pale halo of light lemon. [...] Sometimes, too, after a shower I've seen the whole sky pink and orange, which gave an exquisite value and coloring to the silvery gray-greens. [...] And among all this were women, also pink, who were gathering the fruit." ...|$|E
