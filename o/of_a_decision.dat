5|$|Epatiana succeeded {{his father}} as King of Rurutu around 1886, while still a young child. Due to historians' lack of {{consensus}} about his birth year, sources differ on the actual age of Epatiana at the time. This early succession was a consequence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> taken in old age by Epatiana's father to abdicate and journey back to his homeland of Huahine, where he died shortly after arrival. The body of Teuruarii III was repatriated to Rurutu and interred in the royal cemetery. Because of Epatiana's youth and inexperience, his mother Taarouru served as regent for an indeterminate number of years until the prince was deemed fit to rule independently.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 1826, Rowan {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation to reorganize the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur with a decision in order to strike down a law as unconstitutional. The amendment, which ultimately failed, was offered in the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> by the Supreme Court of the United States declaring an occupying claimant law to be unconstitutional; Rowan personally disagreed with the Court's decision. Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of the federal courts {{would be subject to}} state laws when carrying out the decisions of the federal courts. After a month of debate, the entire bill was tabled.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's deferral in December 2015 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on {{plans for a}} third runway at Heathrow Airport {{until after the election}} was interpreted as an attempt to avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs on the Tube, while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his negative comments about homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to {{establish}} (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, {{at a point in}} time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} error {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stochastic <b>decision</b> {{and the way}} in which it differs from the error probability <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal <b>decision,</b> i. e., the maximum <b>a</b> posteriori <b>decision.</b> This paper calls attention to the fact that the error probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stochastic <b>decision</b> with the <b>a</b> posteriori distribution is at most twice the error probability <b>of</b> the maximum <b>a</b> posteriori <b>decision.</b> It is shown that, by generating an independent identically distributed random sequence subject to the a posteriori distribution and making <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> that maximizes the a posteriori probability over the sequence, the error probability approaches exponentially the error probability <b>of</b> the maximum <b>a</b> posteriori <b>decision</b> as the sequence length increases.
