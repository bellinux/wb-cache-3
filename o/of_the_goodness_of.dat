2500|$|Shortly after {{publishing}} Riddles of the Sphinx, Schiller became {{acquainted with}} the work of pragmatist philosopher William James and this changed the course of his career. For a time, Schiller's work became focused on extending and developing James' pragmatism (under Schiller's preferred title, [...] "humanism"). Schiller even revised his earlier work Riddles of the Sphinx to make the nascent pragmatism implicit in that work more explicit. In one of Schiller's most prominent works during this phase of his career, [...] "Axioms as Postulates" [...] (1903), Schiller extended James' will to believe doctrine to show how it could be used to justify not only an acceptance of God, but also our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> God, and more.|$|E

2500|$|While Schiller's will {{to believe}} is a central theme of Riddle of the Sphinx (appearing mainly in the {{introduction}} and conclusion of his text), in 1891 the doctrine held a limited role in Schiller's philosophy. In Riddles, Schiller only employs {{his version of the}} will to believe doctrine when he is faced with overcoming sceptic and pessimistic methods of philosophy. In 1897, William James published his essay [...] "The Will to Believe" [...] and this influenced Schiller to drastically expanded his application of the doctrine. For a 1903 volume titled Personal Idealism, Schiller contributed a widely read essay titled [...] "Axioms as Postulates" [...] in which he sets out to justify the [...] "axioms of logic" [...] as postulates adopted {{on the basis of the}} will to believe doctrine. In this essay Schiller extends the will to believe doctrine to be the basis of our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goodness</b> <b>of</b> God, and more.
