40|$|Parents’ {{financial}} and human capital resources, especially, {{that of the}} mother {{have been shown to}} be an important component contributing to parents’ division <b>of</b> the <b>parental</b> leave. In this study the effect of relative resources on fathers’ use <b>of</b> the <b>parental</b> leave are considered. In this paper, multinomial logistic regression is applied in a nationally representative sample survey that was conducted by the National Social insurance Agency. Results indicate some association between fathers’ share <b>of</b> the <b>parental</b> leave and relative {{financial and}} human capital resources. Among fathers higher relative income was partially associated with decreased share of the leave, while for relative level of education it is the mothers’ level of education that affects fathers to use higher share <b>of</b> the <b>parental</b> leave. In addition, among fathers having a job in the private sector especially if the mother is in the public sector reduced fathers’ sharing <b>of</b> the <b>parental</b> leave. Oppositely if the father is in the public sector, while the mother works in private sector further fathers’ share <b>of</b> the <b>parental</b> leave...|$|R

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected characteristics. In contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E
5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely {{interact}} {{with one another}} except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E

5|$|The {{length and}} nature <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care varies widely amongst {{different}} orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs {{itself out of}} the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take {{up to six months}} to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent.

5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less {{likely it is that}} any degree <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E

5|$|The {{duration}} <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care in frigatebirds {{is among}} the longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids. Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine {{years of age and}} by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{point at}} which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, {{following}} their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, {{they are able to}} fly. The amount <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E

The level <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> education and commitment required is higher than with medication.|$|E
5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period <b>of</b> <b>parental</b> care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling.

The role of mating and parenting effort, cross-species comparisons <b>of</b> male <b>parental</b> care, and possible hormonal causations for male parental care are addressed As a proxy for investment male hunting is examined against two competing hypotheses used to elucidate that activity, the cooperative pair-bonding model and the signaling model. It is demonstrated that the assumptions found in the 2 ̆ 2 show-off 2 ̆ 2 hypothesis do not adequately explain hunting in terms <b>of</b> male <b>parental</b> investment. From this analysis, it is proposed that male parental investment is best explained in terms of a combination of the pairbonding model and a bargaining-model wherein males seek equilibrium between mating and parenting effort based on available environmental, constraints, both physical and social. Only by adjusting to these given circumstances can males effectively maximize their reproductive potential...|$|R
