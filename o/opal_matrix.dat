40|$|We {{consider}} two equations for {{the filling}} factor estimation of infiltrated zinc oxide (ZnO) in silica (SiO 2) opal and gallium nitride in ZnO opal. The first equation {{is based on}} the effective medium approximation, while the second one - on Maxwell-Garnett approximation. The comparison between two filling factors shows that both equations can be equally used for the estimation of the quantity of infiltrated nanocrystals inside <b>opal</b> <b>matrix...</b>|$|E
40|$|Using the sol-gel technique, BaTiO 3 was {{embedded}} into nanoporous Vycor {{and artificial}} vitreous opal silica {{for the first}} time. About 50 vol% of the pores was filled. In case of the Vycor glass (pore diameter 4 – 6 nm) only amorphous phase was revealed by XRD, IR reflectivity and Raman spectra. After additional gradual annealing, no crystallization was achieved. Chemical reaction with the SiO 2 skeleton started at ~ 1000 K. The room-temperature IR and Raman spectra clearly show characteristic vibrational modes of the ferroelectrically distorted TiO 6 octahedra without any long-range order. In case of the <b>opal</b> <b>matrix</b> (densely packed silica spheres, pore diameter up to ~ 50 nm), crystallization of the ferroelectric BaTiO 3 appeared in coexistence with the amorphous phase, but the penetration depth of the crystalline BaTiO 3 was limited. From the apparent temperature independence of the effective wide-frequency dielectric response due to the essentially temperature independent effective soft mode stiffened to ~ 100 cm- 1, we can deduce that no macroscopic percolation of the crystalline BaTiO 3 has appeared in our <b>opal</b> <b>matrix.</b> Nevertheless, Raman spectra bring evidence of a diffuse ferroelectric phase transition in the opal-BaTiO 3 composite...|$|E
40|$|Scanning {{tunneling}} microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) {{are used}} to investigate the local electronic behavior of Pt-Si nanostructures fabricated in an <b>opal</b> <b>matrix</b> formed by silica spheres of 250 nm diameter. Si and Pt are regularly distributed inside the opal pores and form nanoscale metal-semiconductor-metal junctions. Normalized differential conductance curves enable us to study the distribution of Pt and Si and to detect the presence of regions showing a surface band gap in the range 0. 5 - 0. 8 eV, possibly associated {{with the formation of}} silicides. STS appears as a suitable technique for the electrical characterization of opal-based nanostructures...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{results of}} the {{investigations}} of the photon-phonon interaction in orderly packed silica dioxide (<b>opal</b> <b>matrices)</b> and nanocomposites on their base are presented. Effective conversion of laser light into acoustic vibrations of nanospheres, composing matrix, is shown to exist in such structures. Frequency shifts of the scattered light components are shown to correspond to the nanospheres vibrations eigenvalues. Stimulated scatterings of light generation in <b>opal</b> <b>matrices</b> dependence on the band-gap position is investigated...|$|R
40|$|Interaction of {{electromagnetic}} waves with nanocomposites of materials obtained by doping of <b>opal</b> <b>matrixes</b> with nickel-zinc and manganese-zinc ferrite has been studied. The <b>opal</b> <b>matrixes</b> contain of SiO 2 nanospheres with diameter about 250 nm with ferrite nanoparticles in the nanosphere voids.

For the formation of nanocomposites are used sample <b>opal</b> <b>matrices</b> with dimensions of single-domain regions >= 0, 1 mm. { 3 } The diameter of SiO[2] nanospheres was ~ 260 nm. Obtained nanocomposites volume > 2 cm{ 3 } in filling > 20 % of interspherical nanospacing PbTiO[3], PbTi[3]O[7] crystallites were size of 16 - 36 nm. Using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy are studied composition and structural stability when heated nanocomposites to 550 °C, which allowed the identification of a local phase transition with change of the space group. The dependence of the composition of synthesized materials on the conditions of their preparation is submitted...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of a Fano resonance between continuum Mie scattering and a narrow Bragg band in synthetic opal photonic crystals. The resonance leads to a transmission spectrum exhibiting a Bragg dip with an asymmetric profile, which can be tunably reversed to a Bragg rise. The Fano asymmetry parameter is linked with the dielectric contrast between the permittivity of the filler and the specific value determined by the <b>opal</b> <b>matrix.</b> The existence of the Fano resonance {{is directly related to}} disorder due to non-uniformity of a-SiO 2 opal spheres. Proposed theoretical "quasi- 3 D" model produces results in excellent agreement with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} the {{photonic}} band gap in the photonic crystal, the synthesized SiO(2) opal with embedded CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, on its luminescence in the visible spectral region is studied. It is shown that {{the position of the}} photonic band gap in the luminescence and reflectance spectra for the infiltrated opal depends on the diameter of the constituent nanospheres and on the angle of recording the signal. The optimal conditions for embedding the CdSe/ZnS quantum dots from the solution into the <b>opal</b> <b>matrix</b> are determined. It is found that, for the opal-CdSe/ZnS nanocomposites, the emission intensity decreases and the luminescence decay time increases in the spatial directions, in which the spectral positions of the photonic band gap and the luminescence peak of the quantum dots coincide...|$|E
40|$|The temperature-dependent {{photoluminescence}} (PL) {{spectra of}} zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals deposited inside the ultraviolet (UV) opal were studied. ZnO was {{grown in the}} voids between FCC packed silicon dioxide spheres using spray pyrolysis under ultrasonic vibration in the solution containing a zinc nitrate precursor. The ZnO nanoparticles inside <b>opal</b> <b>matrix</b> with UV photonic band-gap exhibit suppression of the excitonic emission and enhancement of the deep level emission. Suppression of the excitonic lines {{is due to the}} inhibition of spontaneous emission, while enhancement and broadening of the DL emission in the green spectral region is due to Purcell effect. The infiltration of ZnO inside the photonic crystal may be a useful technique to increase its emission efficiency in the selected spectral region. Comment: 22 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} the results of studies of electromagnetic properties of nanocomposites based on <b>opal</b> <b>matrices</b> in the millimeter wavelength range. It is shown that the application of an external magnetic field changes the transmission and reflection coefficients.

40|$|Stimulated {{globular}} scattering (SGS) characteristics (frequency shifts, threshold, conversion efficiency) {{have been}} studied in photonic crystals (synthetic <b>opal</b> <b>matrices</b> and <b>opal</b> nanocomposites) at different temperatures. Results have been compared with stimulated Raman scattering investigations in calcite single crystals. In both cases temperature lowering from + 20 C to - 196 C resulted in the stimulated scattering energy increase and its redistribution to the higher order components.

40|$|Synthetic opals were {{prepared}} on {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) glass substrates from a highly monodisperse polystyrene dispersion. Platinum was then electrodeposited through the interstitial space of the <b>opal</b> <b>matrix.</b> The platinum inverse opal (Pt-IOp) was subsequently obtained by {{the removal of the}} polystyrene template, leaving a highly ordered three dimensional structure. Both the opal template and platinum (Pt) inverse opal were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The results confirmed that the Pt inverse opal (Pt-IOp) has a microporous structure with high surface area and exhibits excellent electrochemical property. The electrocatalytic application of the resulting nanostructured Pt inverse opal electrodes for methanol oxidation was also investigated. The nanostructured Pt-IOp electrode showed a catalytic activity and highly stable electrocatalytic performance in methanol oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic opals-composed of 250 nm {{amorphous}} silica spheres closed packed in a {{face centered cubic}} structure-have been infilled with silicon, platinum, and with Si and different Pt contents. The luminescent properties of these composites have been investigated by cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy and spectroscopy. CL emission {{is influenced by the}} material used to infill the pores of the <b>opal</b> <b>matrix.</b> CL spectra of all the samples investigated show two well-known bands, associated with the defect structure of the silica spheres, centered at about 1. 9 and 2. 7 eV, respectively. Emission in the 2. 15 - 2. 45 eV range, particularly intense in opal-based composites with a high Pt content, is tentatively associated with SiO 2 defects involving silicon clusters. A CL band peaked at about 3. 4 eV as well as a band in the 1. 50 - 1. 75 eV range, whose peak position seems to be affected by the Pt content of the samples, are associated with the presence of Si nanocrystals. The behavior of these emissions suggests that both are related to defect states at the interface between Si nanocrystals and SiO 2 forming the opal spheres...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{three-dimensional}} ordered synthetic opals {{formed by}} spheres of 230 nm impregnated with GaN have been investigated. In {{some of the}} samples gold and platinum were also introduced. The potential applications of GaN-opal assemblies include use in large surface area (of the order of 10 m_ 2 /cm_ 3 GaN-based light-emitting devices at a high density of elements. Also, the photonic crystal properties of perfect opal-GaN composites, characterized {{by the presence of}} a photonic band gap in the visible range, allow a substantial modification of the emitting properties of GaN-based nanodevices in this spectral region. The optical properties of GaN synthesized within interconnected opal voids have been investigated by cathodoluminescence (CL) in a scanning electron microscope. X-ray spectra have been obtained in order to test the quality of the GaN inside the voids. All CL spectra of the samples show a predominant emission centered at about 2. 7 eV which is attributed to the <b>opal</b> <b>matrix.</b> CL spectra also reveal some differences in the spectral distribution of the luminescence which depends on the electron beam-sample orientation. Inhibition of the band edge emission of GaN has been observed in most of the samples. A possible correlation of this effect with the existence of a photonic band gap in the samples is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Stimulated low {{frequency}} Raman scattering (SLFRS) in single-crystal diamond films (SCD) with a graphitized layer built-in is investigated. SLFRS process in all studied structures has frequency shift in gigahertz range (5. 1 - 13. 2 GHz). Coherent phonon mode excitation at a frequency of several GHz {{is a result}} of nonlinear interaction of high-power laser wave with submicron films. SLFRS conversion efficiency and threshold is estimated experimentally. Comparison of the obtained results with data on SLFRS properties in synthetic <b>opal</b> <b>matrixes</b> is made.

40|$|The {{photoluminescence}} (PL) of ZnO-opal structures {{excited by}} a 351. 1 nm laser line was studied. The fabrication of these structures {{was done by}} infiltration of ZnO from an aqueous solution of zinc nitrate into <b>opal</b> <b>matrices.</b> It was observed that the emission spectrum of thick ZnO layers grown {{on the surface of}} bulk opals exhibited narrow PL bands associated with the recombination of bound and free-excitons. The results showed that the strong exciton-LO phonon and exciton-Frohlich mode coupling in ZnO nanostructures was deduced from the analysis of multiphonon excitonic resonant Raman scattering.

40|$|The {{results of}} the spectral, energetical and {{temporal}} characteristics of radiation {{in the presence of}} the photonic flame effect are presented. Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boiling point (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long- term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structured spectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visible luminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificial opals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated with different nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced and the spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface is being changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on the Cu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species of the liquids.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} research evaluating the open educational practices (OEP) of three global health projects operating outside academia - the International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP), the Virtual Campus of Public Health (VCPH), and Physiopedia. The projects all use Creative Commons licences, are not-for-profit, and aim to increase health professionals’ access to high quality resources, especially in low-income countries. The projects were evaluated against two frameworks – the <b>OPAL</b> OEP maturity <b>matrix,</b> and Vrieling’s OEP social configuration framework. Numerous innovative OEP were identified, from which academia could learn, including IACAPAP’s open textbook, created collaboratively by child psychiatrists in 24 countries, Physiopedia’s 1400 article wiki {{and use of}} open badges, and VCPH’s large repository of health-related OER in three languages. However, {{some of the most}} innovative OEP – for example localisation of resources – are not accommodated by either of the frameworks we used. We argue that an extended OEP evaluation framework is needed in order to better encompass vocational learning and to better evaluate the application and impact of OEP outside formal education...|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{stable isotope}} {{variation}} and mineralogical changes in fractured rock may help establish {{the history of}} climatic and geomorphological processes that might affect the isolation properties of a waste repository site. This study examines {{the use of the}} stable isotope ratios of oxygen ({sup 18 }O/{sup 16 }O) and carbon ({sup 13 }C/{sup 12 }C) in authigenic minerals as hydrogeochemical tools tracing low-temperature rock-water interaction in variably-saturated fractured stuff. Isotopic compositions of fracture-filling and rock matrix minerals in the Apache Leap tuff, near Superior, Arizona were concordant with geothermal temperatures and in equilibrium with water isotopically similar to present-day meteoric water and groundwater. Oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of fracture-filling, in unsaturated fractured tuff, displayed an isotopic gradient believed to result from near-surface isotopic enrichment due to evaporation rather than the effects of rock-water interaction. Oxygen isotope ratios of rock <b>matrix</b> <b>opal</b> samples exhibited an isotopic gradient believed to result from, leaching and reprecipitation of silica at depth. Methods and results can be used to further define primary flowpaths and the movement of water in variably-saturated fractured rock. 71 refs., 23 figs., 3 tabs...|$|R
