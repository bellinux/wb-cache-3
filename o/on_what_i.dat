The word brisingr is an ancient Old Norse word meaning [...] "fire", which Paolini found while reading through a {{dictionary}} of word origins. Paolini said he [...] "loved it so much, he decided to base the rest of [...] on Old Norse. To find more words, I went online and dug up dictionaries and guides to the language. I invented more words based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> learned and then formed a system of grammar and a pronunciation guide to fit my world.

The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to your friends and family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E
500|$|Development of Solar 2 {{lasted for}} at least ten months. The game was {{developed}} using Microsoft XNA, a set of tools focused on video game development created by Microsoft. According to Watts, Solar 2 was [...] "mainly expanding on [...] original idea and polishing it to perfection." [...] However, he commented {{that the concept of}} both games took several design iterations to reach its final version: [...] "I played with many, many ideas before finally settling <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have now." [...] Sound designer and musician JP Neufeld composed the game's score. According to Watts, this was done because there was [...] "no way I could do music as good as he can." [...] Both the Windows and Xbox 360 version of the game were developed simultaneously. About the Xbox 360 version, Watts commented that [...] "the lack of keyboards and the aging Xbox 360 hardware were a bit tricky, and updating the Xbox version is a huge pain to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, I had more time, and I focused more <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E

2500|$|Speaking on June 19 at a {{press conference}} in Baltimore, FBI Director James Comey said, while his agency was {{investigating}} the shooting as a [...] "hate crime", he did not consider it an [...] "act of terrorism", citing the lack of political motivation for the suspect's actions. He said, [...] "Terrorism is act of violence done or threatened {{in order to try to}} influence a public body or citizenry, so it's more of a political act, and again, based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know, I don't see this as a political act.

[...] I ran as fast as I could diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] At last I was tackled <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> afterwards learned was about the six-yard line. [...] I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and managed to crawl over the line.

Recent research has discovered that “JP” refers to Elizabeth Prismall, who was a British secretary on Hughes’ staff.

Hughes, of his own volition, informed Kate of Mrs. Prismall’s presence explaining in a letter dated March 8, 1943, [...] "I have taken Mrs. Prismall to the mess several times and during the past few days….So you’ll soon here [...] that Hughes has a girl friend [...] along with the rest.

2500|$|One {{week after}} {{shooting}} began, the film's production company went bankrupt, leaving the production in short supplies {{of food and}} water. Antonioni still had a large supply of film stock and {{managed to get the}} cast and crew to work for free until funding for the film was found. At one point, ships stopped making trips to Lisca Bianca and the cast and crew were stranded for three days without food or blankets. Eventually the crew went on strike and Antonioni and his Assistant Director shot the film themselves. Due to the rough condition of the sea and the difficulty in landing a ship on the rough rocks of Lisca Bianca, the cast and crew were often forced to sleep on the island. Antonioni has stated that he [...] "woke up every morning at 3 o'clock in order to be alone and reflect <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing in order to re-load myself against fatigue and a strange form of apathy or absence of will, which often took hold of us all." [...] After several weeks of Antonioni and the crew working without a budget, the production company Cino del Duca agreed to finance the film and sent money to him.|$|E
