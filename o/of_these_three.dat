5|$|In 1973, {{several years}} after its {{acquisition}} by Amperex, the manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Electronics were transferred to Slatersville. The products transferred from Advanced Micro Electronics included small signal silicon planar transistors for military and industrial applications, Leadless Inverted Devices (LIDs) and hybrid circuits using both thin and thick film technology. Manufacturing <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>three</b> products and the sales office for Philips Semiconductors were housed in Slatersville until 1992 when this business unit was sold.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{the onset of the}} first World War, four new ships were purchased: Bermagui, Bonandera, Bodalla and Bergalia. Bodalla was requisitioned for the war effort and {{repurposed}} as a minesweeper, and she was lost in 1924. After the war the company purchased another three vessels: Nergalia, Cobargo and Kianga. Two <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>three</b> boats, Nergalia and Kianga, were requisitioned during World War II, but while both survived the hostilities, Kianga was not returned to the company after being decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the chest is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the chest wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of the chest cavity; thus when the chest widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the chest is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>three</b> mechanisms.|$|E

At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions.

5|$|Under {{the reign}} of King Fuad I, two laws were passed that reorganized the {{educational}} structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Additionally, formal examinations were required to earn a degree in one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>three</b> fields of study. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed {{building across the street}} from the mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the thirteenth}} century, the islands once ruled by Magnús and his fellow members of the Crovan dynasty before him, were {{incorporated}} into the Scottish realm. In 1293, the parliament of John, King of Scots (died 1314) established three new sheriffdoms within his kingdom. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>three,</b> the Sheriffdom of Skye, was granted to William I, Earl of Ross (died 1323). This sheriffdom included the seaboard north of Ardnamurchan (Wester Ross and Kintail), and the islands of Skye, Lewis, Uist, Barra, Eigg, and Rum. It is possible that parts of the sheriffdom may have been taken over earlier, sometime after the dismantling of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.|$|E
