5|$|In 1996, Railly gives {{a lecture}} about the Cassandra complex {{to a group}} of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Dr. Peters points out to Railly that apocalypse alarmists {{represent}} the sane vision, while humanity's gradual destruction of the environment is the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the group and says that in 1990 Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines' virologist father.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{was present}} in January 1164 when the king summoned a council of the barons and the bishops to Clarendon, where the king demanded that both groups swear to uphold the royal rights of Henry's grandfather, King Henry I, without any {{reservations}} or conditions. Although Becket at first attempted to resist, he eventually submitted, and then forced the other bishops to swear also. In October 1164, Becket was accused of denying justice to a royal vassal, tried at a council held at Northampton, and was found guilty {{although he did not}} accept the sentence. During the trial, Robert attempted to moderate Becket's behaviour, by persuading him from having his archiepiscopal cross, a symbol of spiritual authority, carried in front <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he entered the court, which would have been an insult to the king. Shortly after the trial, Robert interceded with the king to order that no injury be done to Becket, who went into voluntary exile.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} modest Coronet of Frederick {{was made in}} 1728 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of GeorgeII. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by CharlesII which states that the heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear a coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by a ball and cross. The single arch denotes that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal children, whose coronets have no arches. Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion in front <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he took his seat in the House of Lords. It was used by his son, GeorgeIII, then his son, GeorgeIV, and last used by EdwardVII when he was Prince of Wales. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future GeorgeV, to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. After he became king in 1936, EdwardVIII abdicated later the same year and, as the Duke of Windsor, went into exile in France, taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad {{until his death in}} 1972. In its absence, another coronet had to be made for the investiture of Prince Charles in 1969. Unlike the defunct coronets, this one is {{not a part of the}} Crown Jewels but the Honours of the Principality of Wales.|$|E

According to the {{agreement}} with this family, his birth mother would regain custody <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> she was able to; however, this did not happen. After meeting his brother, Stefan found out that his last name is Löfven, (spelled as Löfvén, in the Swedish population register).|$|E

25|$|Howe's first 20 seasons {{came during}} {{an era when}} the {{schedule}} was only 70 games, scoring was difficult, and checking was tight; he never scored 50 goals in a single season. Despite that Howe is currently 4th on the NHL's all-time points list with 1850 total points 801 goals, and 1049 assists, after Gretzky, Mark Messier, and Jaromír Jágr. Howe is still 2nd on the all-time goals list, with only Gretzky ahead <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> career regular season goals from both the NHL and the WHA are combined, he ranks first in goals with 975, ahead of Gretzky's 940.|$|E
25|$|Gasporotto {{decided to}} give up the {{ownership}} of Hotelito Desconocido after suffering an accident where he lost his eye. Members of the fisherman group said that Gasporotto left to Uruguay, but they said they lost track <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he moved to South America. According to local residents, once the ownership of Hotelito Desconocido was passed on to W Arquitectos, they began to see suspicious activity near the hotel. One {{of the members of the}} fisherman group stated that some of the hotel workers said they sometimes saw helicopters deliver packages at the hotel. He also stated to have seen suspicious convoys of black vehicles in some of the dirt roads leading to the hotel.|$|E

During the final battle in the Savage Land, he finally defeats the Flash, but only does so because there is no Speed Force in the Marvel Universe. He makes an appearance in the final battle with Krona, but it is very brief. He also appears at the end as one of the heroes that started out the entire event.|$|E

25|$|Vargas {{claimed that}} this would be the last fight of his career {{regardless}} of the result. He warned Mayorga that he would not tolerate any insults from him like the ones he hurled at Oscar De La Hoya in their press conferences. Vargas stayed true to his promise when at the first official press conference for the fight, Mayorga said some offensive things towards Vargas and attempted to slap him. Vargas immediately jumped up from his seat and retaliated with punches and a brawl broke out between the two fighters' camps, though order was quickly restored. Vargas also recalled the time when Mayorga said Vargas was scared <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he had defeated Javier Castillejo, then was stripped of his WBC light middleweight title rather than face Mayorga, who then defeated Michele Piccirillo for the vacant title. Ultimately the contestants faced off, and Mayorga defeated Vargas by majority decision on November 23, 2007. The scores were 113-113, 114-112, and 115-111. Crucially, Vargas was knocked down in the 1st round and again in the 11th round. Post-fight Ricardo Mayorga apologized to Vargas and the two forgave each other. Vargas officially declared his retirement soon after.|$|E

For a break during the war, Maria, her sisters and mother sometimes visited the Tsar and Tsarevich Alexei at the war headquarters in Mogilev. During these visits, Maria developed an attraction to Nikolai Dmitrievich Demenkov, an officer of the day at the Tsar's Headquarters. When the women returned to Tsarskoye Selo, Maria often asked her father to give her regards to Demenkov and sometimes jokingly signed her letters to the Tsar [...] "Mrs. Demenkov." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{common side}} did erupt {{after a fashion}} in 1728 when Robert Castell, an {{architect}} and debtor in the Fleet prison, who {{had been living in}} lodgings outside the jail within the rules, was taken to a [...] "sponging house" [...] after refusing to pay a higher prison fee to the Fleet's notorious warden, Thomas Bambridge. Sponging houses were private lodgings where prisoners were incarcerated before being taken to jail; they acquired the name because they squeezed the prisoner's last money out <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> Castell arrived at the sponging house on 14 November he was forced to share space with a man who was dying of smallpox, and as a result became infected and died less than a month later.|$|E

500|$|Cutter, a {{crossing}} guard, {{hides the}} shotgun in a dumpster, {{calling the police}} to report finding it. The police officer who takes his statement later recognizes him on seeing the video. Black has deduced the killer's motives—he is trying to undermine society's notion of safety. Black and Bletcher organize a stakeout at another open house, identifying Cutter when he arrives; however, Cutter escapes into the neighborhood. Black realizes that he has hidden in a nearby house, where he and Bletcher find the occupants tied up. Cutter ambushes Black, knocking him down, but before Cutter can escape, the family's dog lunges at him, sending him falling over a mezzanine to his death. [...] Bletcher later tells Black that Cutter's aunt and uncle were tortured to death in front <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he was a child, which led him to recreate the torment for other families.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season Wallwork {{played in}} 31 out of 38 Premier League games, {{but was unable}} to prevent Albion's relegation to the Championship. He nevertheless signed a new two-year deal with the club in August 2006. He remained a regular in the side during {{the early part of the}} 2006–07 season, but following the appointment of Bryan Robson's successor Tony Mowbray in October, Wallwork played just once more for the club. Mowbray described Wallwork as [...] "a very good professional", but preferred a number of other midfielders ahead <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> selecting the team, moving Jonathan Greening from a wide position into the central midfield holding role previously occupied by Wallwork. In order to continue playing first-team football, Wallwork joined Barnsley on loan on 22 November 2006; the loan spell was due to last until 1 January 2007, though West Bromwich Albion had a recall option after 28 days.|$|E
500|$|As to his {{national}}ism, {{he wished}} to see Scotland {{on an equal footing}} with other nations. His national pride was intense; in a Preparatory Note to The Voyage of the Scotia he wrote: [...] "While 'Science' was the talisman of the Expedition, 'Scotland' was emblazoned on its flag". This insistence on emphasising the Scottish character of his enterprises could be irksome to those who did not share his passion. However, he retained the respect and devotion of those whom he led, and of those who had known him longest. John Arthur Thomson, who had known Bruce since Granton, wrote <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> reviewing Rudmose Brown's 1923 biography: [...] "We never heard him once grumble about himself, though he was neither to hold or bend when he thought some injustice was being done to, or slight cast on, his men, on his colleagues, on his laboratory, on his Scotland. Then one got glimpses of the volcano which his gentle spirit usually kept sleeping".|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{has been}} {{described}} as having a meticulous appearance. [...] Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, “In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because {{he was one of those}} handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.” [...] Later, The New York Times described him thusly: [...] "After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally." [...] In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. [...] The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. [...] Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's Plaza Hotel.|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} Wanamaker's Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a {{colleague}} {{who had seen}} him dance, of {{a role in the}} upcoming production Every Sailor. A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled Every Woman. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew it perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while waiting to go on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: [...] "For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nordiques finally {{acquired}} Gélinas on June 20, 1993, {{in exchange}} for Scott Pearson.

The Canucks reached the 1994 Stanley Cup Final but were defeated in seven games by the New York Rangers. In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, he scored 23 points in 46 games and won his first of two consecutive Fred J. Hume Awards as Vancouver's [...] "unsung hero". Gélinas finally achieved the offensive production expected <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> he was drafted by recording consecutive 30-goal seasons. He scored 30 goals in 1995–96 and led the Canucks with 35 goals, was second to Alexander Mogilny with 68 points and recorded a four-goal game against the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996–97. He won three team awards: The Cyclone Taylor Award as Vancouver's most valuable player, the Molson Cup for earning the most three star selections and the Most Exciting Player Award.|$|E
