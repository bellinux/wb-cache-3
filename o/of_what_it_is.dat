5|$|The {{success of}} the Broadway {{production}} {{has led to the}} development of an auxiliary show, Behind the Emerald Curtain, created by Sean McCourt – an original Broadway production cast member who played the Witch's Father, among other roles, in addition to understudying the Wizard and Doctor Dillamond, before taking over the latter principal role – and Anthony Galde who was a long-running swing in the Broadway company from 2004 to 2012. The tour features a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes look at the props, masks, costumes and sets used in the show, and includes a question-and-answer session with the cast members. The Broadway tour is currently led by McCourt and long-running ensemble member and Glinda understudy Lindsay K. Northen. The tour also featured in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago sit-down productions, and were each run by different long-serving cast members of the show. The tour provides a behind the scenes look at what goes into putting on the show every day. Participants get a first hand account <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like to be a part of the massive production that Wicked is.|$|E
5|$|Within 50 million years, the {{pressure}} and density of hydrogen in {{the centre of the}} protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion. Isochrones for Solar Mixture | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement | arxiv=astro-ph/0104292 | date=2001 | volume=136 |issue=2 | pages=417–437 | doi=10.1086/321795 | bibcode=2001ApJS..136..417Y}} The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today.|$|E

25|$|One general {{characteristic}} of games that Wittgenstein considers in detail {{is the way}} in which they consist in following rules. Rules constitute a family, rather than a class that can be explicitly defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to provide a definitive account <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to follow a rule. Indeed, he argues that any course of action can be made out to accord with some particular rule, and that therefore a rule cannot be used to explain an action. Rather, that one is following a rule or not is to be decided by looking to see if the actions conform to the expectations in the particular form of life in which one is involved. Following a rule is a social activity.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Mary's {{failure to}} learn exactly what seeing red feels like {{is simply a}} failure of language, or a failure {{of our ability to}} {{describe}} experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine {{what it is like to}} see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.|$|E
25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E

500|$|In {{the debate}} over {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "redskin", team {{supporters}} frequently cite a paper by Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus, who asserts that the term was a direct translation of words used by Native Americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning. In an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated. Darren R. Reid, a history lecturer at Coventry University, contends that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype: [...] "It is not up to non-Indians to define an idealized image <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to a Native American." [...] The [...] "positive" [...] stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans, but this is [...] "...forcing your idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to honour those people onto them and that, fundamentally, is disrespectful." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} Religious Studies {{describes}} {{the book as}} [...] "a convenient and in many respects convincing account {{of the history of}} Scientology." [...] However, it comments that Wallis [...] "does not really succeed in the formidable task of giving the reader a rounded picture <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like to be a believing member of the Org. His analysis, like its subject matter, is rather mechanical and follows a particular pattern." [...] The review observes that Wallis did not explore the parallels between Dianetics and B. F. Skinner's psychological theories, nor between the screening processes used in Scientology and in Communist China. It recommends that the book would have been more interesting if it had compared its subject with initiation rites, including those of Freemasonry. It dismisses as [...] "facile" [...] the book's background material on secularization and religious schisms.|$|E

[...] A more subdued Roger Ebert gave it three stars, saying that it felt confused and unfinished. He wrote, [...] "The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm idea <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about), but doesn't make it bad. It is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating {{a sense of the}} geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, {{the ways in which the}} American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established".|$|E
500|$|Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 {{that there}} would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role.

The film would again explore the premise <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like to be alone. Lawrence stated, [...] "... the tough thing is, how do we do that again and in a different way?"

500|$|Alonso Duralde {{wrote that}} the film should please slasher fans, but that it added nothing new to the genre or the {{franchise}} and would not appeal to {{people who did not}} like slasher films.

He also said the prospect of another Friday the 13thcrafted by the film's [...] "sequel-friendly" [...] endingdid not leave him with a feeling of dread.

Although Goodykoontz acknowledges the unique touches the film brings to certain characters' deaths, he was unimpressed with the acting and said Padalecki's presence gave the film a [...] "less-good episode of Supernatural" [...] vibe.|$|E

[...] "With A Beautiful Lie, {{it was time to}} take a more personal and less cerebral approach. Although this record is still full of conceptual elements and thematic ideas it is ultimately much more wrapped around the heart than the head. It's about brutal honesty, growth, change.

500|$|Music author Joel McIver {{considers}} Slayer {{very influential}} in the extreme metal scene, especially {{in the development of}} the death metal and black metal subgenres.

They inspired generations of metal bands."

[...] He then grabbed a real revolver and fired it into a nearby wall. The gun empty, Peckinpah barked at his stunned crew: [...] "THAT'S the effect I want!!" [...] He also had the gunfire sound effects changed for the film. Before, all gunshots in Warner Bros. movies sounded identical, regardless of the type of weapon being fired. Peckinpah insisted on each different type of firearm having its own specific sound effect when fired.|$|E
