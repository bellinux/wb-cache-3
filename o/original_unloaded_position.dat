40|$|Wind {{power is}} a {{sustainable}} source of energy. However, there are certain challenges to be overcome. One of the operational challenges is the phenomenon of ice shedding. Icing happens on wind turbine blades in cold regions. When ice grows to a certain size, it separates from the wind turbine blades resulting in the phenomenon of ice shedding. This phenomenon is of significantly dangerous for equipment and personnel in the region. Ice shedding may happen either because of vibrations or bending in blades. However, it was noticed by operators at Nygårdsfjell wind park, Narvik, Norway that ice shedding is more probable to happen when blades are stopped and turned back on. This observation reveals the fact that bending of blades (from loaded to <b>unloaded</b> <b>positions)</b> allows the ice to separate and hence result in ice shedding.

40|$|Positioning {{offshore}} {{supply vessels}} {{in close proximity}} to moving oil and gas production facilities, like tension-leg platforms, is traditionally performed using multi-point anchor systems. These anchor systems protect the rig structure from collision damage, but limit the number of <b>unloading</b> <b>positions</b> around the rig and consume valuable time to attach and release the supply vessel. The use of advanced dynamic positioning algorithms and highly accurate GPS-based position data allow an offshore supply vessel to approach and hold station during unloading without anchors.

The DARPS system provides two GPS based positions to the DP system [...] a DGPS fix using IALA corrections and a target distance/bearing calculation. The relative distance and bearing calculation is not dependent upon differential corrections, thus making the system more robust.

40|$|Background Spinal {{immobilisation}} using a rigid long spineboard is {{a well-established}} procedure in trauma care. During immobilisation, {{the body is}} exposed to high tissue-interface pressures. This {{may lead to a}} localised inflammatory response of the skin, which may be used to monitor the body's response to different types of immobilisation device. Aim In this study we compared the standard rigid spineboard with a new soft-layered spineboard regarding tissue-interface pressures, skin redness as an indicator of reactive hyperaemia and cutaneous IL 1 α and lactate release. Methods Twelve healthy male participants were asked to lie supine on both a rigid and a soft-layered spineboard, loading the sacrum for one hour, followed by one hour in <b>unloaded</b> <b>position.</b> Tissue-interface pressures on the buttocks during loading were measured continuously using a pressure mapping mat. Cutaneous IL 1 α and lactate concentrations were assessed using Sebutapes, during 20 -minute periods. After each 20 -minute period, a photo of the buttocks was taken, which was later assessed for redness by two observers. Results Significant differences in tissue-interface pressure and reactive hyperaemia were found between the two types of spineboard. Release of IL 1 α and lactate were found to increase with prolonged exposure to pressure, and to decrease in the <b>unloaded</b> prone <b>position.</b> A significant relationship was found between tissue-interface pressure and reactive hyperaemia, but not with IL 1 α nor lactate release. Time course of IL 1 α and lactate release was similar for both types of spineboard. Conclusions IL 1 α and lactate both have a strong relationship with pressure exposure time, but not with pressure magnitude. Furthermore, IL 1 α was measured {{even in the absence of}} visible redness of the skin. The study offers the potention of biomarkers, reflecting inflammation and/or tissue metabolism, for use in assessing the effects of prolonged spineboard support. <br/...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{to predict the}} shift of the contact ellipse between the meshing teeth in a spiral bevel gear set is presented in this report. The contact ellipse shift of interest is {{the motion of the}} nominal tooth contact location on each tooth from the ideal pitch point to the point of contact between the two teeth considering the elastic motions of the gears and their supporting shafts. This is the shift of the pitch point from the ideal, <b>unloaded</b> <b>position</b> on each tooth to the nominal contact location on the tooth when the gears are fully loaded. It is assumed that the major contributors of this motion are the elastic deflections of the gear shafts, the slopes of the shafts under load and the radial deflections of the four gear shaft bearings. The motions of the two pitch point locations on the pinion and the gear tooth surfaces are calculated in a FORTRAN program which also calculates the size and orientation of the Hertzian contact ellipse on the tooth faces. Based on the curvatures of the two spiral bevel gear teeth {{and the size of the}} contact ellipse, the program also predicts the basic dynamic capacity of the tooth pair.

40|$|Tracking {{control in}} x-y plane of an {{offshore}} container crane Dongho Kim and Youngjin Park A tracking controller is proposed for a crane {{attached to a}} mobile harbor (MH) equipped with a dual-stage trolley system, to dynamically position a container from the MH to the container ship or vice versa. Wave-induced motions of the MH and container ship occur during loading and unloading operations owing to external disturbances such as waves. However, a challenging task is to move a payload with unwanted swing motions accurately to the loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>positions</b> on a moving target vessel. To solve this problem, a dynamic MH crane model is derived in three-dimensional space, with roll, pitch, and heave motions caused by sea-wave disturbances. The MH crane model is then linearized to design a tracking controller and {{the parameters of the}} linearized model are obtained by carrying out the system identification process. A preview tracking control method that includes feedback and feed-forward control with the predicted target position in the x-y plane in the near future is utilized.

40|$|To {{document}} {{the activity of}} cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin of the foot sole, tungsten microelectrodes were inserted through the popliteal fossa and into the tibial nerve of thirteen healthy human subjects. A total of 104 cutaneous mechanoreceptors were identified in the glabrous skin of the foot. This sample consisted of 15 slow adapting type I (14 %), 16 slow adapting type II (15 %), 59 fast adapting type I (57 %), and 14 fast adapting type II units (14 %). The location of the receptors and {{the outline of the}} receptive fields were determined by using nylon monofilaments perpendicularly applied against the surface of the skin. This revealed that the receptors were widely distributed without an accumulation of receptors in the toes. There were also larger receptive fields predominantly isolated on the plantar surface of the metatarsal-tarsal region of the foot sole. Furthermore, with the foot in an <b>unloaded</b> <b>position,</b> there was no background discharge activity in any of the cutaneous receptors in the absence of intentionally applied stimulation. These findings suggest that skin receptors in the foot sole behave differently from those receptors found on the glabrous skin of the hand.

40|$|Heavy duty powertrains {{are complex}} systems with {{components}} from various domains, different response times during transient operations and different efficient operating ranges. To ensure efficient transient {{operation of a}} powertrain, e. g. with low fuel consumption or short transient duration, {{it is important to}} come up with proper control strategies. In this dissertation, optimal control theory is used to calculate and analyze efficient heavy duty powertrain controls during transient operations in different applications. This is enabled by first developing control ready models, usable for multi-phase optimal control problem formulations, and then using numerical optimal control methods to calculate the optimal transients. Optimal control analysis of a wheel loader operating in a repetitive loading cycle is the first studied application. Increasing fuel efficiency or reducing the operation time in such repetitive loading cycles sums up to large savings over longer periods of time. Load lifting and vehicle traction consume almost all of the power produced by a diesel engine during wheel loader operation. Physical models are developed for these subsystems where the dynamics are described by differential equations. The model parameters are tuned and fuel consumption estimation is validated against measured values from real wheel loader operation. The sensitivity of wheel loader trajectory with respect to constrains such as the angle at which the wheel loader reaches the <b>unloading</b> <b>position</b> is also analyzed. A time and fuel optimal trajectory map is calculated for various <b>unloading</b> <b>positions.</b> Moreover, the importance of simultaneous optimization of wheel loader trajectory and the component transients is shown via a side to side comparison between measured fuel consumption and trajectories versus optimal control results. In another application, optimal control is used to calculate efficient gear shift controls for a heavy duty Automatic Transmission system. A modeling and optimal control framework is developed for a nine speed automatic transmission. Solving optimal control problems using the developed model, time and jerk efficient transient for simultaneous disengagement of off-going and engagement of in-coming shift actuators are obtained and the results are analyzed. Optimal controls of a diesel-electric powertrain during a gear shift in an Automated Manual Transmission system are calculated and analyzed in another application of optimal control. The powertrain model is extended by including driveline backlash angle as an extra state in the system. This is enabled by implementation of smoothing techniques in order to describe backlash dynamics as a single continuous function during all gear shift phases. Optimal controls are also calculated for a diesel-electric powertrain corresponding to a hybrid bus during a tip-in maneuver. It is shown that for optimal control analysis of complex powertrain systems, minimizing only one property such as time pushes the system transients into extreme operating conditions far from what is achievable in real applications. Multi-objective optimal control problem formulations are suggested in order to obtain a compromise between various objectives when analyzing such complex powertrain systems...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, non-fusion {{implants}} to stabilise the lumbar spine {{have become}} more and more popular. However, little is known on the load bearing of such dynamic stabilisation systems. In order to investigate the load bearing of discs bridged with rigid and dynamic stabilisation systems, six lumbar cadaver spines were mounted in a spine tester and loaded with pure moments in the three main motion planes. Four different states of the specimens were studied: intact, destabilised, stabilisation with a Dynesys® and stabilisation with an internal fixator. Intradiscal pressure (IDP) measurements were used to assess the load bearing of the bridged disc. In the neutral <b>unloaded</b> <b>position,</b> there were small but not significant differences in disc pressure for the four states of the treated disc (P> 0. 05). Concerning the disc pressure during the course of loading, both the Dynesys® and internal fixator did significantly reduce the pressure change from neutral to extension in comparison to the intact state (− 0. 05, − 0. 04 and + 0. 24  MPa, respectively) (P 0. 05). The devices apparently eliminated the pressure change from neutral to lateral bending (Dynesys 0. 01  MPa, Fixator 0. 01  MPa and intact 0. 24  MPa), but due to large variations in the intact and defect states the differences were not significant (P> 0. 05). In axial rotation, the pressure change for the internal fixator was reduced compared to the intact state; however, the change was only significant in left axial rotation (P 0. 05) in axial rotation. No changes in IDP were seen in the adjacent discs for either the Dynesys or the internal fixator.

40|$|The plantar {{aponeurosis}} (PA), in {{spanning the}} whole {{length of the}} plantar aspect of the foot, is clearly identi-fied {{as one of the}} key structures that is likely to affect compliance and stability of the longitudinal arch. A recent study performed in our laboratory showed that tension ⁄elongation in the PA can be predicted from the kinematics of the segments to which the PA is attached. In the present investigation, stereophotogramme-try and inverse kinematics were employed to shed light on the mechanics of the longitudinal arch and its main passive stabilizer, the PA, in relation to walking speed. When compared with a neutral <b>unloaded</b> <b>position,</b> the medial longitudinal arch underwent greater collapse during the weight-acceptance phase of stance at higher walking speed (0. 1 ± 1. 9 in slow walking; 0. 9 ± 2. 6 in fast walking; P = 0. 0368). During late stance the arch was higher (3. 4 ± 3. 1 in slow walking; 2. 8 ± 2. 7 in fast walking; P = 0. 0227) and the metatarsophalangeal joints more dorsiflexed (e. g. at the first metatarsophalangeal joint, 52 ± 5 in slow walking; 64 ± 4 in fast walking; P < 0. 001) during fast walking. Early-stance tension in the PA increased with speed, whereas maximum tension during late stance {{did not seem to be}} significantly affected by walking speed. Although, on the one hand, these results give evidence for the existence of a pre-heel-strike, speed-dependent, arch-stiffening mechanism, on the other hand they suggest that augmentation of arch height in late stance is enhanced by higher forces exerted by the intrinsic muscles on the plantar aspect of the foot when walking at faster speeds.

40|$|As {{the price}} of crude oil doubled from June 2007 to June 2008, {{suspicion}} grew that price was being driven higher by speculation rather than fundamental supply and demand. After having seen the price drop 70 percent from its peak, this explanation may appear more plausible than ever. This paper introduces a new methodology that uses convenience yield – imputed from futures prices – to detect the influence of speculation on the spot price of a storable commodity. The paper finds the evidence inconsistent with speculation having {{played a major role in}} the rise of price to $ 100 per barrel in March 2008. However, the evidence suggests that speculation did play a role in its subsequent rise to $ 140. Finally, the analysis finds that the collapse in price was caused by an unanticipated decline in demand rather than by speculators <b>unloading</b> their <b>positions.</b> This implies that, absent the discovery of vast new sources of energy, high oil prices will return with the recovery of the global economy.

30|$|Some MD {{simulations}} of nanoindentation experiments on single-layer rectangular graphene sheets {{have been carried}} out in order to obtain the mechanical properties of graphene. A correlation between the load and the indentation depth is constructed, and Young’s modulus and the strength of graphene are obtained in the end. The simulation results show that the unloaded graphene film could make a complete recovery if the maximum indentation depth is less than the critical indentation depth, and the graphene film undergoes elastic deformation during the whole loading-unloading-reloading process. However, if the maximum indentation depth is larger than the critical indentation depth, the graphene sheet could not restore its <b>original</b> structures after <b>unloading</b> and the graphene deforms plastically. Based on the {{simulations of}} nanoindentation at different loading speeds and indenter radii, it can be observed that the maximum load increased and the critical indentation depth decreased with the increase of loading speed. In addition, the indenter radius has a remarkable influence on the force-displacement curve. As the indenter radius increases, the critical load and the critical indentation depth also increase.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a large trader’s trading strategies in a search-based security market, {{in which all}} traders are subject to type switching. The large trader has pressure to liquidate her position {{by the end of}} the horizon to avoid extra holding costs and faces a tradeoff: if she trades quickly, she moves the price; if she trades slowly, she may not be able to find counterparties in the market. We show that there exists a subgame perfect equilibrium in which she chooses the optimal trading strategies taking into account both the price impact effect and liquidity uncertainty. Asset prices are generated endogenously through a dynamic search and bargaining process and reflect the impact of the large trader’s trades. Small traders, who are price takers and possess no manipulating power, cannot be ignored because their reactions to the big trader’s trading strategy jointly determine the market liquidity. We show that when market liquidity uncertainty is high, the large trader would rather put off trading because it is very costly to induce the small trader to undertake the liquidity risk. When the market liquidity uncertainty is very low, however, she <b>unloads</b> her <b>position</b> quickly despite the price impact incurred. Furthermore, we examine the two effects of liquidity uncertainty and imperfect competition on prices by studying three cases: the benchmark case, the case of a liquid market with a monopolist and the case of a competitive market with liquidity uncertainty. We show that the two effects on prices are nonlinear. When the market is perfectly liquid, there is no price impact from the large trader’s quick trading; however, when the market is illiquid, and the large trader cannot discriminate across small traders, the large trader has to pay a discount for the liquidity uncertainty. Lastly, we explore limiting pricing results by extending the number of small traders and the number of trading periods and show that competitive intuition applies in the model. 2 1...|$|R
