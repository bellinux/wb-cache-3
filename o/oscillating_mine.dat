40|$|The {{position}} of a division site in the rod-shaped bacterium E. coli is partially determined by pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min-family of proteins—MinC, MinD, and MinE. Furthermore, experiments reveal that MinD protein polymerizes on the membrane into filaments and that MinE protein forms an oscillating ring. We assume that MinD filaments are single-stranded (two-stranded hypothesis has been already tested in our previous paper [20]). In the filamentous cells zebra-striped MinD oscillation pattern, fully formed <b>oscillating</b> <b>MinE</b> rings, and weakly fluorescent, rapidly moving MinE rings are experimentally observed. All these phenomena are reproduced by our threedimensional off-lattice stochastic reaction-diffusion model. An algorithm with adaptive time steps is implemented in order {{to speed up the}} time-consuming process of tracking each protein in the computer simulation...|$|E
40|$|In Escherichia coli, a {{contractile}} ring (Z-ring) {{is formed}} at midcell before cytokinesis. This ring consists primarily of FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase, that assembles into protofilaments {{similar to those}} in microtubules but different in their suprastructures. The Min proteins MinC, MinD, and MinE are determinants of Z-ring positioning in E. coli. MinD and <b>MinE</b> <b>oscillate</b> from pole to pole, and genetic and biochemical evidence concludes that MinC positions the Z-ring by coupling its assembly to the oscillations by direct inhibitory interaction. The mechanism of inhibition of FtsZ polymerization and, thus, positioning by MinC, however, is not understood completely. Our in vitro reconstitution experiments suggest that the Z-ring consists of dynamic protofilament bundles in which monomers constantly are exchanged throughout, stochastically creating protofilament ends {{along the length of the}} filament. From the coreconstitution of FtsZ with MinCDE, we propose that MinC acts on the filaments in two ways: by increasing the detachment rate of FtsZ-GDP within the filaments and by reducing the attachment rate of FtsZ monomers to filaments by occupying binding sites on the FtsZ filament lattice. Furthermore, our data show that the MinCDE system indeed is sufficient to cause spatial regulation of FtsZ, required for Z-ring positioning...|$|R
40|$|The Min protein system {{creates a}} dynamic spatial pattern in Escherichia coli cells where the {{proteins}} MinD and <b>MinE</b> <b>oscillate</b> from pole to pole. MinD positions MinC, an inhibitor of FtsZ ring formation, {{contributing to the}} mid-cell localization of cell division. In this paper, Fourier analysis is used to decompose experimental and model MinD spatial distributions into time-dependent harmonic components. In both experiment and model, the second harmonic component {{is responsible for producing}} a mid-cell minimum in MinD concentration. The features of this harmonic are robust in both experiment and model. Fourier analysis reveals a close correspondence between the time-dependent behaviour of the harmonic components in the experimental data and model. Given this, each molecular species in the model was analysed individually. This analysis revealed that membrane-bound MinD dimer shows the mid-cell minimum with the highest contrast when averaged over time, carrying the strongest signal for positioning the cell division ring. This concurs with previous data showing that the MinD dimer binds to MinC inhibiting FtsZ ring formation. These results show that non-linear interactions of Min proteins are essential for producing the mid-cell positioning signal via the generation of second-order harmonic components in the time-dependent spatial protein distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In E. coli, the Min operon (MinCDE) plays a {{key role}} in {{determining}} the site of cell division. <b>MinE</b> <b>oscillates</b> from the middle to one pole or another to drive the MinCD complex to the end of the cell. The MinCD complex prevents FtsZ ring formation and the subsequent cell division at cell ends. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a homologue of MinD has been shown to be involved in the positioning of chloroplast division site. Results To learn whether the MinD homologue in plants is functional in bacteria, AtMinD was expressed in E. coli. Surprisingly, AtMinD can rescue the minicell phenotype of E. coli HL 1 mutant (Δ MinDE) in the absence of EcMinE. This rescue requires EcMinC. AtMinD was localized to puncta at the poles of E. coli cells and puncta in chloroplasts without oscillation. AtMinD expressed in the HL 1 mutant can cause a punctate localization pattern of GFP-EcMinC at cell ends. Yeast two hybrid and BiFC analysis showed that AtMinD can interact with EcMinC. Conclusion Similar to the MinD in Bacillus subtilis, AtMinD is localized to the polar region in E. coli and interacts with EcMinC to confine EcFtsZ polymerization and cell division at the midpoint of the cell. </p...|$|R
40|$|Os estudos sobre desenvolvimento, sem dúvida, se mantiveram como um dos últimos bastiões do modernismo nas ciências sociais (Rapley, 2004). Muitos dos dilemas chave em estudos contemporâneos sobre desenvolvimento se centraram nas disjuntivas entre inovação teórica, política e prática (Simon, 2003). No entanto, a discussão que envolve a relação entre desenvolvimento e mineração, que interessa neste estudo, ainda permanece acrítica dentro da {{literatura}} dominante. Segundo Graulau (2008), o tema de mineração encontra-se num vaivém entre o favoritismo e a oposição. O estudo sob o ponto de vista normativo da mineração no campo de desenvolvimento mostra a mentalidade econômica de longa data que prevalece nesse campo. No Peru as reformas neoliberais implantadas desde a década 1990 têm promovido fortemente o setor de mineração. Os investimentos nacionais e estrangeiros, o volume das exportações e impostos certamente têm influenciado favoravelmente na economia em termos macroeconômicos, obtendo quantidades consideráveis de divisas (UNCTAD, 2008). Não obstante, a grande mineração parece não ter beneficiado as comunidades envolvidas com a extração de minérios (Barrantes, 2005; Glave e Kuramoto, 2007; Zegarra; Orihuela e Paredes, 2007). A quantidade e gravidade dos conflitos que vem acontecendo evidenciam a resistência ao setor, frente à ação discursiva do Estado peruano sobre o “desenvolvimento” que assegura o que a mineração traz. Neste contexto este estudo tem como objetivo analisar as práticas discursivas das políticas de mineração peruana em relação a construção do discurso de desenvolvimento no período compreendido entre 1990 - 2009. Com esse objetivo, foi necessário abordar primeiramente as principais teorias sobre desenvolvimento, mineração e mineração no Peru. No que diz respeito à metodologia o presente estudo utilizou duas técnicas de análise: a Análise Crítica de Discurso, baseado no método tridimensional proposto por Fairclough (2001), para realizar a análise de três discursos de representantes da política de mineração peruana, a segunda abordagem utiliza a Análise de Conteúdo de Bardin (2009), para examinar os artigos relacionados à política de mineração entre as principais revistas especializadas do setor–Mineria e Desde Adentro. Foram utilizadas também categorias de análise constantes e convergentes ao conceito de desenvolvimento para orientar a presente pesquisa. Finalmente as conclusões sugerem que as políticas de mineração reproduzidas pelas autoridades do Estado peruano introduziram práticas discursivas sobre desenvolvimento sustentável e que essas se mantêm relacionadas com as novas ordens de discurso: Responsabilidade Social, Minerção Sustentável, Mineração moderna, Gestão ambiental. Development studies have, {{without any}} doubt, stand {{as one of}} the last bastion of modernism in social sciences (Rapley, 2004). Many of the key dilemmas in contemporary studies about development were focused on the disjunction among innovations in theory, politics and practice (Simon, 2003). Meanwhile, the discussion that involves a relationship between development and mining, which interests our study, still remains acritical within the dominant literature. According to Graulau (2008), the topic of <b>mining</b> <b>oscillates</b> between favoritism and oposition. From a normative point of view, the study of mining within the topic of development shows the longtime economic mentality that prevails in this field. In Peru, the neoliberal reforms put in practice since the decade of 1990 have strongly promoted the mining sector. Certainly, national and foreign investments, the volume of exportations and taxes have favorably influenced the economy in macroeconomical terms, obtaining considerable quantities of reserves (UNCTAD, 2008). Nevertheless, corporate mining didn't seem to benefit local communities involved in mining extraction (Barrantes, 2005; Glave e Kuramoto, 2007; Zegarra, Orihuela e Paredes, 2007). The quantity and gravity of the conflicts the have been ocurring shows a rejection to the mining sector, opposite to the discursive action of the Peruvian State that guarantees the "development" brought by mining. In this context, the main objective {{of this study is to}} analize the discursive practices of Peruvian mining politics in relationship with the construction of development discourse in the decade of 1990 - 2009. Therefore, it was necessary to study the main theories about development, mining and mining in Peru. About the methodology used in this work, we used two analysis techniques: First, the Critical Discourse Analysis, based on the tridimensional method proposed by Fairclough (2001). This technique was used to analyze the speeches of three representatives of Peruvian mining politics. The second technique we used was Content Analysis proposed by Bardin (2009). This technique helped us in the analysis of mining politics articles published in the main specialized magazines of this area - Mineria and Desde Adentro. One of the guides in this research was also defined by a set of categories that were constant and convergent related to the concept of mining. Finally, conclusions suggest that mining politics applied by Peruvian State officers introduced discourse practices about sustainable development and that these are coherent with the new orders of discourse: Social Responsability, Sustainable mining, Modern mining, Environmental Management...|$|R
