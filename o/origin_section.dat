50|$|The 1991 Act {{combined}} {{elements from}} two different civil right acts of the past: the Civil Rights Act of 1866, better known by the number assigned {{to it in the}} codification of federal laws as Section 1981, and the employment-related provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, generally referred to as Title VII. The two statutes, passed nearly a century apart, approached the issue of employment discrimination very differently: Section 1981 prohibited only discrimination based on race or color, but Title VII also prohibited {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex, religion, and national <b>origin.</b> <b>Section</b> 1981, which had lain dormant and unenforced for a century after its passage, allowed plaintiffs to seek compensatory damages and trial by jury. Title VII, passed in the 1960s when it was assumed that Southern juries could not render a fair verdict, allowed only trial by the court and provided for only traditional equitable remedies: back pay, reinstatement, and injunctions against future acts of discrimination. By the time the 1991 Act was passed, both allowed for an award of attorneys fees.|$|E

25|$|Statistical {{significance}} test : A predecessor to the statistical hypothesis test (see the <b>Origins</b> <b>section).</b> An experimental result {{was said to}} be statistically significant if a sample was sufficiently inconsistent with the (null) hypothesis. This was variously considered common sense, a pragmatic heuristic for identifying meaningful experimental results, a convention establishing a threshold of statistical evidence or a method for drawing conclusions from data. The statistical hypothesis test added mathematical rigor and philosophical consistency to the concept by making the alternative hypothesis explicit. The term is loosely used to describe the modern version which is now part of statistical hypothesis testing.|$|R
50|$|Geodynamic mantle {{convection}} {{models have}} included compositional distinctive material. The material {{tends to get}} swept up in ridges or piles. When including realistic past plate motions into the modeling, the material gets swept up in locations that are remarkably similar {{to the present day}} location of the LLSVPs. These locations also correspond with known slab graveyard locations mentioned in the <b>origin</b> <b>section.</b> These types of models, as well as the observation that the degree two structure of the LLSVPs is orthogonal to the path of true polar wander, suggest these mantle structures have been stable over large amounts of time. This geometrical relationship is also consistent with the position of the supercontinent Pangaea, and the formation of the current geoid pattern due to continental break-up from the superswell below.However, the heat from the core is not enough to sustain the energy needed to fuel the superplume(s) located at the LLSVPs. There is a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite from the down welling slab(s) that causes an exothermic reaction. This exothermic reaction helps to heat the LLSVP, but it is not sufficient enough to account for the total energy needed to sustain it. So it is hypothesized that the material from the slab graveyard can become extremely dense and form large pools of melt concentrate enriched in uranium, thorium, and potassium. These concentrated radiogenic elements are thought to provide the high temperatures needed. So, the appearance and disappearance of slab graveyards predicts the birth and death of an LLSVP, potentially changing the dynamics of all plate tectonics.|$|E
50|$|H.R. 1415 has 13 sections, {{the first}} of which names the act as the “Clean Diamond Trade Act”. The Act defines the {{motivation}} behind the passage as due to the human rights issues associated with the rough diamond trade. It also addresses previous action that has been taken to address threats due to conflicts coming from rough diamond trade. The act mentions the United Nations Security Council prohibiting states from exporting weapons to countries affected by diamond conflicts, in addition to mandating that states prohibit importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone and Liberia (3). The United States subsequently restricted the importation of diamonds to those containing a certificate of <b>origin.</b> <b>Section</b> 4 describes the measures for the importation and exportation of rough diamonds, addressing prohibition of diamonds not controlled through the KPCS and the ability of the president to waive requirements in certain circumstances. In Section 5, the act discusses the regulatory aspect, emphasizing the importance of keeping full records of anyone attempting to import or export rough diamonds. Section 5c also describes the oversight procedures, but does not specify which Government agency is in charge of conducting annual reviews. Section 6 delegates importing authority to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and exporting authority to the Bureau of the Census. Section 8 deals with enforcement, and describes the penalties for violating any aspect of the act. This section specifies a penalty not exceeding $10,000 for anyone who violates an aspect of the act, and not more than $50,000 or 10 years in prison for anyone who willfully violates the act. Section 10 promotes the importance of the executive branch publishing statistics on imports and exports of rough diamonds, and Section 11 mandates that annual reports be released every 12 months, although it does not specify who will be compiling these reports to give to congress. Section 12 states that 2 years after the effective date of the act, the Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report on the effectiveness of the act, in addition to any recommendations of modifications to the act.|$|E

40|$|Referred to as «Indian Diaspora», an {{estimated}} 20  25 million stock of Indian migrants is recorded worldwide. This {{is a function}} of flows of unskilled, semiskilled and skilled workers from India over last two centuries. Beginning in 1950 s, and picking up as «brain drain» in 1960 s, skilled migration to developed countries of the North became more prominent with the recent 21 stcentury exodus of the IT workers. Beginning with the oilboom of the 1970 s, large numbers of unskilled and semiskilled Indian labour have migrated to Gulf countries in west Asia. A paradigm shift about skilled migrants leaving India took place in phases  from the «brain drain» of 1960 s  1970 s to «brain bank» of 1980 s  1990 s, and subsequently to «brain gain» in the 21 st century. Similarly, the labour migrants to the Gulf have been viewed as the main source of remittances, swelling Indias foreign exchange reserves. Both these perceptions need moderation. Section 2 presents a general contextual background of India. Sections 3 and 4 highlight Indias transnational connectivity through skilled migrants in the developed countries, in particular the US.
