5|$|As the {{precursor}} to Sandra traversed Central America, it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides. Four {{people died in}} various incidents related to the system: three in El Salvador and one in Honduras. Initially expecting a landfalling storm, officials in Northwestern Mexico prepared equipment for power outages, closed schools, and evacuated 180residents. Sandra's effects largely consisted <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> moderate rainfall; some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this, though the overall impacts were limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> reach the ground. This allows {{a variety of}} mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow {{on the forest floor}} include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment. See also optogenetics which involves the use <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels, and also see biophoton, a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum emitted from a biological system.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E

5|$|Harvey caused minor {{flooding}} in south Florida because <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> relatively heavy rainfall in {{that portion of}} the state and at least 34houses and businesses in southern Florida were flooded. There were sporadic reports of tropical storm-force winds throughout the state, as well as two tornadoes. Damage estimates in Florida reached about $15million (1999USD). Throughout the rest of the United States, impact was limited, confined to light rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Heavy rainfall was reported in Atlantic Canada and Harvey became the wettest tropical cyclone on record in that country. Significant flooding, especially to roads and houses, was reported due to the heavy rainfall and damage throughout Atlantic Canada totalled several million dollars.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{argued that}} light is {{composed}} of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons, {{and the idea of}} wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E
5|$|On July25, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 120km (75mi) west-southwest of Yap. Satellite imagery {{indicated that}} a low level circulation had developed and was under an area <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> moderate wind shear. The low traveled in a general northwest fashion as upper level outflow improved. By July 27, the low deteriorated, becoming elongated, and convection remained disorganized. However, as the low neared Central Luzon, Philippines, shower and thunderstorm activity {{near the center of}} the low increased, and based on its organization, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system a tropical depression early that morning. Shortly after, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as Tropical Depression Henry. As the depression neared the northern Philippines, wind shear increased, partially exposing the center of the system to the south. At 02:30UTC on June30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 00:00UTC the next morning, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W.|$|E

5|$|Sanderson was {{originally}} working to {{a target of}} 200,000 words, later 250,000 words and by April 2008 up to 400,000 words. By the end of October 2008 the 400,000 estimate was still in effect. Sanderson later estimated the final length of A Memory <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>to</b> be at least 750,000 words. Information emerged on the Internet pertaining to the book, with a draft cover suggesting {{it was to be}} split into volumes. On March 30, 2009, Tor Books confirmed A Memory of Light was to be split into three volumes, the first of which, The Gathering Storm, would be released on November 3, 2009. This date was later changed to October 27, 2009, a week earlier than planned.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic venues were {{designed}} to reflect Norwegian culture and character. The hall was designed to play on Scandinavian folklore, such as the Hall of the Mountain King in Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt and the caves of fairy-tale trolls. This has for instance been emulated {{through the use of}} shotcrete on the walls to give a dark and mysterious impression. Lighting is used to create high contrast, such as from the entrance which is dark with pools <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> <b>to</b> the main hall which is brightly lit, to emphasize its size. The dark entrance is also used to adjust the spectators' eyes so the main hall seems brighter. A contrast has also been used between the grandstands' slender lines and the coarse finish of the cavern rock. Red was chosen as the hall's main color because of natural occurrence of red in the rock. Glass tiles are used as they give associations to ice. Ventilation, energy and other installations use shine metal, representing silver embedded in the rock. The main hall is designed as an amphitheater with close contact between spectators and athletes.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> the large, out of focus halo severely reduced {{the usefulness of the}} telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Cosmic Egg Stadium is {{consumed}} by an Idolasphere portal. Heading to the Cosmic Egg, the party are stopped by Hatanaka, who reveals {{himself to be}} the willing Mirage Master of Gharnef: the two are planning to perform the Opera of Shadows, summoning Medeus to consume the real world's Performa. The group recover Dragonstones from the conquered Idolosphere realms and restore Tiki's memory: she reveals that they must find {{the pieces of the}} Fire Emblem and perform the Opera <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>to</b> summon the power of the Divine Dragon Naga, the only force capable of stopping Medeus. Collecting the Fire Emblem pieces, they learn the story of the Hero-King Marth, a warrior from ancient times who bested and sealed away Gharnef and Medeus. The group encounter and defeat Hatanaka and Gharnef, but their sacrifice coupled with the offering of Marth's soul completes the Opera of Shadows and summons Medeus. Traveling to the final Idolasphere realm, Itsuki is fatally injured by Medeus, but the Fire Emblem gems free Marth's soul, which saves Itsuki and allows the group to perform the Opera of Light and defeat Medeus. The Mirages, with their memories restored and Medeus gone forever, return with Tiki to their native realm.|$|E

5|$|Upon first forming, the {{tropical}} depression {{was located in}} an area <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>to</b> moderate westerly wind shear. With a ridge {{to the north and}} west of the depression, the system moved to the northwest under weak steering currents. The depression slowly strengthened and intensified into Tropical Storm Edouard on September 2 while located about 120miles (190km) east of Jacksonville, Florida. The storm remained disorganized with wind shear displacing most of the deep convection from the low-level circulation. Upon becoming a tropical storm, forecasters initially predicted Edouard to gradually turn to the northeast, and within three days be located a short distance off the coast of South Carolina with winds of 60mph (95km/h). However, forecasters admitted little confidence in the prediction, and later forecasts predicted the storm to execute a loop and track westward into northern Florida or southern Georgia. Shortly after {{the tropical}} cyclogenesis of Edouard, steering currents became weak, resulting in the storm to turn sharply eastward. Late on September 2 deep convection developed over the center, though the center quickly became exposed again. The environment appeared to become more hostile on September 2 and 3 with increasing shear and dry air overspreading the center. Despite the conditions, the storm maintained vigorous convection over the eastern portion of the circulation, and it quickly intensified on September 3 to reach peak winds of 55mph (90km/h). A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the system estimated surface winds of up to 60mph (95km/h) and reported flight level winds of 82mph (132km/h).|$|E
