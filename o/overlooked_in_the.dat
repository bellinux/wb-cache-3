5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|Theobald was {{the patron}} of his {{successor}} Thomas Becket, {{and a number}} of other future bishops and archbishops served as his clerks. During his time as archbishop Theobald augmented the rights of his see, or bishopric.

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare, {{commonly}} known as the pinecone mushroom, the cone tooth, or the ear-pick fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales. It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who included it {{as a member of the}} tooth fungi genus Hydnum, but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to contain it. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pine woods where it grows. A.vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says it used to be consumed in France and Italy.|$|E

5|$|In the West, {{however, the}} loose {{ends of the}} Diocletianic {{settlement}} were about to bring the whole Tetrarchic tapestry down. Constantine, son of Constantius, and Maxentius, son of Maximian, had been <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Diocletianic succession, offending the parents and angering the sons. Constantine, against Galerius's will, succeeded his father on July 25, 306. He immediately ended any ongoing persecutions and offered Christians full restitution {{of what they had}} lost under the persecution. This declaration gave Constantine the opportunity to portray himself as a possible liberator of oppressed Christians everywhere. Maxentius, meanwhile, had seized power in Rome on October 28, 306, and soon brought toleration to all Christians within his realm. Galerius made two attempts to unseat Maxentius, but failed both times. During the first campaign against Maxentius, Severus was captured, imprisoned, and executed.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Hinde gave to many {{charities}} {{in southern}} California, and he was particularly generous to Coronado and San Diego.. He funded the construction of Christ Episcopal Church in Coronado, together with its parish center and rectory, all dedicated to his deceased daughter, Camilla. Even though Hinde was generous in his gifts, he remained modest and low-key throughout his life. He did not like receiving credit for his philanthropy, perhaps the reason his contributions were <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years following his death. Hinde bequeathed a large part of his estate to his sister Belinda's son, Frederick Hinde Zimmerman, who used the money to build the Grand Rapids Hotel on the Hinde family farm in Mount Carmel. Hinde left an even larger portion of his estate and his house in Coronado to his nephew, Harry Hinde.|$|E

25|$|The {{scholarly}} conclusion {{has largely}} been that the settlement of New Amsterdam is much more like current New York than previously thought.

25|$|On 17 January, the Emergency Services Bureau (ESB) {{released}} its final media release prior to 18 January at 8:50pm. This media release differed to any previous one in format and content. It also provided several clues that were <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{assessment of the}} risk Canberra faced. For example, one point of the release stated that bushfire logistical support staging areas were being relocated from Bulls Head and Orroral Valley (far outside urban Canberra) to the North Curtin District Playing Fields (far inside urban Canberra), signalling both a major retreat by fire fighters and pointing to imminent danger to the city itself.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, the Northern Rhodesian copper {{industry}} was little developed, and the British {{government did not}} anticipate the future value of these mineral rights. It regarded them as a not {{very important part of}} the overall deal with the company. The lack of any challenge to the BSAC's claims and the decision not to refer them to the Privy Council led to suspicion that the company received favoured treatment. There were family links between a junior Colonial Office minister and the BSAC director leading its negotiations, but no evidence to suggest this led to any bias. The most probable explanation is that the importance of the minerals was <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> haste to achieve a settlement. Because of lack of time, the agreement was not approved by the Attorney-General.|$|E

25|$|In the 2004 English season, Jones was {{preferred}} for {{the series}} against New Zealand and West Indies in both Tests and One-Day Internationals, having made a century in the second Test of the New Zealand series. Read returned to Nottinghamshire and had by far his best season with the bat: he scored 807 first-class runs including two centuries, and averaged over 50. The selectors stuck with Jones, however, and {{by the summer of}} 2005 Read was not even second-choice keeper for England in ODIs, Matt Prior of Sussex being preferred for the role. Read was again <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> squad for the winter tour of Pakistan, instead being selected for the second-tier ECB National Academy squad. As first choice wicket-keeper in the Academy squad, Read got several opportunities to play, and had a successful tour, scoring 254 runs at an average of 66.25 in the West Indies before he had to prematurely return home to attend to a family emergency.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the {{following}} series against Pakistan, Cook recorded his second Test century, gaining him a spot on the boards at Lord's alongside Ian Bell and Collingwood. He and Bell both recorded back to back centuries by the following Test at Old Trafford as well as Cook scoring his then-career best 127 in an innings defeat over Pakistan. In what now seemed a pattern, Cook's century came up while partnering with Collingwood as with his previous two. In the controversial forfeited Test, sometimes called Ovalgate, Cook contributed a first innings top score of 40 and second best 83 before Pakistan refused to return to the field. This score secured Cook's tally of runs, 403, as the second highest scorer for England and third overall in the series. Once again Cook was <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one day series. At {{the end of the season}} he was again awarded the Young Player of the Year award as well as being shortlisted for ICC Emerging Player of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Zappa in New York {{featured}} {{a song about}} sex criminal Michael H. Kenyon, [...] "The Illinois Enema Bandit", which featured Don Pardo providing the opening narrative in the song. Like many songs on the album, it contained numerous sexual references, leading to many critics objecting and being offended by the content. Zappa dismissed the criticism by noting {{that he was a}} journalist reporting on life as he saw it. Predating his later fight against censorship, he remarked: [...] "What do you make of a society that is so primitive that it clings to the belief that certain words in its language are so powerful that they could corrupt you the moment you hear them?" [...] The remaining albums released by Warner Bros. Records without Zappa's consent were Studio Tan in 1978 and Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites in 1979, which contained complex suites of instrumentally-based tunes recorded between 1973 and 1976, and whose release was <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of the legal problems.|$|E

The same year she received two Grammy Award nominations—Best R Vocal Performance, Female and Best R Song for [...] "That's The Way Love Goes"—winning Best R Song. Several critics asserted she was unjustly <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grammy's three major categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the Year. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated, [...] "Jackson again was denied a nomination for {{album of the}} year, even though 'janet' (Virgin) has remained in the Top 10 since its release last summer and has been critically acclaimed." [...] He adds that [...] "the oversight is doubly vexing, because —in a songwriting and production partnership with Jimmy Jam (aka James Harris III) and Terry Lewis—is not just a multiplatinum pop act but an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues over the last decade." [...] Kot laid blame to the oversight {{on the fact that}} many believed her to be a producer-dependent artist—an opinion he found to be in error. Similarly, producer Jimmy Jam stated: [...] "It's easy to say that the two albums she did before she met us weren't successful and when she got with us she became successful... 'Control' was the first album she actually had input. I think that's just as significant as the fact we (Jam and Lewis) did the record." ...|$|E

500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't <b>overlooked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.
