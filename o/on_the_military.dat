He also served <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> Liaison Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. He became Deputy Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff, operations, for Atomic Energy, in July 1948, and Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, for Atomic Energy, in February 1950, {{although}} he remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> Liaison Committee.

Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier.|$|E

5|$|As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes {{brought about by the}} collapse of the Soviet Union <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E

Trưởng was shocked to discover, however, that the Airborne Division was to be removed to III Corps (unknown to Trưởng at the time, the Marine Division was also already slated for redeployment with both units then forming a new national reserve).|$|E
5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and {{political}} history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In his works, he argued that Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.|$|E
5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E
50|$|The {{biggest issue}} that caused deep {{fissures}} between {{the army and}} the government was the midnight e-memorandum posted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military’s</b> website objecting to the selection of Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül as the ruling party’s candidate for the Presidency in 2007. <b>The</b> <b>military</b> argued that <b>the</b> election of Gül, whose wife wears an Islamic headscarf, could undermine the laicistic order of the country.|$|R

5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and while it is true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E
5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign policy innovation was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b>|$|E

His 1968 book on the 30 September Movement coup in 1965, written in collaboration with Ismail Saleh and entitled The Coup Attempt of the 30 September Movement in Indonesia, was the first on the subject to be published.

5|$|Following the Reformation gains (the Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was the {{culmination}} of the unique in Europe religious toleration processes), the Catholic Church embarked on an ideological counter-offensive and Counter-Reformation claimed many converts from Protestant circles. Disagreements over and difficulties with the assimilation of the eastern Ruthenian populations of the Commonwealth had become clearly discernible. At an earlier stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves in the religious Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> front, in a series of Cossack uprisings.|$|E
5|$|In July 1985, Schwarzkopf {{began an}} 11-month {{assignment}} as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the Pentagon. On July 1, 1986, {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant general, and was reassigned to Fort Lewis as commander of I Corps. He held this post for 14 months before returning to the Pentagon as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans in August 1987. In a second role, Schwarzkopf served as the Army's senior member <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> Staff Committee at the United Nations Security Council, where he began to build diplomatic skills in dealings with representatives from other countries. As a part of his duties during the posting, he sat in on arms reduction talks with leaders from the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The French {{soldiers}} {{charged with}} holding the citadel soon became stretched by the guerrilla attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> installation. De Genouilly {{had decided to}} withdraw some of his forces back to central Vietnam. In addition, the inland position of the French forces lessened their technological advantage. As a result, the French decided to evacuate and destroy the fort. This was achieved on March 8. Captain Deroulede used 32 chests of explosives. He also razed the citadel by setting the rice granary ablaze, along with the weapons and munitions. The resulting fire was improbably claimed to have smoldered for a further three years. The French withdrew {{to the outskirts of}} the city, before returning to central Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The Interim Committee {{held its}} first meeting on 9 May 1945.

The Interim Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> use of nuclear weapons but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime use of nuclear weapons and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the Interim Committee's involvement.|$|E
