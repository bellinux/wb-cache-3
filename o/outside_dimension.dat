5000|$|A few {{factors were}} in Tudor's favor. Hiring ships was cheap because many left Boston empty to collect cargo {{later in the}} West Indies. Ice was free, only the labor of cutting it needed payment. Sawdust was also free as a waste product of the lumber industry, and {{insulated}} ice effectively.Tudor had his first profits in 1810 when his gross sales amounted to about $7400, then increasing to just short of $9000; but of that he only received $1000 due to the [...] "villainous conduct" [...] of his agent. At this point his personal debts far outweighed his income and he spent parts of 1812 and 1813 in debtor's prison. By 1815, however, {{he had managed to}} borrow $2100, both to buy ice and to pay for a new ice-house in Havana. It was a double-shelled structure, twenty-five feet square on its <b>outside</b> <b>dimension,</b> nineteen feet square on the interior, and sixteen feet high, holding some 150 tons of ice. [...] "Pursued by sheriffs to the very wharf," [...] in Boston, Tudor set sail for Havana on November 1, 1815. By 1816, Tudor was shipping ice from Massachusetts to Cuba with ever-increasing efficiency and decided to try his hand at importing Cuban fruit to New York. In August of that year, he borrowed $3000 (at 40% interest) for a shipload of limes, oranges, bananas, and pears, preserving it with 15 tons of ice and 3 tons of hay. The experiment ended in disaster as virtually all the fruit rotted during the month-long voyage, leaving Tudor with several thousand dollars' worth of new debt. Still, he pressed on, opening up new markets in three southern U.S. cities (Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and New Orleans, Louisiana).|$|E

The <b>outside</b> <b>dimension</b> of each small house was 1. 70 x 1. 70 x 2. 85 m 3 (W x L x H) and inside dimension was 1. 50 x 1. 50 x 2. 20 m 3. The volume of each room was 4. 95 m 3. The gable roofs slope were 25 o and surface area of VRT was 2. 58 m 2 per each side facing north and south. The VRT tile composed of upper cement plate 40 × 40 cm 2 and lower cement plate 30 x 40 cm 2. Between plates was 3 cm thickness air gap. The experimental {{results showed that the}} top surface of VRT was lower than CCR about 2. 10 oC for average temperature (from 6 : 00 – 18 : 00) and made VRT room temperature lower than CCR about 1. 41 oC for average temperature. VRT could reduce heat gain with air flow rate through the roof tiles gaps varied following the solar radiation, during time 8 : 00 - 17 : 00 the natural ventilation varied from 0. 003 - 0. 014 m 3 /s (10. 6 - 50. 0 m 3 /hr.).

40|$|President of the United States of America. The Monument {{consists}} of a 169. 16 m high column with a large pyramidal foundation. It was built in two periods straddling the Civil War. During the first period from 1848 to 1858, the foundation base was 24. 38 m square, the column was built to a height of 55. 5 m and the average pressure under the foundation reached 513 kPa. In 1879, the foundation was underpinned and {{the base of the}} foundation became a square ring with an <b>outside</b> <b>dimension</b> of 38. 54 m and an inside dimension of 13. 41 m. The column was completed in 1884 and created an average pressure under the foundation of 465 kPa. The original foundation rested on a medium compact sand- stiff clay mixture which was 3. 76 m thick, underlain by a 8. 30 m thick layer of very dense sand, gravel and clay, followed by a 11. 68 m thick layer of stiff to very stiff high plasticity blue clay resting on decomposed Wissahickon schist. The underpinning brought the foundation level down to the very dense sand and gravel layer. Calculations indicate that the Monument settled about 1. 3 m during the first construction period, 1848 - 1858. During underpinning in 1879, the measured settlement was 52 mm. During the completion of the column from 55. 5 m to the full height of 169. 16 m the measured settlement was an additional 63 mm. From 1884 to 1993, the Washington Monument settled an additional 55 mm in a very linear fashion with time. This remarkable case history i...|$|E
40|$|The National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) {{storage ring}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) will be {{equipped}} with 54 dipole magnets having a gap of 35 mm, and 6 dipoles having a gap of 90 mm. Each dipole has a field of 0. 4 T and provides 6 degrees of bending for a 3 GeV electron beam. The large aperture magnets are necessary to allow the extraction of long-wavelength light from the dipole magnet to serve {{a growing number of}} users of low energy radiation. The dipoles must not only have good field homogeneity (0. 015 % over a 40 mm x 20 mm region), but the integral transfer functions and integral end harmonics of the two types of magnets must also be matched. The 35 mm aperture dipole has a novel design where the yoke ends are extended up to the <b>outside</b> <b>dimension</b> of the coil using magnetic steel nose pieces. This design increases the effective length of the dipole without increasing the physical length. These nose pieces can be tailored to adjust the integral transfer function as well as the homogeneity of the integrated field. One prototype of each dipole type has been fabricated to validate the designs and to study matching of the two dipoles. A Hall probe mapping system has been built with three Group 3 Hall probes mounted on a 2 -D translation stage. The probes are arranged with one probe in the midplane of the magnet and the others vertically offset by {+-} 10 mm. The field is mapped around a nominal 25 m radius beam trajectory.

40|$|Plating of Neurospora conidia or ascospores {{is often}} {{accomplished}} using a glass spreader to distribute suspended cells on the agar surface. See How to plate conidia and ascospores. Spreaders are commonly made of 3 mm diameter soft glass rod with a 70 ° bend 50 mm {{from one end}} (Davis and de Serres 1970). These are sturdy and suitable for reuse. Common practice is to sterilize the spreader between using it for different spore samples by dipping it in alcohol and flaming to burn off the excess alcohol. This kills conidia. Ascospores, however, are large, thick-walled, and heat-resistant, and the procedure does not ensure that all ascospores adhering to the spreader will be killed (Newmeyer and Wallace 1971). It is imperative, therefore, that an already used spreader be replaced with a sterile spreader whenever ascospores from different crosses are to be plated one after another. Spreaders handmade from disposable Pasteur pipettes provide a convenient alternative to the conventional spreaders made of glass rod. Procedure Disposable Pasteur pipets 23 cm long are suitable. (VWR Scientific Catalog No. 14572 - 380. Flint glass. <b>Outside</b> <b>dimension</b> of body, 7 mm; OD of 12 cm-long capillary stem, ~ 1. 5 mm.) Pipets are sterilized in a hot-air oven. Each spreader is made just before use. A pipet is brought carefully toward a small flame (Bunsen Burner pilot or alcohol lamp) until the long, thin stem melts at a selected point and the distal portion bends downward {{as a result of}} gravity. The angle at which it solidifies depends on how the pipette is held. A second bend, made quickly and easily, can shape the capillary tip into a straight, 4 - or 5 -cm-long interval suitably angled for spreading. There is no need to dip in alcohol or to flame before using. Each newly made spreader is discarded after use. Because the capillary portion of the Pasteur pipet is thinner than the solid glass rod of conventional spreaders, cells are spread more evenly and are not concentrated in the water film that is formed by surface tension if a spreader is picked up before liquid has been completely imbibed...|$|E
