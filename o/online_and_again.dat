40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to obtain {{empirical}} evidence of secrecy of disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, and body checking among non-clinical women. Female undergraduate students without a history of eating disorders (N = 212) completed questionnaires <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> in the lab a week later under the pretense that their responses were private or would be public. Changes in self-report from the online questionnaires to those completed in the lab indicated secrecy of the relevant construct. The results revealed that women are secretive about their desire to be thin, concerns with food intake, bulimic symptoms, body dissatisfaction, and body checking, but not about dietary restraint. Generally, women for whom appearance is a defining feature of the self, and who are low in fear of negative evaluation tended to be most secretive. Thus, it these women may have been most motivated and willing to engage in impression management...|$|E

The study aims (i) {{to find out if}} pantuns help learners to use the language creatively (ii) {{to find out if the}} respondents used Metacognitive strategies in accomplishing the tasks (iii) to determine learners” perceptions in learning English using keyboard and screen. A total of 50 students attended the English class. They were taught a topic on Special Greetings and how to write pantuns in greetings. Learners designed their own Pantun Greeting Cards and exhibited their work on board for others to read and comment. The instructor selected three best cards and justified the choices. Next, the learners moved on to the computers and assigned to access ([URL] They typed their Pantun Greetings in the Talking Cards and to click „Play” to hear the pantuns being recited with native pronunciations.

The data were then analysed accordingly using frequency counts, percentages and vignettes. The findings show that all the respondents agreed that pantuns helped them use the language creatively.

40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} {{self-reported}} attachment anxiety and avoidance through an online relationship-building paradigm. Seventy-seven undergraduate participants completed an online attachment-focused paradigm {{in which they}} developed {{a relationship with a}} virtual partner, and fifty participants successfully completed a second laboratory-based phase of the study. During the online phase, all participants completed the Experiences in Close Relationships―Revised questionnaire (ECR-R), the experimental group engaged in an interactive relationship-formation story with a virtual partner designed to enhance secure attachment, and control participants engaged in the program without guidance. Participants then visited the laboratory, were asked to recall the <b>online</b> interaction, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> completed the ECR-R. Overall, participants exhibited a significant decrease in their attachment anxiety, but not avoidance; however, change in attachment security did not differ based on study group. Change in the experimental condition was attributed to the secure focus of the guided interaction with the virtual partner. Change in the control condition, on the other hand, was attributed to general relationship practice and behavioral principles of operant conditioning. These results provide preliminary evidence for the effect of a virtual practice relationship on attitudes towards real-life attachments to significant others...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the effects {{and implications of}} utilising multiple social influence strategies simultaneously to endorse a single product or call to action.

In Study 3, we test these findings in an <b>online</b> advertising campaign <b>and</b> <b>again</b> show that a single influence strategy is more effective than the combined usage of multiple influence strategies.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} and develop various {{statistical}} models to enhance {{and improve the}} efficiency of statistical modeling of count data in various applications. The major emphasis {{of the work is}} focused on developing hierarchical models. Various schemes of hierarchical structures are thus developed and analyzed in this work ranging from purely static hierarchies to dynamic models. The second part of the work concerns itself with the development of multitopic statistical models. It has been shown that these models provide more realistic modeling characteristics in comparison to mono topic models. We proceed with developing several multitopic models and we analyze their performance against benchmark models. We show that our proposed models in the majority of instances improve the modeling efficiency in comparison to some benchmark models, without drastically increasing the computational demands. In {{the last part of the}} work, we extend our proposed multitopic models to include <b>online</b> learning capability <b>and</b> <b>again</b> we show the relative superiority of our models in comparison to the benchmark models. Various real world applications such as object recognition, scene classification, text classification and action recognition, are used for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of our proposed models. ...|$|R

40|$|Summingbird is an {{open-source}} domain-specific language {{implemented in}} Scala {{and designed to}} integrate <b>online</b> <b>and</b> batch MapReduce computations in a single framework. Summingbird programs are written using dataflow abstractions such as sources, sinks, and stores, and can run on different execution platforms: Hadoop for batch processing (via Scalding/Cascading) <b>and</b> Storm for <b>online</b> processing. Different execution modes require different bindings for the dataflow abstractions (e. g., HDFS files or message queues for the source) but do not require any changes to the program logic. Furthermore, Summingbird can operate in a hybrid processing mode that transparently integrates batch <b>and</b> <b>online</b> results to efficiently generate up-to-date aggregations over long time spans. The language was designed to improve developer productivity and address pain points in building analytics solutions at Twitter where often, the same code needs to be written twice (once for batch processing <b>and</b> <b>again</b> for <b>online</b> processing) <b>and</b> indefinitely maintained in parallel. Our key insight is that certain algebraic structures provide the theoretical foundation for integrating batch <b>and</b> <b>online</b> processing in a seamless fashion. This means that Summingbird imposes constraints on the types of aggregations that can be performed, although in practice we have not found these constraints to be overly restrictive for {{a broad range of}} analytics tasks at Twitter. 1...|$|R
