50|$|The {{problem to}} be solved is {{detection}} of faces in an image. A human can do this easily, but a computer needs precise instructions and constraints. To make the task more manageable, Viola-Jones requires full view frontal upright faces. Thus {{in order to be}} detected, the entire face must point towards the camera and should not be tilted to either side. While it seems these constraints could diminish the algorithm's utility somewhat, because the detection step is most often followed by a recognition step, in practice these limits <b>on</b> <b>pose</b> are quite acceptable.|$|E

40|$|State-of-the-art {{methods for}} {{large-scale}} 3 D reconstruction from RGB-D sensors usually reduce drift in camera tracking by globally optimizing the estimated camera poses in real-time without simultaneously updating the reconstructed surface <b>on</b> <b>pose</b> changes. We propose an efficient on-the-fly surface correction method for globally consistent dense 3 D reconstruction of large-scale scenes. Our approach uses a dense Visual RGB-D SLAM system that estimates the camera motion in real-time on a CPU and refines it {{in a global}} pose graph optimization. Consecutive RGB-D frames are locally fused into keyframes, which are incorporated into a sparse voxel hashed Signed Distance Field (SDF) on the GPU. <b>On</b> <b>pose</b> graph updates, the SDF volume is corrected on-the-fly using a novel keyframe re-integration strategy with reduced GPU-host streaming. We demonstrate in an extensive quantitative evaluation that our method is up to 93 % more runtime efficient compared to the state-of-the-art and requires significantly less memory, with only negligible loss of surface quality. Overall, our system requires only a single GPU and allows for real-time surface correction of large environments. Comment: British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), London, September 201...|$|E

30|$|Second, we rely <b>on</b> <b>pose</b> {{information}} during training. When {{this information}} is inaccurate, the trained model is suboptimal and produces more false positives.

We could eliminate duplicate detections by comparing the detections of the interaction models.|$|E

30|$|When tested only on {{videos of}} the same class, the HOGHOFMBH model outperforms all other model configurations. This {{demonstrates}} that interactions are more accurately detected {{by a combination of}} pose and motion information. When additional sequences of other interactions are tested (MC), we notice a drop for all models but only marginally for HOGHOFMBH. Especially when relying only <b>on</b> <b>pose</b> information alone in the HOG model, the confusion between interactions increases. The HOGMBH model does not really improve performance over the HOG model. And although the HOGHOF model improves performance slightly more, the most dramatic improvement is caused by the combination of all three feature types.|$|E

30|$|Some SLAM methods using {{current sensor}} and odometry data are based <b>on</b> <b>pose</b> tracking, {{which is a}} {{localization}} method for detecting {{the location of the}} mobile robot based on a given initial robot posture. Starting from this point, the robot posture is recognized by continuously tracking the robot’s path. If a well-tracked robot is suddenly moved to somewhere else without being told, the problem is called kidnapping. The autonomous robot should detect this problem in real time; otherwise, failures or faults are caused by the effects from kidnapping. Thus, the robot may execute a wrong action using the wrong information, even hurting humans, environment or damaging itself.|$|E

Unfortunately, such an 	assumption is often violated due to measurement 	noises as well as irregular movements of persons. To 	deal with the problem, we have developed a 	technique for measuring relative position between 	persons using occlusion reasoning. In particular, we 	show how the use of relative position measurements 	can improve the tracking performance, even in 	difficult situations where two persons frequently 	overlap in images...|$|E
