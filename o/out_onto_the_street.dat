5|$|On Christmas Day, Archie tells Ian the CD of the {{recording}} is under Ian's Christmas tree for Jane, but Ian fails to find it. Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as {{he has made a}} surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} is postponed {{and the parents}} are out looking for work when a prospective tenant appears. Mrs. O'Brien shows him the room and he is interested, but {{does not know what}} to do with the children. Mrs. O'Brien puts the children <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> where they dance to the music played by an organ grinder.

25|$|During the night, rebels {{reportedly}} {{captured the}} Tripoli International Airport, {{as well as}} a weapons depot inside the capital. Tripoli residents received text messages from the government, asking them to go <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and 'eliminate the armed agents'. Heavy fighting within the capital was confirmed by reporters within the city, who heard explosions and sustained gunfire.|$|E

5000|$|The sudden {{popularity}} in the 1960s of the miniskirt brought <b>the</b> concept <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> and was viewed by many as mass exhibitionism. One commentator in the 1960s said, [...] "In European countries ... they ban mini-skirts in <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> and say they're an invitation to rape...." ...|$|R
25|$|Later, {{the area}} became Radio Row. New York City's Radio Row, which existed from 1921 to 1966, was a {{warehouse}} district on the Lower West Side in the Financial District. Harry Schneck opened City Radio on Cortlandt Street in 1921, {{and eventually the}} area held several blocks of electronics stores, with Cortlandt Street as its central axis. The used radios, war surplus electronics (e.g., ARC-5 radios), junk, and parts often piled so high they would spill <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> attracting collectors and scroungers. According to a business writer, it also was {{the origin of the}} electronic component distribution business.|$|E
25|$|Charles Straub had {{a seat in}} {{the family}} circle close to the stairway; he was in the company of his friend Joseph Kreamer. He remembered, “we could hardly run down the stairs; we were crowded down.” Though at first he saw no smoke, {{by the time he had}} been carried down to the last flight, it had grown thicker. There he tripped and people fell on top of him. By then the last flight of stairs was dark and full of smoke. Straub {{struggled}} up and stumbled forward. He estimated that about twenty-five people had gotten out ahead of him. Wondrously, though he had been pushed down three flights of stairs and thought that hundreds had fallen on top of him, only about ten or twelve people came <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> after him. He waited around the Washington Street entrance for three-quarters of an hour, but he never saw his friend Kreamer emerge from the stairway, nor did he ever see him again.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Simpson Day – Landis {{remarks in}} a voiceover that D-Day {{has been the}} hardest to track down for the documentary, saying that rumors have flown around, with his {{whereabouts}} ranging from a Buddhist monastery in Nepal to the Yukon Territory. Landis eventually approaches a house in Modesto, California, where a man opens the door by a crack and claims, in a Hispanic accent, [...] "I don't know no D-Day person! I don't know him!" [...] He slams the door in Landis' face and then bursts {{out of the garage}} in a car. He pulls <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to the strains of the William Tell Overture, gives a manic laugh exactly like D-Day's, and speeds off.|$|E
50|$|But in 2013 Metje Blaak, {{who worked}} in the sex trade for 25 years before turning to film making, says closing legal brothels will push women <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> “In <b>the</b> window is safe, open.

50|$|The friary {{continued}} {{to serve the}} local Shropshire community, dispensing spiritual and medical help to local Salopians during its 300-year existence.

5000|$|The priory was {{dissolved}} in 1538. As the monks and prior had been executed, none {{were given a}} pension; Unusually none of the servants of the priory were given a pension either, and the five paupers who lived within the priory were thrown <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> [...] "penniless".|$|R
500|$|Michael and Carole turn {{to crime}} {{as a means}} of getting by, with Carole taking the role of a prostitute. Carole flirts with a sleazy {{businessman}} and brings him to a hotel room, where Michael beats him to death with a lead pipe. The two walk out into a pinball background with the dead man's cash. Just then, Shorty shows up and shoots Michael {{in the head with a}} gun that Angie gave him to finish the job before Ida chases him; the bullet is seen going through Michael's skull in slow motion. Many of the movie's characters run around in a circle and a kaleidoscope of shocking images and horrifying events proceeds before reverting to the live action story. The [...] "real" [...] Michael destroys a pinball machine after it tilts and walks <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> bumps into the [...] "real" [...] Carole, and follows her into a park. The two are seen briefly arguing before they finally take each other's hands and begin dancing in the park.|$|E
500|$|Seeing Ike Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon around midnight, Holliday confronted Ike, {{accusing him}} of lying about their {{previous}} conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother, Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp, to intervene. Morgan escorted Holliday <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived {{a few minutes later}} and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk {{had been going on for}} a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready for you in the morning." [...] Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. Ike sat down to have another drink, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp [...] "You must not think I won't be after you all in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{responded to}} the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular. [...] "Titanic is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and {{spitting}} them <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> feeling let down and ripped off," [...] he stated. [...] "They are returning {{again and again to}} repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion." [...] Cameron emphasized people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were [...] "celebrating their own essential humanity" [...] by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally [...] "incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric" [...] and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. [...] "Turan mistakes archetype for cliche," [...] he said. [...] "I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration." ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{the cruise}} officially {{takes place on}} only one day, each year the celebration starts early in the summer with these classic {{vehicles}} brought <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> in preparation, and ancillary events are scheduled in the sponsoring communities of Ferndale, Pleasant Ridge, Royal Oak, Huntington Woods, Berkley, Bloomfield Township, Bloomfield Hills, and Pontiac.|$|R
50|$|A {{foreshock}} {{preceded the}} main earthquake {{by a few}} minutes. Its loud rumble was heard by many, although the shock caused little damage. After hearing this warning noise, people fled the buildings they were in, flooding <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Shortly after this the main shock came, at 8:10 a.m., with a magnitude of 5.9 on the Richter scale.|$|R
50|$|The next {{approach}} to develop was that by arts worker Marie Paneth in 1944. She went <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of London {{to address issues}} such as health, family breakdown and poverty in war-torn parts of the city, using a disused air raid shelter as her base. Her aim was to make good, independent citizens for a good community.|$|R
2500|$|In 1601, {{perhaps to}} fight the growing {{competition}} of other animal trainers, Bankes and Marocco ascended over a thousand steps to the rooftop of the then-flat St Paul's Cathedral and performed the act. The show was a success, and even the clergy came out to watch the performance. Then, to the great astonishment of those watching, Marocco walked down the flight of stairs and <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Writer Thomas Dekker wrote in The Guls Hornebooke (1609): ...|$|E

I was about to pass out because of what I saw. The shells landed in a range of 20 to 40 meters around the school. The school was full of people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brennan's {{contributions}} as [...] "The Long-Winded Lady" [...] in The New Yorker are sardonic {{observations of}} New York life. In them, Brennan mocks Manhattan society and social tradition, {{but in a}} humorous, wistful, and often melancholy manner. In these stories she is an observer eavesdropping on strangers' conversations in bars, diners, hotel lobbies, and streets in places like Times Square and Greenwich Village. [...] She then embellishes her observations with speculations and autobiographical details. Brennan is always an onlooker in these sketches, never a participant. For example, she watches a street protest against the Vietnam War from a window, but does not venture <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> A compendium of her articles was published in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Street Pastors {{was founded}} in Brixton, south London, UK in 2003 by Rev. Les Isaac. It {{was based on a}} model from Jamaica in which {{individual}} churches joined together to take their values <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Street Pastors is an initiative of the Ascension Trust, a registered charity established in 1993. The initial activities of street pastors in areas such as Lewisham and Hackney focussed mainly on confronting gang culture and the use of knives and guns. As Street Pastors started to operate {{in other areas of the}} UK, the initiative responded to other local issues, including anti-social behavior and drunkenness.|$|R

50|$|While hostess bars in Tokyo {{often have}} {{designated}} men out on <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> getting clients {{to come into}} their clubs, some hosts are often sent <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> to find customers, who {{are referred to as}} catch (kyatchu), but these are usually the younger, less-experienced hosts. A common look for a host is a dark suit, collared shirt, silver jewellery, a dark tan, and bleached hair.|$|R
2500|$|Outside {{the major}} {{metropolitan}} cities, few stores {{could afford to}} serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations {{that would allow them}} to separate wealthier customers from the [...] "riff raff." [...] One technique was to have a window opening <b>out</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from which customers could be served. [...] This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack. The eighteenth century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.|$|E
