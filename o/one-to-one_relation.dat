5000|$|TMD {{fails to}} provide {{accurate}} estimates of ICP mostly because the acoustic impedance and its changes {{due to the}} acoustic reflex are dominantly determined by the structures and functional properties of the middle ear, and only marginally influenced by changes in ICP. A measurable acoustic phenomenon that originates in the inner ear would, at least in theory, allow for more precise assessment of {{the pressure of the}} peri- and endo-lymph, and consequently, of ICP. Otoacoustic emission (OAE), which is a sound generated by subtle oscillations of the endo- and perilymph caused by contractions of the outer hairy cells of the inner ear in response to a loud sound, seems to offer such a possibility. The sound is transmitted to the stapes, and further through the ossicles, to the tympanic membrane from which it can be detected with a sensitive microphone inserted into the ear canal. OAE is used in clinical practice to test for hearing deficits in babies and children who are too young to cooperate. The equipment can be made portable, and is relatively easy to use. Two approaches are commonly utilized that increase the unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio and facilitate extraction of the OAE waveform: transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). In a recent US patent issued to Meyerson and colleagues [...] thought the use of both the TEOAE and DPOAE for measurement of ICP. TEOAE is used first to determine the optimum OAE response frequency, after which the pair of pure tones is deployed in a DPOAE paradigm such that the cubic distortion product frequency equals the optimum response frequency while the ratio of frequencies f2/f1 is set to 5:4, and of intensities I2/I1 to 6:5. The inventors also proposed formulae that relate ICP to the intensity or phase of the measured OAE signal, and described how the other physiological signals or behaviors that are known to affect ICP such as small oscillations of ICP with each heart beat, respiration, or posture changes, can be used to confirm the validity of the obtained measurements (e.g. the absence of modulation of the measured OAE phase with respiration may indicate occlusion of the cochlear aqueduct, in which case OAE cannot provide any information about ICP). There is little data up to date about the clinical utility or accuracy of otoacoustic emission as a measure of ICP. A pilot study of Frank and colleagues that evaluated different modalities of OAE in 12 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with implanted ventricular catheters for direct ICP monitoring revealed that increased ICP or conditions known to increase ICP (e.g. posture changes, abdomen compression, coughing) were associated with notable decreases (between -2.1 and -7.9SPL) in intensity of the evoked OAE. All results were however reported only as group averages, and no attempt was made to derive a quantitative <b>one-to-one</b> <b>relation</b> between the OAE intensity and ICP. This method as all other correlation based approaches can not be used for absolute ICP value measurement because of impossibility of individual calibration.|$|E

First, e-mental health applications are inherently scalable, whereas traditional care involves <b>one-to-one</b> <b>relations</b> between patient and clinician. Second, electronic data formats can facilitate interoperability in a way that medical data on paper cannot. Third, the flexibility of a web application warrants that improvements in the care program exposed through the application will immediately benefit all applicable users.

Many distinct such applications have been developed in recent years, most of them starting from scratch and running in isolation. In this paper, we design and propose a generic architecture for e-mental health applications from two case studies.

40|$|In {{this article}} I propose that creoles are {{relatively}} transparent {{compared to their}} source languages. This means that they display more <b>one-to-one</b> <b>relations</b> between meaning and form. Transparency should be distinguished from the concepts of simplicity, ease of acquisition, and regularity. Definitions of these notions are given and it is shown how they have been mixed up in earlier literature. The transparency of creoles is explained {{as a result of}} language contact. When people speaking radically different languages communicate, they tend to use maximally intelligible forms, i. e. transparent forms. The repeated selection of transparent over opaque forms will lead to the formation of a relatively transparent language. Hence, creoles are predicted to be either as transparent as or more transparent than their source languages. An empirical study is performed to test this prediction. The transparency of four contact languages and their sub- and superstrates is measured by checking them on a list of non-transparent features. It turns out that they all exhibit opaque structures, but that there is a striking absence of so called form-based forms: linguistic elements and rules that are not motivated pragmatically or semantically. This indicates that such ‘empty’ forms are lost during intense language contact...|$|R

Grafting experiments established unequivocal <b>one-to-one</b> <b>relations</b> between SFT (SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS), a tomato homolog of FT, and the hypothetical florigen, in all flowering plants. Additional studies of SFT and SP (SELF PRUNING, homolog of TFL 1), two antagonistic genes regulating {{the architecture of the}} sympodial shoot system, have suggested that transition to flowering in the day-neutral and perennial tomato is synonymous with ‘termination’. Dosage manipulation of its endogenous and mobile, graft-transmissible levels demonstrated that florigen regulates termination and transition to flowering in an SP-dependent manner and, by the same token, that high florigen levels induce growth arrest and termination in meristems across the tomato shoot system. It was thus proposed that growth balances, and consequently the patterning of the shoot systems in all plants, are mediated by endogenous, meristem-specific SFT/SP ratios, and that shifts to termination by elevated SFT/SP ratios are triggered by mobile florigen. Florigen is a universal growth plant hormone inherently checked by a complementary antagonistic systemic system. Thus, an examination of the endogenous functions of FT-like genes, or of the systemic roles of the mobile florigen in any plant species, that fails to pay careful attention to the balancing antagonistic systems, or to consider its functions in day-neutral or perennial plants, would be incomplete...|$|R

These studies, although revealing the major general modes of wave climate variability and trends, {{do not take}} into consideration the complexity of the wind-wave fields. Because ocean waves are the response to both local and remote winds, analyzing the directional full spectra can shed light on atmospheric circulation not only over the immediate ocean region, but also over a broad basin scale. In this work, the authors use a pattern classification approach to explore wave climate variability in the frequency–direction domain. This approach identifies atmospheric circulation patterns of the sea level pressure from the 31 -yr long Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and wave spectral patterns of two selected buoys in the North Atlantic, finding <b>one-to-one</b> <b>relations</b> between each synoptic pattern (circulation type) and each spectral wave energy distribution (spectral type).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} {{the degree of}} transparency of 22 languages. Transparency {{is defined as the}} extent to which a language maintains <b>one-to-one</b> <b>relations</b> between units at different levels of organisation, i. e. pragmatics, semantics, morphosyntax and phonology. Languages are compared not only as regards the amount of non-transparent phenomena in their grammars, so as to rank them from relatively transparent to relatively non-transparent, but also to uncover an implicational pattern in the distribution of non-transparent features across languages. Transparency is discussed in connection to the notions of simplicity and learnability. Simplicity and transparency are shown to be different concepts that are both relevant in accounting for acquisition data. Whereas most definitions of simplicity take it to apply to particular domains of grammar, transparency is defined as a property of interfaces between levels within the grammar. The term is further operationalised using the framework of Functional Discourse Grammar. It turns out that all languages have at least some non-transparent features, most notably of the redundancy type. Fusion and domain disintegration are less commonly attested, but the non-transparent features that are found only in the least transparent languages are so-called form-based forms: highly syntacticised forms and structures that have no pragmatic or semantic motivation. Furthermore, non-transparent relations at the interfaces of the phonological and pragmatic levels are found in many languages, whereas it is less common to violate transparency at morphosyntactic and semantic interfaces. The attested implicational hierarchy of transparency proves that transparency is a relevant typological notion...|$|R
