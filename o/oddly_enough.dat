The 28–0 Lady Flames of Liberty were the champions of the Big South conference, giving them a berth in the tournament as a No. 16 seed. The usual #1-#16 blowout occurred, with Tennessee winning 102–58, although in another region this blowout did not occur: No. 16 seed Harvard upset injury-depleted No. 1 seed Stanford 71–67 in the West regional.

5|$|Tropical Storm Arthur caused minimal {{flooding}} in the Carolinas in mid-June1996. The first tropical cyclone and named storm {{of the annual}} Atlantic hurricane season, Arthur originated from an area of increased convection east of the Bahamas on June16. Gradually, the system increased in organization, and was designated as a tropical depression on June17. The depression tracked north-northwest and became Tropical Storm Arthur while just offshore the Southeastern United States on June19. Later that day, Arthur peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h), but weakened slightly before making landfall in North Carolina early the following day. After striking North Carolina, Arthur tracked out to sea and weakened further to a tropical depression. By June21, Arthur transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, impact from Arthur was minimal, limited to light rainfall and moderate surf in North and South Carolina, {{as well as a}} tornado in Florida. Total damage amounted to $1million (1996USD), but no fatalities were reported. <b>Oddly</b> <b>enough,</b> 18 years later in 2014, around the same time, another tropical cyclone with the same name impacted areas very similar to where this tropical storm impacted.|$|E

25|$|<b>Oddly</b> <b>enough,</b> the Annals of Joseon Dynasty never {{mentions}} the map {{although it was}} obviously a national project. Another interesting fact is that this map uses the Ming Chinese era name Jianwen. After the Jianwen Emperor lost to Zhu Di in a civil war, the new emperor banned {{the use of the}} era name Jianwen in the 10th month of 1402. Thus the map should have used the era name Hongwu, not Jianwen. However, the era name Jianwen can be found even on the later Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies. This suggests that the Kangnido was never disclosed to the Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Lock {{numbering}} {{changed over}} the years. As mentioned before, Guard Lock No. 2 was numbered Lock 24 for a time, which could cause confusion with Riley's Lock, No 24, upstream. For {{a period of time}} in the early days, the locks were called by letters but that was later changed to numbers. <b>Oddly</b> <b>enough,</b> many of the lock numbers correspond to the contour elevation, e.g. Lock 26 is at the 260 foot elevation line, and lock 30 is at the 300 foot mark, although it is doubted that things were planned that way, and many locks do not correspond to the elevation, e.g. Lock 72 is at the 580 foot mark.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. <b>Oddly</b> <b>enough,</b> most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E
25|$|The Bloc Québécois {{had a very}} {{successful}} result in the 2004 election, with the Liberals reduced to the core areas of federalist support in portions of Montreal and the Outaouais. <b>Oddly</b> <b>enough,</b> this meant that there were comparatively few winnable Bloc seats left—perhaps eight or so—for the party to target. With provincial allies the Parti Québécois widely tipped to regain power in 2007, a large sovereigntist contingent in the House could {{play a major role}} in reopening the matter of Quebec independence. The Bloc Québécois only runs candidates in the province of Quebec. However, Gilles Duceppe's dream of winning 50%+ of the popular vote was dashed when the polls broke after the New Year, and the Conservatives became a real threat to that vision in Quebec.|$|E

I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian.

However, he would suffer a 29th and two 31st-place finishes {{in the next four}} races, crippling his chances in the points race as he fell to fourth-place, 302 points behind Harvick. Green finished 124 points behind Harvick and earned his second runner-up finish in three seasons. He had seven finishes outside the Top 20 compared to only two the previous season. In all, during his three-year full-time return to the Busch Series, Green had 13 wins and 72 Top 10's, both the most of any driver during that period, and averaged three top-tens in every four races. Later that season Green began driving for Richard Childress Racing part-time in the No. 30 America Online-sponsored Chevrolet in Winston Cup (<b>oddly</b> <b>enough</b> as a replacement for Harvick, who was supposed to drive this car before the death of Dale Earnhardt caused him to be promoted to Childress' Winston Cup team much earlier than planned). Green competed in eight races, winning one pole and scoring one top-10 finish. After the season, he left the Busch Series to drive for Childress full-time.|$|E

500|$|There are {{established}} clans {{which do not}} have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. In such cases, clan members usually wear a crest badge which contains the crest and motto of the last known chief. However, there are [...] instances where such clans wear crest badges which are based upon the arms of someone who was never a recognised clan chief. For example, Clan Macfie, which current does not have a chief, uses a crest badge which is derived from the arms of one of the first two Macfies who registered Arms at Lyon Court. Another clan Clan MacEwen whose chiefly line has been untraced since the 15th century, has a crest badge containing the crest and motto of a baronet bearing the surname McEwen. <b>Oddly</b> <b>enough,</b> the McEwen Baronets may not have any actual link with the main Clan MacEwen at all. Another instance is the crest badge of Clan MacInnes. This crest badge is based upon a modern coat of arms of an armigerous clan member, not a clan chief.|$|E

[...] Through 2003, he was active as inker on several Marvel Comics titles, including Daredevil (#248–300), Spider-Man 2099 (#1–25), and Spider-Girl (#1–61), and such non-superhero projects as the four-issue Marvel / Epic Comics miniseries Atomic Age (Nov. 1990 – Feb. 1991), by writer Frank Lovece and penciler Mike Okamoto, for which Williamson won a 1991 Eisner Award for Best Inker. Daredevil penciler John Romita Jr. recalled that, [...] "Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [...] in that I felt that I was protected from mistakes. ...

I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece?

500|$|The kraits, as {{they are}} {{commonly}} known, belong to the family Elapidae and the genus Bungarus. The genus is endemic to the continent of Asia. They are morphologically well connected, forming a close-knit and cohesive unit. The genus has 12–13 species who are morphologically distinct from the Naja genus and the Afro-elapids according to McDowell (1987). McDowell stated [...] "species diversity is greatest in Africa, but the Asiatic Bungarus and Ophiophagus are each so peculiar in anatomy as to suggest an ancient divergence". Others, including Slowinski, believed that the kraits (Bungarus), {{are part of a}} clade that clusters with a group including the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) and <b>oddly</b> <b>enough,</b> with the African mambas (Dendroaspis) on the most-parsimonious tree or with Elapsoidea on the maximum-likelihood tree. This result calls into question the monophyly of cobras and underscores the uncertainty of the homology of the hood spreading behavior in cobras and mambas. The relationships of Dendroaspis, Ophiophagus, and Bungarus differed between the parsimony and likelihood analyses, suggesting that more work is necessary to resolve the relationships of these problematic taxa. McDowell's findings in regard to the sister-group of Bungarus and the sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) family, propose that the kraits might just be a per-mutable clade between the elapidae [...] "palatine-erectors" [...] and the hydrophiinae [...] "palatine draggers". Two genera within the hydrophiinae family in particular, support McDowell's hypothesis. The two genera are Salomonelaps and Loveridgelaps due to many shared characteristics. Mao et al. (1983) showed that this species, Bungarus multicinctus was slightly distinct from the other members of its genus and was immunologically more similar to Laticauda, terrestrial Australian elapids, and true sea snakes than it is to Elapsoidea sundevalli (Sundevall's garter snake), Naja naja (Indan cobra) or two Micrurus species (New World or American coral snakes). Minton (1981), Schwaner et al. and Cadle & Gorman (1981) all suggested similar things to Mao et al. (1983) based on immunological data. The many-banded krait was more similar to the Australian elapids, Laticauda and true sea snakes than they were to numerous elapids they were compared to.|$|E
