That is what verses roll out <b>of,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> speak of other things. Love is the heart of everything.

60|$|Caldigate, {{though he}} bore {{all this with}} an assured face, with but little outward sign of inward misgiving, {{suffered}} much,--much even from the estrangement of those {{with whom he had}} hitherto been familiar. To be 'cut' by any one was a pain to him. Not to be approved <b>of,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be courted, not to stand well in the eyes of those around him, was to him positive and immediate suffering. He was supported no doubt by the full confidence of his father, by the friendliness of the parson, and by the energetic assurances of partisans who were all on his side,--such as Mr. Ralph Holt, the farmer. While Caldigate had been in Cambridge waiting for his wife's escape, Holt and one or two others were maturing a plan for breaking into Puritan Grange, and restoring the wife to her husband. All this supported him. Without it he could hardly have carried himself as he did. But with all this, still he was very wretched. 'It is that so many people should think me guilty,' he said to Mr. Bromley.|$|E
60|$|So {{she walked}} and read, {{and was soon}} in tears. Moreover, when she thought of what Ethelberta would have replied had that keen sister known the wildness of her true reason in wishing to go, she shuddered with misery. To wish to get near a man only {{because he had been}} kind to her, and had admired her pretty face, and had given her flowers, to nourish a passion all the more because of its hopeless impracticability, were things to dream <b>of,</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> tell. Picotee was quite an unreasoning animal. Her sister {{arranged}} situations for her, told her how to conduct herself in them, how to make up anew, in unobtrusive shapes, the valuable wearing apparel she sent from time to time--so as to provoke neither exasperation in the little gentry, nor superciliousness in the great. Ethelberta did everything for her, in short; and Picotee obeyed orders with the abstracted ease of mind which people show who have their thinking done for them, and put out their troubles as they do their washing. She was quite willing not to be clever herself, since it was unnecessary while she had a much-admired sister, who was clever enough for two people and to spare.|$|E

6000|$|I mean (in {{response}} to what you write me of your having read the Golden B.) to try to produce some uncanny form of thing, in fiction, that will gratify you, as Brother--but let me say, dear William, that I shall greatly be humiliated if you do like it, and thereby lump it, in your affection, with things, of the current age, that I have heard you express admiration for and that I would sooner descend to a dishonoured grave than have written. Still I will write you your book, on that two-and-two-make-four system on which all the awful truck that surrounds us is produced, and then descend to my dishonoured grave--taking up {{the art of the}} slate pencil instead of, longer, the art of the brush (vide my lecture on Balzac.) But it is, seriously, too late at night, and I am too tired, for me to express myself on this question--beyond saying that I'm always sorry when I hear of your reading anything of mine, and always hope you won't--you seem to me so constitutionally unable to [...] "enjoy" [...] it, and so condemned to look at it from a point of view remotely alien to mine in writing it, and to the conditions out of which, as mine, it has inevitably sprung--so that all the intentions that have been its main reason for being (with me) appear never to have reached you at all--and you appear even to assume that the life, the elements forming its subject-matter, deviate from felicity in not having an impossible analogy with the life of Cambridge. I see nowhere about me done or dreamed of the things that alone for me constitute the interest of the doing of the novel--and yet it is in a sacrifice of them on their very own ground that the thing you suggest to me evidently consists. It shows how far apart and to what different ends we have had to work out (very naturally and properly!) our respective intellectual lives. And yet I can read you with rapture--having three weeks ago spent three or four days with Manton Marble at Brighton and found in his hands ever so many of your recent papers and discourses, which, having margin of mornings in my room, through both breakfasting and lunching there (by the habit of the house,) I found time to read several of--with the effect of asking you, earnestly, to address me some of those that I so often, in Irving St., saw you address to others who were not your brother. I had no time to read them there. Philosophically, in short, I am [...] "with" [...] you, almost completely, and you ought to take account of this and get me over altogether.--There are two books by the way (one fictive) that I permit you to raffoler about as much as you like, for I have been doing so myself--H. G. Wells's Utopia and his Kipps. The Utopia seems to me even more remarkable for other things than for his characteristic cheek, and Kipps is quite magnificent. Read them both if you haven't--certainly read Kipps.--There's also another subject I'm too full <b>of</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mention the good thing I've done for myself--that is, for Lamb House and my garden--by moving the greenhouse away from the high old wall near the house (into the back garden, setting it up better--against the street wall) and thereby throwing the liberated space into the front garden to its immense apparent extension and beautification....|$|E

But the high praise Stung me with pride and envy, and I rose In mighty competition, to ascend [...] 120 His seat and place my foot triumphantly Upon His subject thrones.
