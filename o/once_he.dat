60|$|<b>Once</b> again <b>he</b> was {{the jungle}} beast revelling in bloody {{conflict}} with his kind. <b>Once</b> again <b>he</b> was Tarzan, son of Kala the she-ape.|$|R

5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} <b>once,</b> <b>he</b> {{said that his}} favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah {{had asked him to}} join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and in his usual jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything else in his career.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, but <b>once</b> <b>he</b> took office, {{he had to}} come down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay.

5|$|George IV came to {{the throne}} in 1820 {{intending}} to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and influence as the ruler of an increasingly powerful Britain. George's previous houses, Carlton House and the Brighton Pavilion were too small for grand court events, even after expensive extensions. George expanded the Royal Lodge in the castle park whilst he was Prince Regent, and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself <b>once</b> <b>he</b> became king.|$|E

6000|$|... "Keep {{behind the}} horses, Nan," [...] he commanded. [...] "That fellow is a ruffian I {{sent to prison}} <b>once.</b> <b>He's</b> trying to get even. He knows our shot won't hurt him at that distance." ...|$|R

5|$|He died on March 29, 1829. He {{was taken}} to the {{cemetery}} by his sons. There was no state funeral at the time, because Juan Lavalle made a coup against the governor Manuel Dorrego and executed him, starting a period of civil war. Lavalle was defeated by Juan Manuel de Rosas, who was appointed governor. <b>Once</b> <b>he</b> restored peace, Rosas made a state funeral for Saavedra, on January 13, 1830.|$|E
5|$|His regents, Armansperg and Rundhart, {{established}} a controversial policy of suppressing the monasteries. This was very upsetting to the Church hierarchy.

5|$|In 1881, Pullin married Alice Ramsden. The {{couple had}} four sons. He {{did not have}} many friends, {{but he was very}} close to the ones he had.

He had strong views on organ music, and <b>once</b> <b>he</b> had formed an opinion he rarely changed his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{told you}} so,' said Welch. 'You're {{to go to}} the Old Man at <b>once.</b> <b>He's</b> just sent over for you. I say, look here, if it's only lines I don't mind doing some of them, if you like.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Once</b> more <b>he</b> lapses into silence. Once {{more she}} lays her hand upon his chest, and moves him {{slightly}} to and fro, {{as a cat}} might stimulate a half-slain mouse. <b>Once</b> more <b>he</b> speaks, {{as if she had}} spoken.|$|R
50|$|Hoppy mistakenly {{believes}} Richard to be {{the thief}} and takes back the money. The honest Richard forms a posse that places Hoppy, California and Lin under arrest. A scheme to trap Jackson pays off, however, and <b>once</b> <b>he's</b> apprehended, all is well.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Indiana Representative Mark Souder {{proposed}} that former president Ronald Reagan, {{who was then}} dying of Alzheimer's disease, replace Roosevelt on the dime <b>once</b> <b>he</b> died, stating that Reagan was as iconic to conservatives as Roosevelt was to liberals. Reagan's wife Nancy expressed her opposition, stating that she was certain the former president would not have favored it either. After Ronald Reagan died in 2004, there was support for a design change, but Souder declined to pursue his proposal.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} the conquest of western and central Honduras until 1539. <b>Once</b> <b>he</b> had established Spanish control there, he headed east to pacify the Olancho valley. Although the conquest {{of the west and}} centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, resistance in the east took much longer to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout the colonial period.|$|E
5|$|Isaac was {{the only}} patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though <b>once</b> <b>he</b> tried to leave, God {{told him not to}} do so. Rabbinic {{tradition}} gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the Land of Israel. Isaac was the oldest of the biblical patriarchs {{at the time of his}} death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed.|$|E

60|$|HARRY. She's grousing rather {{about going}} to Chung-king and I want him to tell her it's a very decent place. He was {{vice-consul}} up there <b>once.</b> <b>He's</b> dining at the Carmichael's, but he said he'd come along here {{as soon as he}} could get away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{quite know}} at the time. It was simply to be with him, I suppose--just <b>once.</b> <b>He's</b> in danger, and I wanted him to know I know it. It makes meeting him--at Cocker's, since it's that I want to stay on for--more interesting." ...|$|R
