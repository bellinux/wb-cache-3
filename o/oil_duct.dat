The fruits of Marlothiella share several unusual features with the genus Lichtensteinia, namely concentric rings of cells around the rib <b>oil</b> <b>ducts,</b> of which the innermost are irregular in size and shape, very small vascular bundles that are usually comprised of two separate strands, and the occurrence of heteromorphy in fruits and ovaries.

40|$|After {{attending}} this presentation, attendees {{will be able}} to use {{a modified}} DNA extraction protocol useful on degraded specimens of bones, teeth, and other various tissues. This presentation will impact the forensic science community presenting factual details that ancient DNA research shares a common problem with forensics and other approaches requiring analyses of museum and non-invasively collected specimens; the amount of endogenous DNA available in the samples is often limited. Thus, extraction techniques that retrieve as much DNA as possible from a specimen are of crucial importance. A wide range of techniques has been published to date, all of which aim to maximize DNA yields, while minimizing the co-extraction of PCR inhibitors. Due to low levels of endogenous DNA, environmental, bacterial, and postmortem DNA damage, as well as the potential presence of environment-borne inhibitors that co-extract with DNA, the recovery of DNA data from degraded specimens can still pose a significant challenge. Previously, DNA extraction from the dental pulp samples was performed following a modified protocol of a Total RNA isolation system, suitable for DNA extraction from samples containing only a small number of nucleated cells. The same method was used for the bone samples. The protocol was partially modified by lengthening the incubation time of the cell lysis step: each sample of dental pulp was placed, overnight, at room temperature, in a single microtube containing 350 L of SV RNA Lysis Buffer. These protocols were applied to five skeletons discovered in Canosa di Puglia (Bari, Italy), during the archaeological excavations of tombs. These protocols do not allow for a complete characterization of genetic systems; however, even though the results obtained were satisfactory considering that the bones were ancient dated between the sixth and seventh centuries. The extraction method on bones, teeth and various tissue fragments of human remains, making some changes to previous protocols used were tested. Following this, the success of amplifying ancient DNA was estimated. Five cases are presented: In the first case, human remains were found in the Apulian countryside in 2002. They most probably belonged to a man who disappeared in 1989 according to the results of parentage testing by forensic hemogenetic investigations performed on the remaining members of the alleged missing man’s family. In the second case, human remains were found in 2006 on an Italian highway which probably belonged to a man reported as missing. Identification was made by comparing the DNA of the remains to a blood sample taken from a brother. The third case involved human remains, discovered in 2009 near a rest home for the elderly in the province of Bari, most likely belonging to an 84 -year-old man who disappeared in 1995. In this case identification was carried out by comparing the genetic profile of the remains to a blood sample taken from the son of the missing man. The fourth case involved the remains of two unknown skeletonized individuals discovered two meters underground. They were discovered in the small town of Marsicovetere, in southern of Italy where a trench for an <b>oil</b> <b>duct</b> was being excavated. In this case, the remains consisted of two full human skeletonized bodies that were highly fragmented. They were presumed to be from a prehistoric period because of their extreme lightness and porosity: they were extremely fragile. The skeletons were removed from the trench by digging around the remains and taking them out along with the soil. The last case concerned remains found in the attic of a church in Potenza in March 2010. DNA extracted from the human remains was compared with the DNA extracted from the blood of members of the missing girl’s family in order to establish identification. The modified method for extracting the DNA genome, followed by the amplification reaction has allowed for the identification of four cadavers and the typification of the fifth. Each of these cases had low expectations for success. These scenarios involved cadavers or remains of unknown origin, which were discovered many years following the time of death. Each was discovered under conditions that did not favor the maintenance of the integrity of nucleic acids...|$|E

The leak is initially identified by the loss of liquid from the system, but its location used to involve engineers digging up the road, freezing a section of cable and seeing if the level was still going down, then choosing a new point to dig and re-freeze. It could take several holes to isolate the leak. If a PFT is injected into the oil, there will be a relatively high concentration of PFT above the leak, which can be pin-pointed to within a few feet, requiring only a single hole to be dug right where the leak is.|$|R

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the monoterpenes limonene and carvone in {{the fruit}} of caraway (Carum carvi L.) proceeds from geranyl diphosphate via a three-step pathway. First, geranyl diphosphate is cyclized to (+) -limonene by a monoterpene synthase. Second, this intermediate is stored in the essential <b>oil</b> <b>ducts</b> without further metabolism or is converted by limonene- 6 -hydroxylase to (+) -trans-carveol. Third, (+) -trans-carveol is oxidized by a dehydrogenase to (+) -carvone.

The activities of the enzymes explain the profiles of monoterpene accumulation quite well, with limonene- 6 -hydroxylase playing a pivotal role in controlling the nature of the end product. In the youngest stages, when limonene- 6 -hydroxylase is undetectable, only limonene was accumulating in appreciable levels. The appearance of limonene- 6 -hydroxylase correlates closely with the onset of carvone accumulation. At later stages of fruit development, the activities of all three enzymes declined to low levels. Although this correlates closely with a decrease in monoterpene accumulation, the latter may also be the result of competition with other pathways for substrate...|$|R

40|$|Vane pumps exhibit {{pressure}} ripple in {{the pressure}} evolution trend during a complete shaft rotation. Pressure ripple can determine oscillating forces {{within the system}} leading to vibration and noise generation. In this context, this paper {{is focused on the}} experimental measurement of the pressure evolution in vane pumps by using two different methodologies. Results of measurements are shown, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies. In the first method a pressure transducer is directly facing the volume between two vanes, in the second method the sensor is located inside an external chamber where the oil is transferred via a ducts suitably designed in the rotor shaft. Briefly, the first method gives better results in terms of pressure evolution but involves some practical problems in the set up: the measurements exhibit pressure offsets strongly dependent on the tightening torque used for sensor mounting and negative pressure values in the low pressure region. The second method is simpler to set up but the results are influenced by the dynamical behavior of the measurement <b>duct</b> carrying <b>oil.</b> In order to avoid resonances of this duct, a vibro-acoustical finite element (FE) model of the oil cavity has been developed. The numerical frequency response functions obtained by the FE model have been used in order to optimize the geometry of the measurement duct, reducing the effects of the resonances of the <b>oil</b> <b>ducts.</b> It is shown that, using this improved methodology, the dynamical components of the measured pressure are not significantly influenced by the frequency response of the measurement duct when the outlet pressures is higher than 50 bar, while for lower outlet pressure the first resonance of the measurement duct is close to the main vane harmonics...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{molecular}} studies (Plunkett et al., 1996 b, 1997; Downie et al., 1999, 2001; Plunkett, 2001; Valiejo-Roman et al., 2002) on {{the family}} Apiaceae {{have shown that the}} existing classification system is largely artificial and that genera and tribes are in need of considerable re-arrangement. The fruit morphology and anatomy of 212 genera and 267 species of the family were studied. This study shows that a new interpretation of traditional morphological evidence will not only help to improve our understanding of the newly emerging molecular phylogeny of the Apiaceae, but also be useful for systematic studies of the family. Fruit structure, the very wide commissure and thick mesocarp as is found in Araliaceae fruits especially, provides some support for the molecular systematic study (Plunkett, 2001) in which it was proposed to move Hydrocotyle L. from Drude’s (1898) Hydrocotyloideae Link. to be a sister of ‘core Araliaceae’. Fruit structural evidence from selected Araliaceae suggests that the Araliaceae and Apiaceae are not fundamentally different and that the two families, as currently circumscribed are linked by taxa sharing character states of both families. Hydrocotyle shows features of both Araliaceae and Mackinlayeae. Two genera, Myodocarpus Brongn. & Gris. and Mackinlaya F. Muell., should be moved from Araliaceae to respectively the Myodocarpeae R. Vig. and Mackinlayeae R. Vig., which cladistically are placed below the Apiaceae. The former has median wings and large vittae and the latter has crystals present in the innermost portion of the mesocarp adjacent to the endocarp. These features are usually absent in Araliaceae but may be present in Apiaceae. A study of fruit features of all other genera with laterally compressed mericarps of Drude’s (1898) Hydrocotyloideae (except for Hydrocotyle) suggests that {{it may be possible to}} move these taxa to Mackinlayeae because they share not only laterally compressed mericarps, but a similar crystal position and arrangement of ventral bundles (there are cells between the ventral bundles, but a true carpophore is absent), as with Mackinlaya. In the present study the subfamily Mulinoideae [Plunkett et al. (2004) has now independently described this subfamily as the Azorelloideae Plunkett & Lowry subfam. nov. ined. ] is proposed and used for Drude’s (1898) Mulineae DC. The Mulinoideae includes three groups, viz. the Klotzschia Cham., Azorella Lam. and Bolax Commerson ex Jussieu groups. The mericarps of the genera in the Klotzschia group may have five prominent ribs and a very wide commissure. In the Azorella group the lateral ribs are small and the marginal ribs may be prominent or winged and the commissure narrow. In the Bolax group the mericarps have more prominent lateral ribs or wings and the marginal ribs are small or undeveloped. The commissure is very narrow. Crystals may be present in the Klotzschia group. They are usually absent in the Azorella group and present in most genera of the Bolax group. These results partly support a molecular study (Plunkett, 2001), in which three groups: the Klotzschia, Azorella and Bowlesia groups, were indicated. The subfamily Saniculoideae is unique in fruit structure. Intrajugal <b>oil</b> <b>ducts</b> are present and there are sometimes some small vittae scattered in the mesocarp. Crystals are dispersed in the mesocarp. Lagoecia L., which has vallecular and commissural vittae, should not be grouped in Saniculoideae but rather be positioned with Apioideae as was indicated by a molecular study (Plunkett et al. 1996; Downie et al., 2001; Valiejo-Roman et al., 2002). Several African genera, including Lichtensteinia Cham. & Schltdl., Marlothiella H. Wolff, Arctopus L., Polemanniopsis B. L. Burtt and Steganotaenia Hochst, have only large intrajugal <b>oil</b> <b>ducts</b> as in Saniculoideae (Steganotaenia also has some small vittae scattered in the mesocarp). A slightly lignified endocarp may be present in most genera (except in Marlothiella) and crystals are present in Lichtensteinia and Marlothiella as in Saniculoideae and absent in other genera. It is proposed that these taxa be moved from Apioideae to near the Saniculoideae as different groups: the Arctopus, Polemanniopsis and Lichtensteinia groups (the latter includes Marlothiella), in addition to the Saniculoideae sensu stricto. This corresponds to a large extent with DNA sequence data (Downie & Katz-Downie, 1999; Plunkett, 2001). The ‘basal Apioideae’ is morphologically poorly defined but can be recognized by a combination of plesiomorphic characters, such as the woody habit, heteromorphic fruits, deciduous leaves and poorly developed carpophores. The most reliable difference between this group and the genera of ‘remaining Apioideae’ is the dispersed crystals in the mesocarp as in Saniculoideae. In ‘basal Apioideae’, DNA studies (Downie et al., 2001; Plunkett, 2001) indicated that the Heteromorpheae Downie & Watson include five endemic African genera: Anginon Raf., Dracosciadium Hilliard & B. L. Burtt, Glia Sond., Heteromorpha Cham. & Schltdl. and Polemannia Eckl. & Zeyh. The fruit study shows that in these genera laterally-winged mericarps (of heteromorphic fruits) and lignified endocarps and mesocarps may be present as well as crystals dispersed in the mesocarp and ventral bundles usually becoming free. Some other endemic African and Madogascar genera, viz. Andriana B-E. van Wyk, Cannaboidea B-E. van Wyk, Pseudocannaboides B-E. van Wyk, Pseudocarum C. Norman and Tana B-E. van Wyk, should also be placed in, or close to, the Heteromorpheae because they have crystals dispersed in the mesocarp and ventral bundles usually becoming free as in some Heteromorpheae. In the Annesorhiza Cham. & Schltdl. group (Annesorhiza and Chamarea Eckl. & Zeyh.), laterally-winged fruits (in heteromorphic fruits), a distinct hypoderm and a lignified endocarp may be present. The monotypic genus Molopospermum W. D. J. Koch is related to Annesorhiza (Downie, personal communication to B-E. van Wyk and P. M. Tilney); it has lateral wings on one of the two mericarps and an abundance of crystals in the mesocarp. The mericarps of the Bupleureae Spreng. may have irregular vittae as in Saniculoideae sensu stricto. All these fruit features are present in the ‘basal Apioideae’ and may be found in Saniculoideae and related groups. Remaining Apioideae differs from the genera of ‘basal Apioideae’ in the absence of dispersed crystals in the mesocarp and various other characters that occur alone or in combination (see above). Eight tribes (including some subtribes) and seven additional clades in ‘remaining Apioideae’ were defined by Downie et al. (2001). The circumscription of some of the tribes, subtribes and clades distinguished by Downie et al. (2001) on the basis of DNA data receive support from fruit structure. These taxa include tribes Aciphylleae and Echinophoreae, subtribes Daucinae and Torilidinae, and clades the Arracacia, Conioselinum and Heracleum clades. The present study shows that Drude’s (1898) system has significant taxonomic value, although many problems are present in his Hydrocotyloideae and Apioideae. These problems may have arisen because some fruit characters were not available, were overlooked, ignored or over-emphasised. Although some of Drude’s groups will be retained in a new system, a clear break from the Drude system is indicated by molecular systematics. This study suggests that taxonomically important fruit characters are wing configuration, presence or absence of intrajugal <b>oil</b> <b>ducts</b> and vittae and their size, presence or absence of crystals and their positions, possible lignification of the endocarp, and the arrangement and position of ventral bundles that may or may not form free carpophores. Therefore, evidence provided by fruit structure, if properly interpreted, can help to support and strengthen the newly emerging molecular phylogeny of the Apiaceae and facilitate understanding of the evolution of taxa in the family.

40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{represent the}} largest portion of capital investment in {{transmission and distribution}} substations. In addition, power transformer outages have a considerable economic impact on the operation of an electrical network. One {{of the most important}} parameters governing a transformer's life expectancy is the hot-spot temperature value. The classical approach has been to consider the hot-spot temperature as the sum of the ambient temperature, the top-oil temperature rise in tank, and the hot-spot-to-top-oil (in tank) temperature gradient. When fibre optic probes were taken into use to record local hot-spots in windings and <b>oil</b> <b>ducts,</b> it was noticed that the hot-spot temperature rise over top-oil temperature due to load changes is a function depending on time as well as the transformer loading (overshoot time dependent function). It has also been noticed that the top-oil temperature time constant is shorter than the time constant suggested by the present IEC loading guide, especially in cases where the oil is guided through the windings in a zigzag pattern for the ONAN and ONAF cooling modes. This results in winding hottest spot temperatures higher than those predicted by the loading guides during transient states after the load current increases, before the corresponding steady states have been reached. This thesis presents new and more accurate temperature calculation methods taking into account the findings mentioned above. The models are based on heat transfer theory, application of the lumped capacitance method, the thermal-electrical analogy and a new definition of nonlinear thermal resistances at different locations within a power transformer. The methods presented in this thesis take into account oil viscosity changes and loss variation with temperature. The changes in transformer time constants due to changes in the oil viscosity are also accounted for in the thermal models. In addition, the proposed equations are used to estimate the equivalent thermal capacitances of the transformer oil for different transformer designs and winding-oil circulations. The models are validated using experimental results, which have been obtained from a series of thermal tests performed on a range of power transformers. Most of the tested units were equipped with fibre optic sensors in the main windings. Some of them also had thermocouples in the core and structural parts. A significant advantage of the suggested thermal models is that they are tied to measured parameters that are readily available (i. e., data obtained from a normal heat run test performed by the transformer manufacturer). reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Large {{transformers}} used {{in power}} distribution or electrical substations have their core and coils immersed in oil, which cools and insulates. <b>Oil</b> circulates through <b>ducts</b> in the coil {{and around the}} coil and core assembly, moved by convection. The oil is cooled by {{the outside of the}} tank in small ratings, and by an air-cooled radiator in larger ratings. Where a higher rating is required, or where the transformer is in a building or underground, oil pumps circulate the oil, and an oil-to-water heat exchanger may also be used. Some transformers may contain PCBs where or when its use was permitted. For example, until 1979 in South Africa. substitute fire-resistant liquids such as silicone oils are now used instead.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to ensure {{designing}} of full-function and stable CFD-simulation procedure for integrated thermal models of the transformers and the reactors, as well as to receive the approval of method of quality and abilities using the calculation examples of full-scale models of the equipment, along with autonomous models of coil-type windings having various design versions of heat-transfer intensification. Research Methods. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method of mathematical simulation of nonlinear processes as concerns hydrodynamics and heat transfer in the transformer equipment using finite-element analysis is employed. The results obtained. The paper presents the main elements of technique for creation of mathematical models; it also contains the examples of CFD-calculations as referred to axisymmetrical integrated models of furnace transformer and gapped-core shunt reactor, as well as the models of windings having design approaches of heat exchange intensification owing to «labyrinth» (partitions) and «alternation» (of number and locations) of axial cooling ducts. Scientific novelty. Scientific value of applied methodological approach {{lies in the fact that}} the developed models are the integrated ones, i. e., they consider geometry, loss, thermal parameters not only of the windings, but also of the main structural elements and cooling system. This ensures the quality and the accuracy of simulation of heat-and-mass transfer processes in complex structure of <b>oil</b> <b>ducts</b> and coils in the windings, enables to avoid erroneous «zigzag» oil flow movement through the groups of coil regular structures (without labyrinth and «alternation» of number and locations of axial ducts under conditions of transformer oil natural cooling as was deduced in the certain studies. Practical significance. Integrated models ensure calculation of oil temperature distribution within active part, including winding fields, oil temperature field between the tank and the windings, temperatures at oil outlet from the tank (top) and oil inlet into the tank (bottom). Calculations allow estimation of mean temperature distribution over the crosssection of winding coils, mean winding temperatures by means of averaging of the temperatures within the coils, detection of location and maximum temperature on the surface of conductors relevant to the most heated coil. The latter is treated as winding hot spot temperature (HST) and used to evaluate the aging of the contacting insulation. Determination of winding hot spot locations and temperatures (HST) is used as support data for installation areas of fiber optic probes for measurement during type testing, as well as in operational monitoring systems of the equipment. The results presented above are practically applied for industrial designing and testing of transformers and reactors...|$|R
40|$|In the Central West Europe (CWE) grid, Belgium {{is rather}} {{strongly}} interconnected with about 5500 MVA border crossing capacity on both its {{northern and southern}} borders. The short average distance between those borders (roughly 150 km) causes the Belgian grid to participate substantially in almost every north-south exchange in the CWE grid. Effective CWE markets, together with a huge wind generation capacity in the Baltic area, give rise to increased north-south exchanges. This results in mostly unforeseeable transits up to 2500 MW through the Belgian grid in both north-south and south-north directions. Historically, the Belgian grid has not been designed {{to cope with this}} kind of transits. Consequently, high transits might endanger the grid safety. To cope with this situation, the Belgian Transmission System Operator (TSO) decided to install Phase Shifting Transformers (PST’s) such that all international transiting power would pass through them without decreasing the actual border capacity. The northern border was chosen, and three PST’s were installed in series with the 400 kV border crossing lines. The combined action of the PST’s aims at reducing the power transits to safe levels. In the actual CWE grid, maximum phase shifting allows to reduce north-south transits by about 1250 MW in each direction. In addition to reducing massive north-south transits, these PST’s will further enhance overall grid safety, by redistributing a given transit along different paths in the Belgian grid. For this application, the PST is a combination of two three-phase transformers (a series and a regulation transformer) connected together by <b>oil</b> <b>ducts.</b> With a rating of 1400 MVA, their maximum angle displacement is ± 25 ° (in no-load conditions). The PST is of the symmetrical indirect design and has no voltage regulation. The main concern regarding the operational use is the volatility of the loop flows. The increase of the electricity trade and the high penetration of wind generation in Europe led to very important and frequent power flow changes both in direction and in amplitude. The Belgian TSO operates the three PST’s in order to stabilize these loop flows within a predetermined range. It will thus be possible to schedule a more stable outage plan and to better assess the power exchange capacities at the border for the different time horizons. Additionally, a phase shifting realized on two PST’s in opposite direction allows a better N- 1 congestion management within the Belgian system in real time with limited impact on the neighboring TSO’s. Specific coordination tests and procedures were set up with the TSO’s of the CWE area. With the availability of all three units since October 2008, System Engineers are unanimous concerning the key-role the PST’s have in the grid security and efficiency. Until now, the units are playing a major role for limiting the power flow through Belgium, to counter congestion problems in foreign grids and to resolve local congestions in the 400 kV and the 220 kV power grids by redirecting east-west power flows. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Coal, {{natural gas}} and petroleum-based liquid fuels are still {{the most widely used}} energy sources in modern society. The current {{scenario}} contrasts with the foreseen shortage of petroleum that was spread out {{in the beginning of the}} XXI century, when the concept of "energy security" emerged as an urgent agenda to ensure a good balance between energy supply and demand. Much beyond protecting refineries and <b>oil</b> <b>ducts</b> from terrorist attacks, these issues soon developed to a portfolio of measures related to process sustainability, involving at least three fundamental dimensions: (a) the need for technological breakthroughs to improve energy production worldwide; (b) the improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors of modern society; and (c) the increase of the social perception that education is a key-word towards a better use of our energy resources. Together with these technological, economic or social issues, "energy security" is also strongly influenced by environmental issues involving greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity in environmentally sensitive areas, pollution and poor solid waste management. For these and other reasons, the implementation of more sustainable practices in our currently available industrial facilities and the search for alternative energy sources that could partly replace the fossil fuels became a major priority throughout the world. Regarding fossil fuels, the main technological bottlenecks are related to the exploitation of less accessible petroleum resources such as those in the pre-salt layer, ranging from the proper characterization of these deep-water oil reservoirs, the development of lighter and more efficient equipment for both exploration and exploitation, the optimization of the drilling techniques, the achievement of further improvements in production yields and the establishment of specialized training programs for the technical staff. The production of natural gas from shale is also emerging in several countries but its production in large scale has several problems ranging from the unavoidable environmental impact of shale mining as well as to the bad consequences of its large scale exploitation in the past. The large scale use of coal has similar environmental problems, which are aggravated by difficulties in its proper characterization. Also, the mitigation of harmful gases and particulate matter that are released as a result of combustion is still depending on the development of new gas cleaning technologies including more efficient catalysts to improve its emission profile. On the other hand, biofuels are still struggling to fulfill their role in reducing our high dependence on fossil fuels. Fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) from vegetable oils and ethanol from cane sucrose and corn starch are mature technologies whose market share is partially limited by the availability of their raw materials. For this reason, there has been a great effort to develop "second-generation" technologies to produce methanol, ethanol, butanol, biodiesel, biogas (methane), bio-oils, syngas and synthetic fuels from lower grade renewable feedstocks such as lignocellulosic materials whose consumption would not interfere with the rather sensitive issues of food security. Advanced fermentation processes are envisaged as "third generation" technologies and these are primarily linked to the use of algae feedstocks as well as other organisms that could produce biofuels or simply provide microbial biomass for the processes listed above. Due to the complexity and cost of their production chain, "third generation" technologies usually aim at high value added biofuels such as biojet fuel, biohydrogen and hydrocarbons with a fuel performance similar to diesel or gasoline, situations in which the use of genetically modified organisms is usually required. In general, the main challenges in this field could be summarized as follows: (a) the need for prospecting alternative sources of biomass that are not linked to the food chain; (b) the intensive use of green chemistry principles in our current industrial activities; (c) the development of mature technologies for the production of second and third generation biofuels; (d) the development of safe bioprocesses that are based on environmentally benign microorganisms; (e) the scale-up of potential technologies to a suitable demonstration scale; and (f) the full understanding of the technological and environmental implications of the food vs. fuel debate. On the basis of these, the main objective of this article is to stimulate the discussion and help the decision making regarding "energy security" issues and their challenges for modern society, in such a way to encourage the participation of the Brazilian Chemistry community in the design of a road map for a safer, sustainable and prosper future for our nation...|$|R
