5|$|In {{the early}} days of Wyoming most of the land was in public domain, which was open to stock raising as an <b>open</b> <b>range</b> and farmlands for homesteading. Large numbers of cattle were turned loose on the <b>open</b> <b>range</b> by large ranches. Each spring, round-ups were held to {{separate}} the cattle belonging to different ranches. Before a roundup, an orphan or stray calf was sometimes surreptitiously branded, which was the common way to identify the cow's owners. Lands and water rights were usually distributed to whoever settled the property first, and farmers and ranchers had to respect these boundaries (the doctrine was known as Prior Appropriation). However, as more and more homesteaders moved into Wyoming, competition for land and water soon enveloped the state, and the cattle companies reacted by monopolizing large areas of the <b>open</b> <b>range</b> to prevent newcomers from using it. They also forbade their employees from owning cattle for fear of additional competition, and threatened anyone they suspected to be rustlers.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Johnson County War also {{marked the}} end of the <b>open</b> <b>range</b> in Wyoming. By 1893, the WSGA was opened to the other small ranchers and farmers, finally ending their {{monopoly}} and control over Wyoming business interests. Previous practices of the WSGA, such as vigilantism and confiscation of cattle were finally stopped. Many prominent leaders of the Association such as Frank Wolcott, Frank M. Canton and Tom Smith later left the area.|$|E

5|$|The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral was a 30-second shootout between lawmen {{and members}} of a loosely {{organized}} group of outlaws called the Cowboys that took place at about 3:00p.m. on Wednesday, October 26, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. It is generally regarded as the most famous shootout {{in the history of}} the American Wild West. The gunfight was the result of a long-simmering feud, with Cowboys Billy Claiborne, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury on one side and town Marshal Virgil Earp, Special Policeman Morgan Earp, Special Policeman Wyatt Earp, and temporary policeman Doc Holliday on the other side. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys, who objected to the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. Billy Clanton and both McLaury brothers were killed. Ike Clanton claimed that he was unarmed and ran from the fight, along with Billy Claiborne. Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday were wounded, but Wyatt Earp was unharmed. The shootout has come to represent a period of the American Old West when the frontier was virtually an <b>open</b> <b>range</b> for outlaws, largely unopposed by law enforcement officers who were spread thin over vast territories.|$|E

25|$|Barbed wire, an {{innovation}} of the 1880s, allowed cattle to {{be confined to}} designated areas to prevent overgrazing of the range. In Texas and surrounding areas, increased population required ranchers to fence off their individual lands. In the north, overgrazing stressed the <b>open</b> <b>range,</b> leading to insufficient winter forage for the cattle and starvation, particularly during the harsh winter of 1886–1887, when {{hundreds of thousands of}} cattle died across the Northwest, leading to collapse of the cattle industry. By the 1890s, barbed wire fencing was also standard in the northern plains, railroads had expanded to cover most of the nation, and meat packing plants were built closer to major ranching areas, making long cattle drives from Texas to the railheads in Kansas unnecessary. Hence, the age of the <b>open</b> <b>range</b> was gone and large cattle drives were over. Smaller cattle drives continued at least into the 1940s, as ranchers, prior {{to the development of the}} modern cattle truck, still needed to herd cattle to local railheads for transport to stockyards and packing plants. Meanwhile, ranches multiplied all over the developing West, keeping cowboy employment high, if still low-paid, but also somewhat more settled.|$|E
25|$|Large {{invertebrates}} include tarantulas (Aphonopelma genus) and Mormon crickets. Exotic species, including chukar, grey partridge, and Himalayan snowcock, {{have been}} successfully introduced to the Great Basin, although the latter has only thrived in the Ruby Mountains. Cheatgrass, an invasive species which was unintentionally introduced, forms a critical portion of their diets. Feral horses (mustangs) and wild burros are other highly reproductive, and ecosystem-controversial, alien species. Most of the Great Basin is <b>open</b> <b>range</b> and domestic cattle and sheep are widespread.|$|E
25|$|By the 1880s, the {{expansion}} of the cattle industry resulted in a need for additional <b>open</b> <b>range.</b> Thus many ranchers expanded into the northwest, where there were still large tracts of unsettled grassland. Texas cattle were herded north, into the Rocky Mountain west and the Dakotas. The cowboy adapted much of his gear to the colder conditions, and westward movement of the industry also led to intermingling of regional traditions from California to Texas, often with the cowboy taking the most useful elements of each.|$|E

50|$|Commerce was {{originally}} {{organized around the}} fur trade. Furs were carried by steamboat along the rivers to the settlements. Gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874 and attracted more settlers, setting off the last Sioux War. The population surge increased the demand for meat spurring expanded cattle ranching on the territory's vast <b>open</b> <b>ranges.</b> With {{the advent of the}} railroad agriculture intensified: wheat became the territory's main cash crop. Economic hardship hit the territory in the 1880s due to lower wheat prices and a drought.|$|R
50|$|Though {{women had}} played an {{important}} role in rodeo's formative years in the mid-to-late nineteenth century, competing and winning against their male counterparts, by the time of the GRA's formation women's role in rodeo had been reduced to beauty pageants, with prizes (instead of prize money) such as cigarette cases. These women were exceptionally competent riders and ropers, whose skills had been honed working the <b>open</b> <b>ranges</b> of the American west, and they found it demeaning to be pushed to the extreme edges of rodeo.|$|R
