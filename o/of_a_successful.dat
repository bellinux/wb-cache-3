An {{alliance with}} Donnchad could explain Echmarcach's success in seizing the kingship from Sitriuc. Although Donnchad and Sitriuc were maternal half-brothersas both descended from Gormlaith ingen Murchada (died 1030)Donnchad's hostility towards Sitriuc {{is demonstrated by}} the record <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> attack he led upon the Dubliners in 1026.|$|E

The Singapore Naval Base was handed over to the government of Singapore on 8 December 1968, and Sembawang Shipyard subsequently became the basis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> ship repair industry.

5|$|Leo Phokas {{released}} the Byzantine prisoners after {{providing them with}} provisions, and took the booty and Arab prisoners back to Constantinople, where he celebrated a triumph at the Hippodrome.

5|$|Newcastle United {{enjoyed a}} brief spell of FA Cup {{dominance}} in the 1950s, winning the trophy three times in five years, and in the 1960s, Tottenham Hotspur enjoyed a similar spell of success, with three wins in seven seasons.

Teams from the second tier of English football, at the time called the Second Division, experienced an unprecedented run of cup success between 1973 and 1980.

Serious offenders were jailed in Key West. By that time, Cooley owned a schooner and took trips not only to take prisoners but to trade coontie, sugarcane, and tropical fruit with Cape Florida, Indian Key, Key West and Havana.|$|E

5|$|Rocco Landesman, {{chairperson}} of the National Endowment for the Arts, has used Citygarden as an example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>successful</b> foundation-funded art venture. Landesman—a former resident of St. Louis—said that such projects can help urban areas economically, but they cannot be funded solely by the federal government, thus requiring assistance from both {{the private sector and}} foundations. Michael Van Valkenburgh, principal of a Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, said he was drawn to St. Louis partly because of Citygarden's design and success. Van Valkenburgh was selected in 2010 to renovate the grounds of the Gateway Arch.|$|E

The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.|$|E
