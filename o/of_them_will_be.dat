Each question {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both correct answers {{in order to get}} credit. After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously.

Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no winnings.|$|E
5|$|Seiken Densetsu 3 {{has similar}} {{gameplay}} to its predecessor, Secret of Mana. Like many other role-playing {{games of the}} 16-bit era, the game displays a top-down perspective, in which the three player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Control may be passed between each of the characters at any time; the companions not currently selected are controlled by artificial intelligence. The game may be played simultaneously by two players, {{as opposed to the}} three of Secret of Mana. There are six possible player characters. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses which three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> playable and which one they will start with; the other two playable characters will join the party when met. The remaining three characters act as non-playable characters (NPCs) when encountered.|$|E

25|$|Benny— Benny {{has been}} the most heavily altered from the {{original}} novel. Although he has an ape-like appearance, just as in the novel, his past as a homosexual scientist is entirely altered. In the game Benny was an overly demanding military officer who ends up killing members of his unit for failing to meet his expectations (with the game also implying that he might have cannibalized them). Benny's psycho-drama places him in stone-aged community where the villagers draw a lottery to decide which <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sacrificed to AM. Benny obsesses over food and eating— but is incapable of chewing anything he finds. AM had severely damaged Benny's brain, but restores it for the scenario so that he can think clearly again - then AM cripples Benny's body so he cannot act on any thoughts he has. Eventually Benny demonstrates the compassion he once lacked by saving a mutant child from the lottery, sacrificing himself in the child's stead.|$|E

25|$|SQL Server also {{provides}} the optimistic concurrency control mechanism, {{which is similar}} to the multiversion concurrency control used in other databases. The mechanism allows a new version of a row to be created whenever the row is updated, as opposed to overwriting the row, i.e., a row is additionally identified by the ID of the transaction that created the version of the row. Both the old as well as the new versions of the row are stored and maintained, though the old versions are moved out of the database into a system database identified as Tempdb. When a row {{is in the process of}} being updated, any other requests are not blocked (unlike locking) but are executed on the older version of the row. If the other request is an update statement, it will result in two different versions of the rows—both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> stored by the database, identified by their respective transaction IDs.|$|E

Among cargo brought to the space station, 2281 pounds were also in the mid-deck.|$|E
25|$|Serbia {{inherited}} about a {{third of}} the diplomatic facilities that belonged to the former Yugoslavia. After 2001 embassies in Chile, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Lebanon, Mongolia, North Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, Venezuela, Vietnam and Zimbabwe were closed due to financial or reciprocal reasons. In June 2008 the Government of Serbia made a decision to close consulates in Bari, Graz and Malmö, and later that year Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić announced a plan to open a consulate-general in Knin (Croatia) during the autumn and an embassy in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia).

In May 2009 it was announced that the embassy in Peru will be temporarily closed and that the consulate-general in Lyon will be closed while the embassy in Kenya was reopened. Due to the legal succession of the Yugoslav properties abroad, Serbia will have to hand over embassy buildings in Vienna, The Hague and Lisbon (to Croatia), Canberra (to the Republic of Macedonia), Ankara, Madrid, Oslo and Ottawa (to Bosnia and Herzegovina) as well as consulate buildings in Klagenfurt, Milan (to Slovenia), Toronto (to Croatia), Zurich and Athens (to the Republic of Macedonia). Serbia will hand over the embassy building in Rome to Slovenia in 2011. In November 2010, the Government of Serbia made a decision to open embassies in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Qatar and reopen embassies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana in 2011 and announced a plan to open embassies in Oman, Chile, Venezuela and Pakistan in the future. In March 2011, Serbia opened its embassy in Azerbaijan and Consulate-General in Herceg Novi. In June 2011, Serbia opened its embassy in Kazakhstan.|$|E
