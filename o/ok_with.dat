5|$|Aquaria was {{developed}} by Derek Yu and Alec Holowka {{over the course of}} two years, off of a concept that Holowka had thought of a year prior. Yu was the lead artist, and Holowka handled the programming and audio components. Both designers had previously worked in video games; Yu had made several freeware games, including I'm <b>O.K</b> <b>with</b> Holowka and others, while Holowka had worked for several video game start-ups, none of which had ever gotten a game published. Some additional work on the game, including some level design and scripting for some enemies, was done by Brandon McCartin. Holowka and Yu officially formed the studio Bit Blot to back the game a week before submitting it to the 2007 Independent Games Festival. The name of the studio is intended to represent a fusion of art and technology. Aquaria is the studio's only game. Both members of the team continue to make video games, but are not doing so as a partnership; Holowka went on to form a separate team called Infinite Ammo, and Yu went back to working on freeware games and various ports of Spelunky.|$|E
25|$|By mid-2011, the Indian cricket {{team was}} enjoying {{unprecedented}} success, winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup held at home, while also being the No. 1 Test team, {{which they had}} achieved in 2009. They proved to be undefeatable at home as always, but also enjoyed success away, especially beyond the subcontinent such as in South Africa in late 2010, where {{for the first time}} ever, the Indian cricket team did not lose a Test series there. The team, led by wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was widely praised by media and former cricketers, and Dhoni's captaincy was also considered by some experts {{to be one of the}} reasons for India's success. However, this success was turned upside down in their tour to England in 2011. It was widely expected that India would win the Test and ODI series there, by light of their recent success. However, their weaknesses in their bowling and batting were completely exposed by the Englishmen and they lost all the 4 Tests, losing their No. 1 Test status to England. Despite the debacle in England, it was widely expected that India would retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after the series in Australia, as the team's previous 2 tours Down Under were <b>ok</b> <b>with</b> achieving 2 test victories and that the Australian cricket team was now quite weak. Also the nucleus of the Indian side selected for the tour had a number of players who had a good record in Australia. India had most recently won a five-match ODI home series against England 5–0 in October and a three-Test home series against the West Indies 2–0 in November, further improving expectations.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{relative}} clinical success of orthokeratology contact lenses (OK) and distance single-vision spectacles (SV) in children {{in terms of}} incidences of adverse events and discontinuations over a 2 -year period. METHODS: Sixty-one subjects 6 to 12 years of age with myopia of - 0. 75 to - 4. 00 DS and astigmatism ≤ 1. 00 DC were prospectively allocated OK or SV correction. Subjects were followed at 6 -month intervals and advised {{to report to the}} clinic immediately should adverse events occur. Adverse events were categorized into serious, significant, and non-significant. Discontinuation was defined as cessation of lens wear {{for the remainder of the}} study. RESULTS: Thirty-one children were corrected <b>with</b> <b>OK</b> and 30 <b>with</b> SV. A higher incidence of adverse events was found <b>with</b> <b>OK</b> compared <b>with</b> SV (p < 0. 001). Nine OK subjects experienced 16 adverse events (7 significant and 9 non-significant). No adverse events were found in the SV group. Most adverse events were found between 6 and 12 months of lens wear, with 11 solely attributable to OK wear. Significantly more discontinuations were found with SV in comparison <b>with</b> <b>OK</b> (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively low incidence of adverse events and discontinuations <b>with</b> <b>OK</b> is conducive for the correction of myopia in children <b>with</b> <b>OK</b> contact lenses. 1. 895 JCR (2012) Q 2, 21 / 59 Ophthalmolog...|$|R

Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts.

500|$|In August 2016, Mappa Producer Masao Maruyama Said in an interview: [...] "For 4~5 years, I kept {{searching for}} a {{suitable}} director to complete Kon's work. Before his death, the storyboard and script, even part of the keyframe film was already completed. Then I thought, even if someone can mimic Kon's work, {{it would still be}} clear that it's only an imitation. For example, if Mamoru Hosoda took the director's position, the completed Dreaming Machine would still be a good piece of work. However, that would make it Hosoda's movie, not Kon's. Dreaming Machine should be Kon's movie, him and only him, not someone else's. That means we cannot and should not [...] "compromise" [...] only to finish it.

500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be <b>O.K.</b> <b>with</b> that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E
