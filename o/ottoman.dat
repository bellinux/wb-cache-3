5|$|Reinforcements from Romani, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Yorke, attacked the <b>Ottoman</b> {{force to the}} north of Katia, but were driven off. These five troops and a machine gun section of Gloucestershire Hussars moved out from Romani at 10:15 to intercept a column of 500 <b>Ottoman</b> soldiers retiring south-east from Dueidar. Shortly after leaving Romani, firing was heard from Katia, and from some high ground they could see the <b>Ottoman</b> artillery north of Er Rabah shelling the camp. When the Gloucestershire Hussars advanced towards the <b>Ottoman</b> artillery, it ceased fire, and fifteen minutes later was seen to withdraw some distance. The Gloucestershire Hussars pushed some <b>Ottoman</b> soldiers back to the high ground south of the Hod um Ugba, where <b>Ottoman</b> reinforcements stopped their advance. The strength of the <b>Ottoman</b> attacks made a gradual withdrawal necessary, but long halts were made to enable the wounded at Romani to retire also.|$|E
5|$|Strong <b>Ottoman</b> Army {{positions}} from Gaza to {{the foothills}} of the Judean Hills had successfully held out against British Empire forces for a week after the <b>Ottoman</b> army was defeated at Beersheba.

The Maniots were bottled up inside Mani and were forced to pay a tribute of 15,00 groshes to the <b>Ottomans.</b> The <b>Ottomans</b> also appointed a Maniot bey to govern the Maniots.

5|$|The Albanian {{revolt of}} 1432–36 {{was a series}} of {{conflicts}} between Albanian rebels and the <b>Ottoman</b> Empire during the early period of <b>Ottoman</b> rule in the region.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Seljuk Turks combined the elements and characteristics of the Turkic {{architecture of}} Central Asia with those of Persian, Arab, Armenian and Byzantine architecture. The transition from Seljuk architecture to <b>Ottoman</b> architecture is most visible in Bursa, which was {{the capital of the}} <b>Ottoman</b> State between 1335 and 1413. Following the <b>Ottoman</b> conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, <b>Ottoman</b> architecture was significantly influenced by Byzantine architecture. Topkapı Palace in Istanbul {{is one of the most}} famous examples of classical <b>Ottoman</b> architecture and was the primary residence of the <b>Ottoman</b> Sultans for approximately 400 years. Mimar Sinan (c.1489–1588) was the most important architect of the classical period in <b>Ottoman</b> architecture. He was the chief architect of at least 374 buildings which were constructed in various provinces of the <b>Ottoman</b> Empire in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|A Venetian confidant on Hvar reported, in 1498, the <b>Ottoman</b> {{preparation}} of 25 ships for sea attack on Krajina and Kačićs. In the next year, they became <b>Ottoman</b> subjects. In 1500, the Split monarch reported to Venice that Ottomans captured several delegates from Split, and that safely arrived in Mostar only thanks to knez Juraj Marković, an <b>Ottoman</b> subject and Venetian friend. Marković wrote from Makarska to Venice {{that he was}} knez for 15 years and always {{a friend of the}} Venetians. In the Marković collection and archive, D.

The Maniots refused and the <b>Ottomans</b> began the siege.

5|$|After decisive <b>Ottoman</b> {{victory at}} the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, and {{especially}} after the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Croats continued defending themselves against the <b>Ottoman</b> attacks. The <b>Ottoman</b> conquest {{during the early years}} of the 16th century prompted the formation of the Uskoks, which were led by Croatian captain Petar Kružić, also called (Prince of Klis). As a part of the Habsburg defensive system, Uskoks used the base at Klis as an important defensive position. They fought almost alone against the Ottomans, and for more than two decades defended the fortress against the <b>Ottoman</b> attacks.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police controlling the Sinai Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected.

Minor <b>Ottoman</b> and Bedouin forces operating across the Sinai continued to threaten the canal from March through the Gallipoli Campaign until June, when they practically ceased until the autumn. Meanwhile, the German and <b>Ottoman</b> Empires supported an uprising by the Senussi (a political-religious group) on the western frontier of Egypt which began in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{ordered the}} ship in 1911 as Rio de Janeiro from the British company Armstrong Whitworth. However, the {{collapse}} of Brazil's rubber boom and a warming in relations with Argentina, the country's chief rival, led to the ship's sale while under construction to the <b>Ottoman</b> Empire. The Ottomans renamed her Sultan Osman I, after the empire's founder, and the ship was nearly complete when World War I broke out. The British government seized her {{for use by the}} Royal Navy, together with another <b>Ottoman</b> dreadnought being constructed in Britain. This act caused resentment in the <b>Ottoman</b> Empire, as the payments for both ships were complete, and contributed to the decision of the <b>Ottoman</b> government to join the Central Powers.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1457, a large <b>Ottoman</b> {{army was}} seen {{approaching}} Albania. Skanderbeg {{sent a letter to}} Calixtus informing him of the <b>Ottoman</b> arrival and the dire need for military aid. The pope responded with a promise to send a fleet to Albania – even though the enemy was on land – but it did not arrive. Skanderbeg was thus left to fight the oncoming <b>Ottoman</b> army alone. Mehmed II had placed Isak Bey Evrenoz and Hamza Kastrioti in command of the force. Isak bey was an experienced commander who had crushed John Kastrioti's rebellion in 1430 and led the <b>Ottoman</b> counterattack at the Siege of Berat. Hamza brought along with him several disaffected Albanian nobles and personal knowledge of the tactics they could expect from Skanderbeg. In total, <b>Ottoman</b> forces numbered between 50,000 and 80,000 men. Armies of this size were usually commanded by the sultan himself so rumors spread that Mehmed was leading the campaign. In contrast, Skanderbeg had between 8,000 and 10,000 men to stand in opposition.|$|E

5|$|Cappello's {{performance}} in 1646 was distinctly lackluster: {{he failed to}} interdict the arrival of <b>Ottoman</b> reinforcements under Koca Musa Pasha in June (see below), and {{an attack on the}} <b>Ottoman</b> fleet at Chania Bay in August failed, as did his attempt to break the <b>Ottoman</b> blockade of Rettimo (Rethymno). As a result, the city fell on 20 October, while the citadel held out until 13 November. During the winter of 1646-1647, both sides suffered from an outbreak of plague, and throughout the spring of 1647, operations did not make much headway. In mid-June however, a small <b>Ottoman</b> force routed a larger body of Venetian mercenaries. This <b>Ottoman</b> success paved the way for Gazi Hüseyin Pasha, the local commander, to conquer the eastern half of the island, except for the fortress of Siteia. The Venetians and the local population suffered some grievous losses: it is estimated that by 1648, almost 40% of the Cretan population had perished of disease or warfare, and in 1677, the island's pre-war population of ca. 260,000 had dropped to about 80,000. By the beginning of 1648, all of Crete, except Candia and a few strongholds like the island of Gramvousa, was in <b>Ottoman</b> hands.|$|E
5|$|Despite this support, the {{economic}} {{resources of the}} <b>Ottoman</b> Empire were depleted by {{the cost of the}} Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the French, British and Germans had offered financial aid. A pro-German faction influenced by Enver Pasha, the former <b>Ottoman</b> military attaché in Berlin, opposed the pro-British majority in the <b>Ottoman</b> cabinet and tried to secure closer relations with Germany. In December 1913, the Germans sent a military mission to Constantinople, headed by General Otto Liman von Sanders. The geographical position of the <b>Ottoman</b> Empire meant that Russia and her allies France and Britain had a significant interest in Turkish neutrality in the event of war in Europe.|$|E
