40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} role of RSS in {{providing}} a so-lution {{to the problem of}} medical information <b>overload,</b> <b>speeding</b> up the dissemination of information and improving communications between all those with an interest in health. It compares the exchange and use of medical information on the Internet before and after the use of RSS and also shares a vision for the future, using MedWorm, a medical search engine and RSS newsfeed provider, as an example. The conclusion high-lights how RSS has opened a new dimension of information exchange which has the potential to enable giant steps forward in the field of medicine. To realise its full potential, both publishers and users of medi-cal information need to recognise the importance of RSS, ensure thought-ful implementation of RSS feeds to announce publication, and provide for education regarding its everyday use. ...|$|R

2500|$|A magnetic-hydraulic {{circuit breaker}} uses a solenoid coil to provide {{operating}} force {{to open the}} contacts. Magnetic-hydraulic [...] breakers incorporate a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an <b>overload,</b> the <b>speed</b> of the solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond normal running current for motor starting, energizing equipment, etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature.

For instance, D’Avanzo and Kuflik (2013) show {{that more than}} 80 % of buyers, while shopping online, expect user’s or professional reviews services, implemented on the seller’s website, that can be consulted before their purchase could take place. However, the diffusion of information, that buyers deal with during their shopping experience, makes room to the information and cognitive overload an out-and-out curse. All that is causing sellers adding Web decision support services to help buyers with their decision-making processes {{and there is a}} growing number of studies focusing on the enhancing of buyers online shopping decisions with the aim to improve their subjective attitudes towards shopping decisions. More and more sellers add on their side web decision support services that implement decision strategies employed by individuals to arrive at decisions and purchases.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of {{heavy vehicle traffic}} on the road network {{plays a key role}} for transport policy and road operators to : - increase the mobility by adapting the policies, - improve road safety, - reduce unfair competition between transport modes and companies, - optimise infrastructure lifetime, and thus to ensure weights and dimensions compliance and to enforce the traffic regulations. Since 2008, 29 WIM systems were installed for the French Ministry of Transport on the main road network, i. e. highways and motorways. They continuously screen <b>overloaded</b> and <b>speeding</b> vehicles and allow to target the controls on presumed violators. The check efficiency was increased by a factor 3, and the accuracy of the WIM systems now allows envisioning the future development of an automated overload control (AOC) system. These systems also allow profiling companies which are frequently infringing the driving law and to target the checks in companies. Detailed heavy traffic data are gathered on a large scale, both as classified flows (statistics), and individual data per vehicle. These data are stored in a National database, and used for statistics, for infrastructure design and management, and for traffic monitoring.

50|$|The {{simplest}} case is {{a switch}} to connect a motor to a power source, such as in small appliances or power tools. The switch may be manually operated or may be a relay or contactor connected {{to some form of}} sensor to automatically start and stop the motor. The switch may have several positions to select different connections of the motor. This may allow reduced-voltage starting of the motor, reversing control or selection of multiple <b>speeds.</b> <b>Overload</b> and over current protection may be omitted in very small motor controllers, which rely on the supplying circuit to have over current protection. Small motors may have built-in overload devices to automatically open the circuit on overload. Larger motors have a protective overload relay or temperature sensing relay included in the controller and fuses or circuit breakers for over current protection. An automatic motor controller may also include limit switches or other devices to protect the driven machinery.|$|R

40|$|Low-thrust {{propulsion}} {{is becoming}} more popular for space missions because of its efficient propellant usage. However the optimization of the resulting trajectories remains a very challenging task, especially to obtain precise optimal solutions. In this paper, we study the Stark model, an exact, closed-form formulation to parameterize the low-thrust problem by subdividing the trajectory into two-body segments subjected to Newtonian gravitation plus an additional uniform force of constant magnitude and direction. Compared to existing analytic methods, this model can take into account more accurately the effect of thrusting and the full dynamics of the problem, {{at the expense of}} a slight <b>speed</b> <b>overload.</b> First, all the general types of solutions, expressed in terms of elliptic integrals, are described in details. Then a state-of-the-art opti-mization solver specially tailored to exploit the structure of the problem is used to take advantage of those closed-form solutions. Preliminary numerical results are presented and compared to existing algorithms to illustrate the performance and the accuracy of our approach. It is believed that our method can, in most cases, eliminate the necessity to numerically propagate equations of motion even in perturbed environments. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The main aim of {{this project}} is to detect faults of three phase IM and control the faults. This project deals with speed control of Induction Motor. The three phase {{induction}} motor may experience many incipient faults due to various reasons. So the protection of these motors from such faults is very important. The various faults are over-voltage/current, under-voltage/current, <b>overload,</b> single phasing, <b>speed</b> variation, over-temperature etc. The most important parameters are voltage, current, speed and temperature. The voltage, current and speed can be controlled using three phase PWM inverter. The frequency and duty cycle of the PWM is controllable and by controlling them we can control the output voltage, frequency and current of inverter. If the voltage of the motor {{is less than the}} rated voltage then the duty cycle of PWM is increased, if the voltage is more than rated then the duty cycle is reduced. The frequency of PWM is kept constant since the speed of motor depends on the supply voltage frequency. Here we keep the v/f ratio constant for speed control. The heart of this project is microcontroller PIC 18 f 4431...|$|R
30|$|However, {{another line}} of {{research}} indicates that HPWS raises conflicting outcomes for employees and their employers (e.g., Ehrnrooth and Björkman 2012; Jensen, Patel and Messersmith, 2013; Wood et al., 2012). According to Ostroff and Bowen (2016), human resource practices serve as a signaling system that sends messages to employees about what is valued and what are appropriate behaviors. By investing in employees and offering autonomy and flexibility at work, HPWS communicates an organization’s expectations for extra effort from its employees (Shaw et al. 2009). Thus, under the practice of HPWS, employees may be faced with work <b>overload,</b> high working <b>speeds,</b> and tight deadlines and {{feel that they are}} forced to intensify their work in order to comply with the organization’s interest (Balducci, Schaufeli, and Fraccaroli 2011; Boxall and Macky 2016; Macky and Boxall 2008). For example, certain HPWS practices such as performance appraisal and performance-contingent pay reflect employers’ expectations for higher levels of performance and productivity (Pohler and Schmidt 2015). Through these practices, employers place greater demands and responsibility on employees (Shaw et al., 2009). Employees thus experience increased stress and decreased control over the pace and amount of work (Anthony et al. 2013). In this light, HPWS contributes to organizational competitive advantages at the cost of employees’ well-being in the way of increased emotional exhaustion and enhanced job anxiety (e.g., Jensen et al. 2013; Kroon, van de Voorde, and van Veldhoven 2009; Macky and Boxall 2008; van de Voorde and Beijer 2015). Indeed, Godard (2004) criticizes studies stressing the contribution of HPWS as not only overestimating HPWS’ positive effects but also underestimating potential costs.|$|R
40|$|LectureThis paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the large scale testing {{of the first two}} stages, including incoming sidestream flow of a LNG propane compressor. The large scale test was performed at 90 % scale of the production propane compressor. The four section propane compressor contains five stages and three incoming sidestreams. The last four stages are of the same impeller family. Therefore, only the first two stages were tested. This paper will describe the complete process from initial selection and design to the scaled testing. Performance requirements for this compressor were tighter than standard API- 617 guarantees. The limitations required for the test were + 2 % for power, - 1 % for speed and + 3 % for head at design flow, ? 2 % for sidestream pressures and - 2 % for surge/stall and overload/choke margins. The design process of the stationaries (IGV, diffuser and return channel vanes) and the sidestream plenum and mixing section will be described. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analyses were used to size the plenum and mixing section in order to reduce losses and ensure a uniform flow distribution for the subsequent stage. Internal stage performance (IGV, impeller, diffuser, and return channel) predictions were also generated using CFD analysis tools. A newly developed tool (presented at 2012 Texas A&M Turbomachinery Symposium) was used to predict the sectional performance and flange pressures. Due to the tighter performance limitations, the impellers were single piece fabricated and an advanced laser 3 D scanning method was used to ensure components met specified manufacturing tolerances. This paper will describe the test rig, instrumentation and test procedures employed. The test was completed for two full (<b>overload</b> to surge) <b>speed</b> lines at the design flow ratio. Test results will be compared against the CFD predictions for stage and sectional performance. Conclusions and recommendations will be presented, including ASME PTC 10 guidelines suggested changes...|$|R
40|$|Context-aware {{computing}} {{is currently}} {{considered the most}} promising approach to overcome information <b>overload</b> and to <b>speed</b> up access to relevant information and services. Context-awareness may be derived from many sources, including user profile and preferences, network information, sensor analysis; usually context-awareness relies {{on the ability of}} computing devices to interact with the physical world, i. e. with the natural and artificial objects hosted within the "environment”. Ideally, context-aware applications should not be intrusive and should be able to react according to user’s context, with minimum user effort. Context is an application dependent multidimensional space and the location {{is an important part of}} it since the very beginning. Location can be used to guide applications, in providing information or functions that are most appropriate for a specific position. Hence location systems play a crucial role. There are several technologies and systems for computing location to a vary degree of accuracy and tailored for specific space model, i. e. indoors or outdoors, structured spaces or unstructured spaces. The research challenge faced by this thesis is related to pedestrian positioning in heterogeneous environments. Particularly, the focus will be on pedestrian identification, localization, orientation and activity recognition. This research was mainly carried out within the “mobile and ambient systems” workgroup of EPOCH, a 6 FP NoE on the application of ICT to Cultural Heritage. Therefore applications in Cultural Heritage sites were the main target of the context-aware services discussed. Cultural Heritage sites are considered significant test-beds in Context-aware computing for many reasons. For example building a smart environment in museums or in protected sites is a challenging task, because localization and tracking are usually based on technologies that are difficult to hide or harmonize within the environment. Therefore it is expected that the experience made with this research may be useful also in domains other than Cultural Heritage. This work presents three different approaches to the pedestrian identification, positioning and tracking: Pedestrian navigation by means of a wearable inertial sensing platform assisted by the vision based tracking system for initial settings an real-time calibration; Pedestrian navigation by means of a wearable inertial sensing platform augmented with GPS measurements; Pedestrian identification and tracking, combining the vision based tracking system with WiFi localization. The proposed localization systems have been mainly used to enhance Cultural Heritage applications in providing information and services depending on the user’s actual context, in particular depending on the user’s location...|$|R
