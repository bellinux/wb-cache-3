5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose job was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson on the other end of the telegraph cable. This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day <b>of</b> <b>messages.</b>|$|E
3000|$|... [*]The {{overhead}} <b>of</b> <b>message</b> delivered - The {{number of}} the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> reflects the network resource consumption <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> in the transfer process. Firstly, the copy <b>of</b> <b>message</b> needs {{to take up the}} corresponding cache space to consume the storage resource. Secondly, the message needs energy when transferred to consume energy resource. Lastly, the message takes up the corresponding communication channel when transferred to consume the network bandwidth. So, the number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> can reflect the network resource overhead. The cost cannot be estimated directly, but it is usually related to the {{number of the}} copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network. If there are more copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network, the link cost will be higher. Conversely, the link cost is lower. So, the number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> can reflect the link cost <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> in the transfer process.|$|R
30|$|In the {{injection}} {{stage of the}} copies <b>of</b> <b>message,</b> it can have choice of injection according {{to the level of}} the credibility of the node itself. It can improve the later spread speed of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> by choosing the nodes whose willing forwarding domain has a higher credibility to inject. If the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> are injected to the nodes which have lower credibility, in the later injection stage, the nodes cannot meet with the nodes injected for a long time to make the injected delay of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> large. The worst case is that the node injects the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> to the node with credibility value 0 to result in the copy <b>of</b> <b>message</b> turning into invalid. This is because the copied message cannot be injected out through the node.To improve the injected efficiency of the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network, we set up an injection threshold R 0 to make the node with copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> inject according to the threshold value. Thus, it only injects the corresponding copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> to the nodes whose credibility exceed the threshold value R 0 in its willing forwarding domain.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, if the node vi {{carrying}} message m {{does not}} encounter the destination node <b>of</b> <b>message</b> m currently {{and the current}} required delivery probability Pm≤ 0, node vi still carries message m until it meets the destination <b>of</b> <b>message</b> m. Note that, once the required delivery probability Pm≤ 0 for a replica <b>of</b> <b>message</b> m, the replica <b>of</b> <b>message</b> m cannot be forwarded to other nodes except its destination node.|$|R

5|$|The {{resistance}} was alerted {{to carry out}} these tasks by messages personnels transmitted by the BBC's French service from London. Several hundred of these messages, which might be snatches of poetry, quotations from literature, or random sentences, were regularly transmitted, masking the few that were actually significant. In the weeks preceding the landings, lists <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of the barrage of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.|$|E
5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E

Fearing to lose their label's highest seller and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song. Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon {{found out that the}} song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which meant the song failed to chart on the official US chart, and made international charting extremely difficult and unlikely.|$|E

30|$|From Figure  9, {{the number}} of copies of all {{algorithms}} is increasing {{with the passage of}} time, but for Epidemic algorithm, its copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> spread the fastest, presenting exponential growth. For Spray and Wait algorithm and Spray and Focus algorithm, they have the limit for the maximum number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> in the network. With the number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> growing to a certain stage, the value will be a constant. For DTSNS routing protocol, its number <b>of</b> copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> is controlled by the delay constraints to self adapt to have the smallest number of copies. More copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> consume more network resource seriously. This is because the copies <b>of</b> <b>message</b> take up the node cache and need a large amount of energy and network bandwidth at the forwarding process. For DTSN which has limited network resource, the overhead is unbearable. So, though Epidemic algorithm has good performance, it is rarely used in practical application.|$|R

5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} the sentiment <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> on social media and its virality, defined as the volume and speed <b>of</b> <b>message</b> diffusion. We analyze 4. 1 million messages (tweets) obtained from Twitter. Although factors affecting message diffusion on social media have been studied previously, we focus on message sentiment and reveal how the polarity <b>of</b> <b>message</b> sentiment affects its virality. The virality <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> is characterized by the number <b>of</b> <b>message</b> repostings (retweets) and the time elapsed from the original posting <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> to its Nth reposting (N-retweet time). Through extensive analysis using the 4. 1 million tweets and their retweets in 1 week, we discover that negative messages are likely to be reposted more rapidly and frequently than positive and neutral messages. Specifically, the reposting volume <b>of</b> negative <b>messages</b> is 20 – 60 % higher than that of positive and neutral messages, and negative messages spread 25 % faster than positive and neutral messages when the diffusion volume is quite high. We also perform longitudinal analysis <b>of</b> <b>message</b> diffusion observed over 1 year and find that recurrent diffusion <b>of</b> negative <b>messages</b> is less frequent than that of positive and neutral messages. Moreover, we present a simple message diffusion model that can reproduce the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>message</b> diffusion observed in this paper...|$|R

5|$|Meermins crew, now led by Krause's {{assistant}} Olof Leij, {{managed to}} communicate with the militia on shore by means <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> in bottles, and persuaded them to light the signal fires for which the Malagasy still on board were waiting. On seeing the fires, the Malagasy cut the ship's anchor cable and allowed the ship to drift towards the shore, after which she ran aground on an offshore sandbank. The Malagasy could then see the militia on the shore preparing to come to the ship's assistance, and realised that their situation was hopeless; they surrendered and were once again shackled. Captain Muller, ship's mate Daniel Carel Gulik and Krause's assistant Olof Leij were tried in the Dutch East India Company's Council of Justice; all three were fired from the Company, while Muller and Gulik were also stripped of their rank and wages. The slaves were not tried, but the two surviving leaders of the mutiny, named in Dutch East India Company records as Massavana and Koesaaij, were sent to Robben Island for observation, where Massavana died three years later; Koesaaij survived there for another 20years. In 2004 an ongoing search was begun for Meermins remains.|$|E
5|$|The French West Indian colonies {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars were almost {{completely}} {{cut off from}} France due to the British naval strategy of close blockade: squadrons of British Royal Navy warships patrolled the coasts of both France itself and the West Indian islands under French control. This hindered communications, severely restricted trade and prevented the reinforcement of the French garrisons during the conflict. As a result, the colonies began to suffer food shortages, their economies stagnated and public and military morale began to severely erode. In desperation, the commanders of the main colonies, the Leeward Islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, sent a series <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> to France {{during the summer of}} 1808, entreating the French government to send food and military supplies. The French responded with a series of frigates and smaller vessels, sailing to the Caribbean independently or in small squadrons. Some of these ships reached their destinations, but the majority were captured by the Royal Navy blockades off France or the islands. Those few ships that did safely make port were trapped there, unable to make the return journey without risking defeat by the British ships waiting offshore.|$|E
