40|$|Background/Objective: Normal {{values for}} <b>CT</b> <b>orbital</b> measurements, which appear in refer-ence books, {{may not be}} {{applicable}} to the Iranian population. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine normal values in an Iranian population and compare them with published standards. Patients and Methods: <b>Orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> from adults were studied from March 2003 to June 2005. The scans had been ordered for complaints unrelated to craniofacial and orbital abnormalities, and in all of them, the presence of any pathology of the bones, globe and orbit were excluded. Four hundred <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (134 females, 266 males, mean age 36. 9 ± 16. 7 years) were studied. Results: The normal interorbital distance at the posterior border of the frontal process of the maxilla measured from 1. 8 to 3. 5 cm (mean 2. 30) in men and 1. 5 to 3. 2 cm (mean 2. 17) in women (p< 0. 01). At the level of orbital equator, the mean interorbital distance was 2. 46 cm in women (range 1. 7 - 3. 2) and 2. 65 cm in men (range 2 - 3. 4) (p< 0. 01). Compared with the cor-responding values of interorbital standards, all these measurements were smaller. Conclusion: Normal values of orbital measurements are smaller and more varied in Iranian population and these values must be used when interpreting <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> of the orbit...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: There is no {{consensus}} as how to calculate orbital soft tissue volume based on <b>CT</b> or MRI <b>scans.</b> The authors sought to validate their technique and to assess the intraobserver and interobserver variability of their calculations of bony orbital volume (OV), orbital fat volume (FV), and extraocular muscle volume (MV) on <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> of humans. METHODS: The authors calculated these volumes {{with the use of}} a manual segmentation technique on <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> with commercially available software. Two observers (one of them masked) calculated the orbital soft tissue volumes in a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> of a phantom constructed of dry skull, butter, and chicken muscle. These calculations were compared with previously taken standard volume measurements of these materials. Repetitive calculations on one <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> by the same observer were compared. Soft tissue volumes taken from 10 <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were calculated by two observers and compared. From the data acquired, intraobserver and interobserver variability was calculated. RESULTS: Outcomes of these calculations using this software approximated the volumes of the phantom measured with standardized techniques. Accuracy of the phantom calculations between the two observers varied from + 0. 7 % to - 0. 7 % for FV and between - 1. 5 % and - 2. 2 % for MV. Mean differences between the repeated calculations were smaller than 5 %. The intraclass correlation coefficient varied from 0. 961 to 0. 999.

40|$|Aim. This {{retrospective}} study aimed at investigating indications, surgical approaches, and {{the materials used}} for orbital floor reconstructions, {{as well as the}} clinical followup, particularly with regard to postoperative complications. Methods. This study comprised 120 patients who underwent surgery for orbital floor fractures between 2001 and 2011. Diagnosis and treatment were based on both physical examination and <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Patients were retrospectively analyzed for data, such as mechanism of injury, classification of fracture, and complications. Results. The most common cause of injury was physical assault followed by traffic accidents. Surgery was performed with a mean delay of 5 days after the incident. Subciliary lower eyelid incision was the most common surgical approach to the orbital floor, followed by mid lower eyelid incision and transconjunctival lower-eyelid approach. For orbital floor reconstruction, collagenous membrane derived from bovine pericardium (65 %) is mainly used, followed by titanium mesh (35 %); 18. 0 % of patients showed postoperative complications: 10. 0 % presented transient hypesthesia, 4. 2 % transient diplopia, 2. 0 % enophthalmos, 1 % visible scar and 0. 8 % from scleral show.

40|$|Preseptal and orbital {{cellulitis}} occur {{more commonly}} in children than adults. The history and physical examination are crucial in distinguishing between preseptal and orbital cellulitis. The orbital septum delineates the anterior eyelid soft tissues from the orbital soft tissue. Infections anterior to the orbital septum {{are classified as}} preseptal cellulitis and those posterior to the orbital septum are termed orbital cellulitis. "nRecognition of orbital involvement is important {{not only because of}} the threatened vision loss associated with orbital cellulitis but also because of the potential for central nervous system complications including cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, and death. "nOrbital imaging should be obtained in all patients suspected of having <b>orbital</b> cellulitis. <b>CT</b> is preferred to MR imaging, as the orbital tissues have high con-trast and the bone can be well visualized. <b>Orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> allows localization of the disease process to the preseptal area, the extraconal or intraconal fat, or the subperiosteal space. Axial CT views allow evaluation of the medial orbit and ethmoid sinuses, whereas coronal scans image the orbital roof and floor and the frontal and maxillary sinuses. If direct coronal imaging is not possible, reconstruction of thin axial cuts may help the assessment of the orbital roof and floor. Potential sources of orbital cellulitis such as sinusitis, dental infection, and facial cellulitis are often detectable on CT imaging.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} extraocular muscle (EOM) volume and cross-sectional area using computed tomography (CT), and to determine the relationship between EOM size and the vertical angle of deviation in thyroid eye disease (TED). Twenty-nine TED patients (58 orbits) with vertical strabismus were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent complete ophthalmic examination including prism, alternate cover, and Krimsky tests. <b>Orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were also performed on each patient. Digital image analysis was used to quantify superior rectus (SR) and inferior rectus (IR) muscle cross-sectional areas and volumes. Measurements were compared with those of controls. The correlation between muscle size and degree of vertical angle deviation was evaluated. The mean vertical angle of deviation was 26. 2 ± 4. 1 prism diopters. The TED group had a greater maximum cross-sectional area and EOM volume in the SR and IR than the control group (all p< 0. 001). Area and volume of the IR were correlated with the angle of deviation, but the SR alone did not show a significant correlation. The maximum cross-sectional area and volume of [Right IR + Left SR - Right SR - Left IR] was strongly correlated with the vertical angle of deviation (P< 0. 001). Quantitative CT of the orbit with evaluation of the area and volume of EOMs may be helpful in anticipating and monitoring vertical strabismus in TED patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionConnective tissue bands {{connect the}} {{horizontal}} rectus muscles {{at the level}} of the posterior pole to the orbital wall. These bands, referred to as pulley bands or faisseaux tendineux, purportedly act like springs to keep the rectus muscle bellies in place during eye movement out of the plane of the muscle. We examined the mechanical properties of these bands in human specimens obtained during surgery. In addition, we examined eye motility and stability of rectus muscles in a patient who had no functional pulley bands. MethodsExenterations were carried out on two patients with sebaceous gland carcinoma. Pulley bands were identified and force-elongation behavior was examined with a forceps and a force gauge. Stability of rectus muscles was examined in a patient with severe Crouzon’s syndrome by <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and during surgery under local, eye drop, anesthesia. ResultsThe pulley bands showed leash-like mechanical behavior: they were slack over approximately 10 mm and became taut when stretched further. In the patient with Crouzon’s syndrome, both CT and observation of the muscle during surgery showed little sideways displacement of the muscle bellies in eye movement out of the plane of the muscle, despite the lack of functional pulley bands. DiscussionThe leash-like mechanical behavior of the pulley bands seems unsuited for stabilization of the muscle bellies. The patient with Crouzon’s syndrome had relatively good eye motility and stable rectus muscle paths despite the lack of functional pulley bands...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} studies, the authors {{report on the}} {{treatment}} of nine Graves' disease patients with severe ophthalmopathy by use of intensive plasma exchange followed by immunosuppression (during three to six months). Results of treatment were evaluated by comparing the ophthalmopathy index and the <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> performed before and after plasmapheresis. Favorable results were obtained in eight out of nine patients, i. e. in all patients who exhibited evolutivity of their ocular signs and symptoms. The best positive effects of plasmapheresis were observed for soft tissue involvement, proptosis, tonometry, and visual acuity. Furthermore, {{a significant reduction in}} the size and density of enlarged extraocular muscles was also found. Six months after withdrawal of immunosuppression, three patients presented a moderate recurrence of ophthalmopathy and were treated successfully by a second course of plasmapheresis, followed by a short immunosuppression. In conclusion, the use of intensive plasma exchange associated with immunosuppression is an effective approach to the treatment of severe Graves' ophthalmopathy. It yields rapid and dramatic improvements that are maintained in most patients after withdrawal of immunosuppression.

40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} the accuracy and practicability of three-dimensionally preformed Arbeitsgemeinschaft Osteosynthese AO titanium mesh plates for orbital fractures. METHODS:Forty-seven patients with isolated blow-out orbital fractures {{were included in}} this study. Fracture locations were as follows: floor/medial wall(n = 26, 55 %), medial wall(n = 12, 26 %), and floor(n = 9, 19 %). The floor fractures were exposed by a standard transconjunctival approach, whereas a combined transcaruncular transconjunctival approach was used in patients with medial wall fractures with temporary dissection of inferior oblique muscle. A three-dimensionally preformed AO titanium mesh plate was selected according {{to the size of}} the defect previously measured on the preoperative computed tomographic scan examination and fixed at the inferior orbital rim with 2 screws. The accuracy of plate positioning of the reconstructed orbit was assessed on the postoperative computed tomography(CT) scan. The practicability of clinical use of AO three-dimensionally preformed titanium mesh plates was assessed on the preoperative and postoperative clinical data. RESULTS: Postoperative <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> showed an anatomic three-dimensional placement of the orbital mesh plates in all of the patients.

40|$|The authors {{report a}} case of Pager's disease of bone and ocular neuromyotonia (ONM) in a 72 -year-old woman. As far as we are aware, this {{association}} has never been previously described. The patient had an acquired left third cranial nerve palsy with oculomotor synkinesis and a left sixth cranial nerve palsy, Subjectively, she complained of recurring episodes of transient horizontal and vertical diplopia, lasting for about 30 - 40 sec and accompanied with discomfort in the left eye (LE), During those episodes, which occurred spontaneously or after sustained eccentric gaze, the LE became more esotropic with increasing restriction of abduction or hypotropic with increasing restriction of elevation. Electromyography (EMG) of the left medial rectus detected repetitive bursts of motor unit potentials with aspect of 'multiplets'. The oculomotor findings and the neurophysiological data evoked the diagnosis of ocular neuromyotonia which was subsequently confirmed by the effective response to carbamazepine.

40|$|Introduction. The {{presence}} of bilateral exophthalmos and palpebral, periorbital edema associated with hyperthyroidism {{is most often}} considered as an initial sign of Graves’ ophthalmopathy. However, in up to 20 % of cases, Graves’ ophthalmopathy might precede the occurrence of hyperthyroidism, which {{is very important to}} be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially if it is stated as unilateral. Among other less common causes of non-thyroid-related orbitopathy, orbital lymphoma represents rare conditions. We presented of a patient with Graves’ disease, initially manifested as bilateral orbitopathy and progressive unilateral exophthalmos caused by the marginal zone B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the orbit. Case report. A 64 -yearold man with the 3 -year history of bilateral Graves’ orbitopathy and hyperthyroidism underwent the left orbital decompression surgery due to the predominantly left, unilateral worsening of exophthalmos resistant to the previously applied glucocorticoid therapy. A year after the surgical treatment, a substantial exophthalmos of the left eye was again observed, signifying that other non-thyroid pathology could be involved. Orbital ultrasound was suggestive of primary orbital lymphoma, what was confirmed by <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and the biopsy of the tumor tissue. Detailed examinations indicated that the marginal zone B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma extended to IV - B-b CS, IPI 3 (bone marrow infiltration: m+ orbit+).

Methods: A prospective study was conducted in 15 patients with indirect traumatic optic neuropathy. All patients underwent a thorough ophthalmic examination. Initial visual acuity, final visual acuity, and relative afferent pupillary defect were determined, and visual acuity was converted into logMAR units. We performed flash VEP and an orbital computed tomography scan in all patients. Results: There was a good correlation between relative afferent pupillary defect and final visual acuity (r = &minus; 0. 83), and better initial visual acuity could predict better final visual acuity (r = 0. 92). According to findings from flash VEP parameters, there was a relationship between final visual acuity and amplitude ratio of the wave (r = 0. 59) and latency ratio of the wave (r = &minus; 0. 61). Neither primary visual acuity nor final visual acuity was related to the presence of orbital fractures in the <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Conclusion: Patients with traumatic optic neuropathy often present with severe vision loss.

40|$|Purpose: We {{report a}} rare case of {{traumatic}} {{injury to the}} eye caused by homemade fireworks in a Chinese juvenile patient with a metal ring left in the orbit after having been sutured at the Emergency Department. Methods: An 11 -year-old boy presented with a traumatic injury to the right eye from homemade fireworks. Following initial assessment involving maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) and suturing at the Emergency Department, he was transferred to our department for further evaluation because of his poor sight 1 day later. On examination, a skin laceration beneath the right eyebrow was noted, but the superior orbit was not fully visible on the maxillofacial CT performed 1 day previously. Therefore, an <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was carried out on the second day, which showed a hyperdense ring embedded in the superior border of the orbital wall; the ring was surgically removed. On postoperative day 7, a fundus examination revealed resolving vitreous hemorrhage, blunt traumatic retinal detachment, and a large retinal tear superior to the macula. The patient refused to take surgery for retinal detachment into consideration. Therefore, we opted for oral steroids and careful observation. Results: After 2 months' observation, the large retinal tear had healed and white fibrous scar tissue had developed, and the retinal detachment superior to the macula had reattached itself spontaneously. The patient's vision had further improved to 20 / 200. During 1 year of follow-up, he remained clinically stable. Conclusion: To avoid missing the diagnosis, a complete history of the mechanism of injury and accurate imaging still prove most useful. Complete removal of the foreign body by the emergency physician is necessary because of the ocular toxicity of an iron-containing foreign body. As evidenced by the current case, oral steroids and observation {{for a period of}} several months is a management of choice for traumatic retinal detachment and retinal tear superior to the macula associated with homemade fireworks in children...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE To {{study the}} {{suitability}} of an endoscopic transcaruncular approach (ETA) for repair of large medial orbital wall fractures (MOWFs) near the orbital apex. DESIGN A retrospective, noncomparative case series with description of the surgical technique. PARTICIPANTS Ninety-three consecutive patients (93 orbits) with large isolated MOWFs near the orbital apex. METHODS The isolated MOWFs were determined by computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> of the orbit in all patients. All patients underwent fracture repair by an ETA, and the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the defects were measured during surgery. Porous polyethylene sheets (1. 0 mm thick) were used to repair the bony defects. Patients were followed for 6 to 15 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Size of vertical and horizontal fracture defects, rate of complete repair of the fracture defects, correction of enophthalmos, resolution of diplopia, and complications 6 months after surgery. RESULTS All surgeries were completed uneventfully. The mean postoperative follow-up time was 9. 7 ± 3. 0 months. Under direct endoscopic visualization, all entrapped and herniated orbital contents were released and reposited, the entire boundary of the fractures were exposed adequately, and the implants were placed to overlie all edges of the fracture stably in all cases. The vertical and horizontal fracture defects measured during surgeries ranged from 16 to 30 mm and from 25 to 34 mm, respectively. Six months after surgery, complete reconstruction of the bony defects was demonstrated by <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> and symmetry of the both eyes was acquired in 92 of 93 patients (98. 9 %). Of 30 patients with significant preoperative enophthalmos of more than 2 mm, 29 (96. 7 %) were corrected, with a mean improvement of 3. 37 ± 0. 77 mm. Diplopia within the 30 ° visual field of the gaze was resolved in 40 of 43 patients (93. 0 %). Three patients (7. 0 %) had residual diplopia on medial gaze because of presumed paralysis of the medial rectus muscle. Intraorbital hemorrhage occurred in 1 patient the day after surgery and resolved with conservative treatment. CONCLUSIONS The ETA {{seems to be a}} useful method for recovery of the normal anatomic features of the orbits for patients with large MOWFs near the orbital apex.

Because of the agitation of the child and the lack of access, {{it was not possible to}} perform a brain or <b>orbital</b> computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scan,</b> but an X-ray showed that the object had gone directly into the retro-orbital space. As the result of a clinical diagnosis, it was possible to ascertain that the globe was severely hypertonic. Throughout this process the child was extremely agitated. After consultation with the neurosurgery service, the patient was rushed to the operation room. After anesthesia and superanasal peritomy, the pencil was removed slowly from the orbit. Neurology and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> after surgery didn’t show any ocular or brain symptoms. Once the patient’s general condition had improved sufficiently and his visual acuity had returned to 10 / 10, he was discharged from the hospital. This case shows that even without specialized tests, such as <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> an organ can be saved...|$|R
40|$|A 47 -year-old man {{presented}} with right-side torso pain and numbness and intermittent fever and {{was diagnosed with}} pul-monary infection. However, he reported blurred vision in his right eye during therapy. Further questioning of the patient about his behavior uncovered that he ate inadequately cooked Pomacea canalicu-lata twice within 54 days. This piece of information, along {{with the fact that}} it coincided with an outbreak of angiostrongylia-sis in Beijing, 1 brought to our attention the possibility of this disease. Because of this, some related examinations were per-formed. An investigation based on circulating antigens (CAg) of Angiostrongylus cantonensis was positive, <b>orbital</b> computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scan</b> showed that there was a soft tissue lesion (6. 7 × 2. 6 mm in size) at {{the lower part of the}} right optic nerve sheath (Figure 1), and ocular magnetic resonance imag...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prospectively {{evaluate}} the accuracy and predictability of new three-dimensionally preformed AO titanium mesh plates for posttraumatic orbital wall reconstruction. We analyzed the preoperative and postoperative clinical and radiologic data of 10 patients with isolated blow-out orbital fractures. Fracture locations were as follows: floor (N = 7; 70 %), medial wall (N = 1; 1 %), and floor/medial wall (N = 2; 2 %). The floor fractures were exposed by a standard transconjunctival approach, whereas a combined transcaruncular transconjunctival approach was used in patients with medial wall fractures. A three-dimensional preformed AO titanium mesh plate (0. 4 mm in thickness) was selected according to the size of the defect previously measured on the preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan examination and fixed at the inferior orbital rim with 1 or 2 screws. The accuracy of plate positioning of the reconstructed orbit was assessed on the postoperative CT scan. Coronal CT scan slices were used to measure bony orbital volume using OsiriX Medical Image software. Reconstructed versus uninjured orbital volume were statistically correlated. Nine patients (90 %) had a successful treatment outcome without complications. One patient (10 %) developed a mechanical limitation of upward gaze with a resulting handicapping diplopia requiring hardware removal. Postoperative <b>orbital</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> showed an anatomic three-dimensional placement of the orbital mesh plates in all of the patients. Volume data of the reconstructed orbit fitted that of the contralateral uninjured orbit with accuracy to within 2. 5 cm(3). There was no significant difference in volume between the reconstructed and uninjured orbits. This preliminary study has demonstrated that three-dimensionally preformed AO titanium mesh plates for posttraumatic orbital wall reconstruction results in (1) a high rate of success with an acceptable rate of major clinical complications (10 %) and (2) an anatomic restoration of the bony orbital contour and volume that closely approximates that of the contralateral uninjured orbit...|$|E
40|$|Pyomyositis is {{a primary}} {{bacterial}} infection of striated muscles nearly always caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Development of the intramuscular abscess involving the extra-ocular muscles (EOMs) remains an extremely rare process. We herein present a case of isolated EOM pyomyositis involving superior rectus muscle in a 2 -year male child who was referred with complaints of swelling in left eye (LE) and inability to open LE since last 1 -month. <b>Orbital</b> computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scan</b> showed a well-defined, hypo-dense, peripheral rim-enhancing lesion in relation to left superior rectus muscle suggestive of left superior rectus abscess. The abscess was drained through skin approach. We concluded that pyomyositis of EOM {{should be considered in}} any patient presenting with acute onset of orbital inflammation and characteristic CT or magnetic resonance imaging features. Management consists of incision and drainage coupled with antibiotic therapy...|$|R
40|$|A 35 -year-old man's vision had {{progressively}} deteriorated over a 3 -month period. His left {{visual acuity}} was 5 / 20. Enhanced <b>orbital</b> computed tomographic (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> revealed a fusiform dilatation of the ophthalmic artery {{in the left}} optic canal. Cerebral Angiography revealed a fusiform aneurysm on the left ophthalmic artery in the optic canal, measuring 6. 2 × 4. 6 mm in size. Four days after admission, visual acuity dropped to hand-motion. Endovascular treatment was chosen and a microcatheter was guided into the proximal segment of the ophthalmic artery. Using 4 detachable coils, parent artery occlusion was done. Three months after the intervention, the visual acuity in his left eye improved to 20 / 20. Dramatic recovery of visual acuity is exceptional with an ophthalmic artery trunk aneurysm. When an occlusion of the proximal ophthalmic artery is the only treatment option in such a situation, the endovascular occlusion of the proximal ophthalmic artery is quite feasible {{in the sense that}} it does not require any optic nerve manipulation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} {{the incidence of}} asymptomatic incidental trochlear calcifications and to describe their clinical features. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed <b>orbital</b> computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> of 216 patients to identify the presence of trochlear calcifications. We analyzed the prevalence, age distribution, and gender preponderance of trochlear calcifications. We also examined age-specific prevalence rates for trochlear calcifications, {{as well as their}} relationship to systemic disease. Results: The mean age of patients was 26. 8 years. Trochlear calcifications were observed in 35 (16 %) of the 216 patients, and 18 of the 35 patients had bilateral calcifications. The rate of trochlear calcification was higher in males; 32 (20. 9 %) of 153 male patients had trochlear calcifications, compared with 3 (4. 8 %) of 63 female patients. Age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease were not significantly associated with the incidence of trochlear calcifications. Conclusions: Incidental asymptomatic orbital calcification is more commonly observed on CT images than we expected and occurs predominantly in male patients. Understanding this to be a relatively common, benign finding may help us to rule out foreign bodies and other pathologic conditions.

40|$|A 36 -year-old {{woman with}} no past medical history was ad-mitted to {{hospital}} after slipping on the ice. The patient {{did not lose}} consciousness, but she immediately noted drooping of her right eyelid and double vision when she elevated the lid. There was a 3 cm laceration wound on the chin and some abrasions over the neck and the central region of her face (Fig. 1 A). The right pupil was fixed and dilated, and there was complete right ptosis. The patient could not elevate, depress, or adduct the right eye, but the eye intorted on attempted downgaze (Fig. 1 B). The right pupil measured 5 mm in diameter and was slug-gish reactive to light. Ophthalmologic tests of vision and intra-ocular pressure were within normal ranges in both eyes. Fur-ther physical and neurological examinations were normal. Skull X-rays and <b>orbital</b> computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> immedi-ately after the accident failed to show fractures. MRI and MR angiography of the brain did not reveal any pathology on ad-mission (Fig. 2). Contrast-enhanced spoiled gradient-recalled (SPGR) MR sequences with multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) was subsequently performed to produce high-resolution imag-es of the cisternal portions of the cranial nerves.
