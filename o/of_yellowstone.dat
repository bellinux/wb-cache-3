5|$|U.S. Army {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> was {{so successful}} that by 1891 they were also managing Sequoia, Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks in California and Mackinac National Park in Michigan. The National Park Service later followed the precedents established by the army and incorporated them into their own management strategy. During its tenure at Yellowstone, the army developed regulations that put emphasis on protection of park resources, safety of visitors, and positive but effective visitor interaction. Under the watchful eyes of the army, the geothermal features, forests and wildlife <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> were protected from vandalism, fire and poaching. These practices were adopted by the National Park Service and continue as a foundation of National Park management policy. Proactive actions by the army in stopping poaching in the park led to {{the passing of the}} Lacey Act of 1894, which established legal protection for the wildlife and remedies for dealing with violators.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 or 1873, Yount {{was hired}} as a {{seasonal}} guide, wrangler and packer for geological survey expeditions with the aim of mapping broad swaths of the Rocky Mountains.

As of 2010, the education costs per student were about $10,000 and about $2,500 per student for meals and transportation.|$|R
5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

5|$|The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem elk herd numbers over 200,000 {{individuals}} {{and during the}} spring and fall, they {{take part in the}} longest elk migration in the continental U.S. Elk in the southern regions <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park and in the surrounding National Forests migrate south towards the town of Jackson, Wyoming, where they winter for up to six months on the National Elk Refuge. Conservationists there ensure the herd is well fed during the harsh winters. Many of the elk that reside in the northern sections of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem migrate to lower altitudes in Montana, mainly to the north and west.|$|E
5|$|There {{are dozens}} of species of {{flowering}} plants that have been identified, most of which bloom between the months of May and September.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left {{a legacy of}} policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Concerned by {{the effects}} of {{commercial}} interests, prominent citizens including Galen Clark and Senator John Conness advocated for protection of the area. A park bill was prepared {{with the assistance of}} the General Land Office in the Interior Department. The bill passed both houses of the 38th United States Congress, and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant. This is the first instance of park land being set aside specifically for preservation and public use by action of the U.S. federal government, and set a precedent for the 1872 creation <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> as the first national park. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to California as a state park, and a board of commissioners was proclaimed two years later.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans {{have lived}} in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000years. Aside from visits by {{mountain}} men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Secretary of the Interior, the first being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was subsequently commissioned to oversee management <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> for a 30-year period between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.|$|E
5|$|The Absaroka and Beartooth Mountains {{are partly}} in the {{northern}} section of the forest. The Wind River Range is in the southern portion and contains Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming. Yellowstone National Park forms part of the boundary to the west; south <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone,</b> the Continental Divide separates the forest from its neighbor Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The eastern boundary includes privately owned property, lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Wind River Indian Reservation, which belongs to the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians. Custer National Forest along the Montana border is on the northern frontier. The Oregon Trail, the 19th century covered wagon route, passes {{just south of the}} forest, where broad and gentle South Pass allowed the migrants to bypass the rugged mountains to the north.|$|E
5|$|The Yellowstone {{fires of}} 1988 {{together}} formed the largest wildfire in the recorded history <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park in the United States. Starting as many smaller individual fires, the flames quickly spread {{out of control}} with increasing winds and drought and combined into one large conflagration, which burned for several months. The fires almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and, on September 8, 1988, the entire park was closed to all non-emergency personnel {{for the first time}} in its history. Only the arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought the fires to an end. A total of , or 36percent of the park was affected by the wildfires.|$|E
50|$|The Yellowstone River Compact is {{an interstate}} compact that was entered into by Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming and {{ratified}} in 1950 {{for the purpose}} of providing for an equitable division and apportionment of the waters <b>of</b> the <b>Yellowstone</b> River and its tributaries, encouraging mutually beneficial development and use <b>of</b> the <b>Yellowstone</b> River Basin's waters, and furthering intergovernment cooperation between the three states. The Compact became effective in 1951 and provided for the creation <b>of</b> the <b>Yellowstone</b> River Compact Commission to administer the provisions of the Compact as between the states of Montana and Wyoming.|$|R

5|$|Yellowstone National Park spans {{an area of}} , {{comprising}} lakes, canyons, {{rivers and}} mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake {{is one of the}} largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent. The caldera is considered an active volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone.</b> The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest {{forms the}} eastern {{boundary}} <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park and the northeastern and eastern entrances {{to the park}} are both accessed by way of designated scenic roadways. A federally designated National Scenic Byways All-American Road, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212), weaves through the forest and serves as the northeastern entranceway to Yellowstone National Park. Chief Joseph Scenic Byway (Wyoming Highway 296) connects Cody, Wyoming with the Beartooth Highway and follows the old trail in which Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe attempted to flee the U.S. Cavalry in 1877. South of there, Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway (US 14/16/20) heads west from Cody, Wyoming, passes through the forest and crosses Sylvan Pass as it enters Yellowstone. Lastly, the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway (US 26/287) heads northwest from Dubois, Wyoming, over Togwotee Pass and enters Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Though the Beartooth Highway {{is the only one}} of these four roads that is a National Scenic Byway, all four of them have been designated Wyoming State Scenic Byways by the state of Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin (which, at , {{is about the}} size of France) lies roughly between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade Mountains on the west. In the United States and Canada the term watershed is often used to mean {{drainage basin}}. The term Columbia Basin is used to refer not only to the entire drainage basin but also to subsets of the river's full watershed, such as the relatively flat and unforested area in eastern Washington bounded by the Cascades, the Rocky Mountains, and the Blue Mountains. Within the watershed are diverse landforms including mountains, arid plateaus, river valleys, rolling uplands, and deep gorges. Grand Teton National Park lies in the watershed, as well as parts <b>of</b> <b>Yellowstone</b> National Park, Glacier National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and North Cascades National Park. Canadian National Parks in the watershed include Kootenay National Park, Yoho National Park, Glacier National Park, and Mount Revelstoke National Park. Hells Canyon, the deepest gorge in North America, and the Columbia Gorge are in the watershed. Vegetation varies widely, ranging from western hemlock and western redcedar in the moist regions to sagebrush in the arid regions. The watershed provides habitat for 609known fish and wildlife species, including the bull trout, bald eagle, gray wolf, grizzly bear, and Canada lynx.|$|E
