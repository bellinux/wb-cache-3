5|$|In October 1965, Leeds skipper Collins {{was injured}} in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup game against Torino and Revie gave the {{captaincy}} to Bremner after initially handing the armband to Charlton {{for the remainder of}} the season; Charlton was keen to give up the captaincy as it prevented his superstitious ritual of coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> last on match days. Revie and Bremner had a strong bond of trust, which was why the manager gave him the captaincy at such a young age. Leeds finished second in the league in the 1965–66 campaign to Liverpool, who had finished six points clear at the top.|$|E
5|$|Simulated {{light rail}} {{testing in the}} tunnel began on May 20, 2009, with two-car trains {{operating}} alongside in-service buses, making it the first joint bus and rail tunnel with stations in the United States. Service on the Central Link light rail line began on July 18, 2009, operating from Westlake station in the tunnel to Tukwila International Boulevard station near the airport. Light rail service was extended north from Westlake to University of Washington station (via Capitol Hill station) on March 19, 2016, coinciding with the moving of several bus routes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to accommodate increased train frequencies.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E

50|$|On April 13, 1992, {{during the}} Chicago flood 250000000 gal L of water poured into Chicago's subways and <b>the</b> basements <b>of</b> nearby buildings.

5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near {{the opening of}} the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E
5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E

25|$|Work started {{immediately}} {{to plug the}} tunnel and hundreds of volunteers used timbers and stones. The river easily washed these <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Within a few weeks, the plug held and dams were built to divert the river and stop St. Anthony Falls from being washed away. The fix was temporary and the 1870 spring floods tore {{up some of the}} new dams and swept away more of Hennepin Island. In addition, the earth support below the Summit flour mill, Moulton's planing mill and a wheat storehouse were undermined and each of these was tipped into the river.|$|E

25|$|By September 2014, Gordon King of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was {{the only}} {{prisoner}} still alive who had worked directly on the Great Escape, but {{was not one of}} the escapees. He had been number 141 to escape and operated the pump to send air into the tunnel. Speaking candidly of his low number and resulting inability to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> that night, he said he considered himself fortunate. King had been shot down over Germany in 1943 and {{spent the rest of the}} war as a prisoner. He participated in the Battle Scars TV series in his home town of Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|Timmermann coaxed Busch out {{and talked}} with him. Busch {{described}} {{the situation in the}} tunnel and offered to translate for the surrender. The German officers were still reluctant to surrender. Timmermann, through Busch, finally had a German officer come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and a peaceful surrender was arranged. Some 200 soldiers and over 100 civilians, along with young Busch's mother, surrendered and were escorted over the bridge to safety. It was now a little after 1715 hours (5:15 PM), less than two hours had passed. The only German killed in the railroad tunnel that afternoon was young Willi Felten.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 December 2009, during the December 2009 European snowfall, five London-bound Eurostar trains failed inside the tunnel, {{trapping}} 2,000 passengers for approximately 16 hours, during the coldest temperatures in eight years. A Eurotunnel spokesperson explained that snow had evaded the train's winterisation shields, and the transition from cold air outside to the tunnel's warm atmosphere had melted the snow, resulting in electrical failures. One train was turned back before reaching the tunnel; two trains were hauled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> by Eurotunnel Class 0001 diesel locomotives. The blocking of the tunnel led {{to the implementation of}} Operation Stack, the transformation of the M20 motorway into a linear car park.|$|E

25|$|Tunnels were blasted {{through hard}} rock by {{drilling}} {{holes in the}} rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted loose. The loosened rock would be collected and hauled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{for use in a}} fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. A foot or so advance on a tunnel face was a typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented nitroglycerin explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Arden {{investigates the}} death chute {{to find the}} empty cart Grace was taken from and inhuman {{footprints}} leading <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> He later shows Kit a plaster cast of the footprint, believing it to be alien. He asks Kit if {{he had sex with}} wife Alma (Britne Oldford) and Grace (Lizzie Brocheré) before their abductions, thinking the aliens are experimenting with eugenics. Arden asks Kit's permission to cause his temporary death to see if the aliens return. Kit consents, believing it will allow him to see Alma again. Arden renders Kit dead by a potassium chloride injection, promising to revive him in a few minutes with atropine and epinephrine. Bright light and loud sounds fill the hallways, and Arden leaves Kit to find Pepper (Naomi Grossman) and a naked full-term pregnant Grace.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 1997, the mid-morning {{service to}} Wellington broke down 2.5km into the Rimutaka Tunnel from the Featherston portal after an {{electrical}} fault in locomotive DC 4951's control gear. The Rimutaka Tunnel is a radio dead-spot, {{and the train}} driver and guard found the Train Control telephones on the tunnel wall to be dead. Shortly afterwards, the tunnel alarm sounded at Upper Hutt signal box indicating the train {{had been in the}} tunnel for more than 15 minutes, and a full-scale emergency response was activated. The train was removed from the tunnel two hours later by a relief locomotive from the Featherston end after a haphazard response {{on both sides of the}} tunnel. There were no injuries, although some elderly passengers required medical treatment due to the distress of the event. After the incident, changes were made to the Train Control telephones so they would self-test and track occupancy rules were modified to allow trains to coast <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> (which has a gradient of 0.25% to 0.55%) if they became disabled. Emergency services on either side of the tunnel now carry out training exercises every 2–3 years in preparation for such a situation.|$|E

25|$|Free kicks {{are awarded}} for {{technical}} infringements {{that do not}} warrant a penalty. This includes indiscretions like players time wasting, charging over the 22-metre line during the oppositions drop-out, pushing in a ruck with their head lower than their hips, returning the ball to a ruck or maul, pretending to clear the ball from a ruck or maul and preventing the ball being thrown in at a quick line-out. Many infringements are penalised by free kicks during line-outs, including delaying or pretending {{to throw the ball}} in (balking), having less than two or more numbers than the opposition, leaving once the line-out has formed, failure to form a line-out, standing closer than five metres or over fifteen metres from the sideline, the receiver or opposition hooker (or equivalent player) standing in the incorrect position, not forming a straight line, not keeping a metre gap between the two lines, lifting a player below the shorts from behind or below the thighs from in front, jumping before the ball is thrown in, not lowering any lifted player, using only the outside arm to catch or deflect the ballor leaving the line-out before the ball is thrown, Free kicks are awarded at scrums are for delay in forming a scrum, incorrect or early binding of the front rows, pushing before the ball is fed, front rows feet off the ground before the ball is fed, the scrumhalf not feeding the ball in correctly or straight, intentionally kicking the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> bringing the ball back into the scrum after it has emerged, a non-front row player hooking the ball from the tunnel or the scrum half pretending to clear the ball from the scrum.|$|E
500|$|Speed {{limits in}} the Channel Tunnel are {{dictated}} by air-resistance, energy (heat) dissipation {{and the need}} to fit in with other, slower trains. The trains were designed with Channel Tunnel safety in mind, and consist of two independent [...] "half-sets" [...] each with its own power car. In the event of a serious fire on board while travelling through the tunnel, passengers would be transferred into the undamaged half of the train, which would then be detached and driven <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to safety.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, {{the club}} adopted the playing of the Post Horn Galop prior to home matches.
