5|$|By {{the next}} day, the state parks agency closed Refugio State Beach and El Capitán State Beach. Governor Jerry Brown {{declared}} a state of emergency. Santa Barbara County also {{declared a state}} of emergency. The Santa Barbara emergency management team eventually recommended that the Board of Supervisors keep the proclamation of local emergency intact till until May 2016. They anticipated that a significant winter storm could bring up submerged <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> situation could be reassessed in the spring.|$|E
50|$|Automotive oil {{recycling}} {{involves the}} recycling of used <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{creation of new}} products from <b>the</b> recycled <b>oils,</b> <b>and</b> includes <b>the</b> recycling of motor <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> hydraulic <b>oil.</b> Oil recycling also benefits the environment: increased opportunities for consumers to recycle oil lessens the likelihood of used oil being dumped on lands and in waterways. For example, one gallon of motor oil dumped into waterways {{has the potential to}} pollute one million gallons of water.|$|R

5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver {{is a source}} of vitamin <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|In March 1941, 250 {{officers}} and men from No. 3 Commando {{took part in}} the first large-scale Commando raid, which was launched on four ports in the Lofoten Islands in Norway. The raid, codenamed Operation Claymore, proved to be a considerable success, resulting in the capture of a number of wheels of the German Enigma encoding machine which helped the Allies to decode German radio traffic later in the war, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of petrol and <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> capture of several hundred Germans.|$|E
5|$|The Fairbanks economy, which briefly boomed in {{the period}} between the {{discovery}} of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legal challenge, stagnated as legal challenges dragged on. The challenges were ended by approval of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act in late 1973. When pipeline work began in early 1974, it sparked a boom in Fairbanks unlike anything since the years immediately after the city's founding. Alyeska Pipeline Service Company alone spent an estimated $800,000 a day in Fairbanks, which housed the construction headquarters on Fort Wainwright. Tens of thousands of workers poured into the city, straining the economy, infrastructure, and public works. The population of the Fairbanks North Star Borough increased by 40 percent between 1973 and 1976. The number of businesses in the area doubled during the same period.|$|E

50|$|Water based defoamers are {{different}} types of <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> waxes dispersed in a water base. The oils are often mineral oil or vegetable <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> waxes are long chain fatty alcohol, fatty acid soaps or esters. These are normally best as deaerators, which means they are best at releasing entrained air.|$|R
50|$|Air quality {{must also}} be taken into consideration. Dust tends to absorb moisture, {{providing}} a suitable environment to attract mold growth and insects. Dust can also become acidic when combined with skin <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surface of paper.|$|R
5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine {{considered}} {{sending the}} two ships to attack convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, but the difficulties associated with refueling at sea convinced the Germans {{to abandon the}} plan. Bremse {{was one of the}} ships interned at Scapa Flow {{under the terms of the}} armistice in November 1918. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the scuttling of the fleet. She was salvaged in 1929 by teams working for Ernest Cox, though they had to contend with large quantities of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> risks of fires and explosions. Having been brought back to the surface after a decade underwater, she was then scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E

30|$|Emulsification {{is mainly}} {{dominated}} by the viscosity of <b>the</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surfactant in the drilling fluids. Large amounts of crude oils, generally as much as 25 – 50  vol% can be blended with aphron-based drilling fluids, and still be water-wetting.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} compare the effects of {{weathering}} on two types of mixed oil, simulated weathering experiments were performed. The first sample {{was a mixture of}} two fresh <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second sample was a mixture of one fresh <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> another <b>oil</b> sample that had undergone a serious weathering process. Comparative studies evaluated decay rates and changes in diagnostic ratios of some fingerprinting biomarkers. Results showed that the mixing process affected the weathering rate of some compounds in <b>the</b> <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> also that certain diagnostic ratios are more suitable for estimating mixing proportions. A Pr/n-C- 17 versus Pr/n-C- 18 plot can be used to identify the end-numbers of mixed <b>oils</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> (C- 13 + C- 14) /(C- 25 + C- 26) ratio is a useful diagnostic ratio to detect the degree of weathering. Finally, hopane, sterane, and alkylated PAH fingerprints were found to give useful insights about the sources of the mixed oils. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|Monte Testaccio has {{provided}} archaeologists {{with a rare}} insight into the ancient Roman economy. The amphorae deposited in the mound were often labelled with tituli picti, painted or stamped inscriptions which record information such as {{the weight of the}} oil contained in the vessel, the names of the people who weighed and documented the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> name of the district where the oil was originally bottled. This has allowed archaeologists to determine that the oil in the vessels was imported under state authority and was designated for the annona urbis (distribution to the people of Rome) or the annona militaris (distribution to the army). Indeed, some of the inscriptions found on mid-2nd century vessels at Monte Testaccio specifically record that the oil they once contained was delivered to the praefectus annonae, the official in charge of the state-run food distribution service. It is possible that Monte Testaccio was also managed by the praefectus annonae.|$|E
5|$|Once steel {{supplies}} {{had been}} agreed, an initial tranche of $35 million in funding {{was provided by}} the government Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which owned and manage the operation of the pipelines through its subsidiary organizations, the Defense Plants and the Defense Supplies corporations. In turn, the actual construction and operation of the pipelines would be carried out by the War Emergency Pipelines company (WEP), a non-profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest oil companies in the United States: Atlantic Refining, Cities Service Oil, Consolidated Oil, Gulf Oil, Pan American Petroleum and Transportation, Standard Oil, Tidewater Associated Oil, Shell Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil, Sun <b>Oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Texas Pipe Line Company. The WEP was led by W. Alton Jones and Burt Hull, both with extensive backgrounds in the industry, with Oscar Wolfe as its chief engineer. The company established its offices in Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other coal.|$|E
