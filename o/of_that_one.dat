The original manuscript of the Chronicle was created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple copies were made <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> original and then distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. In one case, the Chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} eventually, the APU and tail vibrations eventually {{reached the same}} frequency and went into resonance, where the force of multiple same-frequency vibrations add to that of one another and create one large vibration. This {{seems to indicate that}} the replacement <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> bolt may have actually worsened the vibration by changing the vertical stabilizer's natural frequency and possibly bringing it closer to that of the APU. Thus, the tail's vibration increased in amplitude until it failed and broke off.|$|E

In a later review for the album's [...] "Platinum Edition" [...] re–release, Allan Clare gave it an 8 out of 10, saying {{the rest of the}} album aside from [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] was [...] "bland".

[...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asserted that Beckinsale and Farmiga played [...] "two of the most fascinating female movie characters to hit screens in a long while, and they've been brought to life by two gifted actresses, each working {{at the top of her}} game." [...] Beckinsale received a Critic's Choice Award nomination for her performance. The film never received a full theatrical release after the distributor filed for bankruptcy and the film has grossed just $186,702 worldwide.

500|$|Arkham Asylum and Arkham City {{composer}} Nick Arundel {{returned to}} score Arkham Knight, while his partner on those games, Ron Fish, {{was replaced by}} composer David Buckley. On his continued involvement in the series, Arundel said [...] "One {{of the good things}} about doing a sequel, is you get the opportunity to redo , to revisit things... We have a set of material that we want to keep consistent, like the Batman theme ... We wanted to keep [...] theme and tailor it more to the story for this game. How can we get the Scarecrow element out <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> theme." [...] Arundel added that Buckley was willing to work within the music he had already created, as opposed to wanting to add his own personal touch to it. Buckley received Arundel's work from Arkham Asylum to help create new variations on the chords and melody from the original theme. Volume 1 of the official soundtrack was released from WaterTower Music alongside the game on June 23, 2015, and a limited edition vinyl record featuring fifteen songs from the soundtrack chosen by Arundel.

500|$|Josh Wigler from MTV {{loved the}} revelations from the {{conversation}} with William Bell, along {{with the appearance of}} shapeshifters. He thought the episode was Fringe [...] "at its absolute finest," [...] as the [...] "mystery-of-the-week and the overarching plot worked in complete harmony with one another, proving that Fringe is entirely capable of delivering on both a serialized and episodic basis". Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker praised guest actor Leonard Nimoy's [...] "terrific, coolly-controlled performance," [...] and wrote that he continued [...] "to admire the way Fringe can mind-meld its scientific fiction with workplace-family drama and light comedy, juggling an increasing number of characters and subplots, while still maintaining a strong narrative through-line". The A.V. Club Noel Murray graded the episode a B+, explaining that the episode was much better than the previous week and also praising the introduction of two new characters and the long awaited meeting between Olivia and William Bell. Murray concluded his review somewhat negatively, [...] "If the whole episode had maintained the [...] "yes we're aware this is kinda nutsy" [...] tone <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> great line, I'd have bumped it up one more notch to the A-level. I'm holding back only because [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] was such an info-dump, and played a fraction too soberly".|$|E
500|$|This {{remained}} {{a point of}} contention until 1929, when Brownlee and King agreed on a new wording: [...] "organized {{in accordance with the}} laws of the Province, but in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the constitution." [...] The federal government had already agreed to continue the resource subsidy in perpetuity, but Brownlee objected to its plans to base the amount on Alberta's 1929 population, which would see it receive less than Saskatchewan in perpetuity despite having a much faster-growing population. [...] When the federal Turgeon Commission recommended that Manitoba, in addition to a perpetual subsidy, receive a one-time payment of more than $4 million, Brownlee demanded the same for Alberta. [...] King countered that the purpose <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> time payment was to compensate Manitoba for years during which it, unlike Alberta and Saskatchewan, did not receive a subsidy; Brownlee responded that the federal government had given away more than three times as much of Alberta's land as Manitoba's to the railways. [...] King left the meeting in protest against this new demand, but he was determined to settle with Manitoba and Alberta in order to isolate Saskatchewan Premier James Thomas Milton Anderson and his more extravagant demands. [...] He eventually accepted Brownlee's terms, and an agreement was signed December 14, 1929. [...] The agreement provided for an annual subsidy of $562,000 until Alberta's population reached 800,000 and $750,000 until it reached 1,200,000, after which it would be $1,125,000.|$|E
