5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. <b>Older</b> <b>siblings</b> may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their <b>older</b> <b>siblings.</b> There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{identified}} urban-rural differences in schizophrenia risk. Hypothetical underlying cause(s) may include toxic exposures, diet, infections, and selective migration. The authors investigated whether the underlying cause(s) {{responsible for the}} urban-rural differences were rooted in families or in individuals. Linking data from the Danish Civil Registration System and the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, a population-based cohort of 711, 897 people aged 15 years or more was established. Overall, 2, 720 persons developed schizophrenia during the period 1970 – 2001. The authors evaluated whether the nearest <b>older</b> <b>sibling’s</b> place of birth had an independent effect on schizophrenia risk. If the cause(s) responsible for the urban-rural differences are rooted in individuals only, the nearest <b>older</b> <b>sibling’s</b> place of birth should have no independent effect. In this analysis, the nearest <b>older</b> <b>sibling’s</b> place of birth had an independent effect; among persons {{who lived in a}} rural area during their first 15 years of life, the relative risk was 1. 59 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 10, 2. 30) if their nearest older sibling had been born in the capital area as compared with a rural area. Some of the cause(s) responsible for the urban-rural differences in schizophrenia risk are rooted in families, but some might also be rooted in individuals. cities; environment; family characteristics; genes; risk factors; schizophrenia; siblings; urbanization Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; CRS, Civil Registration System; ICD, International Classification of Diseases.

40|$|In France {{as in the}} US, the {{participation}} of a mother in the labour market {{is influenced by the}} sex of her <b>oldest</b> <b>siblings.</b> Same-sex mothers tend to have more children and to work significantly less than the other mothers. In contast, the sex of the <b>oldest</b> <b>siblings</b> does not have any perceptible influence on neighbourhood choices. There is no correlation between the sex of the siblings of a mother and the sex of the siblings of the other mothers living in the same close neighbourhood. Given these facts, the distribution of the sex of the siblings of the other mothers provides us with a plausible instrumental variable to identify the influence of other mothers' participation on a mother's participation in the labour market. Reduced-form analysis reveals that a mother's participation in the labour market is significantly affected by the sex of the <b>oldest</b> <b>siblings</b> of the other mothers living in the same neighbourhood. IV estimates suggest a strong impact of close neighbours' participation in the labour market on individual participation. We compare this result to estimates produced using the distribution of children's quarters of birth to generate instruments. Mothers whose children were born {{at the end of the}} year cannot send their children to pre-elementary school as early as the other mothers and participate less in the labour market. Interestingly enough, estimates using the distribution of quarters of birth in the neighbourhood as instruments are as strong as estimates using the sex-mix instruments.

5|$|Gaara first {{appears in}} the series when he is sent to Konohagakure, an allied ninja village, {{to take part in}} the Chunin Exams {{alongside}} his <b>older</b> <b>siblings</b> Kankuro and Temari. In truth, he is sent in order to infiltrate Konohagakure in preparation for an invasion by Sunagakure and its ally, Otogakure. There, he and Kankuro and Temari easily pass both the first and second phases. In the third phase, Gaara is set to fight against Rock Lee. Lee is able to pass Gaara's defenses, provoking an enraged Gaara into breaking Lee's arm and leg, claiming victory. Sasuke Uchiha manages to give Gaara the first injury he has ever received, causing Gaara to suffer a mental breakdown and nearly manifest his Tailed-Beast powers. This begins the invasion, with his <b>older</b> <b>siblings</b> carrying him off as he could not participate in his current state of mind. Both Sasuke and Naruto Uzumaki confront him with the latter defeating him. Later, Sunagakure sends Gaara to help in preventing Sasuke from defecting to Otogakure, which became enemy of Sunagakure once learning that Orochimaru murdered Rasa prior to the attack. While he is able to help Lee fight Orochimaru's servant Kimimaro, Gaara is unable to prevent Sasuke from escaping from Konoha. He makes amends with the many characters he had alienated, apologizing to those he hurt and improving his relationship with his family. At the same time, Gaara's fundamental characteristic becomes the desire to protect as many people as he can, as in doing so he believes, like Naruto, he will be able to find true strength. This culminates in his replacing his father as the Fifth Kazekage during Part II of the series.|$|E
5|$|Robert was {{probably}} one of the sons of Gilbert de Gant, who is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma– wife of Alan de Percy, Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant– who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, probably the youngest of the four brothers, and probably was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were <b>older</b> <b>siblings.</b> Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter.

5|$|For preschoolers, {{there was}} the {{educational}} television show Barney & Friends starting in 1992; their <b>older</b> <b>siblings</b> had the 1988 animated movie The Land Before Time and its increasing line of direct to video sequels (13 by 2016). Dinosaurs, a television sitcom, parodied humans and other television shows. Of particular note is Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, Jurassic Park, the popularity of {{which led to a}} series of films and other media. The first of these, Jurassic Park, married advanced CGI with advances in scientific knowledge of dinosaurs. Dinosaur was the most expensive movie in 2000, but was a box-office success. The falling cost of computer-generated effects also has recently allowed the increased production of documentaries for television; the award-winning 1999 BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs, the 2001 When Dinosaurs Roamed America, the 2009 Animal Armageddon, and the 2011 Planet Dinosaur are notable examples.|$|E
5|$|Around 1871 Nathalie {{took the}} {{children}} and left her husband for Trophimowsky, who had abandoned his own wife and family. They left Russia, staying in Turkey and then Italy before settling in Geneva. Around 1872 Nathalie gave birth to Augustin; deMoerder, who came to Switzerland in a failed attempt to reconcile with Nathalie, accepted the son as his own and allowed him to have his surname, but the boy's <b>older</b> <b>siblings</b> believed that Trophimowsky was the father. General deMoerder died several months later, and despite their separation had arranged for his estate to pay Nathalie a considerable regular income. The family remained in Switzerland. Four years later Eberhardt was born, and was registered as Nathalie's illegitimate daughter. Biographer Françoise d'Eaubonne speculated that Eberhardt's biological father was the poet Arthur Rimbaud, {{who had been in}} Switzerland at the time. Other historians consider this unlikely and find it more likely that Tromphimowsky was the father, noting that Nathalie and Trophimowsky were rarely apart, that Eberhardt's birth did not impact negatively on their partnership, and that Eberhardt was Trophimowsky's favorite child. Biographer Cecily Mackworth speculated that Eberhardt's illegitimacy was due to Tromphimowsky's nihilist beliefs, which rejected traditional concepts of family.|$|E

25|$|These divides {{can also}} occur {{between members of}} the same generation, {{particularly}} between <b>older</b> <b>siblings</b> who may identify more strongly with their home country and younger siblings who may identify more with American culture. This is especially likely to occur when <b>older</b> <b>siblings</b> belong to the 1.5 generation, meaning that they were born abroad, and younger siblings were born in the United States. In many societies, <b>older</b> <b>siblings</b> are given greater responsibilities and may feel more pressure from parents to set a good example for their younger siblings by performing well in school and obtaining success. At the same time, this greater responsibility often affords <b>older</b> <b>siblings</b> a greater degree of power within the family. <b>Older</b> <b>siblings</b> may therefore also be more likely to uphold their parents' traditional values because of the power it affords them within the family. In America's more egalitarian culture, power hierarchies based on age {{are less likely to be}} accepted. Younger siblings may therefore reject the authority of their <b>older</b> <b>siblings,</b> fostering tensions within the family.
