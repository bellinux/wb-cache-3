40|$|Education and {{examination}} are inseparable, and {{the importance}} of examination at any level cannot be overemphasized. It has remained a potent instrument for judgement of knowledge acquired. In recent times, the conduct of examinations has generated serious concern and discussions among stakeholders. The conduct of examination has been fraught with various dimensions <b>of</b> examination <b>malpractices.</b> Just like corruption, examination malpractice has permeated the entire educational system in Nigeria. Government functionaries, school authorities, invigilators, examiners, parents and students are all guilty of the iniquitous trend <b>of</b> examination <b>malpractice</b> and the consequent undermining and rubbishing of the examination process and examination bodies. This therefore raises the issue of examination management strategies for qualitative education.

25|$|The {{extra cost}} <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> {{lawsuits}} is {{a proportion of}} health spending in both the U.S. (1.7% in 2002) and Canada (0.27% in 2001 or $237 million).

Average payouts to American plaintiffs were $265,103, while payouts to Canadian plaintiffs were somewhat higher, averaging $309,417. However, malpractice suits are far more common in the U.S., with 350% more suits filed each year per person. While malpractice costs are significantly higher in the U.S., they make up only a small proportion of total medical spending. The total cost of defending and settling malpractice lawsuits in the U.S. in 2004 was over $28 billion. Critics say that defensive medicine consumes up to 9% of American healthcare expenses., but CBO studies suggest that it is much smaller.|$|E
25|$|The {{restructuring}} of the three armies into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents part of a wider process of 'thickening' the central state institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to mitigate some of the potential controversy around restructuring, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) made use of evidence <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> in Republika Srpska military institutions. Firstly, from 2002 onwards, OHR utilised a scandal around the provision of parts and assistance to Iraq in breach of a UN embargo (the so-called Orao affair) to support the cause for bringing governance of the armies under the level of central institutions. Following this, in 2004, the process was accelerated, drawing its justification from new evidence of material {{and other forms of}} support flowing from Republika Srpska armed forces to ICTY indictee Ratko Mladić. OHR condemned the ‘systematic connivance of high-ranking members of the RS military’ and noted that measures to tackle such systematic deficiencies were under consideration. This was quickly followed by the expansion of the mandate for a Defence Reform Commission, which ultimately resulted in the consolidation of three armed forces into one, governed {{at the level of the}} central state.|$|E

Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: [...] "No, No, No" [...] centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and [...] "The Rest Cure" [...] told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: [...] "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We {{do not want to see}} either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic." [...] Joy Bells ran for 723 performances.|$|E
500|$|Since Athenian {{politicians}} were often indicted by their opponents, {{there was not}} always {{a clear distinction between}} [...] "private" [...] and [...] "public" [...] cases, and thus a career as a logographer opened the way for Demosthenes to embark on his political career. An Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, which enabled him to serve personal interests, even if it prejudiced the client. It also left him open to allegations <b>of</b> <b>malpractice.</b> Thus for example Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents; in particular, that he wrote a speech for Phormion (350 BC), a wealthy banker, and then communicated it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a capital charge against Phormion. Plutarch much later supported this accusation, stating that Demosthenes [...] "was thought to have acted dishonorably" [...] and he also accused Demosthenes of writing speeches for both sides. It has often been argued that the deception, if there was one, involved a political quid pro quo, whereby Apollodorus secretly pledged support for unpopular reforms that Demosthenes was pursuing in the greater, public interest (i.e. the diversion of Theoric Funds to military purposes).|$|E
500|$|John Romulus Brinkley (later John Richard Brinkley; July 8, 1885 [...] May 26, 1942) was an American who fraudulently {{claimed to}} be a medical doctor (he had no {{legitimate}} medical education and bought his medical degree from a [...] "diploma mill") who became known as the [...] "goat-gland doctor" [...] after he achieved national fame, international notoriety and great wealth through the xenotransplantation of goat testicles into humans. Although initially Brinkley promoted this procedure as a means of curing male impotence, eventually he claimed that the technique was a virtual panacea {{for a wide range of}} male ailments. He operated clinics and hospitals in several states, and despite the fact that almost from the beginning, detractors and critics in the medical community thoroughly discredited his methods, he was able to continue his activities for almost two decades. He was also, almost by accident, an advertising and radio pioneer who began the era of Mexican border blaster radio. Although he was stripped of his license to practice medicine in Kansas and several other states, Brinkley, a demagogue beloved by hundreds of thousands of people in Kansas and elsewhere, nevertheless launched two campaigns for Kansas governor, one of which was nearly successful. Brinkley's rise to fame and fortune was as precipitous as his eventual fall: At the height of his career he had amassed millions of dollars; yet he died sick and nearly penniless, as a result of the large number <b>of</b> <b>malpractice,</b> wrongful death and fraud suits brought against him.|$|E

2500|$|How {{much these}} costs are {{is a matter}} of debate. Some have argued that {{malpractice}} lawsuits are a major driver of medical costs. However, the direct cost <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> suits amounts to only about 0.5% of all healthcare spending, and a 2006 Harvard study showed that over 90% of the malpractice suits examined contained evidence of injury to the patient and that frivolous suits were generally readily dismissed by the courts. A 2005 study estimated the cost around 0.2%, and in 2009 insurer WellPoint Inc. said [...] "liability wasn’t driving premiums." [...] Counting both direct and indirect costs, other studies estimate the total cost <b>of</b> <b>malpractice</b> [...] "is linked to" [...] between 5% and 10% of total U.S. medical costs. A 2004 report by the Congressional Budget Office put medical malpractice costs at 2% of U.S. health spending and [...] "even significant reductions" [...] would do little to reduce the growth of health care expenses.|$|E

Three percent of the claims were not associated with injuries; of them, 16% got compensation. 63% were associated with errors; of them, 73% got compensation (average $521,560). Thirty-seven percent were not associated with errors; of them, 28% got compensation (average $313,205). Claims not associated with errors accounted for 13 to 16% {{percent of the total}} costs.

An English newspaper of the time is quoted as describing Argentine corruption as follows: [...] "Today there are dozens of men in government who are publicly accused <b>of</b> <b>malpractice,</b> who in any civilized country would be quickly punished with imprisonment, and yet none of them have been brought to justice.
