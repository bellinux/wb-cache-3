5|$|Douglas Engelbart, {{the founder}} of SRI's Augmentation Research Center (ARC), was the primary force behind the design and {{development}} of the multi-user <b>oN-Line</b> <b>System</b> (or NLS), featuring original versions of modern computer-human interface elements including bit-mapped displays, collaboration software, hypertext, and precursors to the graphical user interface such as the computer mouse. As a pioneer of human-computer interaction, Engelbart is arguably SRI's most notable alumnus. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The ARC {{became the}} driving force behind the design and {{development}} of the <b>oN-Line</b> <b>System</b> (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E

In addition, multiple emulated cards can be stored in a smartphone to support multi-merchant loyalty programs. The user does not need to carry many physical cards anymore.|$|E

50|$|Ken Williams (born October 30, 1954) is an American retired game {{programmer}} who co-founded <b>On-Line</b> <b>Systems</b> {{together with}} his wife Roberta Williams. <b>On-Line</b> <b>Systems</b> eventually became Sierra On-Line and was ultimately renamed Sierra Entertainment. The couple were leading figures {{in the development of}} graphical adventure games. At its height, Sierra employed nearly 1,000 people prior to its acquisition in 1996.|$|R

25|$|The live {{demonstration}} {{featured the}} introduction of a complete computer hardware and software system called the <b>oN-Line</b> <b>System</b> or, more commonly, NLS. The 90-minute presentation essentially demonstrated almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor (collaborative work). Engelbart's presentation was the first to publicly demonstrate all of these elements in a single system. The demonstration was highly influential and spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. The underlying technologies influenced both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows graphical user interface operating systems in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Ivan Sutherland {{developed}} Sketchpad in 1963, {{widely held}} {{as the first}} graphical computer-aided design program. It used a light pen to create and manipulate objects in engineering drawings in realtime with coordinated graphics. In the late 1960s, researchers at the Stanford Research Institute, led by Douglas Engelbart, developed the <b>On-Line</b> <b>System</b> (NLS), which used text-based hyperlinks manipulated with a then new device: the mouse. In the 1970s, Engelbart's ideas were further refined and extended to graphics by researchers at Xerox PARC and specifically Alan Kay, who went beyond text-based hyperlinks and used a GUI as the main interface for the Xerox Alto computer, released in 1973. Most modern general-purpose GUIs are derived from this system.|$|E
2500|$|Several other {{experimental}} pointing-devices {{developed for}} Engelbart's <b>oN-Line</b> <b>System</b> (NLS) exploited different body movements –for example, head-mounted devices {{attached to the}} chin or nose– but ultimately the mouse won out because of its speed and convenience. The first mouse, a bulky device (pictured) used two potentiometers perpendicular {{to each other and}} connected to wheels: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis. At the time of the [...] "Mother of All Demos", Engelbart's group had been using their second generation, 3-button mouse for about a year.|$|E
50|$|Edu-Ware {{may be most}} {{noted for}} what it failed to publish rather than what it did publish: Ken Williams {{originally}} shopped the first graphical adventure, Mystery House to Eduware in 1980. Unhappy with how the negotiations were proceeding, he formed <b>On-line</b> <b>Systems</b> to publish the game. <b>On-line</b> <b>Systems</b> became Sierra <b>On-line</b> and Sierra became extremely successful, based largely on their reputation in the graphic adventure genre.|$|R

2500|$|Much of Engelbart's {{thought that}} led to the {{development}} of his Augmentation Research Center (ARC), as well as the <b>oN-Line</b> <b>System</b> was derived from the [...] "research culture" [...] of World War II and the early Cold War. A notable source of inspiration to Engelbart was the article [...] "As We May Think", written by Vannevar Bush in The Atlantic magazine, which Engelbart read while stationed as a US Navy radar technician in the Philippines in 1946. In Engelbart's view, in order to steer society into the right use of scientific knowledge derived from the war, that knowledge would need to be better managed and regulated.|$|E

50|$|Sierra Entertainment {{was founded}} in 1979 as <b>On-Line</b> <b>Systems</b> in Simi Valley, California, by Ken and Roberta Williams. Ken Williams, a {{programmer}} for IBM, bought an Apple II microcomputer which he planned to use to develop a Fortran compiler for the Apple II.

After initial success, <b>On-Line</b> <b>Systems</b> was renamed Sierra On-Line in 1982, and the company moved to Oakhurst, California.
