40|$|The {{establishment}} of Low Cost Carrier <b>offshoots</b> by network carriers has three possible objectives: {{to spin off}} profitable businesses; to see off low cost competition in key markets; and to establish a test-bed for adapting low cost business processes to their mainline operations.

The significant cost differences between network and Low Cost Carriers are identified, and it is shown that network carriers have made little inroads into closing this gap, {{whether or not they}} set up Low Cost Carrier <b>offshoots.</b> Some reasons for the failure of the <b>offshoots</b> are proposed by examining operating differences: mixed fleets, keeping interlining and two class cabins and the lack of progress on reducing labour costs. Labour Union restrictions and the lack of separation from the main airline were crucial...|$|R

Results showed that rooting medium was an important factor in determining the extent of root formation of <b>offshoots.</b> The highest rooting percentages were obtained using the following media, perlite: peat moss (3 : 1) medium followed by the woodshavings: peat moss (l: 1) and perlite: peat moss (1 : 1) media. Sand medium was inferior to the other media. It was also found that neither rooting percentage nor root weight of ground <b>offshoots</b> were increased by NAA and/or catechol treatments. On the other hand, NAA and/or catechol treatments appeared to be essential for good root formation and development on aerial <b>offshoots...</b>|$|R
