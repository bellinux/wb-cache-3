40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} how effective are {{the influences of}} detector sizes, types of gas field, and the changes of operation temperature on detector characteristics of Geiger Muller viewed from threshold voltage, plateau, slope, and the resolving time. The determination of detector characteristics {{was obtained from the}} detector enumeration with diameter variation, types of gas field, and temperature operation changes on Cs- 137 radiation. Data obtained from detector characteristics’ determination were the data count. Geiger Muller detector manufacturing process was started from the preparation of materials, the cathode tube and tube cap manufacture, installation of the detector and anode cap, vacuum tubes, gas fill, detector characteristic test, and data acquisition. The detector was made of stainless steel, the anode of tungsten wire with the length of 100 mm and diameters of 11 mm, 16 mm, 24 mm, and the anode diameter of 0. 08 mm. The gas field used alcohol argon and bromine argon, while for the temperature variation was increased from the temperature of 30 ºC to 70 ºC. Data obtained from the detector test were in the form of counts per minute (cpm) as a function of <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> (<b>V)</b> of the detector. From data of the test, it was illustrated the counting-per-minute graph on the detector’s operation voltage, so that the plateau, slope and resolving time of the detector could be determined. Research results obtained showed that the volume of the detector tube was influential on the detector characteristic curve. When the detector tube was varied, the initial voltage also changed. The change of gas field types also affected the detector characteristic curve. If the gas field type used argon gas having low ionization potential, the initial voltage of the detector would be smaller. Meanwhile, the increment of the detector’s temperature affected the detector’s count number and only slightly affected the length of the plateau while for the slope was relatively the same.

40|$|Abstract Numerical {{experiments}} {{are carried out}} system-atically to determine the argon soft X-Ray yield Ysxr for optimized argon plasma focus with storage energy E 0 from 1 kJ to 1 MJ. The ratio c = b/a, of outer to inner radii; and the <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>V</b> 0 are kept constant. E 0 is varied by changing the capacitance C 0. These numerical experiments were investigated on argon plasma focus at different opera-tional gas pressures (0. 41, 0. 75, 1, 1. 5, 2. 5 and 3 Torr) for two different values of static inductance L 0 (270 and 10 nH). Scaling laws on argon soft X-Ray yield, in terms of storage energies E 0, peak discharge current Ipeak and focus pinch current Ipinch were found. It {{was found that the}} argon X-ray yields scale well with Ysxr 8 1011 I 4 : 12 pinch for the high inductance (270 nH) and Ysxr 7 1013 I 4 : 94 pinch for the low inductance (10 nH), (where yields are in joules and current in kilo amperes). While the soft X-ray yield scaling laws in terms of storage energies were found to be as Ysxr 0 : 05 E 0 : 940 at energies in the 1 – 100 kJ region. The scaling ‘drops ’ as E 0 is increased, and Ysxr scales as Ysxr 1 : 01 E 0 : 330 at high energies towards 1 MJ for 10 nH at argon gas pressure of 1 Torr. The optimum efficiencies for SXR yield were found to be 0. 00077 % with a capacitor bank energy of 112. 5 kJ for high inductance (270 nH) and 0. 005 % with a capacitor bank energy of 4. 5 kJ for low inductance (10 nH). Therefore for larger devices, {{it may be necessary to}} operate at a higher voltage and use higher driver impedance to ensure increasing X-ray yield efficiency beyond the optimum val-ues. As storage energy is changed the required electrode geometry for optimum yield is obtained and the resultant plasma pinch parameters are found.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2010. ChemistryIncludes bibliographical references. Ruthenium-based materials, {{including}} pure hydrous Ru oxide and composites of Ru oxide/carbon fabric (CF), nanostructured Ru oxide/multiwall {{carbon nanotube}} (MWCNT), thin film Ru oxide/CF and binary Mn-Ru oxide/CF have been synthesized using various methods. Their properties {{were characterized by}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and constant current discharging. The purpose of the work was to improve the performances of Ru oxide supercapacitors and enhance the utilization of Ru in the composites. [...] Hydrous Ru oxide was prepared by a modified sol-gel method. The factors influencing the performances of Ru oxide supercapacitors, such as annealing temperature, electrode preparation method, electrode loading, separator, and stability, have been investigated in detail. XRD patterns show that the hydrous Ru oxide had an amorphous structure, while a crystalline structure was formed at annealing temperatures over 200 °C. The best specific capacitance for hydrous Ru oxide was 716 ± 24 F/g at an annealing temperature of 110 °C. Hydrous Ru oxide electrodes prepared by coating Ru oxide {{on the surface of}} carbon fibre paper with 5 % Nafion binder showed the best performance. Specific capacitances (ca. 700 F/g) did not change significantly with increasing electrode loading (up to 51 mg/cm 2) due to the good proton conductivity of the Nafion binder and the high mechanical stability of the electrodes. The best power density for supercapacitors reached 130. 5 kW/kg for half discharge, while the best energy densities were 40. 5 W h/kg and 31. 2 W h/kg for the operating voltages of 1. 3 V and 1. 0 V, respectively. Their lifetimes were over 120000 cycles. [...] In order to improve the utilization of Ru, Ru oxide/CF composites were prepared by an impregnation method. Specific capacitances of the composites increased with Ru oxide loadings. However, the specific capacitance for the Ru oxide component decreased with increasing loading. An average specific capacitance of 1085 F/g based on the Ru oxide component was obtained for a 9. 2 % Ru oxide/CF supercapacitor. The high specific capacitance was ascribed to synergistic effects between functional groups on the CF surface and the Ru oxide component with high surface area. [...] Nanostructured Ru oxide/MWCNT, thin film Ru oxide/CF, thin film Mn oxide/CF, and thin film Mn-Ru oxide/CF composites were synthesized by a spontaneous reduction method. The sizes of Ru oxide particles for the nanostructured Ru oxide/MWCNT composites were less than 3 nm. Thin film structures were observed by SEM for all of the CF composites. The utilization of Ru in these composites was enhanced due to the thin film structure and nanostructured Ru oxide particles, which allows electrolytes to access the bulk Ru oxide. An average specific capacitance of 704 ± 62 F/g for the hydrous Ru oxide component was obtained for a 25. 1 % hydrous Ru oxide/MWCNT composite. A maximum average specific capacitance of 824 ± 152 F/g based on the Ru oxide component was obtained for a 7. 4 % Ru oxide/CF composite with a f 1 lm structure. For an 11. 6 % Mn oxide/CF composite, the specific capacitance for the Mn oxide component in 2 M LiOH was over 1000 F/g, however, it quickly decreased with cycling. The stability of Mn-Ru oxide/CF composites was sharply improved due to the introduction of Ru. [...] A few types of hybrid supercapacitors were tested by cyclic voltammetry and constant current discharging. The operating voltages for hybrid supercapacitors of Ru oxide/CF or Mn oxide/CF with the CF reached 2. 0 V in 2 M KN 03 electrolyte, and the maximum energy density was ca. 18 Wh/kg. A Ru oxide//Pd/C supercapacitor exhibited a maximum energy density of 41. 3 W h/kg. A hybrid supercapacitor with anthraquinone modified CF (the negative electrode) and Ru oxide (the positive electrode) electrodes requires 76. 3 % less Ru oxide relative to a symmetric Ru oxide supercapacitor to provide a similar energy. [...] An approach for quickly predicting the energy and power from impedance spectroscopy is proposed. The usable energy (E= 1 ⁄ 2 Cre (f) V 2) is related to the real capacitance (Cre(f)) and <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> (<b>V),</b> while power (P= 2 f E) depends on E and the frequency (f).

A hybrid one-transistor/one microbeam/bit memory array is proposed for back-end compatible and low-cost OTP NVM integration.

40|$|This {{paper will}} present a {{characterization}} of a microfluidic device with embedded angled microelectrode arrays for the continuous flow-through dielectrophoretic separation of particles. The operation of the device is demonstrated using samples of colloidal latex spheres, achieving 100 % particle deflection with low <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> of 10 <b>V.</b> This characterization is essential for dielectrophoretic separation to get the specific indication for each particle type behaviour, deflection and hence separation {{at the end of}} the arrays. This paper will discuss results obtained and also detail of the theoretical background of the separation method and the optimization of separation that is achievable by choice of frequency and voltage...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} of photoreactive and light-emitting liquid crystals which can be patterned photolithographically to form polymer networks for use in organic light-emitting diodes. The resolution capability of the photopatterning is investigated using a phase mask of period one micron to spatially modulate the irradiance of ultraviolet light incident to the monomer thin film. A surface relief grating of the same period and depth 85 nm is formed on exposure and washing. An OLED incorporating a novel green light-emitting liquid-crystal has a luminous efficiency of 4. 3 lm W- 1 at 100 cd ni and gives a luminance of 990 cd m- 2 at an <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> of 10 <b>V.</b> © 2005 Materials Research Society.
