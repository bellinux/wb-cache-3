He further posed that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a different life, necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.|$|E

50|$|A {{value network}} is a {{business}} analysis perspective that describes social and technical resources within and between businesses. The nodes in a value network represent people (or roles). The nodes are connected by interactions that represent tangible and intangible deliverables.

They account for the overall worth of products and services. Companies have both internal and external value networks.|$|E

5000|$|In November 2012, the Tolkien Estate, trustee and {{publishers}} sued Middle-earth Enterprises (in addition to Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema) for infringing Tolkien's copyrights by producing casino {{and video games}} using his characters.

5000|$|The suit {{alleges that}} by {{producing}} gambling {{and video games}} using his characters, the parties ignored {{the limitations of the}} rights purchased more than four decades ago in 1969; contending the original licence to Tolkien's works was limited to the right to sell [...] "tangible" [...] products such as [...] "figurines, tableware, stationery items, clothing, and the like", but did not cover [...] "electronic or digital rights, rights in media yet to be devised or <b>other</b> <b>intangibles</b> such as rights in services".

50|$|Forcing the {{development}} of the decision framework, with the assignment of scores to intangibles allowing comparison to <b>other</b> <b>intangibles</b> as well as tangibles, eases the resolution of differences of perspectives between senior managers (e.g. Chief Financial Officer, Risk Manager, and the proposer of the initiative), allows changes to the scores to flow through {{to the rest of the}} process (especially the analysis of alternatives), and provides clarity of benefits to a board (before, during, and after the initiative), and clarity of priorities to people looking after more detailed aspects of the initiative. The same transparency of values apply if the proposal is developed at an enterprise level, or within a lesser organizational unit.|$|E
50|$|Organizational {{capital is}} one of the three {{components}} of structural capital, itself a component of intellectual capital.

50|$|The first {{requirement}} is {{to define what}} is meant by 'brand' and which intangible assets {{should be included in the}} brand valuation opinion.

5000|$|Libertarians hold {{a variety}} of views on {{intellectual}} property (IP) and patents. Some libertarian natural rights theorists justify property rights in ideas (and <b>other</b> <b>intangibles)</b> {{just as they do}} property rights in physical goods, saying whoever made it owns it; other libertarian natural rights theorists, especially since Kinsella, have held that only physical material can be owned, and that ownership of [...] "intellectual property" [...] amount to an illegitimate claim of ownership over that which enters another's mind, that which cannot be removed or controlled without violation of the non-aggression axiom. Pro-IP libertarians of the utilitarian tradition say that IP maximizes innovation, while anti-IP libertarians of the selfsame persuasion say that it causes shortages of innovation. This latter view holds that IP is a euphemism for intellectual protectionism and should be abolished altogether.|$|E
50|$|Choi's poetry {{continuously}} asks {{questions about}} existence and essence. His early works explore existence {{and the place}} of existence through sound and shadow. In particular, he examines the paradoxical relationship between existence and non-existence in his second poetry collection Achim cheksang (아침책상 Morning Desk), and probes the issue further in his third collection Ttakttagurineun eodie sumeoitneunga (딱따구리는 어디에 숨어있는가 Where Is the Woodpecker Hiding?). His subsequent works Gongnori haneun dalma (공놀이 하는 달마 Bodhidharma Playing Ball) and Eoreum eolgul (얼음얼굴 Ice Face) are regarded as inquiries into existence taken to the extreme. His later poetry collections link the issue of existence to basic tenets of Eastern philosophy. Choi evokes Buddhist thought on the void by referring to shadow, empty space, ghosts, and <b>other</b> <b>intangibles.</b> He describes empty space as not simply a space that contains nothing, but a place of creation and demise. Choi's poems, which perceive this empty space and the void, can thus be considered a culmination of spiritualist literature that deals with {{the beginning and end}} of existence.|$|E

Contrary to other assets, they generally—though not necessarily—suffer from typical market failures of non-rivalry and non-excludability.|$|R
