25|$|Postmodernity {{can mean}} a {{personal}} {{response to a}} postmodern society, the conditions in a society which make it postmodern or the state of being {{that is associated with}} a postmodern society as well an historical epoch. In most contexts it should be distinguished from postmodernism, the adoption <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> philosophies or traits in art, literature, culture and society. In fact, today, historical perspectives on the developments <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> art (postmodernism) and postmodern society (postmodernity) can be best described as two umbrella terms for processes engaged in an ongoing dialectical relationship, the result of which is the evolving world in which we now live.|$|E
40|$|The main {{intention}} of this text {{is to present}} three inter-connected projections of the current global crisis <b>of</b> the <b>postmodern</b> capitalism: discursive, sociological and cultural/political. Discursive projection is considering the crisis <b>of</b> the <b>postmodern</b> capitalism through {{the perspective of the}} discursive paradigmatic restructuring (social link), sociological projection is giving interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>postmodern</b> social economy paradigm (society of knowledge), whilst the cultural/political projection is discussing the <b>postmodern</b> ideological forms <b>of</b> everyday life (cultural capitalism). In the last instance, all three are raising a question: Is there any good alternative...|$|R

25|$|While broadly based, the {{movement}} was unstable.

25|$|Richard Rorty {{argues in}} Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature that {{contemporary}} analytic philosophy mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of representationalism and correspondence theory that rely upon {{the independence of}} knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of anti-foundationalism and anti-essentialism within a pragmatist framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of conventionalism and relativism, but opposes much <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> thinking with his commitment to social liberalism.|$|E
25|$|William S. Burroughs (19141997) was {{the writer}} who finally brought science fiction {{together}} with the trends <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> literature. With the help of Jack Kerouac, Burroughs published Naked Lunch, {{the first of a}} series of novels employing a semi-dadaistic technique called the Cut-up and postmodern deconstructions of conventional society, pulling away the mask of normality to reveal nothingness beneath. Burroughs showed visions of society as a conspiracy of aliens, monsters, police states, drug dealers and alternate levels of reality. The linguistics of science fiction merged with the experiments of postmodernism in a beat generation gestalt.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{partly as}} a {{reaction}} to the perceived excesses of positivism, French spiritualism thrived with thinkers such as Henri Bergson and it influenced American pragmatism and Whitehead's version of process philosophy. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with Jules Henri Poincaré, Gaston Bachelard, Jean Cavaillès and Jules Vuillemin. Influenced by German phenomenology and existentialism, the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the craddle <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> philosophy with Jean-François Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault.|$|E
40|$|María Elena de Valdés does an {{analysis}} about {{an important part}} <b>of</b> the <b>postmodern</b> movement: the questioning of legitimizing authority with a concomitant surge in writing from the previously marginalized sectors <b>of</b> society. In <b>postmodern</b> literature the writing is {{an exploration of the}} implicit, the testing of authority and the accepted and, finally, the cultivation of the creative metaphor as a paradigm for creation out <b>of</b> conflict. <b>Postmodern</b> art in all its manifestations is always pointing out difference, differences within any grouping, differences made visible by positioning of the singular in relation to the others...|$|R

25|$|The rise <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> architecture, {{with its}} {{interest}} {{in history and}} place, has seen the occasional reintegration of Gothic Revival styles. One example is Massey College at the University of Toronto. Its materials and the elements of its design are fully modern; however, the form and arrangement of those materials directly quotes from the Gothic Revival structures on campus. Another is the Windsor Arms Hotel, also in Toronto. It is a modern Gothic styled skyscraper built {{on the base of}} an older Gothic Revival structure {{from the start of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the federal}} {{government}} has stuck with modernist simplicity for its functional buildings, but has turned again to monumental architecture for projects of national significance. Most notable are the three museums that have been built in the national capital over the last three decades. The new homes of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, National Gallery of Canada, and the Canadian War Museum are unique examples <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> architecture. All cost vast amounts of money, but they have also met with international acclaim. They also have allowed the capital to become a showcase for buildings by three of Canada's most prominent architects: Moshe Safdie, Douglas Cardinal, and Raymond Moriyama.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} aestheticization of everyday life, {{the architecture of}} museums has taken on special significance since the 1980s. A striking number of exhibition structures have incorporated a vocabulary <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> and deconstructivist forms. In and around Basel, new buildings, additions or renovations have been constructed from designs by nationally and internationally renowned architects (Renzo Piano, Zaha Hadid, Frank O. Gehry, Wilfried and Katharina Steib, Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta) and celebrated as examples of avant-garde museum architecture. In other area museums, by contrast, the building fabric is old to very old, consisting of former residential and commercial buildings or monasteries and churches that have been converted for exhibition purposes.|$|E

25|$|Brooklyn (Kings County), on {{the western}} tip of Long Island, is the city's most populous borough. Brooklyn {{is known for its}} cultural, social, and ethnic diversity, an {{independent}} art scene, distinct neighborhoods, and a distinctive architectural heritage. Downtown Brooklyn is the largest central core neighborhood in the outer boroughs. The borough has a long beachfront shoreline including Coney Island, established in the 1870s as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country. Marine Park and Prospect Park are the two largest parks in Brooklyn. Since 2010, Brooklyn has evolved into a thriving hub of entrepreneurship and high technology startup firms, and <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> art and design.|$|E
25|$|The Dr. John Archer Library, {{the main}} library of the university, was opened in 1967, {{one of the}} {{original}} three buildings of the new campus (the others being the classroom and laboratory buildings), and named after Dr. John Archer in 1999. Further building has been substantially in accord with Yamasaki's vision, notwithstanding some controversy over the years as to the suitability of its austere style for the featureless Regina plain; by 1972 with the demolition of Yamasaki's 1955 Pruitt–Igoe housing project in St. Louis, Missouri—such demolition being considered by some to be the beginning <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> architecture—Yamasaki's modernist aesthetic was already somewhat passé in the view of many architects.|$|E
25|$|Many critics hold postmodern art {{emerges from}} modern art. Suggested dates for {{the shift from}} modern to postmodern include 1914 in Europe, and 1962 or 1968 in America. James Elkins, commenting on discussions about the exact date of the {{transition}} from modernism to postmodernism, compares it to the discussion in the 1960s about the exact span of Mannerism and whether it should begin directly after the High Renaissance or later in the century. He makes the point these debates go {{on all the time}} with respect to art movements and periods, {{which is not to say}} they are not important. The close of the period <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> art has been dated to the end of the 1980s, when the word postmodernism lost much of its critical resonance, and art practices began to address the impact of globalization and new media.|$|E

25|$|The first {{dialogue}} between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference {{held at the}} University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor {{a relationship with the}} divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> cynicism and anomie. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.|$|E
25|$|One {{characteristic}} <b>of</b> <b>postmodern</b> art is its conflation of {{high and}} low culture through the use of industrial materials and pop culture imagery. The use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well, as documented in Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gopnik's 1990–91 show High and Low: Popular Culture and Modern Art at New York's Museum of Modern Art, an exhibition that was universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn. Postmodern art is noted for {{the way in which it}} blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art. Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era. Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general camp aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as Gothicism, the Renaissance and the Baroque, and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement. Such elements are common characteristics of what defines postmodern art.|$|E
