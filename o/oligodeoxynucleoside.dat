40|$|<b>Oligodeoxynucleoside</b> methylphosphonates were {{synthesized}} using methylphosphonamidite monomers {{incorporating the}} base labile tert-butylphenoxyacetyl (t-BPA) protecting {{group on the}} exocyclic amines of dA, dC, and dG. Synthesis of the <b>oligodeoxynucleoside</b> methylphosphonates required only a small change in oxidation solution from standard DNA synthesis. The increased lability of the t-BPA group over the standard benzoyl and isobutyryl protection permitted the use of milder basic deprotection conditions. Deprotection of the nucleoside bases and release from support was best accomplished by a short treatment with ammonia saturated methanol. This procedure resulted in minimal backgone degradation with no base modifications. Analysis of the resultant <b>oligodeoxynucleoside</b> methylphosphonates by reverse phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy are described...|$|E
40|$|Oligonucleotide analogues like <b>oligodeoxynucleoside</b> phospho-rothioates and phosphorodithioates (Fig. 1) are of {{interest}} for antisense applications (1). Efficient methods exist for the preparation of both analogues, but the products often contain less sulfur than intended, {{as shown by the}} presence of variable amounts of phosphate linkages in oligonucleoside phosphoro-thioates, and phosphorothioate linkages in oligonucleoside phos-phorodithioates. Incomplete oxidation by the sulfurization reagents used in phosphoramidite or thiophosphoramidite methods could explain the appearance of these impurities, but cannot explain why products prepared by triester methods are also often contaminated. We have recently described a dithiophosphortriester method that gives <b>oligodeoxynucleoside</b> phosphorodithioates free of phosphorothioate impurities (2). However, when the oligonu-cleoside phosphorodithioates were kept in prolonged contact wit...|$|E
40|$|Short <b>oligo(deoxynucleoside</b> phosphorothioate) s were {{analyzed}} as {{a pool of}} individual diastereomeric species. The composition of such mixtures, determined by means of HPLC, indicates that consecutive couplings in commonly used phosphoramidite chemistry lead to increasing contents of the Rp isomer. Methods of analysis and mathematical basis for diastereomeric composition are discussed. Data presented include all 16 possible combinations of nucleosides in dinucleotide phosphorothioates, as well as examples of trimers and tetramers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oligodeoxynucleosides</b> with internucleoside methylphosphonate {{linkages}} complementary to regions within U 3 {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 were evaluated {{for their ability to}} block phorbol myristate acetate upregulation of virus in chronically infected promonocytic and T-lymphoblastoid cell lines. One such oligomer, targeted to an NF-kappa B enhancer element, inhibited phorbol myristate acetate induction of viral replication and tat-mediated trans activation of the {{human immunodeficiency virus}} long terminal repeat. The effect of this construct is contrasted with classical antisense methylphosphonate-derivatized oligomers complementary to initiation codon and splice acceptor sites of human immunodeficiency virus structural and regulatory genes. Its activity suggests a novel application of the modified oligonucleotide strategy in the blockade of viral induction from latently infected cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bacterial DNA has immunostimulatory {{effects on}} {{different}} types of immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs). Application of DCs as a cellular adjuvant represents a promising approach in the immunotherapy of infectious disease and can-cers. Objectives: To investigate the effect of tumor antigen pulsed DCs in the pres-ence of CpG- 1826 in treatment of a murine model of cancer. Methods: WEHI- 164 cells (Balb/c derived fibrosarcoma cell line) were injected subcutaneously in the right flank of mice. Bone marrow {{cells were cultured in}} the presence of GM-CSF and IL- 4. After 5 days, tumor lysate, CpG- 1826, and <b>oligodeoxynucleosides,</b> as control, were added to the culture media and incubated for 2 days. Cytokine production in DCs culture media was measured by ELISA. Then DCs were injected subcutane-ously around the tumor site in the right flank of mice. Tumor growth rate was moni-tored in case and control groups. Two weeks after DCs immunotherapy, cytotoxic assay was conducted using various amounts of effector (splenic T cells) and target cells (WEHI- 164 or CT 26) for 6 h. Results: Immunotherapy with DCs treated with CpG led to {{a significant increase in the}} activity of cytotoxic T cells and decreased tumor growth in immunized mice. In the control group which received DCs without CpG treatment, no change in cytotoxic activity and tumor growth rate was detected. Conclusion: The current study suggests that specific anti tumor immune responses can be induced by DCs matured with CpG and proposes CpG usage in DCs targeted clinical strategies...|$|R
40|$|Syntheses of non ionic <b>oligodeoxynucleoside</b> phosphoramidates (P-NH 2) {{and mixed}} phosphoramidate- phosphodiester {{oligomers}} were accomplished on automated solid supported DNA synthesizer using both H-phosphonate and phosphoramidite chemistries, {{in combination with}} t-butylphenoxyacetyl for N-protection of nucleoside bases, an oxalyl anchored solid support and a final treatment with methanolic ammonia. Thermal stabilities of the hybrids formed between these new analogues and their DNA and RNA complementary strands were determined and {{compared with those of}} the corresponding unmodified oligonucleotides, {{as well as of the}} phosphorothioate and methylphosphonate derivatives. Dodecathymidines containing P-NH 2 links form less stable duplexes with DNA targets, d(C 2 A 12 C 2) (deltaTm/modification - 1. 4 degrees C) and poly dA (deltaTm/modification - 1. 1 degrees C) than the corresponding phosphodiester and methylphosphonate analogues, but the hybrids are slightly more stable than the one obtained with phosphorothioate derivative. The destabilization is more pronounced with poly rA as the target (deltaTm/modification - 3 degrees C) and could be compared with that found with the dodecathymidine methylphosphonate. The modification is less destabilizing in an heteropolymer-RNA duplex (deltaTm/modification - 2 degrees C). As expected, the P-NH 2 modifications are highly resistant towards the action of various nucleases. It is also demonstrated that an all P-NH 2 oligothymidine does not elicit Escherichia coli RNase H hydrolysis of the poly rA target but that the modification may be exploited in chimeric oligonucleotides combining P-NH 2 sections with a central phosphodiester section...|$|E
