25|$|As {{noted by}} Tinley (1969), typical {{habitats}} of Kirk's dik-dik consist of thicket mosaics characterized by well-developed shrub layers and scant short grass cover. Dik-diks live in pairs on territories of 2–86 acres, depending <b>on</b> <b>cover</b> and resources. If no unfavorable events occur {{a pair of}} Kirk's dik-dik may reside within the same territory for life. Males are the main defenders of territories, as females are unable to maintain territories themselves. (Kingdon 1982) According to MacDonald (1985), territorial conflicts over quality habitat are not frequent, however, when do they occur, males charge one another, stopping just short of physical contact, before repeating the process by running from a longer distance. Furthermore, the encounter ends when one male surrenders, which results in both males scratching at the ground, urinating, and defecating".|$|E
25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on single-line watermarked paper with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon switch over to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The actual quantity issued remains unknown. The earliest known use <b>on</b> <b>cover</b> is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class canceling machine at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of this issue for approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in mint condition, which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E

Robert Christgau believed the New York Dolls relied more <b>on</b> <b>cover</b> songs for the album because, [...] "like so many cocky songwriters, David Johansen overloaded his debut with originals and then found that record promotion wasn't a life activity that inspired new ones." [...] English writer Clinton Heylin said their inability to sell enough records before may have discouraged them from writing original songs.|$|E
