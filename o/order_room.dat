25|$|On 11 January 1819, ten new flourishments in the Ambassador’s Hall were {{executed}} by António Joaquim de Faria and the contractors Francisco de Paula, Severiano Henrique Pereira and Leandro Gomes. On 15 February, in the Sala dos Archeiros (Archer's Hall), the painters Vicente Paulo Rocha and João de Deus Moreira, painted the base boards, following {{the designs of}} Manuel Piolti (since José Francisco Ferreira quit the project). By May, Cyrillo proposed a new eastern façade, with a triangular apex and allegorical sculptures, alluding to the expulsion of the French during the Peninsular Wars. But, the project was abandoned. Between 1819 and 1920, sculptures of Justiça andPrudência were completed by João José de Aguiar; the ceilings of the Archer's Hall and Cane Concierge's Hall by José da Cunha Taborda (1766–1836) were completed, its doors first started by Manuel Piolti (1770–1823); the metal shields on the doors were provided by the Army arsenal; {{the ceiling of the}} Spanish Hall of Tapestry by Cyrillo Volkmar Machado, with perspectives by Manuel Piolti, figures by Joaquim Gregório da Silva Rato and ornamentation by André Monteiro da Cruz; base boards {{were executed}} by Pierre Philippe Thomire (1751–1843); the ceiling of the antechamber of the Sala do Despacho (<b>Order</b> <b>Room)</b> was completed by André Monteiro da Cruz and José da Cunha Taborda. In 1820, a new project for the south and eastern façades was authorized, which included a system of ramps and staircases created by António Francisco Rosa. Metalsmiths João Pereira and Manuel António, and carpenter José Joaquim de Sousa completed the project.|$|E

All they want is comfort, {{to live in the}} Sun King suite on the 22nd floor of the Palace and <b>order</b> <b>room</b> service. But before they know it, prostitution isn’t even paying the bills; one by one, they go into debt with their own bodies." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1943 Adams skipped {{school for}} a week {{in order to see}} Ellington play local gigs. He {{eventually}} met Rex Stewart, who further introduced him to Harry Carney and other band members. This led to Adams being able to take lessons from Skippy Williams, who was the tenor saxophonist in Ellington's band. Adams switched to the tenor saxophone in the fall of 1943 due to his jobs as a box cutter in the mail <b>order</b> <b>room</b> of a jazz store and an usher at a movie theater, which gave him enough money to buy the instrument. His job at the jazz store also allowed him to listen to all of the newest available jazz records [...] and led to his emulation of Coleman Hawkins, who he had heard play locally in 1945, and interest in the music of Don Byas. Adams' first steady gig came in 1946 with a six-piece group led by Ben Smith, which then caused him {{to drop out of school}} in the 11th grade due to working six nights a week.|$|E

5000|$|Adams {{first started}} working on the album in 2001, but {{switched}} his focus on the soundtrack album, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron which was scheduled for release in 2002. Adams had {{started working on}} the album in The Warehouse Studio, Canada, but {{he ran out of}} time because he was about to headline a tour in Europe. He, together with his associates, created a system and decided to do small overdubs while on tour, to see how it worked out. The idea of recording while on tour was mainly due to boredom on Adams' part. With his earlier releases Adams used, in his own words, to [...] "go kind of nuts, a bit stir crazy", so he began using his spare time on tour to write and record new songs. [...] "I tried {{to make use of the}} time which is generally spent doing nothing," [...] Adams said. He was able to gather enough equipment into a couple of suitcases to create a small studio for himself.

Adams believed it to be a better working environment, even when he and the crew moved the gear many times during a season, and they would normally get help from the local staff.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{results of}} electronic Raman-scattering experiments in differently doped single crystals of Y- 123 and Bi- 2212. The comparison of AF insulating and metallic samples suggests {{that at least}} the low-energy part of the spectra originates predominantly from excitations of free carriers. We therefore propose {{an analysis of the}} data in terms of a memory function approach. Dynamical scattering rates and mass-enhancement factors for the carriers are obtained. In B 2 g symmetry the Raman data compare well to the results obtained from ordinary and optical transport. For underdoped materials the dc scattering rates in B 1 g symmetry become temperature independent and considerably larger than in B 2 g symmetry. This increasing anisotropy is accompanied by a loss of spectral weight in B 2 g symmetry in the range between the superconducting transition at Tc and a characteristic temperature T* of <b>order</b> <b>room</b> temperature which compares well with the pseudogap temperature found in other experiments. The energy range affected by the pseudogap is doping and temperature independent. The integrated spectral loss is approximately 25 % in underdoped samples and becomes much weaker towards higher carrier concentration. In underdoped samples, superconductivity related features in the spectra can be observed only in B 2 g symmetry. The peak frequencies scale with Tc. We do not find a direct relation between the pseudogap and the superconducting gap. Comment: RevTeX, 21 pages, 24 gif figures. For PostScript with embedded eps figures, see [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} paper is entitled “The Influence of Reservation Section’s Services on Customer Satisfaction at Savoy Homann Bidakara Hotel”. In achieving customer satisfaction, a hotel should provide good services and making efforts {{to improving the}} quality of their service. Consideration of that reason the writer want to find how the hotel’s services by Reservation section. The writer choose Reservation section as one of Front Office Department in charge of processing the <b>order</b> <b>room</b> data and gives direct information about the hotel to the guest as an object of research. The prospective guests hotel usually have a less knowledge about the hotel they will choose to stay for a while and usually do some observation first via telephone or email as consider will use hotel or not before decide. In this research, the writer uses descriptive qualitative method to research open questioner and interview to guest and staffs of Savoy Homann Bidakara hotel especially Reservation staffs and Assistant manager Front Office Department. The goals of the research are finding the facts of the influence of service provided the hotel reservation toward the satisfaction of their customers in Savoy Homann Bidakara hotel. Reservations sections have a big role towards the satisfaction of hotel’s guests for example they have to serve all the guests room request and give them a good facilities from other hotel department. The hotel and Reservation staff section also has efforts to improving their services with provide regular training to their staffs and they also should improve their hospitality, information and communication in serving their guests. Reservations Section at Savoy Homann Bidakara Hotel received well by the guests.
