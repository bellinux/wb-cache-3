25|$|The Litauische Bau-Bataillonen is {{a poorly}} {{researched}} subject. Lithuanian researcher Rimantas Zizas {{was the first}} to publish a more comprehensive study of the battalions in 2000. The main obstacle to academic research is the lack <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources.</b> Lithuanian archives provide an incomplete picture as they mostly have documents on mobilization and formation of the battalions. Documents related to battalion activities are most likely spread among various Russian and German archives and await further examination. The contemporary press wrote quite extensively about the battalions, but those articles were vague to protect military secrets and with a clear bias, either pro- or anti-German. Post war documents, produced by various Soviet authorities, have a clear anti-German bias. Those are mostly KGB interrogation protocols of former battalion soldiers; the prisoners were often tortured to extract confessions. The Soviets were not interested in comprehensive histories and instead focused on battalions' engagements with Soviet partisans and repressions against civilians. Former soldiers did not produce extensive memoirs; Zizas identified only memoirs of Pranas Nagys as valuable.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Douglas Smith, Rasputin's {{youth and}} early adulthood are [...] "a black hole {{about which we}} know almost nothing," [...] though the lack <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources</b> and information did not stop others from fabricating stories about his parents and his youth after Rasputin's rise to fame. Historians agree, however, that like most Siberian peasants, including his mother and father, Rasputin was never formally educated, and he remained illiterate well into his early adulthood. Local archival records suggest {{that he had a}} somewhat unruly youth - possibly involving drinking, small thefts, and disrespect for local authorities - but contain no evidence of his being charged with stealing horses, blasphemy, or bearing false witness, all major crimes that he was later rumored to have committed as a young man.|$|E
2500|$|Śabda (शब्द), {{relying on}} word, {{testimony}} of {{past or present}} reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains Sabda-pramana as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn {{only a fraction of}} those facts and truths directly. [...] He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through Sabda (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the Sabda <b>of</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>sources.</b> The disagreement between Advaita and other schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability.|$|E

Unfortunately, the judge in the case never revealed the terms of the injunction. In a statement Catherine Murphy said: “I am a public representative.

In the High Court the following Tuesday (June 2, 2015), Mr Justice Donald Binchy stated that it was [...] "never intended nor could it have been intended that any order of this court would impact upon entitlements of deputies to speak as they see fit or the entitlement of the media to report on those utterances", but added that it was [...] "entirely understandable" [...] that RTÉ had sought court clarification on this.|$|E
