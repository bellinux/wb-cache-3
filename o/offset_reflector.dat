40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the focal plane field distribution of an <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna. A physical-optics model is developed to calculate the near-field data at the focal plane. A 70 cm <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna comparable to a standard satellite TV set has been our study case. As a starting point in our design process, we have investigated the optimal size of the focal plane array (FPA) for <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> antennas and achievable scan ranges.

40|$|In {{this report}} the {{performance}} of the hard horn antennas in a cluster-fed <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> system operating in the Ka-band (20 - 30 GHz) is analyzed. The analysis is done with a program that uses aperture integration to find the far-field of the antenna system. The results for different positions of the feed antenna in the <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> system are compared with results obtained for a rotationally symmetric antenna with the same diameter and a focused feed (BOR 1 approximation). The results show a good agreement for the focused feeds and some differences as the feed is displaced from the focal point. Several improvements of the reflector design are proposed and analyzed. It is concluded that the BOR 1 approximation is a powerful tool when designing a cluster-fed <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> system. Especially in the initial stage it gives the possibility to test a large number of different reflector designs. However, there are also degradation in the co- and crosspolar isolation for off-focus feeds that can only be studied by locating the feed in its real off-focus position in the actual <b>offset</b> <b>reflector.</b> Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

The modified <b>offset</b> parabolic <b>reflector</b> antenna, {{combined with an}} array of flat aluminum plates at the bottom, is fed through symmetric/asymmetric H-plane feed horn antennas. An effective measured pencil-beam/fan-beam switching performance has been achieved as a result of setting the flares of the H-plane feed horn antenna symmetrically and asymmetrically, without making any changes in the geometry of the <b>offset</b> parabolic <b>reflector</b> antenna...|$|R

Some unique geometrical {{features of the}} reflector rim constructed from {{the intersection of the}} reflector surface and a cone or cylinder are explored in detail. It is found that the intersection curve (rim) of the rotationally generated conic-section reflector surface and a circular cone with its tip at the focal point is always a planar curve and has a circular projection on the focal plane only for the <b>offset</b> parabolic <b>reflector.</b> Furthermore, in this case, the line going {{through the center of the}} circle, parallel to the focal axis, and the central axis of the cone do not intersect the reflector surface at the same point.

40|$|Analysis are {{presented}} {{for the current}} distribution {{and its effects on}} the radiated fields from any portion of the parabolic reflector, using a generalized feed source. The feed is formed of co-polarized electric and magnetic sources, with a given directivity towards the reflector surface. The mixture ratio between the electric and magnetic sources is examined with a view to minimize the cross-polarized radia-tion. This ratio is dependent on the reflector configuration. While {{it is well known that}} cross-polarized cur-rents vanish when the electric and magnetic moments of the feed are equal in symmetric reflectors, no comprehensive analyses are available for offset configurations. Therefore, in this work generalized rigor-ous analyses are given to specially accommodate <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors,</b> which are widely used in modem tele-communication systems. Cross-polarized currents of <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors</b> could only be minimized. Feed pointing would be lower than the reflector center (mid way between this center and the vertex). Also, the feed source should be predominantly electric for vertical polarization and predominantly magnetic for horizontal polarization. Illustrations based on computer simulation {{are presented}} to give quantitative perspective for these results...|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the offset {{geometry}} for dual reflector antennas is attractive for satellite communications where low side lobes are necessary to achieve good isolation between adjacent main lobes operating over the same frequency band. A description is presented of a new, numerically rigorous technique for synthesizing dual <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors.</b> The objective of the synthesis procedure is to transform a given primary feed pattern into a desired aperture distribution through two reflections in an <b>offset</b> dual <b>reflector</b> system. It is found that a given specification for the aperture distribution does not always lead to a smooth solution for the two surfaces. In this event, the so-called energy condition on the specified amplitude distribution is relaxed, and an approximate solution which satisfies the energy condition only within a certain numerical tolerance is derived...|$|R
40|$|Although many {{reflector}} antennas possess circular projected apertures, {{there are}} recent satellite and ground antenna applications {{for which it}} is desirable to employ reflectors with elliptical apertures. Here a modification of the Jacobi-Bessel expansion is presented for the diffraction analysis of reflectors with elliptical apertures. A comparative study is also performed between this modified Jacobi-Bessel algorithm and the one which uses the Jacobi-Bessel expansion over a circumscribing circular region. Numerical results are presented for <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors</b> with elliptical and circular apertures and the improved convergence properties of the modified algorithm are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{simulated}} {{and analytical}} results for 3. 8 m symmetric and <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> geometries using a wideband feed and concludes {{that a significant}} improvement in performance can be obtained using the offset geometry. These performance improvements are a reduction of spillover noise from 28 K to 16 K, and an improvement in the sensitivity figure of merit (A_(eff) /T_(sys)) from 0. 07 to 0. 09 m^ 2 /K. Further performance improvement in offset design were achieved using a ground shield, which reduced the spillover noise to 11 K, and adding a dielectric rod within the wideband feed, which illuminated the antenna to improve sensitivity figure of merit from 0. 09 to 0. 12 m^ 2 /K The use of a mesh material for the <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> surface was also investigated. Using these optimizations, arrays of small offset reflectors {{can be used in}} future radio astronomy...|$|E
40|$|Parabolic {{symmetric}} and <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> antennas adaptively illuminated using a novel triple-mode feedhorn (TE 11 +TM 01 +TE 21) {{with different}} mode combinations and impedance and radiation performances are presented. The {{combination of the}} radiating modes in a feedhorn with proper amplitude and fixed phase values helps in electronically pointing the main beam of the radiating patterns such as that obtained in a beam-steering antenna with limited beam-scan range. This type of radiation performance virtually creates a displaced phase center location for the feedhorn, which, consequently, adaptively illuminates the reflector antenna surface. Impedance-matching bandwidths are preserved for both reflector antennas similar {{to the case of}} feedhorn alone. The copolarization gain and peak cross-polarization levels are far better with the <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna than the symmetric reflector antenna. Such reflector antennas find applications in ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and space based radars. The investigation results are solely computed using FEKO full-wave analysis tool...|$|E

All three give operating bands near 22 GHz and 32 GHz. The peak linear crosspolar levels of the diplexer alone and in the <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> are discussed, together with the copolar sidelobe performance of the complete antenna...|$|E
30|$|A well-designed {{reflector}} {{surface with}} high beam pointing accuracy in electromagnetic performance is of practical {{significance to the}} space application of cable mesh reflector antennas. As for space requirements, circular polarizations are widely used in spaceborne antennas, which usually lead to a beam shift for <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors</b> and influence the beam pointing accuracy. A two-step structural design procedure is proposed to overcome the beam squint phenomenon for high beam pointing accuracy design of circularly polarized <b>offset</b> cable mesh <b>reflectors.</b> A simple structural optimal design and an integrated structural electromagnetic optimization are combined to alleviate the beam squint effect of circular polarizations. It is implemented by cable pretension design and adjustment to shape the offset cable mesh surface. Besides, {{in order to increase}} the efficiency of integrated optimization, an update Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) Hessian matrix is employed in the optimization iteration with sequential quadratic programming. A circularly polarized <b>offset</b> cable mesh <b>reflector</b> is utilized to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed procedure. A high beam pointing accuracy in order of 0.0001 º of electromagnetic performance is achieved.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A 12. 2 to 12. 7 GHz {{integrated}} twin feed horn for a 60 -cm reflector antenna {{structure has}} been designed and fabricated. The two horns utilized are corrugated and laterally defocused to produce dual beams.

40|$|The {{secondary}} pattern of a perfectly conducting <b>offset</b> main <b>reflector</b> being illuminated by a point feed at an arbitrary location is studied. The {{method of analysis}} {{is based upon the}} application of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the aperture fields obtained using geometrical optics (GO) and geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). Key features of the present work are (1) the reflector surface is completely arbitrary, (2) the incident field from the feed is most general with arbitrary polarization and location, and (3) the edge diffraction is calculated by either UAT or by UTD. Comparison of this technique for an <b>offset</b> parabolic <b>reflector</b> with the Jacobi-Bessel and Fourier-Bessel techniques shows good agreement.

40|$|We {{have used}} crosscorrelation, semblance, and eigenstructure {{algorithms}} to estimate coherency. The first two algorithms calculate coherency over {{a multiplicity of}} trial time lags or dips, with the dip having the highest coherency corresponding to the local dip of the reflector. Partially because of its greater computational cost, our original eigenstructure algorithm calculated coherency along an implicitly flat horizon. Although generalizing the eigenstructure algorithm to search over a range of test dips allowed us to image coherency {{in the presence of}} steeply dipping structures, we were somewhat surprised that this generalization concomitantly degenerated the quality of the fault images in flatter dip areas. Because it is a local estimation of reflector dip (including as few as five traces), the multidip coherency estimate provides an algorithmically correct, but interpretationally undesirable, estimate of the best apparent dip that explained the <b>offset</b> <b>reflectors</b> [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Antenna {{characterisation}} and radar {{cross section}} measurements can be conveniently and successfully carried out {{by means of a}} compact antenna test range (CATR), whose performance is primarily assessed in terms of quiet zone size and field uniformity. CATR characterisation and diagnostics are usually performed by means of (amplitude and phase) field measurements in the quiet zone and are of timely interest either on CATR installation or on its periodic reassessments performed by manufacturers and/or users. This paper addresses CATR characterisation from amplitude-only data, an attractive topic because of the application of CATRs to the millimetre or sub-millimetre wave ranges. The approach is based on an appropriate strategy retrieving the missing quiet zone phase and facing the issue of the large electrical dimensions of the CATR. To take into account the characteristics of the collimating system as well as to keep as low as possible the number of unknowns to be sought for, it exploits the Jacobi-Bessel expansion of the aperture field. The performance of the algorithm has been tested through a wide numerical analysis against synthetic data generated by GRASP 8 -SE whose full version is routinely employed for CATR design. The main results related to a Gregorian dual <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> CATR, modelled on that proposed in the literature by Pistorius et ah, and to a single <b>offset</b> <b>reflector</b> CATR, inspired by the one available at the Queen Mary & Westfield College, London (UK), are reported...|$|E
