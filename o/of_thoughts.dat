5|$|Although much <b>of</b> <b>Thoughts</b> {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), such as her poignant description of the suffering single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
5|$|Kochanowski {{was born}} in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the {{universities}} of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled {{in the village of}} Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> and feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written {{after the death of his}} young daughter.|$|E
5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language Instinct was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{standard}} {{approach to the}} core phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> insertion characterizes {{it in terms of}} a normal sense <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> ownership coupled with an abnormal sense <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> agency. Recently, Fernández (2010) has argued that there are crucial problems with this approach and has proposed instead that what goes wrong fundamentally in such a phenomenology is a sense <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> commitment, characterized in terms <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> endorsement. In this paper, we argue that, even though Fernández raises new issues that enrich the topic, his proposal cannot rival th...|$|R

5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{special schools}} in Singapore, which place little {{emphasis}} on academics, Pathlight School {{uses the same}} academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools. The sole exception is that mother tongue lessons are replaced with classes covering social and life skills. The school accommodates {{the needs of students}} with smaller class sizes, staff trained to handle autistic children, more visual teaching methods, more predictable environments and individual education plans for each student. Satellite classes and special events give students regular opportunities to interact with neurotypical (non-autistic) peers from mainstream schools; exceptional students are allowed to attend classes with mainstream students for some subjects. To prepare students for employment, Pathlight School runs computing courses, a design studio and a cafe staffed by students. The school also produces book compilations <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> written by students, conducts exhibitions of student artwork and sells merchandise made by students, to help students develop useful skills, raise funds for the school and raise awareness of autism. In addition, Pathlight School has hosted autism events such as the WeCAN Learning Congress 2010, where over 20 international experts shared their best practices in autism care with about 560 delegates.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{there are}} two {{different}} schools <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> on CVC research. One school <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> is Creole Exceptionalism, which regards creole languages as a socially inferior dialect or degenerate language. Another school <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> however is referred to as Crioulidade, which celebrates Cape Verde's unique heritage, consequently referring to the language not in terms of its African or Portuguese heritage, but rather as its own unique hybrid of the two that has its own history and cultural significance. Proponents of this school <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> argue that the processes of miscegenation and creolization were positive, rather than negative as the Exceptionalism school <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> suggests.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{argue for a}} novel theory of {{representational}} content, which I call ‘subjective externalism’. The view combines an internal, subjective constraint on the attribution <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> content which traditionally underpins internalist theories <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> and an external, objective constraint on the attribution <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> content which traditionally underpins externalist theories <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> While internalism and externalism are mutually inconsistent, the constraints to which each theory is committed are not. It is this realization that opens up the conceptual space for subjective externalism, according to which the correct attribution <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> content to an individual is essentially constrained by her nonrepresentational relations to objective manifest properties in her wider reality...|$|R
