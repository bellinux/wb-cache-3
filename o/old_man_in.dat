5|$|Convinced that Shogun is {{targeting}} him, {{he tries}} {{to distance himself from}} having witnessed the murder scene and avoid getting involved in New Gen, which draws the attention of the police. Between him being suspected, more New Gen murders occurring, and Shogun supposedly targeting him, Takumi finds himself experiencing hallucinations and paranoia, and is unsure of what is real and who he can trust. In one of his delusions, Shogun appears as an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> a wheelchair and tells him that more people will die unless he wakes up.|$|E
5|$|Irish actor Wilfrid Brambell, {{who played}} Paul McCartney's fictional {{grandfather}} John McCartney, was already well-known to British audiences as co-star of the British sitcom Steptoe and Son. The recurring joke {{that he was}} so clean reflects a play on his sitcom role, where he was always referred to as a dirty <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> other roles, Norman Rossington played the Beatles' manager Norm, John Junkin played the group's road manager Shake, and Victor Spinetti played the television director. Brian Epstein, the group's real manager, had an uncredited bit part.|$|E
5|$|When Catherine {{finds her}} {{colleague}} dead, she flees {{from the company}} premises and finds her husband, who has deduced that her job offer was simply a way for Odessa to reach him. Elsewhere, an Odessa agent murders the <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> Frank's home; the loss serves to reunite Watts, Means and Black, who contrive a plan to strike back at Odessa. As the Elder conducts a funeral for the Old Man, a carbomb kills his assassin, while Odessa's Paraguayan headquarters is destroyed and Knight's company is raided and closed. The Elder finishes his rites and returns home, opening a package delivered from the Middle East; inside is the fragment of the True Cross.|$|E

5|$|When {{war broke}} out in Europe in 1939, Learned Hand adopted an anti-isolationist stance. He rarely spoke out publicly, {{not only because of}} his {{position}} but because he thought bellicosity unseemly in an <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> February 1939, he became his court's senior circuit leader (in effect, chief judge, although the title was not created until 1948). In this post, Hand succeeded Martin Manton, who had resigned after corruption allegations that later led to Manton's criminal conviction for bribery. Not an admirer of Manton, Hand nonetheless testified at his trial that he had never noticed any corrupt behavior in his predecessor. Having sat in two cases in which Manton accepted bribes, Hand worried for years afterward that he should have detected his colleague's corruption.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains {{that she had been}} {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} surrounding his origins, {{it is possible}} that Fergus was of Norse-Gaelic and native Gallovdian ancestry. Traditionally, the Gallovidians appear to have looked towards the Isles instead of Scotland, and the core of his family's lands seems to have centred in valley of the river Dee and the coastal area around Whithorn, regions of substantial Scandinavian settlement. Whatever the case, the fact that Fergus died as an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> 1161 suggests that he was born before 1100.|$|E
25|$|Although he was {{probably}} an <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>in</b> AD 403 Rumoridus was made consul posterior in the West alongside the infant Theodosius II in the East.

His consulship is recorded in several inscriptions, with considerable variety in the spelling of his name.|$|E
25|$|Coca-Cola's {{advertising}} {{has significantly}} affected American culture, {{and it is}} frequently credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> a red-and-white suit. Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by Haddon Sundblom, the motif was already common. Coca-Cola was not even the first soft drink company to use the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising: White Rock Beverages used Santa in advertisements for its ginger ale in 1923, after first using him to sell mineral water in 1915. Before Santa Claus, Coca-Cola relied on images of smartly dressed young women to sell its beverages. Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress Hilda Clark as its spokeswoman.|$|E

In the tale, three brothers outwit Death by magicing a bridge to cross a dangerous river. Death, angry at being cheated, offers to give them three gifts, the Deathly Hallows, {{as a reward for}} evading him. The first two die {{as a result of the}} gifts granted to them, but the third uses his gift wisely and dies in his bed an <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> The Pardoner's Tale, three rogues are told that if they look under a tree, they can find a means to defeat Death.
