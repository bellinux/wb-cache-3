Majida {{said during a}} press conference that the event is evidence that humanity can unite for good and to make peoples lives better anywhere in the world. She also thanked the organizers and hoped peace will spread all over the Arab world. The charity event was held under the patronage of H.H. Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, who described the festival as one that “celebrates human connections, international dialogue and {{strong support for the}} less fortunate <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> global citizens – values that are fundamental to our collective vision for the United Arab Emirates”. The festival took place at Emirates Palace and expected to raise millions for underprivileged children across the globe. The Minister toured with Majida various booths of participating countries and they attended performances for each country including Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, they informed the media to cover their civil rights resolution.|$|E
60|$|Mr Sparkler {{considered}} it a parallel case to that <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> in the West Indies with Yellow Jack. Mrs Sparkler closed her eyes again, and refused to have any consciousness <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> <b>of</b> the West Indies, or of Yellow Jack.|$|R

500|$|Amin was {{informed}} of the Soviet decision to intervene in Afghanistan and was initially supportive, but was assassinated. Under the command of the Soviets, Karmal ascended to power. On 27 December 1979 Radio Kabul broadcast Karmal's pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people, saying: [...] "Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed, his accomplices – the primitive executioners, usurpers and murderers of tens of thousand <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> countrymen – fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters, children and old people..." [...] Karmal was not in Kabul when the speech was broadcast; he was in Bagram, protected by the KGB.|$|E
500|$|On 28 October 2015, the Ministry of Defence banned a {{large number}} of serving {{soldiers}} from attending a rally in support of Sergeant Blackman, saying that the event was a [...] "political protest". However, lawyers representing the rally organisers stated that was not the case, rather, the event was [...] "a show of support to one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> Royal Marines and not a 'political protest. A related online government petition raised over 100,000 signatures calling for Sergeant Blackman's immediate release stating that the soldier had been condemned for defending his country. Within hours of the MoD's decision Michael Fallon, Minister for Defence, put out a government statement saying that the UK would maintain military operations in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future.|$|E
500|$|The sensationalism in {{the press}} that started before the trial {{continued}} throughout the trial, the appeals process, the commutation decision, and beyond. At the time, local papers were the dominant source of information, {{but they were not}} entirely anti-Frank. The Constitution alone assumed Frank's guilt, while both the Georgian and the Journal would later comment about the public hysteria in Atlanta during the trial, each suggesting the need to reexamine the evidence against the defendant. [...] On March 14, 1914, while the extraordinary motion hearing was pending, the Journal called for a new trial, saying that to execute Frank based on the atmosphere both within and outside the courtroom would [...] "amount to judicial murder." [...] Other newspapers in the state followed suit and many ministers spoke from the pulpit supporting a new trial. L. O. Bricker, the pastor of the church attended by Phagan's family, said that based on [...] "the awful tension of public feeling, it was next to impossible for a jury <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> human beings to have granted him a fair, fearless and impartial trial." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{heard that}} you had been at several of the runs, {{and of course you}} are in with some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows.</b> How did you get to know about the {{entrance}} to this place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite clearly," [...] replied Harold, smiling, [...] "because some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> can't take an aim at all, {{much less}} a good one, so they'd be as likely to shoot us as them." ...|$|R
500|$|Other nationalists {{had high}} hopes for the German {{unification}} movement, and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back. Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress. As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865, [...] "The progress of humanity seems to {{have come to a}} halt, and you with your superior intelligence will know why. The reason is that the world lacks a nation [...] possesses true leadership. Such leadership, of course, is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty, to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed." [...] Garibaldi looked to Germany for the [...] "kind of leadership , in the true tradition of medieval chivalry, would devote itself to redressing wrongs, supporting the weak, sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> men. We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction. It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not all {{interpretations of}} global {{citizenship}} are positive. For example, Parekh advocates {{what he calls}} globally oriented citizenship, and states, [...] "If global citizenship means being {{a citizen of the}} world, it is neither practicable nor desirable." [...] He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community. He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be [...] "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland." [...] Parekh presents his alternate option with the statement: [...] "Since the conditions of life <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen." [...] Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{they went}} on, and I heard 'em being {{attended}} to by some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows.</b> They didn't {{know what they}} were doing, or they couldn't have missed me sitting, the way they did.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See, Chris, {{there are}} some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> {{creeping}} along {{by the side of}} the river. They must be hidden from the sight of the Boers. I expect they will be the first to begin." ...|$|R

2500|$|Baudelaire {{was educated}} in Lyon, where he boarded. At {{fourteen}} he {{was described by}} a classmate as [...] "much more refined and distinguished than any <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> pupils [...] we are bound to one another [...] by shared tastes and sympathies, the precocious love of fine works of literature." [...] Baudelaire was erratic in his studies, at times diligent, at other times prone to [...] "idleness". Later, he attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, studying law, a popular course for those not yet decided on any particular career. He began to frequent prostitutes and may have contracted gonorrhea and syphilis during this period. He also began to run up debts, mostly for clothes. Upon gaining his degree in 1839, he told his brother [...] "I don't feel I have a vocation for anything." [...] His stepfather had in mind a career in law or diplomacy, but instead Baudelaire decided to embark upon a literary career. His mother later recalled: [...] "Oh, what grief! If Charles had let himself be guided by his stepfather, his career {{would have been very}} different.... He would not have left a name in literature, it is true, but we should have been happier, all three of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|By way of {{contrast}} to Hobbes's multiplicity of laws, Cumberland {{states in the}} very first sentence of his Treatise of the Laws of Nature that [...] "all the Laws of Nature are reduc'd to that one, of Benevolence toward all Rationals." [...] He later clarifies: [...] "By the name Rationals I beg leave to understand, as well God as Man; and I do it upon the Authority of Cicero." [...] Cumberland argues that the mature development ("perfection") of human nature involves the individual human willing and acting for the common good. For Cumberland, human interdependence precludes Hobbes's natural right of each individual to wage war against all the rest for personal survival. However, Haakonssen warns against reading Cumberland as a proponent of [...] "enlightened self-interest." [...] Rather, the [...] "proper moral love of humanity" [...] is [...] "a disinterested love of God through love of humanity in ourselves as well as others." [...] Cumberland concludes that actions [...] "principally conducive to our Happiness" [...] are those that promote [...] "the Honour and Glory of God" [...] and also [...] "Charity and Justice towards men." [...] Cumberland emphasizes that desiring the well-being <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> humans is essential to the [...] "pursuit of our own Happiness." [...] He cites [...] "reason" [...] as the authority for his conclusion that happiness consists in [...] "the most extensive Benevolence," [...] but he also mentions as [...] "Essential Ingredients of Happiness" [...] the [...] "Benevolent Affections," [...] meaning [...] "Love and Benevolence towards others," [...] as well as [...] "that Joy, which arises from their Happiness." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jock. [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> {{has been}} on a moor not far from where she was {{astonishing}} the natives, conjointly with Lady Anne Macnalty. There were bets which of three men she may be engaged to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A flock <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> {{are going}} to drive over by-and-by, and I'll be hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down before her table afterward," [...] said Laurie, espousing her cause with warmth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} supply is sufficient," [...] said Ben, [...] "so don't run any chances. If {{you think that}} is an enemy give him a shot. But don't hit one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> by mistake," [...] he added, by way of caution.|$|R
60|$|In this {{arrangement}} we rested, {{and as we}} walked back to camp I cared nothing for the sly words or glances <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> artists. I believed I had won my case.|$|E

6000|$|... "You see," [...] he explained, [...] "I know {{beforehand}} {{that you}} are speaking the truth as you see it. I know beforehand that any scheme in which you are engaged is for the benefit <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> creatures and not for their harm. But alas! you make yourself the judge of these things, {{and there are times}} when individual effort is the most dangerous thing in life." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{will you}} come to our quarters?" [...] one of them said. [...] "We have got some decent wine, and some really good cigars which came up from Lisbon last week, {{and there are lots}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> who will be glad to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; I did a {{good deal}} of fishing round Athlone, and was taught to tie my own flies. I wish I had a packet of hooks--the two one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> made for me are well enough for worms, but they are rather clumsy for flies." ...|$|R
60|$|Mitchell {{cleared the}} ravine by {{a hundred and}} twenty yards. He strolled back to me, and watched Alexander go through his ritual with an indulgent smile. I knew just how he was feeling. Never does the world seem so sweet and fair and the foibles <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> human beings so little irritating as when we have just swatted the pill right on the spot.|$|E
6000|$|... "We were amazed, sir--Your Highness," [...] said Mr. Pugh. [...] "We could not--we cannot--understand it. The entire {{thing is}} a {{baffling}} mystery to us. We asked the soldiers at the door. They referred us to Mr. Scobell. We asked Mr. Scobell. He referred us to you. And now we have come, as the representatives <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> visitors to this island, to ask Your Highness what it means!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's true!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "It's {{the word}} of God! It's for us to stop the war. If we stop it to-night instead of to-morrow, a {{thousand}} lives may be saved, human lives, lives <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellow</b> creatures. Our fellow labourers in Germany have given us the chance. Don't let us delay five minutes. Let the one of us you may select see the Prime Minister to-night and deliver the people's message." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you mustn't {{be alarmed}} if some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>fellows</b> seem downcast," [...] Mr. Harriwell said, having drawn him aside in confidence.
