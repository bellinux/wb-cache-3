At the time, {{he was known as}} the oldest living World War I veteran, as Emiliano Mercado del Toro had not yet been discovered. He was interviewed by Treehouse Productions in 2006 as part of their Living History Project, a radio tribute to the last surviving World War I veterans that was hosted by Walter Cronkite.

The compiler and 9th-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar. The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.|$|E

When her parents and maternal grandmother Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna heard the rumours about Felix, they wanted to call off the wedding. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> they heard had originated from Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Irina's first cousin once removed, who {{had been one of}} Felix's friends and, it has been speculated, might have been involved in a romantic relationship with Felix. Dmitri told Felix he was also interested in marrying Irina, but Irina said she preferred Felix. Felix was able to persuade Irina's reluctant family to relent and allow the ceremony to go forward.|$|E
25|$|Bella annoys Edward with {{questions}} about how he saved her life. She hears that Edward {{and his family are}} vampires who drink animal blood. She is told legends of the local Quilyeute people by a friend Jacob Black who she met during a camp out. Disturbed by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. To her dismay, she then realizes that Edward hadn't come to school on the blood typing day because he is a vampire; she compares the characteristics of the vampires in mythology to the Cullens, and finds many similarities. Convinced he's a vampire, she finds herself in the state of bewilderment. Bella is saved by Edward again in Port Angeles when she is almost attacked. Driving a silver Volvo, Edward takes Bella to dinner and home. As they drive, she tells him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> he is a vampire. Edward says he tried to stay away, finding her scent too desirable. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love.|$|E

The {{historian}} Julia Barrow has determined that at least 25 of the 155charters in the Liber are forged, but cautions {{that this is the}} minimum estimate. Barrow identifies more than 30 of the charters in Hemming's work as forgeries, including some that are duplicates from the Liber.

Colfer has {{credited}} his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together, and O'Malley has said the same about working with Colfer. Burt loves Kurt, and openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, [...] "Preggers". Murphy took the scene verbatim from his own experience of coming out to his father. He called the father-son relationship [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> we really love on the show", and one that is [...] "very personal" [...] to him, as he wishes his own father had acted more like Burt. During the first season, Kurt has cause to wonder whether his father truly accepts him. Colfer offered the insight that his character is [...] "more concerned with being OK in his dad's eyes than with anyone else", and said that the bond between them would continue to strengthen as the series progressed. From O'Malley's point of view, [...] "There's a lot at stake in their relationship and [...] trying to show other people how it can be, in a positive way. I'm not saying hey, let's go to Greenwich Village and be in the parade. This is very very difficult, but he loves his son." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur}} of the moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath is a novella by H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937).

It is both the longest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> make up his Dream Cycle and the longest Lovecraft work to feature protagonist Randolph Carter. Along with his 1927 novel The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, it can be considered one of the significant achievements of that period of Lovecraft's writing. The Dream-Quest combines elements of horror and fantasy into an epic tale that illustrates the scope and wonder of humankind's ability to dream.|$|E

The U.S. House Judiciary Committee devoted three hearings to the issue of sport-related brain injuries, repeatedly citing Schwarz's work during them.

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to the series has been mixed. Commenting on The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens, P.

[...] Of the setting, he observed that it allowed [...] "ample room for swashbuckling, skullduggery and horseplay, in which de Camp deals deftly from time to time," [...] but noted that [...] "ut of this setting, on the other hand, has come just one really memorable book--'Rogue Queen.'" ...|$|E
