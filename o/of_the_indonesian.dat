Instead, Beale deployed his platoon into two positions, one covering the track with two Brens in order to secure it from <b>the</b> <b>Indonesians</b> in <b>the</b> re-entrant, as well as another position on a bend in the river. Only the sentry on the right-hand flank, Private Lawrence Jackson, could see around the bend, which narrowed to just [...] at that point.|$|R
