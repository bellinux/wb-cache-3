5|$|Before Gardner's election, on May 24, 1854, Anthony Burns {{was arrested}} in Boston as a {{fugitive}} under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Edward G. Loring, a Suffolk County probate judge who also served as U.S. commissioner of the Circuit Court in Massachusetts, ordered that Burns be forced back into slavery in Virginia, outraging abolitionists and the increasingly antislavery public in Massachusetts. Under the pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison, the legislature passed two Bills <b>of</b> <b>Address,</b> in 1855 and 1856, calling for Judge Loring {{to be removed from}} his state office, but in both cases Gardner declined to remove Loring. A third Bill <b>of</b> <b>Address</b> to remove Loring from office was later approved by Gardner's Republican successor, Nathaniel Prentice Banks.|$|E

5|$|Her name {{given at}} birth was Yalurrngali: Peggy Rockman was a name {{subsequently}} {{given to her}} by white administrators. 'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and {{may be associated with}} particular totems. Although they may be used as terms <b>of</b> <b>address,</b> they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus 'Peggy Rockman' is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.|$|E
