5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by readers that include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only <b>one</b> <b>question</b> in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E

Various celebrities also made special guest appearances {{at the end of}} every episode; each guest played <b>one</b> <b>question</b> for a chance at $50,000 for a charity of their choice, being allowed to use any one of the four lifelines in place at the time (Phone-a-Friend, Ask the Audience, Double Dip, and Ask the Expert), but still earned a minimum of $25,000 for the charity if they answered the question incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>question</b> of {{constitutional}} interpretation that was highlighted during the parliamentary debates pertained {{to the former}} Article 22H which had been incorrectly inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1991 in January 1991. Article 22H(1) provided that the President might, acting in his discretion, withhold his assent to any bill passed by Parliament (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applied) if the bill provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. At that time, Article 5(2A), which entrenched certain core constitutional provisions (of which Article 22H(1) was one) by requiring {{the approval of the}} electorate at a national referendum for their amendment, had not been brought into force.|$|E

It was conducted under the Military Service Referendum Act 1916.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>question</b> arising {{early in}} the story is why God rejects Cain's sacrifice, since Cain never {{received}} instructions about how to sacrifice correctly, nor had he done anything wrong, and why God then admonishes Cain with a warning about sin.

25|$|One {{challenge}} studying sleep {{evolution is}} that adequate sleep information is known only for two phyla of animals- chordata and arthropoda. With the available data, comparative {{studies have been}} used to determine how sleep might have evolved. <b>One</b> <b>question</b> that scientists try to answer through these studies is whether sleep evolved only once or multiple times. To understand this, they look at sleep patterns in different classes of animals whose evolutionary histories are fairly well-known and study their similarities and differences.|$|E
25|$|The Introduction in {{the book}} {{provides}} a history of parliamentary procedure and includes the background and history of Robert's Rules of Order.

Some fundamental principles upon which the book is based include: <b>one</b> <b>question</b> at a time; one person, one vote; and a vote being limited to members present.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>question</b> {{we might}} ask is whether, {{if we had}} chosen a {{different}} free ultrafilter V, the quotient field A/U would be isomorphic as an ordered field to A/V.

25|$|In {{the second}} round, the contestants {{attempted}} {{to match the}} celebrities whom they had not matched in the first round. On the CBS version, the challenger always began the second round (unless that contestant had matched all six stars; in this situation, the champion selected from the two questions available). This meant that a champion who had only answered <b>one</b> <b>question</b> could be ahead of a challenger who had played both questions, rendering the final question moot. On the syndicated versions, the leader after a round played first in the next round. In case of a tie score, the contestant who had not selected their own question in the previous round made the selection in the tie-breaker round.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that different scholars frequently have different opinions regarding any given question. This is why there is usually more than one fatwa regarding any <b>one</b> <b>question.</b> In fact, {{there are a number of}} methodologies for how to understand evidence gathered from the previously mentioned sources of Islamic law. Scholars who follow different methodologies will frequently arrive at different answers to the same question. It is well known that in Islam there are four schools of thought, and each of them differ with respect to certain aspects. However, it is important to know that these differences are usually about minor issues. For example, in terms of beliefs, the vast majority of Muslims agree on most aspects of belief, most importantly the concept of monotheism, and belief in the angels, Prophets, holy books and the Day of Judgment.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{a report}} in the New York Times {{revealed}} that Martinez had offered in 2006 to plead guilty to 2nd-degree murder in an attempted plea bargain that was ultimately rejected by the government. Martinez's guilty plea offer was signed by his two Army defense lawyers who were permitted by Army regulations to sign the plea offer only if they believed at the time that Martinez committed the crime. Subsequent debate was twofold: <b>one</b> <b>question</b> arose over whether the government's pursuit of the death penalty may lead defendants to plead to crimes they have not committed in order to avoid death as a punishment. Another question focused on the alleged inflexibility of the military's punishment scheme, as the government had apparently rejected Martinez's 2006 plea on the grounds that Martinez would have been eligible for parole within 10 years if sentenced to life, even after pleading guilty to 2nd-degree murder in the slaying of the two officers.|$|E

Local news still predominated, but national issues were becoming increasingly important. In 1920, Johnston editorialized against women’s suffrage as a violation of states’ rights: “No <b>one</b> <b>questions</b> the ability of women[...] [...] [...] No <b>one</b> <b>questions</b> that they are as capable as men to cast their ballots. But thousands question the manner in which women are to be enfranchised and honestly believe that the surrender to the general government of the powers of the state is too big a price to pay for a privilege which is chimerical and visionary in the extreme.” ...|$|R
