5|$|Back to the Egg is {{the seventh}} and final studio album by the British-American band Wings, {{released}} in 1979 on Columbia Records in America, and on Parlophone in the UK. Co-produced by Chris Thomas, the album reflects band leader Paul McCartney's embracing of contemporary musical trends such as new wave and punk, and marked the arrival of new Wings members Laurence Juber and Steve Holley. Back to the Egg adopts a loose conceptual theme around {{the idea of a}} working band, and its creation coincided with a period <b>of</b> <b>considerable</b> activity for the group, which included making a return to touring and work on several television and film projects.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose <b>of</b> <b>considerable</b> fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} <b>of</b> <b>considerable</b> antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture {{may have contributed to}} the historic Shoshones, but it is not well understood. Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being an idea <b>of</b> <b>considerable</b> theoretical interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the standard model of particle physics.

5|$|In the 20th century, Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British and allied effort in the two world wars and began to suffer a sharp {{industrial}} decline, going through periods <b>of</b> <b>considerable</b> political instability. The decline was particularly acute in the second half of the 20th century, but was compensated for to a degree by the development of an extensive oil industry, technological manufacturing and a growing service sector. This period also increasing debates about the place of Scotland within the United Kingdom, the rise of the Scottish National Party and after a referendum in 1999 the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander <b>of</b> <b>considerable</b> ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must be assigned to Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
