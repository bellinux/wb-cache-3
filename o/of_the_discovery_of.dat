5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, {{who moved}} to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> bones by local workmen he led excavations {{in the area of}} the hyena den. His work led to the discovery of the first evidence for the use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills. Middle Paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41,000 years.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, for the 25th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> radium, the French {{government}} {{established a}} stipend for her; its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur (1822–95).

Mrs. William Brown Meloney, after interviewing Marie, created a Marie Curie Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip.|$|E
5|$|Press {{coverage}} in the following days, after Howe's statement that no bomb had been found, continued {{to focus on the}} act planned by the IRA; several newspapers reported a search for a fourth member of the team.

5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in the approval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, {{as it is}} only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and {{the uncertainty of the}} alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> element 113.|$|E
5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, Szilard {{moved to}} New York City, taking {{a room at}} the King's Crown Hotel near Columbia University. He {{encountered}} John R. Dunning, who invited him to speak about his research at an afternoon seminar in January 1939. That month, Niels Bohr brought news to New York <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> nuclear fission in Germany by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch. When Szilard found out about it on a visit to Wigner at Princeton University, he immediately realized that uranium might be the element capable of sustaining a chain reaction.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, many claims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> {{nobelium}} {{were made}} from laboratories in Sweden, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Although the Swedish scientists soon retracted their claims, the priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, {{and it was not}} until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) credited the Soviet team with the discovery, but retained nobelium, the Swedish proposal, as the name of the element due to its long-standing use in the literature.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1917, the Argentines had to sharply curtail Rivadavias {{activities}} {{because of}} a fuel shortage, but they voyaged to the United States with the Argentine ambassador in 1918. Rivadavia then took on a load of gold bullion and brought it back to Argentina, docking in Puerto Belgrano on 23 September 1918. In December 1920, Rivadavia participated in ceremonies that marked the 400th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the Strait of Magellan. On the 2nd, the ship called on Valparaíso in Chile; 25 days later, it took part in an international naval review. Two years later, Rivadavia was placed into reserve.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with {{paraffin}} wax as a neutron moderator, and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna with its peculiar orbit in 2004 {{led to the}} conclusion that something beyond the known eight planets had perturbed Sedna away from the Kuiper belt.

The announcement in March 2014 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> a second sednoid, , which shared some orbital characteristics with Sedna and other extreme trans-Neptunian objects, further raised the possibility of an unseen super-Earth in a large orbit.|$|E
5|$|At a young age, Eloise asks Daniel if {{he knows}} what destiny is and then tells him {{that he has a}} special gift — his {{brilliant}} mind — and that his destiny relies on this. After Daniel graduates from Oxford University, Eloise gives him a new journal as a gift and again reminds him of his destiny. Meanwhile, Daniel has received an enormous research grant from Charles, who Daniel does not know is actually his father. Years later, following the crash of Flight 815, Daniel has suffered severe psychological effects from performing experiments on himself; he has lost his mental acuity, and now lives with a caretaker. While watching the news coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the Flight 815 wreckage in the Sunda Trench, Daniel is visited by Charles, who tells him that he faked the found wreckage and that the real plane actually landed on the island. Charles invites Daniel to go to the island, which Charles claims will cure his psychological problems. Eloise later visits Daniel and further encourages him to go to the island.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{was named}} after the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. She was built by the Franco-Russian Works at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 4 August 1886, {{launched}} on 1 June 1889, and completed in July 1891, although her trials lasted until the spring of 1892. She sailed in June 1892 for New York City {{to participate in the}} celebration honoring the 400th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> America. Upon her departure she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and visited Toulon in October 1893 with the Russian Squadron to reinforce the Franco-Russian Alliance. She was then commanded by Captain Richard Dicker. She sailed for the Pacific Ocean during the First Sino-Japanese War and arrived at Nagasaki, Japan on 28 April 1895, before sailing for Chefoo in China. She remained in the Pacific until late 1896, when she returned to the Mediterranean Squadron and supported Russian interests during the Cretan Revolt. She returned to the Baltic in April 1898 for an extensive, multi-year, refit. Her machinery was replaced with Belleville water-tube boilers and vertical triple expansion steam engines. Her after superstructure was cut down one deck abaft the mainmast and most of her 47mm and 37mm revolving cannon were removed. Only two 37mm revolvers were retained and she received sixteen 47mm and two 37mm single-barreled guns in their place.|$|E
