5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells.

5|$|After {{separating}} from Leissègues on 15 December, Willaumez sailed south, capturing {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> from a British troop convoy and sending the prizes, with the frigate Volontaire, to Tenerife. Willaumez's {{intention was to}} raid the China Fleet, a large convoy of valuable East Indiamen that sailed from the Far East to Britain every year. However, on 23 December he was pursued by Duckworth and driven far off course, {{so that by the}} time he reached the Cape of Good Hope, where he planned to resupply his ships, it had already been captured by a British expeditionary force. Turning westwards, Willaumez raided shipping in the South Atlantic until April, when he anchored at Salvador in neutral Brazil. By early May, Willaumez was at sea again, stopping at Cayenne and then splitting his force to raid shipping in the Leeward Islands prior to reuniting at Fort-de-France on Martinique in June.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{detected}} in New Zealand {{in the port}} of Timaru, South Island in 2002. This was the first incident of C.mutica being reported in the southern hemisphere.

Additional specimens were also recovered from the hulls <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in other ports, though they did not seem to have established colonies in the ports themselves. Genetic studies of the New Zealand populations suggests a possibility that these were secondarily introduced from non-native populations of C.mutica in the Atlantic through ballast water in the sea chests of international shipping.|$|E

Endeavour Wharf, near the railway station, was opened in 1964 by the local council. The number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> using the port in 1972 was 291, increased from 64 in 1964.
