50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, Telescopic cylinder can be used. One has to realize that for simple pushing applications telescopic cylinders might be easily available; for higher forces and/or double acting cylinders, they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use Plunger cylinders. Plunger cylinders have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one <b>oil</b> <b>connection</b> is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal piston cylinder, whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil. A hydraulic cylinder does not have a leakage over the piston nor over the cylinder head sealing so that {{there is no need for}} a mechanical brake.|$|E

However the book is chock full of information, alas most already well known to anyone even remotely familiar with the problematique under review; but it also offers some incisive analysis. The twelve contributed chapters by fourteen authors and coauthors are divided into three parts dedicated to examining and analyzing the general history and mutual background of the Caspian Sea region; to the ?ve littoral states of Azerbaijan, Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan; and to three external interested states, the United States, Turkey, and Georgia. Nonetheless, the review by each author goes well beyond the nominative boundaries assigned {{to him or her}} and trespasses over into the topics, territories and their relations assigned to other authors. Quite prop-erly so, in view of the mutually complex real-life interrelations in the Caspian Sea Basin, so that no topic or state could be adequately understood in itself other than in relation to the others. Indeed, we are witnessing the contemporary continuation of the nineteenth century Great Game for the control of Central Eurasia. However, the <b>oil</b> <b>connection</b> also reaches well beyond Caspian Sea and must make this book pertinent also to readers of this journal...|$|E

40|$|Denmark is an industrialized {{market economy}} with a gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) of $ 161 million in 2001. Slow economic growth was noted with only 0. 9 % increase in the GDP. Its standard of living was {{among the highest in}} the world with a per capita income of $ 31, 151. The country depended on imported raw materials and foreign trade. Denmark’s mineral resources are mainly fossil fuels that are located in natural gas and petroleum fields in the North Sea. The nonfuel minerals industry included mining and quarrying of chalk, clays, diatomite, limestone, and sand and gravel and production of secondary aluminum and crude steel and its semimanufactures. Denmark’s relatively high drilling activity was due to commitment wells on fifth-round acreage. Oil discoveries were made by Dansk Operatorselskab IS at Nini 1 A and Cecilie 1 A. Oil production in 2001 totaled 14. 1 million metric tons (Mt), or 88, 100 barrels, which was up by 0. 3 % compared with that of 2000.

40|$|The {{conjunction}} {{of oil and}} Russia's economic recovery in 1999 - 2004 links many themes. On September 16, 1998, the Central Bank of Russia mandated repatriation of 50 percent of foreign exchange revenues. On December 31, 1998, it raised the mandated repatriation rate to 75 percent. This rule affected primarily fuels and metals exports. In the next several years, world oil prices started to climb. The Central Bank of Russia subsequently reduced the mandated repatriation rate from 50 to 30 to 25 percent of foreign exchange revenues. Rising oil prices both incited this reduction and compensated for it. Russia's economy shifted from the great contraction in 1992 - 98 to a partial recovery in 1999 - 2004. Tables 1 and 2 provide the background data. This chapter explains these developments 1. It views Russia's economy as a new economic system which evolved from central planning after liberalization and privatization in 1992 and adapted to the policy shift in September-December 1998. We explore how, under this system, mandated repatriation of export revenues inadvertently became a quasi-fiscal policy, i. e. how it increased tax remittance and reduced subsidy extraction, which, in turn, shifted the economy from contraction to recovery. Oil and other tradeables, primarily natural resources, are important. Without their massive export, the issue of mandated repatriation of foreign exchange revenues would have been irrelevant. Oil on its own, however, was not the crucial factor. Many observers, including the IMF, attribute Russia's recovery to rising world oil prices. Figure 1 documents the heterogeneous economic performance of the six major petroleum-exporting {{countries around the world}} in 1992 - 2004. In Russia and across countries, it is uncorrelated with oil price fluctuations. Figure 2 illustrates how economic recovery synchronized in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other former Soviet states, both net oil exporters (Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan) and importers (Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova). The oil factor was neither necessary (viz., Ukraine) nor sufficient (viz., Venezuela) for economic recovery and growth in the early 2000 s. The <b>oil</b> <b>connection</b> abstracted from the economic system and policy shifts is specious. Russia's economic recovery raises a more fundamental, and incendiary, issue than oil. Figure 3 illustrates it. In Russia and similar post-central plan economies, liberalization and privatization coincided with the great economic contraction in 1992 - 98. Partial deliberalization and de-privatization in Russia, starting with mandated repatriation of export revenues, coincided with economic recovery in 1999 - 2004. The principal idea of this chapter is that the impact of economic freedom is ambivalent. It depends on the economic system. The freedom to create new wealth it is eminently productive. However, the freedom for firms and some individuals to redistribute to themselves income from the government, other firms, and other households, suppresses productive incentives and economic growth. Government restriction of such freedom, e. g., in China or in Russia after 1998, fosters economic performance...|$|E
40|$|The Outer Hebrides are a {{structurally}} complex area, comprised predominantly of {{crystalline basement}} rocks of the Lewisian Gneiss Complex with the multiply reactivated Outer Hebrides Fault Zone following eastern {{portions of the}} islands for over 200 km along strike. In Eastern Lewis, the Permo-Triassic Stornoway Formation unconformably overlies Lewisian basement rocks of the OHFZ in a half-graben. This structural setting {{is analogous to the}} major offshore Clair oil field, where oil is found within Devonian-Carboniferous red beds of the Clair Group directly overlying Lewisian Gneiss Complex rocks of the Rona Ridge, which was upfaulted in the Mesozoic. <b>Oil</b> <b>connection</b> and flow has been proven in the basement rocks at Clair, however, {{little is known about the}} nature of fracturing and faulting within the basement and how these faults link to the cover sequence. Here, the cover and basement rocks of the Outer Hebridean Islands of Lewis and Harris are studied as an analogue. Faults, fault rocks and deformation are characterised within the Stornoway Formation, and at the basement-cover interface, allowing recognition of Mesozoic and younger faults within the Lewisian and their separation from older structures. Three fault sets are distinguished within the Stornoway Formation: a NNW-SSE striking normal fault set (Set 1); a N-S and E-W quadrimodal normal fault set (Set 2); and a less numerous late E-W strike-slip set (Set 3). Tertiary dolerite dyke intrusion occurred along Set 1 and Set 2 faults prior to the formation of Set 3. Palaeostress analyses reveal that Set 1 and 2 result from E-W and ENE-WSW directed extension vectors, followed by E-W directed contraction associated with Set 3. These orientations are interpreted to be representative of Mesozoic extension related to the opening of the Atlantic, followed by Cenozoic contraction. Faults in the Stornoway Formation are accompanied by development of authigenic clay-bearing gouges and cataclasites, ± calcite cement and late zeolite. Zeolite is often associated with secondary porosity, produced through dissolution of calcite. Mesozoic and younger faults are readily identified in Lewisian Gneiss rocks of the Stornoway region based on fault rock characterisation, and these faults also display an ENE-WSW directed extension vector. The major bounding faults of the Stornoway Formation are sub-parallel with the local foliation and the reactivation of the basement foliation by Mesozoic faults is proven. Fault trends identified within the Stornoway Formation are also sub-parallel with the local foliation. Conjugate faulting apparent in the Stornoway Formation is not present within the Lewisian, possibly indicating a degree of structural detachment between faulting in the basement and faulting in the cover, probably linked to the development of low-angle faults within the Stornoway Formation within metres of and parallel with the basement-cover unconformity. The basement-cover interface displays abundant evidence of fluid overpressure, potentially linked with dewatering during lithification and local fault movements. Mesozoic and younger-age brittle fault rocks post-date pre-existing extensive ductile and brittle deformation that are most intense within the OHFZ. Brittle fault rocks of pre-Mesozoic age are associated with pseudotachylites, fine grained cataclasites, epidote-bearing cataclasites and pumpellyite-bearing cataclasites. Mesozoic fault rocks contain authigenic clay-bearing gouges and cataclasites often associated with zeolite and adularia mineralisation that often accompanies the development of secondary porosity within the fault rocks. This chronological fault rock assemblage represents the continued exhumation of the islands after the successively lower temperature and pressures conditions experienced since the initial development of the basement gneiss complex. Across Lewis, fault rock characterisation allows identification of major Mesozoic and younger structures that cross the islands, with a km-scale offset postulated across the major Seaforth Fault that may link the major NE-SW striking Minch Fault to a NE-SW striking fault lying offshore western Lewis/Harris. On Lewis, the predominant orientation of Mesozoic structures is NNW-SSE, becoming NW-SE on Harris, south of the Seaforth Fault and where foliation becomes pervasively NW-SE. It seems highly likely that, as identified in the Stornoway Region, the foliation orientation plays a significant role in the development of later structures. At Clair, fault rock development within the Devonian-Carboniferous Clair Group is dependent on the host lithology, with gouges formed in mudstones, and granulation seams found in porous, oil-bearing sandstones. Calcite-cemented breccias are present in zones of calcite cemented host rock. Pyrite and calcite vein mineralisation are associated with oil influx, and a late phase of dissolution was accompanied by faulting that produced uncemented brittle fault rocks (gouge). In the basement, oil is seen along open fractures and in vug-like secondary porosity associated with adularia mineralisation, of which two forms are present. Euhedral adularia is often altered to green clay and partially to wholly infills tensile fractures that may predate the emplacement of the Clair Group. Later adularia occurs as ‘speckled’ veins, with haematite, clay, calcite, pyrite, minor zeolite and oil, and appears to be contemporaneous with calcite-pyrite veining (i. e. Mesozoic in age). Porosity in both adularia-bearing fractures is associated with oil staining. The basement displays little evidence of extensive mylonites or phyllonites that are obvious in the OHFZ of the Outer Hebrides. Scalability studies show that it is difficult to assign power-law spacing distributions to fractures within the basement rocks of the Hebrides. Fractures parallel with Mesozoic structures do however tend to display a greater degree of organisation with more clustering of fractures as the faults are approached. Mesozoic fault-perpendicular fracture sets display more strongly random fracture spacing distributions consistent with a jointing origin. At Clair, fracture spacing studies in the cover show a low fracture density compared to basement, with fracture spacing that is clustered and may be well represented by power-laws. Dissolution has locally produced a randomly spaced fracture network. Although fracture spacings in the Hebridean Lewisian are generally random, fracture apertures define a clear power law relationship over 5 orders of magnitude. Similarly, results from the Clair group also display equivalent power law relationships. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{reflect on}} and explore what {{remains to be}} done to make the concept of {{supportive}} environments—one of the Ottawa Charter's five core action areas—a reality in the context of growing uncertainty about the future and accelerated pace of change. We pay particular attention to the physical environment, while underscoring the inextricable links between physical and social environments, and particularly the need to link social and environmental justice. The paper begins with a brief orientation to three emerging threats to health equity, namely ecological degradation, climate change, and peak <b>oil,</b> and their <b>connection</b> to economic instability, food security, energy security and other key determinants of health. We then present three contrasting perspectives on the nature of social change and how change is catalyzed, arguing for an examination of the conditions under which cultural change on the scale required to realize the vision of ‘supportive environments for all’ might be catalyzed, and the contribution that health promotion as a field could play in this process. Drawing on sociological theory, and specifically practice theory and the work of Pierre Bourdieu, we advocate rethinking education for social change by attending more adequately to the social conditions of transformative learning and cultural change. We conclude with an explication of three key implications for health promotion practice: a more explicit alignment with those seeking to curtail environmental destruction and promote environmental justice, strengthening engagement with local or settings-focused ‘communities of practice’ (such as the Transition Town movement), and finding new ways to creatively ‘engage emergence’, a significant departure from the current dominant focus on ‘risk management’...|$|R

Anthropogenic pollution {{has been the focus}} of extensive research for some time and a variety of programs for the monitoring and {{assessment of}} environmental pollution have been developed. Determination of the levels of pollution in sensitive ‘sentinels’ such as mussels, allows monitoring of these levels in a given area over a prolonged period of time. Furthermore, the biological effects of pollution are reflected in a series of biomarkers, none of which provides a general picture of the sentinel’s state of health and all of which are individually specific for certain pollutants and influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. In an attempt to improve biomonitoring of marine pollution, we have developed two proteomic approaches here. In the first portion of the thesis, a proteomic analysis was performed on peroxisomes isolated from mussels exposed either to one of three model anthropogenic pollutants, or two different types of crude oil, or from mussels exposed to the Prestige oil spill. Application of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) provided protein expression signatures (PES) for exposure to these different pollutants. Furthermore, several individual protein components of these PES could be putatively identified. In the second portion of this work, such analysis of subproteomes was developed further in order to improve the applicability of this approach to biomonitoring. A simple fractionation procedure in combination with liquid chromatography and 2 -DE provided samples from mussels residing in different regions of a pollution gradient around the harbor of Gothenburg, as well as from mussels exposed to two types of fuel oil similar to that of the Prestige that were suitable for environmental proteomics. In addition, we constructed a model for this approach that can be cross-validated in the future and applied to assess sources of fuel <b>oil</b> pollution in <b>connection</b> with biomonitoring programs...|$|R

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has nearly 24, 500 number of distribution transformers installed island wide which {{are connected to}} 11 kV or 33 kV Medium Voltage (MV) networks to meet the present power demand of consumers. Failure of a distribution transformer results to interruption of power supply to the consumers and involve high expenditure in repair or replacement of transformer. Hence protection of distribution transformer is very important. Transformer failure rate of the CEB is nearly 2. 5 % where internationally acceptable level is less than 2 %. When a Distribution Transformer is failed, it is replaced with a new transformer, {{but there is no}} proper method established by the CEB to analyze the cause of failure. A detailed investigation of failed transformer is vital important to understanding the actual failure scenario and prevent further incidents. The objective {{of the study was to}} identify main causes of distribution transformer failures and propose measures to minimize those failures. This thesis presents the CEB distribution substation installation practices and practical situation of distribution substations which would be the causes for failures. Detail investigation procedure for failed transformers was established in order to find out actual cause for each transformer failure. Through the literature review, different failure modes were identified for each transformer component and common transformer failure causes are lightning, short circuit faults in network, aging, overloading, <b>oil</b> leaks, loose <b>connections</b> and bad workmanship. Failed transformers during the year 2011 were inspected in order find the root causes for failures. It was observed that lightning and overloading are the major causes for transformer failures in Southern Province. It was observed that 28 % of transformer failures are due to lightning and 25 % are due to overloading. Onsite investigations were carried out and failed transformers were opened whenever necessary to identify the exact causes for failures. Several tests were done before opening failed transformers such as insulation resistant test, polarization index test, ratio test and LV short circuit test. To minimize transformer failures, several measures were proposed. Maintaining the surge arrestor earth electrode resistance less than 10 Ω, replacing of faulty surge arrestors, installation of LV surge arrestors, proper fuse selection, balancing of loads, and proper crimping of lugs are few recommendations.

The DB 606 engine had first been introduced on the Heinkel He 119 and later used on other aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 261 where they functioned as intended, but the extremely tight cowlings on the He 177A led to considerable problems, the most common being in-flight engine fires and engine overheating. There were several reasons for the flammability of the DB 606 engine as installed in the Greif's engine nacelle accommodations, one of which was the common [...] "central" [...] exhaust manifold, serving a total of 12 cylinders, on the two inner cylinder banks of the twinned DB 601 component engines making up a DB 606. This central exhaust system routinely became excessively hot, causing the usual accumulation of oil and grease {{in the bottom of the}} engine cowling to catch fire. When the pilot throttled back there was a tendency for the mechanical fuel injection pump on each component DB 601 engine to [...] "lag" [...] in their response in such situations, and deliver more fuel than was required by the engine, in addition to which the fuel injection pump connections often leaked. To reduce the aircraft's weight no firewall had been provided, and the aft end of each DB 606 was fitted so close to the main spar — with the rear two-thirds of the component powerplants' engine blocks being placed behind the wing's leading edge — that there was insufficient space for the fuel/oil fluid lines and electrical harnesses. The engines' exterior surfaces within the cowlings were frequently saturated with fuel and <b>oil</b> from leaking <b>connections.</b> At high altitude the oil tended to foam due to a badly designed oil pump, reducing its lubricating qualities. Insufficient lubrication resulted in the disintegration of the connecting rod bearings, resulting in the conrods sometimes bursting through either one of the component engine crankcases and puncturing the oil tanks, the contents of which would pour on to the often-overheated central exhaust pipe collector. The tightly packed nature of the [...] "power system" [...] engine installations on the He 177A, with the extreme rearwards location of the component engines in their nacelles, also led to poor maintenance access as well as very poor ventilation. As a result of these factors, in addition to a lack of routine maintenance in the field, the DB 606 powerplants frequently caught fire in flight. While theoretically sound, the effort to create an adequately powerful engine for the He 177 by mechanically coupling two pairs of lower-power engines into two heavy [...] "power system" [...] powerplant setups proved to be difficult to perfect, and led to numerous engine complications, turning out to be most numerous with the service test He 177A-0 and initial production A-1 models.|$|R
