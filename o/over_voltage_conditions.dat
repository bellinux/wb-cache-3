Nowadays, modern industrial devices are mostly based on electronic devices such as programmable logic controllers and electronic drives.

In this condition lower relay of the circuit will remain open. When the voltage rises above 242  V (which is 1.1 times the rated voltage of 220  V and it is a swell and <b>over</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>condition).</b> Under this situation the circuit will remain open because during that time the upper relay in the circuit will remain open. Thus we can protect the costly equipment’s by disconnecting the supply to the circuit during abnormal conditions.|$|R
30|$|The {{protection}} circuit proposed {{in this paper}} {{can be used to}} protect the costly electrical appliances from abnormal conditions like sag, swell, under <b>voltage,</b> <b>over</b> <b>voltage,</b> <b>over</b> current and able to avoid appliances being get damaged from harmful effects. The advantages of this protective device are: highly sensitive, fit and forget system, low cost and reliable circuit, complete elimination of manpower, can handle heavy loads up to 7 A, auto switch OFF during abnormal conditions and auto switch ON at the time of normal conditions. The applications of this protection device are in industrial machinery, house hold appliances like: TV, refrigerator, air conditioner, agriculture motors, and water pumps. This device can also be used directly as standalone equipment between the supply mains and the load. The over/under <b>voltage</b> and <b>over</b> current cut-off with time delay provides over/under-voltage and over current protection and also protection against any transients. If tap changing transformer is used and is automatically controlled, then the device can operate the load normally during under <b>voltage</b> and <b>over</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>condition.</b> Hence, we can protect as well as operate the load in abnormal conditions also. The proposed system can be further improved by integrating it with GSM modem that alerts user by sending an SMS about the tripping status.|$|R

30|$|When the RMS voltage {{or current}} drops between 0.1 and 0.9 pu at power {{frequency}} for duration of 0.5  cycles to 1  min, {{then it is}} said to be sag condition. The swell condition will occur when RMS voltage or current rises between 1.1 and 1.8 pu at power frequency for the duration of 0.5 to 1  min, and above 1.8 pu and below 0.9 pu is called over voltage and under voltage conditions, respectively [4]. Voltage sags and under voltage conditions are caused by abrupt increase in loads due to short circuit and faults or it is caused by abrupt increase in source impendence caused by loose connection.

Such abnormalities include fault conditions, under/ <b>over</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>conditions,</b> under/over frequency conditions, and equipment malfunction. Under the guidance of POWER and our faculty advisor, the goal of the project was to design a protection scheme for a typical wind farm. The requirements of the protective relaying scheme were to integrate with substation monitoring and control systems and meet the basic objectives of protective relaying. The system was first modeled using the ASPEN One-liner software package and short-circuit analysis was conducted to simulate possible fault conditions. Based on the results from the analysis, relay setting were developed for the protection scheme. The settings were then downloaded onto microprocessorbased protective relays donated by Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. and tested to ensure proper functionality...|$|E
30|$|Normal {{working voltage}} {{for the single}} phase AC system is 220  V and[*]+[*]or - 10 % {{tolerance}} is considered. This supply is converted into DC {{with the help of}} AC- DC converter followed by the RLC filter. The filter circuit removes the ripples which present in the DC. The output of the filter is DC and this is given as input to the regulator, where the voltage can be varied up to 440  V. The regulator provides constant supply required for the microcontroller and relay system even though there is any changes that has happens in the input side of regulator. The normal supply obtained at the output side of regulator is 12  V. When over current fault occurs the current transformer connected to the supply side converts that high value of current into low value and supply it to the microcontroller through analog to digital converter (ADC). In case when <b>over</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>condition</b> occurs the high values of voltage is reduced to low value of voltage and send that signal to ADC. The ADC converts analog signal into digital signal which is understood by the microcontroller.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} twenty years, {{industrial}} controls have experienced dramatic changes with advances in adjustable speed drive technology. It has been observed that voltage waveforms generated by power frequency converters may affect significantly the reliability of electric motor insulation system. <b>Over</b> <b>voltage</b> problems in long cable drives due to step voltage pulse rise time became an important research area during the last decade. The <b>over</b> <b>voltage</b> phenomenon is usually described using the traveling wave and reflection phenomena. For {{better understanding of the}} processes in long cable drives distributed-parameter representation in simulations is used. The problem with bearing currents is well known. Besides magnetic dissymmetries, other causes exist for bearing currents, such as voltage potential accidentally applied to the shaft, electrostatic charge accumulation, and common-mode voltages generated by unbalanced excitation of the motor windings. Any of the above could cause bearing currents and bearing failures. Recently, common-mode voltages with high frequency and high dv/dt have been a major cause of bearing currents and premature bearing failures in high-frequency inverter-fed, induction motors.

Mostly the protection of electrical power depends {{on the performance of}} insulation systems under transient <b>over</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>conditions</b> arises due to lightening and switching applications. Transient over voltages in addition to the abrupt changes in the state of power systems, e. g. switching operations or faults are known as switching impulse voltages and that due to lightening are known as lightening impulse voltages. Very short pulse high-voltage or high-current surges can be produced by an electrical apparatus known as impulse generator. High impulse voltages are used to test the durability of electric power equipment against lightning and switching surges. The Marx Impulse generator is used to generate such high impulse voltages. A total of eight stages of both Standard as well as Improved Marx Impulse generator were designed and the impulse waves were recorded. These recorded impulse waves were compared with the standard impulse wave with front time of 1. 2 µ seconds and fall time of 50 µ seconds.

When motor is operated on sinusoidal supply, then during switching period voltage across motor phase becomes equal to supply line voltage and the maximum voltage across any of the coil obtained is 30 % more than the rated value. Unexpected behaviour was observed in variation of coil voltage (harmonic voltage after few cycle from starting) with sinusoidal supply during starting, however this is not producing large <b>over</b> <b>voltages</b> or high dv/dt. Voltage rise time when motor is supplied with converter is very small and is {{of the order of}} micro second. In some cases the peak voltage at motor terminals reaches to value which more than twice the value of dc link voltage and rated line to line voltage of the motor. The distribution of <b>voltage</b> during switching <b>condition</b> is not even among the coils of a winding and hence turns. The voltage drop in coils near the terminal is more than that of in other coils. The measured voltage drop across first coil from terminal of winding of four coils in series is varying 30 to 65. 8 % of the phase voltage against 25 % of the phase voltage. Comparison of wave forms for sinusoidal supply and inverter supply shows that distortions were very large with inverter supply which increases the losses and produces more stresses on the insulations.
