5|$|In <b>overt</b> primary {{hypothyroidism}}, TSH {{levels are}} high and T4 and T3 levels are low. <b>Overt</b> hypothyroidism may also be diagnosed in {{those who have a}} TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T4. It may also be diagnosed in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L.|$|E
5|$|Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs) are two or {{more police}} {{officers}} who are deployed by UK police forces to gather intelligence {{on the ground and}} in some circumstances, to disrupt activists and deter anti-social behaviour. They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct <b>overt</b> surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of <b>overt</b> surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled that they must justify retention of photographs on a case-by-case basis. Any retained information is recorded on the Crimint database.|$|E
5|$|Unmarked phrase {{order is}} subject–object–{{predicate}}. While the predicate generally has {{to remain in}} clause-final position, the other phrases are free to change order or to wholly disappear. The topic tends to be placed clause-initially, new information rather {{at the end of}} the clause. Topic can be overtly marked with bol, which can also mark contrastive focus, <b>overt</b> additive focus ('even, also') can be marked with the clitic č, and <b>overt</b> restrictive focus with the clitic l ('only').|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{about one}} billion people are {{estimated}} to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In large population-based studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3–0.4% of the population have <b>overt</b> hypothyroidism. A larger proportion, 4.3–8.5%, have subclinical hypothyroidism. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, 80% have a TSH level below the 10mIU/l mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops <b>overt</b> hypothyroidism (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a goiter).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{campaign}} successfully desegregated downtown lunch counters, sit-ins, pickets, and protests against other segregated facilities continued in Nashville until {{passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended <b>overt,</b> legally sanctioned segregation nationwide. Many of {{the organizers of the}} Nashville sit-ins went on to become important leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5|$|Early {{comic strips}} also avoided <b>overt</b> {{treatment}} of gay issues, though examples of homosexual subtext have been identified. The 1938–1939 edition of Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates features a primary villain, Sanjak, {{who has been}} interpreted {{by some as a}} lesbian with designs on the hero's girlfriend.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock has {{sometimes}} been labelled cock rock for its emphasis on <b>overt</b> masculinity and sexuality and because it has historically been predominantly performed and consumed by men: {{in the case of}} its audience, particularly white, working-class adolescents.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of <b>overt</b> encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing <b>overt</b> encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Liberty {{brought a}} {{judicial}} review of the <b>overt</b> surveillance practices in May 2008, which was decided in favour of the police, EWHC 1105 (Admin) |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2008/1105.html}} however the police were asked to clarify their evidence to the Court of Appeal, following an investigation by The Guardian newspaper.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{composed}} {{dozens of}} art songs, arrangements of folk songs, chamber and piano music. While the piano music is relatively unimportant, {{many of the}} art songs possess a delicate beauty. While they yield in <b>overt</b> lyricism to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, otherwise they reserve {{their place in the}} standard repertory of Russian singers.|$|E
5|$|The {{record sleeve}} {{includes}} a montage photograph {{in the studio}} consisting of a mirror, straw, razor blade and a rolled up five pound note (as an <b>overt</b> reference to cocaine consumption). Lynott insisted on adding the picture {{over the rest of}} the band's objections.|$|E
5|$|The term minimal {{encephalopathy}} (MHE) {{is defined}} as encephalopathy that {{does not lead to}} clinically <b>overt</b> cognitive dysfunction, but can be demonstrated with neuropsychological studies. This is still an important finding, as minimal encephalopathy has been demonstrated to impair quality of life and increase the risk of involvement in road traffic accidents.|$|E
5|$|They can be playful {{with other}} dogs, and {{get along with}} horses. The breed {{standard}} requires that shyness {{be treated as a}} fault, although it states that this {{should not be confused with}} submissiveness which is not treated as such. <b>Overt</b> aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|Treason {{against the}} United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in {{adhering}} to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses {{to the same}} <b>overt</b> Act, or on Confession in open Court.|$|E
5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Dreamgirls, starring Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, {{was released by}} DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures in December 2006. The film contains more <b>overt</b> references to Motown and the Supremes than does the play that inspired it: for example, in the film, many of the Dreams' album covers are identical in design to Supremes album covers, and the Dreams themselves hail from Detroit – not Chicago, as do their Broadway counterparts.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to <b>overt,</b> active tuberculous disease. In those with HIV, {{the risk of developing}} active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E
5|$|According to Perry Link, {{pressure}} on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong is avoided {{because it could}} result in a denial of visas for fieldwork in China. Ethan Gutmann also noted that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC government's attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making <b>overt</b> representations on Falun Gong's behalf.|$|E
5|$|After the Philippines fell to Japanese {{forces in}} 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Army urged farmers to grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for {{cultivation}} were issued to farmers. Without {{any change in}} the Marihuana Tax Act, over 400,000 acres of hemp were cultivated between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957. New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act, started the LaGuardia Commission that in 1944 contradicted the earlier reports of addiction, madness, and <b>overt</b> sexuality.|$|E
5|$|By 1968 the Americans {{were well}} aware of the scope and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to come on board against the communists. It was also conscious that any <b>overt</b> action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|During her trials, UB-7 {{developed}} a leak which {{took some time}} to repair. In the meantime, she was assigned the Austrian number of U-7 and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since it was still the intent for UB-7 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the <b>overt</b> hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E
5|$|During her trials, UB-8 was {{assigned}} the Austrian number of U-8 and an Austrian commander. Her German crew at Pola—since {{it was still}} the intent for UB-8 {{to be transferred to}} the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine—wore either civilian clothes or Austrian uniforms. As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of the <b>overt</b> hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E
5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more <b>overt</b> masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, gay {{relationships}} were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. <b>Overt</b> gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.|$|E
5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this <b>overt</b> military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E
5|$|In Pensacola, Brown and Nix {{married in}} secret, as Naval Cadets {{were not allowed}} to marry until their {{training}} was complete, under threat of immediate dismissal. Nix took a room in Pensacola, and the two visited one another on weekends. In spite of <b>overt</b> racism from at least one instructor and several classmates at this posting, Brown completed the rigorous training in August 1947.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken aback by the <b>overt</b> sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Kaga {{designed}} Gaiden {{to address}} issues raised with the first game, such as tedious elements of map navigation. The system of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was used as base for various improvements to aspects such as enemy AI, although the gameplay adjustments ended up removing some of the strategic elements. These elements included a navigable overworld and more <b>overt</b> role-playing elements, along {{with the introduction of}} the class evolution system. Balancing these elements proved challenging for the team. The game made use of the new MMC4 memory chip, developed partially in response to the memory capacity problems faced during the development of the first game. For the story, Kaga wanted to deepen the relationship between the player and their units, represented through the growth of the characters through their battles. To create a stronger and broader central narrative, Kaga created the game's dual protagonists. An <b>overt</b> reference to Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was made {{in the form of a}} trio of female Pegasus Knights, who were similar to another trio from the first game yet bore different names.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with <b>overt</b> hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower starting dose is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E
5|$|President Nixon {{was more}} than willing to seize the {{advantage}} offered by the ousting of Sihanouk and the opportunity to strike the border sanctuaries as a means of buying time for both the U.S. and South Vietnam. On 29 April, the first bombings of Operation Patio took place. Like Menu, these tactical airstrikes were held in close secrecy. Although they were initially an anti-infiltration measure, they quickly expanded as targets deeper in Cambodia became the norm. The program was quickly superseded by Operation Freedom Deal, the <b>overt</b> support of FANK troops by B-52 and tactical airstrikes by American and South Vietnamese aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to <b>overt</b> TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Race meetings, concert parties (including drag acts– good drag queens were {{in great}} demand), {{trips to the}} seaside and {{football}} matches were organised to keep men entertained. There were various unofficial publications, including the “Wipers Times”– these give an insight into the views of ordinary soldiers and junior officers. <b>Overt</b> patriotism was rare, and politicians such as (Prime Minister) Asquith and Ramsay MacDonald (an opponent of the war, later Labour Prime Minister) were satirised.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus's {{position}} {{was not quite}} that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD25 to Tiberius's niece, Livilla, though under pressure quickly withdrew the request. While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius, the presence of Livia seems to have checked his <b>overt</b> power for a time. Her death in AD29 changed all that.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force did {{possess an}} {{aircraft}} which had an all-weather capability, radar-guided bombing equipment, and awesome destructive potential – the B-52 Stratofortress. The civilian administration, however, never considered utilizing the big bombers (whose operations remained {{under the control}} of the Strategic Air Command) very far north of the DMZ, believing that it was too <b>overt</b> an escalation. Air Force Chief of Staff John P. McConnell also opposed sending the bombers into the air defense environment in the north and limited B-52 strikes to Route Package One.|$|E
5|$|The US {{government}} {{was aware of}} these activities in Cambodia, but refrained from taking <b>overt</b> military action within Cambodia in hopes of convincing the mercurial Sihanouk to alter his position. To accomplish this, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized covert cross-border reconnaissance operations conducted by the secret Studies and Observations Group in order to gather intelligence on PAVN/NLF activities in the border regions (Project Vesuvius). This intelligence data would then {{be presented to the}} prince in an effort to change his mind.|$|E
5|$|The episodes, {{written in}} advance {{during the fall}} of 2010, were {{conceived}} to successfully {{bring an end to}} the series. Showrunners Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders attempted to preserve the intended ending envisioned by original series developers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar several years earlier. The episodes featured the return of several former actors, including John Schneider, Aaron Ashmore, Annette O'Toole, Michael McKean (voice only), and Michael Rosenbaum. The episodes also contained several <b>overt</b> references, homages, and connections to previous Superman franchises, such as the 1978 film Superman and the 2006 film Superman Returns.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{the natives}} gave <b>overt</b> clues {{that they were}} displeased with the {{settlement}} being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by {{an agent of the}} Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely {{had little to do with}} that transaction, if they even knew of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.|$|E
