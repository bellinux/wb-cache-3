5|$|Since midnight {{the weapons}} {{on all the}} fronts are silent. By {{the order of the}} Grand Admiral Dönitz, the Wehrmacht ceased its hopeless fighting. With this, a nearly 6-year heroic {{struggle}} has ended. It brought us great victories but also heavy defeats. The Wehrmacht has been honorably defeated by superior forces. The German soldier, in accordance with his oath, has given his unforgettable effort to his people. Till the end the homeland supported him with all its strength, under the heaviest sacrifices. The singular performance of the front and Fatherland shall receive its final honor in the later, fair judgement. The achievements and sacrifices of German soldiers at sea, on the land and in the air has not escaped the notice of <b>our</b> <b>enemy.</b> Therefore, every soldier can hold his head high, and proudly lay his weapon down. He can start to work bravely and confidently the bitterest hour of our history, for the eternal life of our people.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be <b>our</b> <b>enemy.</b> They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

500|$|On 5March 1917, {{shortly after}} commencing {{operations}} with No.1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped {{while he was}} bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria. At first believing {{that he had been}} struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base. On 21April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under [...] "intense anti-aircraft fire"; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order for [...] "conspicuous gallantry". He was promoted major in May and given command of No.1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with <b>our</b> <b>enemy</b> in the air." [...] His men knew him as a teetotaller and non-smoker, whose idea of swearing was an occasional [...] "Darn me!".|$|E
500|$|Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force {{encountered}} the six ships of Vice Admiral Beatty's 1st and 2nd battlecruiser squadrons. The German ships {{were the first}} to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000m). When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in Moltke being engaged by both New Zealand and Tiger. The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. Due to errors in British communication, Derfflinger was unengaged during the first 10 minutes of the battle. Derfflingers gunnery officer, Korvettenkapitän Georg von Hase later remarked [...] "By some mistake we were being left out. I laughed grimly and now I began to engage <b>our</b> <b>enemy</b> with complete calm, as at gun practice, and with continually increasing accuracy." [...] At 17:03, the British battlecruiser [...] exploded after 15 minutes of gunfire from Von der Tann. Shortly thereafter the second half of Beatty's force, the four s of the 5th Battle Squadron, came into range and began firing at Von der Tann and Moltke.|$|E
500|$|March 1917 saw the {{heaviest}} bombing campaign {{carried out by}} the squadron to date; short of its regular [...] ordnance, the pilots improvised by dropping [...] howitzer shells on Turkish forces along the Gaza–Beersheba line. During one such mission on 20March, Lieutenant Frank McNamara earned the Victoria Cross for landing his Martinsyde in the desert under enemy fire and rescuing a fellow pilot whose B.E.2 had been forced down. On 26March, No.1 Squadron took part in the First Battle of Gaza; it suffered its first combat death the next day, when one of its B.E.2s was attacked by a German Rumpler. The unit participated in the Second Battle of Gaza on 19April; like its predecessor, the attack was a failure for the Allies. Williams, later known as the [...] "Father of the RAAF", assumed command of the squadron in May. Two B.E.12s were delivered the same month; like the Martinsydes, they were armed with a forward-firing machine gun and employed as escorts for the B.E.2s. By June, mechanical issues caused by hot summer weather and the threat from new German Albatros scouts were rendering the B.E.2s largely ineffective, and Williams urgently requested newer models. Modern aircraft were eventually delivered, first the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in October, and then the Bristol F.2 Fighter in December. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with <b>our</b> <b>enemy</b> in the air." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the musical}} prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen {{at play in}} the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle {{reminder}} of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: [...] "I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me". The wary Flosshilde cries: [...] "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: [...] "Now I laugh at my fears, <b>our</b> <b>enemy</b> is in love", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: [...] "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!" [...] Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him [...] bewailing their loss.|$|E
