5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> a headless corpse.|$|E
25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from {{the arm of}} the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull {{at the back of the}} ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for conductive hearing losses or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|E
25|$|Japanese Fire Department's rank insignias are {{place on}} a small badge and pinned above the right pocket. Rank is told by stripes and Hexagram stars. The design of the insignias came from older Japanese style {{military}} insignias. Officers and Team Leaders could wear an arm band <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> fire jacket to show status as command leader. Sometimes rank can be shown as different color fire jacket for command staff. The color whites and gray are reserved for EMS. Orange is reserved for rescuer.|$|E

25|$|The Robinson-Finlay bridal party {{arrived at}} the church shortly before 1 o'clock. The bridegroom was {{accompanied}} by his best man, Captain Standish, Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria, and the bride entered the church leaning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> her father, the Governor of New South Wales. The service was accompanied by music provided by a choir and the organ and the bridal couple departing {{to the music of}} a wedding march. The bells of the nearby St Mary's Cathedral were rung (St James' had no bells at the time).|$|E
25|$|The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) is {{the small}} but {{professional}} military force of Jamaica. The JDF {{is based on the}} British military model with similar organisation, training, weapons and traditions. Once chosen, officer candidates are sent to one of several British or Canadian basic officer courses depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> service. Enlisted soldiers are given basic training at Up Park Camp or JDF Training Depot, Newcastle, both in St. Andrew. As with the British model, NCOs are given several levels of professional training as they rise up the ranks. Additional military schools are available for speciality training in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Royal Holloway's {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of the Royal Holloway shield and its surrounding elements. There are three crescents shown on the coat of arms, which are taken from Thomas Holloway's own coat of arms. Taken from the Bedford coat of arms, the field is coloured black and gold in a chequered design, {{with the addition of}} ermine spots (feather-like symbols representing ermine tails) from the Royal Holloway coat. Placed between two black lozenges, there is a lamp of learning. Traditionally, the lozenge is worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> unmarried women or widows, which places significance on the coat of arms' lozenges as it acts as a reminder that the colleges were founded for women. Below, the motto is displayed which is taken from the arms of Bedford College, and reads esse quam videri.|$|E

25|$|Images of {{children}} {{on the path to}} destruction also litter the scene: aside from the dead baby on the spike and the child falling to its death, a baby is quieted by its mother with a cup of gin, and in the background of the scene an orphaned infant bawls naked on the floor as the body of its mother is loaded into a coffin on orders of the beadle. Two young girls who are wards of the parish of St Giles—indicated by the badge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> one of the girls—each take a glass. Hogarth also chose the slum of St Giles as setting for the first scene of The Four Stages of Cruelty, which he issued almost simultaneously with Beer Street and Gin Lane. Tom Nero, the central character of the Cruelty series wears an identical arm badge. In front of the pawnbroker's door a starving boy and a dog fight over a bone, while next to them a girl has fallen asleep; approaching her is a snail, emblematic of the sin of sloth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself {{how to read and}} write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E
500|$|The tefillin are {{to serve}} as a {{reminder}} of God's intervention {{at the time of the}} Exodus from Egypt. Maimonides details of the sanctity of tefillin and writes that [...] "as long as the tefillin are on the head and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> a man, he is modest and God-fearing and will not be attracted by hilarity or idle talk; he will have no evil thoughts, but will devote all his thoughts to truth and righteousness." [...] The Sefer ha-Chinuch (14thcentury) adds that the purpose of tefillin is to help subjugate a person's worldly desires and encourage spiritual development. Joseph Caro (16thcentury) explains that tefillin are placed on the arm adjacent to the heart and on the head above the brain to demonstrate that these two major organs are willing to perform the service of God.|$|E

2500|$|Hauka fjöllum, [...] "arms", from hauka [...] "hawk" [...] and fjöll mountain. This is a {{reference}} to the sport of falconry, where a bird of prey is perched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> the falconer. By convention, [...] "hawk" [...] combined with a term for a geographic feature forms a kenning for [...] "arm." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 12. Pantomime and finale. On {{the small}} stage an aged king wearing a crown enters slowly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> a queen whose {{features}} and costume {{are similar to}} those of Queen Gertrude. Hamlet, whose eyes never leave the face of King Claudius, narrates the action of the mimed play (Hamlet: C'est le vieux Roi Gonzague et la Reine Genièvre [...] "This is the aged King Gonzago and Queen Guinevere"). The play proceeds as follows: With protestations of love Guinevere leads Gonzago to a lonely spot. The drowsy king soon falls asleep in her arms. The villain enters. She holds out a cup, he seizes it, and pours the fatal potion, then takes the crown and places it on his head.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin D. Roosevelt was a {{good friend}} of Clark Griffith, and had {{attended}} games at the stadium since his days as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the 1910s. When FDR returned to Washington in 1933 as president, Griffith visited the White House early every season to give Roosevelt season passes; he also constructed a special ramp at the ballpark that accommodated the president's special mobility needs after his bout with polio in 1921. On Opening Day in 1941, Roosevelt stood up in the stadium's presidential box <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arm</b> <b>of</b> a military aide, and threw out the first pitch. In 1942 Clark Griffith urged Roosevelt to keep baseball going during the war. Griffith took credit after Roosevelt's initial [...] "Green Light letter", which allowed baseball to continue.|$|E
