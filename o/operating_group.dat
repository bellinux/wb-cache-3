40|$|For this study, we {{reviewed}} {{a series of}} 564 consecutive SAH among which 72 cases (12. 7 %) were older than 65 years. Etiology of SAH was: arterial aneurysms (65), arteriovenous malformations (1), unknown origin (6). Among the 65 aneurysms, 28 operated cases were between 65 - 69 years old. One year after surgery, the results are: GOS 1 and 2 : 22 cases (57 %); GOS 3 : 4 cases; GOS 5 : 13 cases. In the non <b>operated</b> <b>group,</b> 19 cases died (73 %) and among the alive patients, one was GOS 2 (4 %), 5 GOS 3 and 1 GOS 4. In the <b>operated</b> <b>group,</b> mortality is similar to other published series. In the non <b>operated</b> <b>group,</b> mortality is unsurprisingly higher (73 %) than in the <b>operated</b> <b>group,</b> but also than in the literature. An explanation could be found with analyses of the income of our patient whose many are not referred cases from other hospital. Our analysis confirmed that the severity of SAH after 65 years is increasing. The raise of anterior communicating aneurysms location is demonstrated. Operative indication and timing are dependent of neurological grading, general condition and secondarily of the location and anatomy of the aneurysm.

40|$|Introduction: Corrosive gastroesophagitis {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in surgery and though multidiciplinary approach is used in these patients, prognosis of such patient is poor. In this retrospective study we selected patients with corrosive gastroesophagitis who had referred to Loqman hospital in the last decade and the results of treatment were analyzed. Methods: We analyzed patients with corrosive gastroesophagitis who had referred to Loqman hospital in the last decade retrospectively. Factors included age, sex, grade, substance use, surgery option and results of endoscopy. Results: In this study, 88 patients were evaluated. Most of the patients were men (64 %) in the 31 - 40 years age group and the most common substance involved was acid (42 %), cleaning (25 %) and alkaline (15 %) solutions. Mortality on the base of grading was: grade I= 0 %, grade II = 8. 5 % and grade III= 64 %. Endoscopy results in <b>operated</b> <b>group</b> were as follows: 48 % ulcer and 26 % stricture, while in the non <b>operated</b> <b>group</b> 7 % had ulcers and 46 % strictures. Mortality was 59 % in the <b>operated</b> <b>group</b> and 80 % in the non <b>operated</b> <b>group.</b> But all grade III patients had dysphagia. Conclusion: In grade II corrosive esophagitis, gastritis surgery is the best option for decreasing morbidity, but in grade III patients, surgery has a very poor prognosis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} morphologic changes, {{as well as}} chondroprotective and intra-articular effects of meloxicam on joint repair in rabbits induced by experimental trochleoplasty, minimizing possible adverse side effects. MethodsThirty-five rabbits were divided into four groups: the control group, which did not undergo surgery, and <b>operated</b> <b>groups,</b> which used different ways of administering the anti-inflammatory agent: systemic, 0. 2 mg/kg; intra-articular, 0. 5 mg/kg; positive group control, without meloxicam. Each <b>operated</b> <b>group</b> was divided according to the periods of 7 or 30 days evaluation after surgery. ResultsRegarding macroscopic and histological evaluation of cartilage, after 30 days, most animals showed almost complete joint repair, the presence of few or no inflammatory cells; whereas part of the animals treated with meloxicam presented necrosis in the trochlear ridge and absence of inflammatory cells after 7 days. In positive control group, it was observed moderate inflammation and connective tissue proliferation. None of the animals in the <b>operated</b> <b>groups</b> showed irregularities 30 days after surgery.
