40|$|The X-ray {{diffraction}} {{experiments on}} shocked rock and mineral analogs of particular significance to lunar geology are described. Materials naturally shocked by meteorite impact, nuclear-shocked, or artificially shocked {{in a flat}} plate accelerator were utilized. Four areas were outlined for investigation: powder diffractometer studies <b>of</b> <b>shocked</b> single crystal silicate minerals (quartz, orthoclase, oligoclase, pyroxene), powder diffractometer studies <b>of</b> <b>shocked</b> polycrystalline monomineralic samples (dunite), Debye-Scherrer studies of single grains <b>of</b> <b>shocked</b> granodiorite, and powder diffractometer studies <b>of</b> <b>shocked</b> whole rock samples. Quantitative interpretation <b>of</b> peak <b>shock</b> pressures experienced by materials found in lunar or terrestrial impact structures is presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a number <b>of</b> essays on <b>shocks</b> in deterministic growth models. We aimed at two things in this dissertation. First, to sharpen our understanding on the growth impact of drastic changes such as market shocks, natural shocks, and policy shocks. A {{better understanding of the}} role <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in growth processes helped us to identify (and hopefully to fill-up) gaps in the field of economic modeling and to use these findings to raise new questions. Second, we intended to initiate background work for analyzing the growth implications <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in a taxonomy. The issue <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> has clearly not been analyzed sufficiently and systematically in the (deterministic) growth literature, even if many studies used some notion <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in their analysis in one way or another. This dissertation intends to provide a more systematic treatment <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in deterministic growth models. ...|$|R

Amelia mourns the loss of Arrow, and suspects Jim of failing to secure the lifelines, while in fact Arrow's line was cut by a ruthless insectoid crew member named Scroop.|$|E
40|$|Shock {{is a term}} of {{art that}} pervades modern {{economics}} appearing in {{nearly a quarter of}} all journal articles in economics and in nearly half in macroeconomics. Surprisingly, its rise as an essential element in the vocabulary of economists can be dated only to the early 1970 s. The paper traces the history <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in macroeconomics from Frisch and Slutzky in the 1920 s and 1930 s through real-business-cycle and DSGE models and to the use <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> as generators <b>of</b> impulse-response functions, which are in turn used as data in matching estimators. The history is organized around the observability <b>of</b> <b>shocks.</b> Aswell as documenting a critical conceptual development in economics, the history <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> provides a case study that illustrates, but also suggests the limitations of, the distinction drawn by the philosophers of science James Bogen and James Woodward between data and phenomena. The history <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> shows that this distinction must be substantially relativized {{if it is to be}} at all plausible...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} structure <b>of</b> flare-associated interplanetary <b>shocks</b> is {{investigated by}} examining the properties <b>of</b> 116 <b>shocks</b> which originated in solar flare events during a 18. 7 -year period commencing mid-May 1967. The best average representation <b>of</b> these <b>shocks</b> is an expansion which is uniform over about 100 deg. The highest compression ratio across the shock is about 15 deg west of the radial from the flare site. The loose coupling <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> and their drivers {{is supported by the}} observation that drivers are generally only detected for shocks originating near central meridian. A comparison of the numbers <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> per year with the numbers of sudden commencement geomagnetic storms indicates that the percentage <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> at 1 AU which originate in flare events is less than 50 percent. Many shock-flare associations made in the past are probably in error...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to study quantitatively the effects on {{macroeconomics}} due to different shocks. The interactions between different shocks are the major subjects. Furthermore, the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>shocks,</b> i. e, the time evolutions <b>of</b> <b>shocks,</b> and the propagation <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> {{are studied in detail}} by using the quantitative models. The approach of this paper can be applied to any economic shocks, particularly, price shocks, technology shocks, unemployment shocks, and outer capital flow shocks. As an example, we investigate the interaction <b>of</b> price <b>shock</b> and exchange rate shock. At the same time, we also discuss the macroeconomic policy’s effects on economic business cycle...|$|R
5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state <b>of</b> <b>shock</b> at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E

30|$|Particle {{acceleration}} {{in multiple}} shocks {{has been treated}} theoretically by Melrose and Pope (1993). They considered a system where “seed” particles initially given at the location <b>of</b> the <b>shock</b> waves are continuously accelerated by a sequence <b>of</b> identical <b>shock</b> waves. Furthermore, they concluded that the energy spectrum becomes n(p)∝ p^- 1 for infinite number <b>of</b> <b>shocks,</b> where n(p) is the density distribution function. The spectrum for dual shocks is harder than that <b>of</b> a single <b>shock</b> whose compression ratio is 4. Recently, Zhao and Li (2014) performed test particle simulations for a pair <b>of</b> parallel <b>shocks</b> approaching each other. They included magnetic turbulence and calculated the equation of motion and pitch-angle diffusion of particles. Their calculations showed that the power-law spectrum index for a pair <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> is harder than that <b>of</b> a single <b>shock,</b> and the maximum energy is greater than that <b>of</b> a single <b>shock.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{disadvantage}} of EMU {{is the lack}} of national monetary policy to absorb country-specific <b>shocks.</b> The seriousness <b>of</b> this depends on the availability of alternative adjustment mechanisms, {{as well as on the}} asymmetry of the demand and supply shocks within EMU. Previous empirical research on the asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> mainly focused on correlation coefficients between the shocks for some specific period. Therefore, it does not give a proper picture of the development of the symmetry <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> in the EMU. The aim of this paper is to analyse empirically whether shocks in EMU became more or less symmetric. By using a moving principal component analysis the development of the symmetry <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> will be much clearer. The results suggest that within EMU the symmetry <b>of</b> demand <b>shocks</b> increased during the last two decades, whilst the symmetry <b>of</b> the supply <b>shocks</b> also rose slightly.

We find that the persistence <b>of</b> <b>shocks</b> can vary widely depending on the individual commodity and the time period.

5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases <b>of</b> <b>shock.</b> Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
