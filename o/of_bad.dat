5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith. Similarly, the existence <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite {{the existence of}} statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> faith, the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{high degree}} of {{symmetry}} between economic goods and economic bads. Snow, litter and street mud are cited as examples. Economic growth obviously results in an increase in the supply <b>of</b> <b>bads</b> as well as goods. In addition, however, because it raises the value of time it can turn goods into bads and it can result in an end to the transformation <b>of</b> <b>bads</b> into goods. This is illustrated in some detail by two case studies for nineteenth century London, relating to domestic refuse and to horse manure. As a result of economic growth, horse manure had almost ceased to be an economic good and had become an economic bad {{by the end of the}} century. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{strategic}} model of network interdiction in a non-cooperative game of flow. A security agency operates a network with arc capacities. An adversary, endowed with a bounded quantity <b>of</b> <b>bads,</b> chooses a flow that specifies {{a plan for}} carrying bads through the network from a base to a target. Simultaneously, the agency chooses a blockage, which specifies a plan for blocking the transport <b>of</b> <b>bads</b> through arcs in the network. However, the blockage of arcs disrupts {{the operation of the}} network. The adversary gains and the agency loses from the target damage and the network disruption. The adversary incurs the expense <b>of</b> carrying <b>bads.</b> We characterize the Nash equilibria in terms of the primitives of our model. Our model contributes to the literature of game theory by introducing non-cooperative behavior into a Kalai-Zemel type mode of a (cooperative) game of flow. Our research also advances models and results on network interdiction. Network interdiction, Noncooperative game of flow, Blockage, Nash equilibrium, Kalai- Zemel game of flow...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{identification}} <b>of</b> multiple <b>bad</b> data, {{especially when}} mutually interacting, {{may be difficult}} to handle, since the well known procedures based on the normalized or weighted residuals may become faulty. In such a case, successive elimination of the measurement with the largest normalized residual may result in the suppression of correct measurements instead <b>of</b> the <b>bad</b> data. Then the problem <b>of</b> identifying <b>bad</b> data is considered as a combinatorial decision procedure. In this paper, binary PSO is used for the identification <b>of</b> multiple <b>bad</b> data in the power system state estimation. The proposed binary PSO based procedures behave satisfactorily in the identifying multiple bad data. The test is carried out with reference to the IEEE- 14 bus system...|$|R

5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> weather.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} whether bad news on a company {{impacts on the}} {{correlations}} between the equity return of the company and those of other companies based on the Japanese equity data in 1997, when some of major financial institutions bankrupted. We define "contagion" or "exclusion" as a significant increase or decrease, respectively, in the correlation after the announcement <b>of</b> the <b>bad</b> news. Our major findings are (1) whether the effect <b>of</b> the <b>bad</b> news is "contagion" or "exclusion" basically depends upon the nature <b>of</b> the <b>bad</b> news, (2) heteroskedasticity in the correlation has some influence on the identification <b>of</b> the <b>bad</b> news effect and it is important to adjust the heteroskedasticity in the correlation to correctly identify the effect...|$|R

Simultaneously, an agency chooses a blockage specifying a plan for blocking the transport <b>of</b> <b>bads</b> through arcs in the network. The bads carried to the target cause a target loss while the blocked arcs cause a network loss. The adversary earns and the agency loses from both target loss and network loss. The adversary incurs the expense <b>of</b> carrying <b>bads.</b> In this model we study Nash equilibria and find a power law relation between the probability {{and the extent of}} the target loss.
