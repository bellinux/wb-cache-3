5|$|November 26, 2011: The NBA <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> {{reached a}} {{tentative}} agreement {{to end the}} lockout.|$|E
5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on key issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{received}} a tepid response from sports fans, and provoked criticism from media members. It continued into January 1999, threatening {{cancellation of the}} entire season. After division within the players union, however, NBPA executive director Billy Hunter reached an agreement with NBA commissioner David Stern on January 6 to end the work stoppage. Quickly ratified by the <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players,</b> the deal was signed later in January, ending the lockout after 204 days. The settlement provided for maximum salaries for players and a pay scale for first-year players. In the months after the lockout, television ratings and ticket sales declined during the 50-game season, and both remained below pre-lockout levels in subsequent seasons.|$|E

5000|$|This season {{marked the}} first under the NBA's new Collective Bargaining Agreement, agreed upon by the <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> the <b>player</b> union on June 21.|$|R
25|$|In November 2005, MLB <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> {{approved}} {{even tougher}} penalties for positive tests {{than the ones}} in place during the 2005 season. Under the new rules, a first positive test {{would result in a}} 50-game suspension, a second positive test would result in a 100-game suspension, and a third positive test would result in a lifetime suspension from MLB.|$|E
25|$|The Oilers {{struggled}} with their small-market status for several years, {{but after the}} wiped-out 2004–05 season, they were aided by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the NHL <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players.</b> This included a league-wide salary cap that essentially forced all teams to conform to a budget, as the Oilers had been doing for years. A more reasonable conversion rate of Canadian dollar revenues to US dollar payroll {{in the new millennium}} also helped the Oilers to return to profitability. Because of this, Edmonton was able to acquire Chris Pronger (former winner of the Hart and Norris Trophies) and Michael Peca (two-time Frank J. Selke Trophy winner) before the 2005–06 season.|$|E
25|$|The 2012–13 NHL lockout {{lasted from}} September 15, 2012 to January 19, 2013, after the <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> failed {{to agree on}} a new {{collective}} bargaining agreement. The owners' original offer retained the framework established following the 2004–05 NHL lockout but made numerous changes to player salary and movement rights, including reducing the players' share of hockey-related revenues from 57 percent to 46 percent, introduce term limits on contracts, eliminate salary arbitration, and change free agency rules. As the deadline for work stoppage approached, the union unsuccessfully challenged the league's ability to lock out players of the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers (appealing to the Alberta Labour Relations Board), and the Montreal Canadiens (appealing to the Quebec Labour Relations Board).|$|E

50|$|The 1994-95 {{season was}} nearly {{cancelled}} {{due to a}} lockout, however, on January 11, 1995, an agreement was made between the NHL <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> the <b>players,</b> <b>and</b> a shortened 48 game schedule {{was used for the}} season.|$|R
50|$|Due to Veeck's {{arrival in}} 1959, Comiskey Park {{instantly}} became a ballpark {{filled with a}} series of promotional stunts which helped draw record crowds, the most obvious being the exploding fireworks Veeck installed in the scoreboard to celebrate home runs and victories. And in 1960, they became the first team in the history of sports to wear last names on the back of their jerseys, a Veeck innovation. Unlike Charles Comiskey, Veeck was considered a player-friendly <b>owner,</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> enjoyed playing for him.|$|R
25|$|However, both Bonds' {{accomplishments in}} the 2000s {{have not been}} without controversy. During his run, journalists {{questioned}} McGwire about {{his use of the}} steroid-precursor androstenedione, and in March 2005 was unforthcoming when questioned as part of a Congressional inquiry into steroids. Bonds has also been dogged by allegations of steroid use and his involvement in the BALCO drugs scandal, as his personal trainer Greg Anderson pleaded guilty to supplying steroids (without naming Bonds as a recipient). Neither Bonds nor McGwire has failed a drug test at any time since there was no steroid-testing until 2003 after the new August 7, 2002 agreement between <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> was reached. McGwire retired after the 2001 season; in 2010, he admitted to having used steroids throughout his MLB career.|$|E
25|$|The 2004–05 NHL lockout was a lockout that {{resulted}} in the cancellation of what would have been the 88th season of play of the National Hockey League (NHL). It {{was the first time the}} Stanley Cup was not awarded since 1919, and the first time a major professional sports league in North America canceled a complete season because of a labor dispute and the second time after the 1994–1995 MLB strike that the Playoffs of a major professional sports league in North America were cancelled. The lockout lasted 10 months and 6 days starting September 16, 2004, the day after the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NHL and the NHL Players Association (NHLPA) that resolved the 1994–95 lockout expired. The lockout of the 2004–2005 season resulted in 1,230 unplayed games. The negotiating teams reached an agreement on July 13, 2005, and the lockout officially ended 9 days later on July 22, after both the NHL <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> ratified the CBA.|$|E
500|$|The <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> union met on November 6, {{and they}} were joined again by federal {{mediator}} Cohen. The players proposed that they receive 51% of BRI, with a 1% portion taken out for retired players. The owners offered a [...] "band" [...] that would pay the players 49 to 51%, depending on revenue growth. Jeff Kessler, the union’s attorney, said the league's proposal was really 50.2% and called the possibility of reaching 51% an [...] "illusion". The league also proposed restrictions for teams that pay the luxury tax, banning them from sign and trade deals and limiting {{their use of the}} mid-level exception. They also proposed a [...] "repeater tax" [...] for teams that exceed the tax threshold thrice in a five-year span. Stern issued an ultimatum, giving the players until November 9 to accept the deal before it is lowered to 47% BRI and a flex salary cap.|$|E

500|$|The lockout {{prompted}} indifference {{among most}} American sports fans, {{who thought that}} greed was shown by both sides; the latter was a similar sentiment to what fans voiced during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. A CBS News–New York Times poll conducted in October 1998 showed that, while most fans' opinion of professional basketball was unaffected by the work stoppage, 29percent reported that their views had become more negative. The same poll showed that fans backed the NBPA in the dispute by a 36–29 margin, while the general public supported the owners 24percent to 22percent. One-quarter of basketball fans {{who responded to the}} poll stated {{that they did not know}} enough about the lockout to give an opinion, along with 45percent of the general public. Media members were frequently critical of the <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players.</b> Sportswriter Tony Kornheiser described the labor dispute as one [...] "between tall millionaires and short millionaires." [...] An article in Newsweek termed the lockout [...] "an incomprehensible and unconscionable dispute between rival gangs of millionaires". Time Bill Saporito believed that each side was damaged by the lockout, in terms of financial losses and negative publicity. Stern said that he had made concessions in the agreement, while Hunter said that the parties [...] "both blinked." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> {{met again}} on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days. [...] They met {{before a federal}} mediator, George Cohen—the {{director}} of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve the 2011 NFL lockout. At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't trust your gut. I got to trust my own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. Hunter said the owners told them, [...] "Take it or leave it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and prorate the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E
500|$|Reports of {{division}} among players and owners surfaced. Jason Whitlock of Foxsports.com wrote that Fisher was privately working with Stern on the 50–50 split and that Hunter confronted Fisher about the issue. Fisher and Stern denied {{a private meeting}} took place. In {{a letter to the}} players, Fisher called the reports [...] "absurd" [...] and demanded [...] "a retraction for the libelous and defamatory stories" [...] through his attorneys. Hunter said his [...] "relationship with Derek is very good. There was no confrontation". Fisher, as union president, is not empowered to make unilateral decisions for the union. While Fisher believed a 50–50 deal could be considered, Hunter maintained that the owners should never [...] "make the same or more than the players". Miami Heat owner Micky Arison, one of the owners willing to settle with players, responded to a fan complaining about greedy <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> on Twitter, saying that [...] "You are barking at the wrong owner." [...] He was fined $500,000 by Stern, five times larger than any previous amount against an owner for publicly commenting on the labor situation. Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis and Charlotte Bobcats owner Michael Jordan had been fined $100,000 each for public comments on the lockout. Leonsis had commented about the owners' desire for a hard salary cap, while Jordan told an Australian newspaper that the league's business model was [...] "broken", citing the owners' desire for revenue sharing. A group of 10 to 14 hardline owners, led by Jordan, wanted to cap the players' share of BRI at 50% and as low as 47. During the labor dispute in 1998, then-player Jordan told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin, [...] "If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team." [...] Whitlock called Jordan a [...] "sellout" [...] wanting [...] "current players to pay for his incompetence". He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, Stern left Proskauer Rose {{to become}} the NBA's General Counsel under Commisioner Larry O'Brien. By 1980, he was Executive Vice President of the NBA. During this time, two {{landmark}} decisions were reached with the NBA Players' Association: drug testing and team salary cap. The drug testing dealt with the perception that most basketball players used drugs, that the NBA admitted it had a problem, and it was cleaning it up. The salary cap created a revenue-sharing system where <b>owner</b> <b>and</b> <b>player</b> were effectively partners. Both of these agreements solidified Stern's standing inside NBA circles.|$|R
500|$|In 2011, Borislow {{purchased}} a controlling {{share of the}} Washington Freedom women's professional soccer team. He had a brief turbulent relationship with other <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> the <b>players</b> which ended in a battle of law suits and the termination of the soccer team and league.|$|R
2500|$|The Expos {{franchise}} {{was saved}} {{by a new}} collective bargaining agreement between the <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> that forbade contraction until at least 2006. Speculation of contraction was replaced by rumours of relocation, as it was obvious MLB {{did not intend to}} keep the team in Montreal. While MLB was not ready to relocate the Expos right away, in [...] it sought to increase revenues by having the team play 22 of its 81 home games in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Expos again found themselves in contention for the playoffs: on August 29, the team was tied with four other clubs for the National League Wild Card spot. When MLB's rosters expanded on September 1, Selig announced that the Expos would not be recalling any additional players from the minor leagues: the other owners had decided against spending a few extra thousand dollars, {{a small fraction of the}} team's $35 million payroll, to bolster the team. Several players, including relief pitcher Eric Knott, were sent back to the minors due to budget constraints. The team faded again, finishing 18 games out of first in the East and eight games out of the wild card spot. [...] Later, Minaya said that the denial of the September call-ups was [...] "a message to the players" [...] and [...] "a momentum killer." [...] Keri later wrote that MLB's refusal to authorize the September call-ups eroded what goodwill the Expos still had among the Montreal fanbase. [...] After the season, Guererro was lost to free agency, while staff ace Javier Vázquez was traded to the Yankees.|$|E
2500|$|But {{his most}} {{important}} decision came in the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) had negotiated contracts eight times, and each time a strike action of varying length had occurred. By the spring of 1994, {{the possibility of a}} strike was rising, as <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>players</b> argued over a salary cap, revenue-sharing (which would [...] "tax" [...] the sport's top money-making teams and redistribute the funds to the weakest teams), and the extent of salary arbitration. The NLRB was closely monitoring the situation, (in no small part because Chairman Gould was an avid baseball fan). On July 28, the MLBPA set a deadline of August 12, 1994, for a new collective bargaining agreement or it would strike. The strike began on August 12, but despite the appointment of former Secretary of Labor William Usery, Jr. as a special mediator on October 13 the World Series was cancelled {{for the first time in}} history. On December 22, the owners unilaterally imposed a salary cap and eliminated salary arbitration. On Christmas Eve, MLB announced it would start spring training with strikebreaker players. Two days later, the owners and the players' association both filed unfair labor practice (ULP) complaints with the NLRB, with each side claiming the other had not negotiated in good faith. Meanwhile, the NLRB had initiated its own investigation into the strike (led by NLRB Regional Director Dan Silverman and NLRB General Counsel Fred Feinstein). The key issue for the board was whether the legal rules of negotiation had been followed. Under American labor law, the employer is permitted to implement its last offer if an impasse had been reached. But the two sides had been negotiating since November, and it was not entirely clear that an impasse had been reached. Congress was considering legislation to make baseball subject to United States antitrust law, and on January 26 President Bill Clinton announced that the two sides would have to make major progress to an agreement by February 6 or the federal government would intervene. On February 3, the owners unilaterally lifted their salary cap. But with no agreement even close, Usery hinted that he would recommend a legislative solution (perhaps removing the antitrust exemption, perhaps imposing binding arbitration) to the President. But Republicans in Congress (who had just won control of the House and Senate) signaled they would not enact any such legislation.|$|E
