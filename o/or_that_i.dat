500|$|Aaron Ramsey, {{who scored}} Arsenal's winning {{goal in the}} FA Cup final, was adamant their recent success would make his {{teammates}} determined to win more. He aimed for victory in the Community Shield, as it would provide a platform for {{what he described as}} [...] "a tough opening couple of games in the Premier League." [...] Samir Nasri, who left Arsenal to join Manchester City in 2011, in the lead-up to the match described the abuse he received from Arsenal supporters since his transfer as [...] "stupid." [...] He went on to explain: [...] "They see it as treason <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> betrayed them but it’s not like that. I just look what’s best for me ... For the fans the only reason [...] has to be for the money. But it isn’t just for the money." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thomas {{testified that}} the accusations against him were false and that, [...] "I deny each and every single {{allegation}} against me today that suggested {{in any way that}} I had conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with Anita Hill, that I ever attempted to date her, that I ever had any personal sexual interest in her, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> in any way ever harassed her." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 14, 2012, Bowles gave an {{interview}} with The Daily Caller where he asserted {{that he is not}} [...] "backing away" [...] from his praise of Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan. Said Bowles: “I think he's smart. I think he's intellectually curious. I think he is honest, straightforward and sincere. And I think he does have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean I agree with it {{by any stretch of the}} imagination. But I'm not going to act like I don't like him <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't have some real respect for him." [...] Along with his praise of Ryan he also had criticism of the current government.|$|E
2500|$|Ethan Allen's Reason {{addresses}} {{the topics of}} original sin, theodicy and several others in classic Enlightenment fashion. In Chapter 3, section IV, he notes that [...] "omnipotence itself" [...] could not exempt animal life from mortality, since change and death are defining attributes of such life. He argues, [...] "the one cannot be without the other, any more than {{there could be a}} compact number of mountains without valleys, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature." [...] Labeled by his friends a Deist, Allen accepted the notion of a divine being, though throughout Reason he argues that even a divine being must be circumscribed by logic.|$|E
2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but I never felt {{comfortable}} in the band. I never felt like it was my band <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E

2500|$|Anscombe also {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. When a set of facts xyz stands in this relation to a fact A, they are a subset out of a range some subset among which holds if A holds. Thus if A is the fact that I have paid for something, the brute facts might be that I have handed him a cheque for a sum which he has named as the price for the goods, saying that this is the payment, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> gave him some cash {{at the time that he}} gave me the goods. There tends, according to Anscombe, to be an institutional context which gives its point to the description 'A', but of which 'A' is not itself a description: that I have given someone a shilling is not a description of the institution of money or of the currency of the country. According to her, no brute facts xyz can generally be said to entail the fact A relative to which they are 'brute' except with the proviso [...] "under normal circumstances", for [...] "one cannot mention all the things that were not the case, which would have made a difference if they had been." [...] A set facts xyz... may be brute relative to a fact A which itself is one of a set of facts ABC... which is brute relative to some further fact W. Thus brute facts are not a distinct class of facts, to be distinguished from another class, 'institutional facts': the essential concept to grasp here is that of a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. The term 'brute facts' had a major role to play in John Searle's philosophy of speech acts and institutional reality.|$|E
