5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve <b>our</b> <b>deepest</b> gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
500|$|Slaughterhouse-Five {{received}} generally positive reviews, with Michael Crichton {{writing in}} The New Republic, [...] "he {{writes about the}} most excruciatingly painful things. His novels have attacked <b>our</b> <b>deepest</b> fears of automation and the bomb, <b>our</b> <b>deepest</b> political guilts, our fiercest hatreds and loves. No one else writes books on these subjects; they are inaccessible to normal novelists." [...] The book went immediately {{to the top of}} The New York Times Best Seller list. Vonnegut's earlier works had appealed strongly to many college students, and the antiwar message of Slaughterhouse-Five resonated with a generation marked by the Vietnam War. He later stated that the loss of confidence in government that Vietnam caused finally allowed for an honest conversation regarding events like Dresden.|$|E

As a wedding present, Sir Moses Montefiore, a banker and philanthropist, presented Beatrice and Henry with a silver tea service inscribed: [...] "Many daughters have acted virtuously, but thou excellest them all." [...] The Times newspaper, shortly before Beatrice's marriage, wrote: [...] "The devotion of your Royal Highness to our beloved Sovereign has won our warmest admiration and <b>our</b> <b>deepest</b> gratitude.

500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... <b>our</b> <b>deepest</b> needs are met as well!" ...|$|E

Certainly, India is a very developed government with its own domestic services or capabilities to provide emergency assistance. That said, it’s something we normally do especially in the cases of strong partners like India, where we offer whatever assistance we can in the aftermath of natural disasters."

In a special gesture, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon visited the Permanent Mission of India to the UN and signed a condolence book.

500|$|A love poem, [...] "The Good-Morrow" [...] is thematically {{centred on}} several concepts. The poem is {{primarily}} {{to do with}} evolving love; the movement from pure lust, in the first stanza, to a nascent and evolving spirituality which liberates the lovers because they no longer [...] "watch each other out of fear" [...] but can instead see clearly. The lovers' faith in each other allows them to be brave, unlike the Seven Sleepers, who were forced out of fear to hide their beliefs; with love, the lovers can allow others to pursue their own dreams, accepting that [...] "Let us possess one world; each hath one, and is one" [...] – with each other, {{there is no need}} to search further for adventure. Harold Bloom notes the intertwining of both sensual and spiritual love, arguing that Donne is suggesting that it is impossible for those buried in sensual love, [...] "busying themselves in mundane matters", to experience true love. Donne's emphasis on the importance of spiritual love can be seen from the biblical allusions; Achsah Guibbory states that the tone and wording of the poem is an intentional reference to Paul the Apostle's description of divine, agapic love; [...] "At moments like these...eros merges with agape. Walls collapse, the veil parts, we know as we are known; <b>our</b> <b>deepest,</b> truest selves exposed". Alfred W. Satterthwaite, writing in The Explicator, argues that the story of the Seven Sleepers itself contains this theme; in the story, the Sleepers awoke to find themselves [...] "thunderstruck" [...] in their new environment, something analogous to [...] "the radiant revelation love grants to the lovers in the poem".|$|E

40|$|Computational {{prediction}} of membrane protein (MP) structures is very challenging partially {{due to lack}} of sufficient solved structures for homology modeling. Recently direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA) sheds some light on protein contact prediction and accordingly, contact-assisted folding, but DCA is effective only on some very large-sized families since it uses information only in a single protein family. This paper presents a deep transfer learning method that can significantly improve MP contact prediction by learning contact patterns and complex sequence-contact relationship from thousands of non-membrane proteins (non-MPs). Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs, <b>our</b> <b>deep</b> model (learned from only non-MPs) has top L/ 10 long-range contact prediction accuracy 0. 69, better than <b>our</b> <b>deep</b> model trained by only MPs (0. 63) and much better than a representative DCA method CCMpred (0. 47) and the CASP 11 winner MetaPSICOV (0. 55). The accuracy of <b>our</b> <b>deep</b> model can be further improved to 0. 72 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs. When only contacts in transmembrane regions are evaluated, our method has top L/ 10 long-range accuracy 0. 62, 0. 57, and 0. 53 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, by non-MPs only, and by MPs only, respectively, still much better than MetaPSICOV (0. 45) and CCMpred (0. 40). All these results suggest that sequence-structure relationship learned by <b>our</b> <b>deep</b> model from non-MPs generalizes well to MP contact prediction. Improved contact prediction also leads to better contact-assisted folding. Using only top predicted contacts as restraints, <b>our</b> <b>deep</b> learning method can fold 160 and 200 of 510 MPs with TMscore> 0. 6 when trained by non-MPs only and by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, respectively, while CCMpred and MetaPSICOV can do so for only 56 and 77 MPs, respectively. Our contact-assisted folding also greatly outperforms homology modeling...|$|R
