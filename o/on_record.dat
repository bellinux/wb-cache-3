5|$|Cyclone Gonu set several {{intensity}} records. When {{it became}} a very severe cyclonic storm on June 3, Gonu became the strongest tropical cyclone <b>on</b> <b>record</b> in the Arabian Sea. Later, it became the only super cyclonic storm, which is a tropical cyclone with 3-minute sustained winds of at least 220km/h (140mph), in the region. The JTWC estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph). Based on their estimate, Gonu was tied with the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone for the strongest tropical cyclone in the entire northern Indian Ocean, and had the highest windspeed of any cyclone in this basin. On June 6, Gonu made landfall in extreme eastern Oman with winds of 150km/h (90mph), making it the strongest tropical cyclone <b>on</b> <b>record</b> to strike the Arabian Peninsula. With a damage total of $4.2billion (2007USD) and 50deaths, Gonu became the worst natural disaster <b>on</b> <b>record</b> in Oman. Additionally, the storm was only the second cyclonic storm <b>on</b> <b>record</b> to strike Iran, the other doing so on June 4, 1898.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of June24, Hurricane Celia {{intensified}} into a powerful Category5 storm, further solidifying it as the strongest of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season. At its peak, the cyclone attained winds of 160mph (260km/h) along with a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). This ranks it as the second-strongest June hurricane <b>on</b> <b>record,</b> {{as well as the}} eleventh-strongest in the basin, and the second known Category5 to develop during the month <b>on</b> <b>record.</b> The strongest and first known storm of this intensity in June was Hurricane Ava in 1973. Additionally, it also marked the first time <b>on</b> <b>record</b> that two consecutive seasons featured Category5 hurricanes, with Hurricane Rick in October 2009 reaching this intensity, the second time two consecutive seasons had a category 5 hurricane was when hurricanes Marie and Patricia formed in 2014 and 2015 respectively. In the National Hurricane Center's monthly tropical weather summary for June 2010, it was stated that the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) for the month was the highest <b>on</b> <b>record,</b> most of which is attributed to Hurricane Celia.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, Ana {{became the}} second {{subtropical}} cyclone <b>on</b> <b>record</b> in the Atlantic basin {{in the month}} of April, after a subtropical storm in 1992.

5|$|A {{total of}} 16 {{tropical}} depressions were recorded, of which 15 further intensified into tropical storms. Of those 15, {{a total of}} 7 strengthened into hurricanes, while 4 attained their peaks as major hurricanes. Activity began with Alex which, upon making landfall in the Azores, became the first January landfalling tropical cyclone since Hurricane Alice in the 1954 season. In June, tropical storms Colin and Danielle became the earliest third and fourth named storms, respectively, <b>on</b> <b>record.</b> Hermine moved ashore the coastline of Florida as a Category1 hurricane on September2, ending the record hurricane drought {{that began in the}} state after the 2005 season's Hurricane Wilma. In late September and early October, Hurricane Matthew wrought destruction throughout the Caribbean Sea and Southeastern United States, resulting in $15.09 billion (2016 USD) in damage and 603 deaths; it remains the ninth-costliest hurricane <b>on</b> <b>record</b> in the Atlantic, as well as the tenth-costliest in the United States. In mid-October, Hurricane Nicole ascended to Category4 intensity and remained a major hurricane while directly impacting Bermuda, the first storm of such strength to do so since Hurricane Fabian in the 2003 season. The season concluded with Hurricane Otto, the latest-forming major hurricane <b>on</b> <b>record</b> in the Atlantic and the first cyclone to cross from the basin while maintaining tropical characteristics into the East Pacific since Hurricane Cesar–Douglas.|$|E

5|$|Damage from Diane was {{heaviest}} in Connecticut, where rainfall {{peaked at}} 16.86in (428mm) near Torrington. The storm produced the state's largest flood <b>on</b> <b>record,</b> which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30stream gauges reported their highest levels <b>on</b> <b>record.</b> The Connecticut River at Hartford reached a water level of 30.6ft (9.3m), the third highest <b>on</b> <b>record</b> there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown Winsted, {{much of which}} was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the 1938 Long Island hurricane, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184people and destroyed 813houses, with another 14,000homes heavily damaged. Monetary losses totaled $754.7million, although the inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1billion. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was retired.|$|E

5|$|During the year, a {{total of}} 17tropical cyclones, 15tropical storms, six {{hurricane}}s and two major hurricanes formed. The most intense hurricane, Dean, tied for the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded {{as well as the}} third most intense Atlantic hurricane at landfall. The season was one of only four <b>on</b> <b>record</b> for the Atlantic with more than one Category5 storm. It was the second <b>on</b> <b>record</b> in which an Atlantic hurricane, Felix, and an eastern Pacific hurricane, Henriette, made landfall on the same day. September had a record-tying eight storms, although the strengths and durations of most of the storms were low. Aside from Dean and Felix, none of the storms exceeded Category1 intensity.|$|E
5|$|Ekeka is {{most unusual}} for its {{formation}} in January. Tropical cyclones rarely form {{east of the}} International Date Line outside of the tropical cyclone season, which starts May 15 in the eastern Pacific and June 1 in the central Pacific, and ends on November 30 in both regions. In the official Pacific hurricane database, Ekeka was the second tropical cyclone <b>on</b> <b>record</b> to occur in January or February within the Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line, after Tropical Storm Winona of 1989. It is third earliest cyclone <b>on</b> <b>record</b> within the basin, behind Hurricane Pali of 2016, and the aforementioned Winona.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Able in 1951 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the earliest forming major hurricane– a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding – however following post-storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder; as it became a major hurricane on June8. Though it developed within the bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season, Hurricane Audrey in 1957 became the earliest developing Category4 hurricane <b>on</b> <b>record</b> after it reached the intensity on June27. However, reanalysis from 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3, making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 <b>on</b> <b>record</b> on July 8, 2005. The earliest-forming Category5 hurricane, Emily, reached the highest intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on July17, 2005.|$|E
