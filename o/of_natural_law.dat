5|$|It was Newton's {{conception}} of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that {{became one of the}} seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.|$|E
5|$|American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism, {{political}} philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, {{the modern}} debate between rationalism and empiricism, {{and the influence}} <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> as influences {{on the development of}} Kant's ethics. Other philosophers have argued that Kant's parents and his teacher, Martin Knutzen, influenced his ethics. Those influenced by Kantian ethics include philosopher Jürgen Habermas, political philosopher John Rawls, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision-making and for denying human nature. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being prescriptive. Michael Stocker has argued that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship, while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations. The Catholic Church has criticised Kant's ethics as contradictory and regards Christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics.|$|E

25|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> {{was very}} {{important}} {{in the development of}} the English common law. In the struggles between Parliament and the monarch, Parliament often made reference to the Fundamental Laws of England, which were at times said to embody natural law principles since time immemorial and set limits on the power of the monarchy. According to William Blackstone, however, natural law might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of equity, but was not itself identical with the laws of England. Nonetheless, the implication <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> and advocates of legal positivism, like Jeremy Bentham, have also been staunch critics of the common law.|$|E

In libertarian Christianity, the existence <b>of</b> Bible-based <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> is a prerequisite to the discovery <b>of</b> Bible-based <b>natural</b> rights, because such natural rights are a subset <b>of</b> such <b>natural</b> <b>law.</b> Along with a Bible-based concept of the social contract, Bible-based <b>natural</b> <b>law</b> and Bible-based <b>natural</b> rights are {{the core of the}} libertarian Christian’s Bible-based political and legal philosophy.

25|$|Spencer's {{interest}} in psychology {{derived from a}} more fundamental concern which was to establish the universality <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law.</b> In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman's salon, he was possessed {{with the idea of}} demonstrating {{that it was possible to}} show that everything in the universe – including human culture, language, and morality – could be explained by laws of universal validity. This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, were beyond the realm of scientific investigation. Comte's Système de Philosophie Positive had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality <b>of</b> <b>natural</b> <b>law,</b> and Spencer was to follow Comte in the scale of his ambition. However, Spencer differed from Comte in believing it was possible to discover a single law of universal application which he identified with progressive development and was to call the principle of evolution.|$|E
