25|$|The eastern/mountain bongo’s {{survival}} in the wild is dependent on more effective protection of the surviving remnant populations in Kenya. If this does not occur, it will eventually become extinct in the wild. The existence of a healthy captive population of this subspecies <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> for its reintroduction.|$|E
25|$|The first {{materials}} {{considered for}} cellulosic biofuel included plant matter from agricultural waste, yard waste, sawdust and paper. Professors R. Malcolm Brown Jr. and David Nobles, Jr. of the University of Texas at Austin developed cyanobacteria {{that had the}} potential to produce cellulose, glucose and sucrose, the latter two easily converted into ethanol. This <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> to create ethanol without plant matter.|$|E
25|$|Stem cell transplantation, {{particularly}} in younger (i.e. less than 40 years of age) and more severely affected patients, <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> for curative therapy.

25|$|Laminar-flow {{control is}} a {{technology}} that <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> for significant improvement in drag coefficient which would provide improvements in aircraft fuel usage, range or endurance that far exceed any known single aeronautical technology. In principle, if 80 percent of wing is laminar, then overall drag could be reduced by 25 percent. The frictional force between {{the air and the}} aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations (boundary layer suction).|$|E
500|$|Liquid-dominated {{reservoirs}} (LDRs) {{were more}} common with temperatures greater than [...] and are found near young volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean and in rift zones and hot spots. Flash plants are the common way {{to generate electricity}} from these sources. Pumps are generally not required, powered instead when the water turns to steam. Most wells generate 2-10 MWe. Steam is separated from liquid via cyclone separators, while the liquid is returned to the reservoir for reheating/reuse. As of 2013, the largest liquid system is Cerro Prieto in Mexico, which generates 750 MWe from temperatures reaching [...] The Salton Sea field in Southern California <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> of generating 2000 MWe.|$|E
2500|$|Each cell of {{the body}} {{contains}} the hereditary information (DNA) wrapped up in structures called chromosomes. [...] Since genetic syndromes are typically the result of alterations of the chromosomes or genes, there is no treatment currently available that can correct the genetic alterations in every cell {{of the body}}. [...] Therefore, there is currently no [...] "cure" [...] for genetic disorders. [...] However, for many genetic syndromes there is treatment available to manage the symptoms. [...] In some cases, particularly inborn errors of metabolism, the mechanism of disease is well understood and <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> for dietary and medical management to prevent or reduce the long-term complications. [...] In other cases, infusion therapy is used to replace the missing enzyme. [...] Current research is actively seeking to use gene therapy or other new medications to treat specific genetic disorders.|$|E
