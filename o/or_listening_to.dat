500|$|Although {{nearly all}} users {{understand}} that the Slender Man is not real, they suspend that disbelief {{in order to become}} more engrossed when telling <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> stories. This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend dialectic. This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, George Noory's Coast to Coast AM, a radio call-in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man. Two years later, an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune described his origins as [...] "difficult to pinpoint."

2500|$|The {{stethoscope}} [...] is {{an acoustic}} medical device for auscultation, <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the internal sounds {{of an animal}} or human body.

It is also used to listen to intestines and blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used for measurements of blood pressure. Less commonly, [...] "mechanic's stethoscopes", equipped with rod shaped chestpieces, are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines (for example, sounds and vibrations emitted by worn ball bearings), such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts. Stethoscopes {{can also be used to}} check scientific vacuum chambers for leaks, and for various other small-scale acoustic monitoring tasks.

Allmusic's Greg Maurer's found [...] "a fascination with the dark, (self-)destructive side of religion is more than evident in his later work... While {{there might not be}} any of the explicit Biblical imagery on [...] that Cave would later ejaculate, the title ... is apt". McFarlane stated it showed the band was [...] "irrevocably and unashamedly changing for the better, being more aggressive than anything they had ever recorded". Sound Stage Direct described it as [...] "a creepy carnival of tribal rhythms, wonky discordance and garbled surrealism". Music critic, Ed St John summarised, [...] "this is an expression which ebbs out beyond the confines of proficiently played music ... is akin to watching a film of Jackson Pollock painting <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Dylan Thomas in full alcoholic flight".|$|E
2500|$|The Emperor did not {{normally}} get up until noon, had brunch at about 2pm before {{going back to}} bed for another rest, to be followed up by playing tennis or table tennis, riding his bicycle or his car aimlessly around {{the grounds of the}} palace <b>or</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> his vast collection of Chinese opera records. Puyi become a devoted Buddhist, a mystic and a vegetarian, having statues of the Buddha put up all over the Salt Tax Palace for him to pray to while banning his staff from eating meat. Puyi's Buddhism led him to ban his staff from killing insects or mice, but if he found any insects or mice droppings in his food, the cooks were flogged. When Puyi went into the gardens to mediate before a statue of the Buddha, there always had to be complete silence, and as there were two loud Japanese cranes living in the garden, the emperor always had his servants flogged if the cranes made a sound. One day when out for a stroll in the gardens, Puyi found that a servant had written in chalk on one of the rocks: [...] "Haven't the Japanese humiliated you enough?" [...] When Puyi received guests at the Salt Tax Palace, he gave them long lectures on the [...] "glorious" [...] history of the Qing as a form of masochism, comparing the great Qing Emperors with himself, a miserable man living as a prisoner in his own palace. The Empress Wanrong retreated in seclusion as she became addicted to opium, and her father stopped visiting the Salt Tax Palace as he could not bear to see what she had become. Wanrong, who detested her husband, liked to mock him behind his back by performing skits before the servants by putting on dark glasses and imitating Puyi's jerky movements. During his time in Tianjin, Puyi had started wearing dark glasses at all times, as during the interwar period wearing dark glasses in Tianjin was a way of signifying one was a homosexual or bisexual.|$|E
