30|$|In {{this paper}} we tackle the route {{bundling}} problem {{which consists of}} compounding multiple routes {{in a way that}} intermediate points minimize a global distance metric of multiple <b>origin–destinations</b> pairs. In this context, the ultimate goal in route bundling is to construct tree-like graph structures where the anchoring points, being roots of the tree structure, serve as coordinating locus for the joint transport of information, goods and people.|$|R

An optimization model is proposed to determine which links should be invested for the system to perform better while encountering natural disasters such as earthquake. The connectivity reliability and travel time reliability of <b>origin-destinations</b> (ODs) are selected as performance measures to do so. The Monte-Carlo simulation method is used to estimate the reliability measures and the model is solved by the genetic algorithm.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to investigate the possibility of extending roadside survey forms so that they provide useful additional information on freight transport. This possibility would appear to be significant. Moreover, to a certain extent, {{there is a possibility that}} the conclusions presented in this paper might also apply to other types of surveys, especially national road freight surveys aimed at carriers. While these surveys do not offer the same opportunity as roadside surveys to obtain simultaneous information on <b>origin-destinations</b> and routes, and exclude by design the international transit trips, they are still a useful and widely used source of information on road freight transport. Extending these surveys along the lines presented in this paper could be a potential opportunity to improve our knowledge of freight transport.|$|R

This infrastructure has to be sufficiently survivable to restore the traffic in the event of a failure. Moreover, it should have adequate capacities so that the demands can be routed between the <b>origin-destinations.</b> In this paper we consider the Multilayer Capacitated Survivable IP Network Design problem. We study two variants of this problem with simple and multiple capacities. We give two multicommodity flow formulations for each variant of this problem and describe some valid inequalities. In particular, we characterize valid inequalities obtained using Chvatal-Gomory procedure from the well known Cutset inequalities. We show that some of these inequalities are facet defining. We discuss separation routines for all the valid inequalities. Using these results, we develop a Branch-and-Cut algorithm and a Branch-and-Cut-and-Price algorithm for each variant and present extensive computational results...|$|R
40|$|We propose Video Driven Traffic Modelling (VDTM) for {{accurate}} simulation of real-world traffic behaviours with detailed information and low-cost model development and maintenance. Computer vision techniques are employed to estimate traffic parameters. These parameters {{are used to}} build and update a traffic system model. The model is simulated using the Paramics traffic simulation platform. Based on the simulation techniques, effects of traffic interventions can be evaluated {{in order to achieve}} better decision makings for traffic management authorities. In this paper, traffic parameters such as vehicle types, times of starting trips and corresponding <b>origin-destinations</b> are extracted from a video. A road network is manually defined according to the traffic composition in the video, and individual vehicles associated with extracted properties are modelled and simulated within the defined road network using Paramics. VDTM has widespread potential applications in supporting traffic decision-makings. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we apply it in optimizing a traffic signal control system, which adaptively adjusts green times of signals at an intersection to reduce traffic congestion. <br /...|$|R

40|$|For {{the case}} of {{low-cost}} airlines, which are characterized by having a single fleet with {{a small number of}} airplanes, ina previous work, a heuristic algorithm (AFS-MRA) was developed to simultaneously find the flight schedule and theaircraft routes subject to maintenance constraints. This work advances this algorithm by incorporating competition inthe planning process (MAFS-MRA). Within a time frame with a given demand data, competition is seen as a game with two players (one airline and all itscompetitors), where the strategies are all the potential <b>origin-destinations</b> that could be included in the flight schedule,and the payment matrix contains the objective function coefficients that depend on the market share and the routespreviously selected. Numerical experimentation was undertaken using real data for {{the case of}} two airlines that operate at TolucaInternational Airport in Mexico. It was found that, by considering competition, the occupation improves to 3 % and thatthe number of flights required to satisfy the demand was reduced to 21 %. Besides, the updating process reduces theprofit computation error in almost 80 %, as compared to the real market behavior for the period under study...|$|R

This paper describes the findings of the research conducted to identify the transportation network critical facilities (road links) and their impacts on urban mobility for the city of Medellin, the second largest city in Colombia. This paper analyses the negative effects on travel time when a facility is disrupted or the capacity is suddenly reduced (e. g., accident, natural or manmade disaster, dedicated bike-route, maintenance, and construction). Criticality is identified following two methodologies: 1) comparing the travel time of the network users solving the user equilibrium (UE) traffic assignment problem between the base case and the disrupted network; 2) assessing the impact of the disrupted facility on the path travel times between affected <b>origin-destinations</b> zones. critical infrastructures; urban mobility; traffic assignment; user equilibrium; heuristics; shortest path; Medellín; Colombia; transport networks; critical facilities; road links; cities; capacity reduction; capacity disruption; travel time...|$|R
40|$|Macroscopic traffic {{simulation}} {{has gained}} {{more and more}} interest from the scientific community since the seminal works of Daganzo (2007) and Geroliminis & Daganzo (2008). It assumes that traffic conditions are homogeneous inside a given region (or reservoir); and traffic states are defined by a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). Most implementations of MFD models are accumulation-based and have been designed for control purposes. Few {{attention has been paid}} to the route choice process, i. e. the characterization of most likely alternatives and calculation of pathflow distribution. The most advanced MFD-based simulator including route choices has been proposed by Yildirimoglu & Geroliminis (2014). The authors implemented a multi-reservoir accumulation-based macroscopic traffic simulator. To calculate the macroscopic routes and trip lengths, they considered the sampling of several microscopic <b>origin-destinations</b> (OD) on the real network and made use of a time dependent shortest-path algorithm. The route flows are assigned according to a simple Multinomial Logit model. In fact, Multinomial Probit model has never been implemented in such a framework, while lots of route correlations happen due to the limited number of reservoirs used to describe an urban area. Furthermore, the macroscopic route set definition still requires further investigations...|$|R

30|$|Companies do {{not only}} {{decide how much}} they want to export to a {{specific}} country, but also whether they will export to a country at all. Often, there are barriers to export to a country. Some are there for purely economic reasons. One such example is a car manufacturer who needs a certain density of sales representatives in a region, so that the customers have a service point within an acceptable distance from where they live. Therefore, if a car manufacturer expects not to sell at least {{a certain amount of}} cars at a given price in a country, he will not enter the market at all. Other type of barriers are costs due to differences in the language spoken, or differences in regulation, difficulties in culture, uncertainties and risks with respect to the regulation and tariffs. All these can prevent one company exporting to another country. Of course, all these factors may affect some companies more than others and thus one could expect that in each country, there are at least some companies that export goods to any other country. However, the data shows that for <b>origin-destinations</b> combinations at the country level, depending on the commodity type, 15 – 85 % of the observations are missing values (which can best be interpreted as: no trade).|$|R
40|$|Travel {{time for}} a road trip is a drivers' most {{appreciated}} traffic information. Measuring travel times on a real time basis is also a perfect indicator {{of the level of}} service in a road link, and therefore is a useful measurement for traffic managers in order to improve traffic operations on the network. In conclusion, accurate travel time measurement {{is one of the key}} factors in traffic management systems. This paper presents a new approach for measuring travel times on closed toll highways using the existing surveillance infrastructure. In a closed toll system, where toll plazas are located on the on/off-ramps and each vehicle is charged a particular fee depending on its origin and destination, the data used for toll collection can also be valuable for measuring mainline travel times on the highway. The proposed method allows estimating mainline travel times on single sections of highway (defined as a section between two neighboring ramps) using itineraries covering different <b>origin-destinations.</b> The method provides trip time estimations without investing in any kind of infrastructure or technology. This overcomes some of the limitations of other methods, like the information delay and the excess in the travel time estimation due to the accumulation of exit times (i. e. the time required to travel along the exit link plus the time required to pay the fee at the toll gate). The results obtained in a pilot test on the AP- 7 toll highway, near Barcelona in Spain, show that the developed methodology is sound.

40|$|Increasing {{awareness}} that globalization {{and information technology}} affect the patterns of transport and logistic activities has increased interest in the integration of intermodal transport resources. There are many significant advantages provided by integration of multiple transport schedules, such as: (1) Eliminating direct routes connecting all <b>origin-destinations</b> pairs and concentrating cargos on major routes; (2) improving the utilization of existing transportation infrastructure; (3) reducing the requirements for warehouses and storage areas due to poor connections, and (4) reducing other impacts including traffic congestion, fuel consumption and emissions. This dissertation examines a series of optimization problems for transfer coordination in intermodal and intra-modal logistic networks. The first optimization model is developed for coordinating vehicle schedules and cargo transfers at freight terminals, {{in order to improve}} system operational efficiency. A mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) within the studied multi-mode, multi-hub, and multi-commodity network is formulated and solved by using sequential quadratic programming (SQP), genetic algorithms (GA) and a hybrid GA-SQP heuristic algorithm. This is done primarily by optimizing service frequencies and slack times for system coordination, while also considering loading and unloading, storage and cargo processing operations at the transfer terminals. Through a series of case studies, the model has shown its ability to optimize service frequencies (or headways) and slack times based on given input information. The second model is developed for countering schedule disruptions within intermodal freight systems operating in time-dependent, stochastic and dynamic environments. When routine disruptions occur (e. g. traffic congestion, vehicle failures or demand fluctuations) in pre-planned intermodal timed-transfer systems, the proposed dispatching control method determines through an optimization process whether each ready outbound vehicle should be dispatched immediately or held waiting for some late incoming vehicles with connecting freight. An additional sub-model is developed to deal with the freight left over due to missed transfers. During the phases of disruption responses, alleviations and management, the proposed real-time control model may also consider the propagation of delays at further downstream terminals. For attenuating delay propagations, an integrated dispatching control model and an analysis of sensitivity to slack times are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{coordination}} of street works activities in urban networks has been {{highlighted by the}} Government {{as one of the}} most important aspects of street works practice, benefiting street authorities, undertakers and road users alike (Department for Transport, 2012 c). The present research aims to develop an optimisation model for minimising the overall costs and disruptions incurred by all stakeholders as a result of implementing a number of street works schemes in an urban traffic network. The output of the optimisation model consists of optimum values for the underlying decision variables of the model such as start time of each street works scheme, type of traffic management strategy for each link, sequence of link closures and the level of resources allocated to undertake each scheme. The following two distinct objective functions, which are subject to minimisation by the optimisation model, have been developed: A primary objective function which captures the monetised effects of street works schemes such as cost of delays to road users, and cost of undertaking street works schemes. A secondary objective function (developed as a fuzzy inference system) to capture the non-monetised disruptive effects of street works schemes. The fuzzy variables of this inference system correspond to the level of ‘accessibility degradation’ of the network links, ‘connectivity degradation’ of the <b>origin-destinations</b> of the network, and ‘time sensitivity’ of the disruptive events (i. e. street works schemes). Next the street works optimisation problem was mathematically formulated as a bi-level optimisation programming problem, where the higher level problem is associated with minimising the aforementioned objective functions, and the lower level problem deals with predicting traffic flows, and thus the amount of delays incurred by the road users. Subsequently this study developed a genetic algorithm solution method to solve the resulting non-convex and NP-hard optimisation problem with integer or mixed type variables. Finally the performance of the optimisation algorithm was verified by a number of experimental tests on a small hypothetical network for three street works schemes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} rail rapid transit on land uses and land values are discussed. Rail transit can enhance accessibility, and {{can raise the}} demand for {{locating}} in areas around stations, increasing land value, {{and in some cases}} fostering redevelopment at higher densities. The attraction that the areas around stations produce depends on the number of trips generated for unit of land for different types of land-uses. A series of studies on the effect of rail transit on land values are reviewed. Using data from censuses and <b>origin-destinations</b> surveys, the effects of metro lines on land-uses during the 1990 's in Mexico City and Santiago de Chile are determined. Results show that in Mexico City neither zones located next to the new lines, nor zones located next to the lines built before 1990 had a higher growth of population, income per capita or employment, as compared to other zones with similar densities and incomes per capita. In the case of Santiago, whereas the areas located next to the newly built line had similar changes to other zones, the areas located next to the two lines built before the 1990 's had a significantly higher growth in number of households and average income per capita than other areas, especially in high-income districts. These results are explained by the lower attractiveness of the metro for middle and high-income people in Mexico City as compared to Santiago de Chile, which is proven by specifying relations between ridership and GDP for both cities, using multiple regression models. (cont.) The potential of land value capture as a mechanism for funding rail transit in both cities is discussed, based on the experience of other rail transit systems around the world, and on the characteristics of both metros. In both cases a land value capture system is proposed for new lines. Some guidelines for the implementation of land value capture mechanisms are provided. by Alvaro Covarrubias. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is devoted}} to the study of three different topics under the advice of three different mayor professors. The only thing these topics have in common is the interest and curiosity of the author to explain real life events, using applied econometric techniques. Chapter 2 applies financial tools to assess whether stock values reacted across world markets to the announcement of indexes that synthesize the environmental performance of the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest publicly-traded companies. The environmental index selected for this purpose is the 2 ̆ 2 Global 100 Ranking 2 ̆ 2 (G 100), a ranking of the 100 largest public companies by market capitalization. The results show that the market reacted to the 2 ̆ 2 Global 100 Ranking 2 ̆ 2 by changing the relative price of the stocks, but not the value of the portfolio. We also find that investors in US-traded stocks are more interested in past environmental performance than on managerial quality, while the opposite is true for investors in non-US-traded stocks. Chapter 3 estimates simultaneous equation models of barge and railroad rates for specific <b>origin-destinations</b> and grains (corn, wheat, and soybeans) in the US, using data from the Grain Transportation Report. Evidence of specific route competitiveness of various grains was found. Interestingly, it was possible to identify a railroad route with prices as complementary of barge rates, which may increase railroad market power. River levels affect barge rates, but there are differences for corn and wheat, possibly due to production locations in the Mississippi basin. Ocean vessel rates affect barge rates directly and railroad rates indirectly. Real exchange rates affect barge rates more than railroad rates. Evidence suggests that distance between railroad origin and barge origin affects the impact of the later on the first one. Chapter 4 studies the effect on early education achievement of keeping the same classmates as in the previous year by utilizing the unique nature of the Tennessee Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR). Results show that keeping all kindergarten classmates vs. losing all of them increases the probability of passing first grade by 7 to 10 percent. In addition, noncognitive skills are improved when more kindergarten classmates are kept as first grade classmates. If all classmates are kept together vs. staying alone in a new class, motivation and selfconfidence may increase by 0. 5 of a standard deviation, while the number of absences may decrease by 2 to 3 days...|$|R
