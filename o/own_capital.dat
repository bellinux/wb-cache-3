5|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from the Kingdom of Hungary, the Mongol forces halted at Sarai (now Russia) on the Volga River where their leader, Batu Khan set up his <b>own</b> <b>capital.</b> Henceforth, the steppes between the rivers Dnieper and Danube were {{under the influence of}} the Mongols of the Volga, known as the Golden Horde. From the 1260s, a relative of Batu, Nogai Khan settled at Isaccea on the Lower Danube and became the absolute master of the neighboring regions. He made himself independent of the Golden Horde around 1280, but was killed in a battle in 1299.|$|E
5|$|In 1470 a {{rebellion}} shook Q'umarkaj during a great celebration that saw a large gathering that included representatives {{of all the}} most important highland peoples. Two sons of K'iq'ab together {{with some of his}} vassals rebelled against their king, killing many high ranking lords, Kaqchikel warriors and members of the Kaweq lineage. The rebels tried to kill K'iq'ab himself but he was defended by sons loyal to him in Pakaman, {{on the outskirts of the}} city. As a result of the rebellion, K'iq'ab was forced to make concessions to the rebelling K'iche' lords. The newly empowered K'iche' lords turned against their Kaqchikel allies, who were forced to flee Q'umarkaj and found their <b>own</b> <b>capital</b> at Iximche.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick. The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their <b>own</b> <b>capital</b> at Iximche. The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) because it was too close to Q'umarkaj.|$|E

Cilicia became a Byzantine province, and Nikephoros re-Christianized it. Amidst rebellions and Byzantine raids {{as far as the}} Jazira, Sayf al-Dawla died at Aleppo in February 967. His son and successor, Sa'd al-Dawla, faced constant internal turmoil, and he did not secure control of his <b>own</b> <b>capital</b> until 977.

5|$|Years after Su's death, {{the capital}} city of Kaifeng was besieged and {{captured}} in 1127 by the Jurchens of the Manchuria-based Jin Dynasty during the Jin–Song wars. The clock-tower was dismantled piece by piece by the Jurchens, who carted its components back to their <b>own</b> <b>capital</b> in modern-day Beijing. However, due to the complexity of the tower, they were unable to successfully piece it back together. The new Emperor Gaozong of Song instructed Su's son, Su Xie, to construct a new astronomical clock-tower in its place, and Su Xie set to work studying his father's texts with a team of other experts. However, they were also unsuccessful in creating another clock tower, and Su Xie was convinced that Su Song had purposefully left out essential components in his written work and diagrams so that others would not steal his ideas.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula of Matabeleland on 30 October 1888, Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889. Under this charter, the Company was {{empowered}} {{to trade with}} indigenous rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise and run a police force. In return for these rights, the British South Africa Company would administer and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders. Though the Company made good on most of these pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored. Lobengula reacted by making war on the new arrivals, their Tswana allies and the local Mashona people in 1893. The resulting conflict ended with Lobengula's torching of his <b>own</b> <b>capital</b> at Bulawayo, his death from smallpox in early 1894, and the subsequent submission of his izinDuna (advisors) to the Company. Violent rebellion to the north-east, in neighbouring Mashonaland, was forcibly put down by the Company during 1897.|$|E

5|$|The Antankarana were {{originally}} {{a branch of}} the Sakalava royal line called the Zafin'i'fotsy (children of silver). This group split off from the Sakalava in the 16th century following a dispute with the Zafin'i'mena (children of gold) that ended with the latter's exclusive right to the kingship. Having been refused the right to the throne, the Zafin'i'fotsy left the Sakalava homeland on the southwestern coast to settle just north of the boundaries of Sakalava control. The first Antankarana king, Kozobe (1614–39), claimed {{a large part of the}} island's north as his territory, which he split into five provinces each ruled by one of his sons. This territory was rapidly reduced from the south by Zafin'i'mena prince Andriamandisoarivo, who led violent campaigns into bordering Antankarana territory to expand the frontiers of what was to become the Sakalava Kingdom of Iboina at the end of the 17th century. Many Zafin'i'fotsy nobles were killed or quickly surrendered to the advancing Sakalava armies, but oral history celebrates several who resisted, including Andriamanpangy, a descendent of Kozobe. His son Andriantsirotso (1692–1710) founded the Antankarana kingdom, leading the Zafin'i'fotsy further north into the area now protected as Ankarana Reserve and declaring his sovereignty over the north. He was accepted as king both by his own people and by the communities already living in the north, who united together under the name Antankarana (people of the Ankarana rocks). The Sakalava warred with the nascent Antankarana kingdom in its continued effort to claim sovereignty over the territory, but the Antankarana hid themselves in natural shelters formed by the rocks and caves of Ankarana. Eventually they were forced to take refuge at Maroantsetra, a town ruled by a relative named Raholo; Andriantsirotso was able to repel the Sakalava three years later with the support of Raholo's soldiers. Throughout this period Andriantsirotso established the foundations for the kingdom by organizing military cooperation among clans, establishing an administration, developing economic regulations and introducing customs that reinforced a hierarchical social order. According to oral history, at the point when Andriantsirotso was preparing to return to his <b>own</b> <b>capital,</b> a mysterious eight-year-old girl named Tsimatahodrafy arrived in Maroantsetra. She revealed herself to be a sorceress and instructed Andriantsirotso on the rituals to perform en route to ensure his safe return and the establishment of a strong kingdom, including the continuing practice of tying a mat to two tsitakonala trees planted outside the king's house to indicate a royal residence and symbolize the indivisibility of the kingdom.|$|E
