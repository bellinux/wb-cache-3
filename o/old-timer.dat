25|$|Almost {{all of the}} rivalries of the NCAA {{originated}} from the basketball court, since basketball is the sport most covered by the media, especially on television. Most of the rivalries started due to the schools' compositions, because four of the <b>old-timer</b> six were schools exclusively for males from affluent families. These rivalries have declined in recent years with the withdrawal {{of two of the}} <b>old-timer</b> six, Ateneo and La Salle.|$|E
25|$|After Wilson {{graduated}} from Acadia University in 1987, {{she began to}} play senior women's hockey with the Moncton Blades (later known as the Maritime Blades). New Brunswick {{did not have a}} senior women's hockey league, therefore, the Blades were forced to arrange competitive games against men's minor hockey teams and men's <b>old-timer</b> teams. In order to play competitive hockey against other women, the Blades had to travel to Quebec. From 1988-98, the Blades represented New Brunswick at the Women's National Hockey Championship.|$|E

[...] "The new-comers {{get in on}} the rich creeks, and the <b>old-timers,</b> who dared and {{suffered}} and made this country, get nothing. <b>Old-timers</b> made this discovery on Squaw Creek--how it leaked out is the mystery--and they sent word up to all the <b>old-timers</b> on Sea Lion. But it's ten miles farther than Dawson, and when they arrive they'll find the creek staked to the skyline by the Dawson chechakos. It isn't right, it isn't fair, such perversity of luck." ...|$|R

2500|$|Two cowboys, a {{newcomer}} and an <b>old-timer,</b> are drinking beer {{in front of}} a saloon. Suddenly, there is a clatter of hooves, a great cloud of dust, and something moving extremely fast from one end of town to the other. The newcomer looks at the <b>old-timer,</b> but seeing no reaction, decides to let the matter drop. However, several minutes later, the same cloud of dust, accompanied by the clatter of hooves, rapidly proceeds in the other direction. Not being able to see what's behind the dust, and unable to contain his curiosity any longer, the newcomer asks: [...] "OK, what the hell was that, Bill?" [...] / [...] "Oh, that's Uncatchable Joe. Nobody has ever managed to catch him, Harry." [...] / [...] "Why? Is he so fast, Bill?" [...] / [...] "Nope, it's just because nobody needs him, Harry."

2500|$|The <b>Old-Timer</b> (Bill Thompson) â€“ a hard-of-hearing {{senior citizen}} with {{a penchant for}} {{distorting}} jokes, prefacing each one by saying, [...] "That ain't the way I heer'd it!" [...] For no apparent reason, he refers to Fibber as [...] "Johnny" [...] and Molly as [...] "Daughter". A recurring joke is that he refuses to tell his real name. In the 1940 episode [...] "Mailing Christmas Packages", he is referred to by another character as [...] "Roy", while in one episode (01/29/1946 and reiterated in the episode a week later) he claims his name is [...] "Rupert Blasingame". In the 3/25/41 episode, [...] "Fibber Changes His Name", he appears as Mr. Fumble, a lawyer. Also, in the 3/14/39 episode, Fibber calls him Mr. Sims, but he's having trouble with his memory in this episode, so this may be just an error in remembering, as he also calls Mr. Wilcox [...] "Harpo" [...] for perhaps the first time instead of Harlow, due to poor memory tricks. The Old-Timer's girlfriend is named Bessie, and she usually refers to him as [...] "O.T." [...] In a 15-minute episode {{near the end of the}} series, Mcgee and Molly spend the day trying to find one mysterious [...] "Adleton P. Bagshaw," [...] only to discover him to be the <b>Old-Timer.</b> [...] At the Mcgees' surprise the <b>Old-Timer</b> says, [...] "You mean to stand there with your bare face hanging out in the wind and tell me you don't know my name[...] [...] pretty discouragin' when folks you consider your friends for nigh on twenty years don't even know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{with white}} neighbors had their ups and downs. One <b>old-timer</b> related, [...] "Dad got along {{well with the}} group and went {{to some of the}} powwows. The only problem about going to these powwows was while at them you were {{expected}} to eat a little dog meat with them." [...] He tells of the Indian women coming up to his folks' place and bartering [...] "berries and other wild foods for milk, eggs, and perhaps a chicken." [...] The Indians traded in Westboro. John Young himself was once arrested for poaching deer, and was jailed in Medford.|$|E
