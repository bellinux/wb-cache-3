40|$|This part {{deals with}} the basic {{elements}} <b>of</b> <b>property</b> law. I begin in chapter 7 by examining the fundamental question of what justifies the social institution <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> that is, {{the rationale for the}} rights that constitute what we commonly call ownership. I also discuss examples of the emergence <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights. Then I consider a number of important issues about property rights. In chapter 8, I inquire about the division <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights (property rights may be divided contemporaneously, over time, and according to contingency). In chapter 9, I study a variety of issues about the acquisition and transfer <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> including the discovery of unowned or lost property, registration systems for transfer <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> and the transfer <b>of</b> <b>property</b> at death. In chapter 10, I investigate “externalities ” and property [...] problems concerning cooperation and conflict in the use <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> together with the resolution of such problems through bargaining and legal rules.

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal.

Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E

40|$|Article {{is devoted}} to {{theoretical}} analysis of nature and mechanism <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> insurance. Types <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> relations {{and its role in}} public reproduction are investigated. Peculiarities <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> relations are considered. Classification <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects depending on their most essential features is analyzed. Different approaches to classification <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> subjects are considered. Nature and preconditions of origin <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are investigated. Goals and functions <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are specified. Risks that related to disposal and commercialisation <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> and connected with peculiarities <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects and growing rate <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> rights infringements are analyzed. Three groups of risks concerning disposal and commercialization <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects are singled out: risks related to loss or abridgement <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> rights; risks related to possible losses, contingencies and half-received profits connected with commercialization <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects; risks <b>of</b> professional responsibility of participants <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> market.

5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} two types <b>of</b> <b>properties,</b> contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which {{adds to the}} historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the same basic characteristics.

40|$|Exclusion theorists <b>of</b> <b>property</b> {{think that}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>property</b> {{properly}} concerns only the relations between owners and nonowners — that is, the external relationships of owners, or {{what we might call}} the “external life” <b>of</b> <b>property.</b> From this perspective, the internal relationships among property stakeholders — the “internal life” <b>of</b> <b>property</b> — are irrelevant from a conceptual point of view. I argue that this is a distorted and misleading view <b>of</b> <b>property.</b> To reveal this misconception, I distinguish between two types <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> which I call exclusion property and governance property. Governance property, not exclusion property, is the dominant mode of ownership today. the emergence of GP as the predominant form <b>of</b> <b>property</b> means that the right to exclude can no longer be considered the core of private ownership.

40|$|In this thesis, I problematize a {{widespread}} assumption in theories of civil disobedience. The {{assumption is that}} destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> is violence.

I put forth three sufficient criteria for viewing destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> as violence {{and use them to}} evaluate two representative cases of civil disobedience in Denmark. I conclude that destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> can be viewed as violence in cases where it results in significant physical or psychological damage to persons or substantial violations of the right to private property. However, the destruction <b>of</b> <b>property</b> most common to civil disobedience does not result in significant physical or psychological damage to persons or substantial violations <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights, and thus cannot reasonably be considered violence.
