5|$|McBride {{made his}} major league debut for the Cardinals in 1973, but he {{retained}} his rookie status after only appearing in 40 games that year. He became {{known for a}} distinctive appearance, as he wore {{one of the largest}} Afro hairstyles in the major leagues. When he stepped to home plate to bat, McBride made a ritual of wiping away the chalk lines that made up the batter's box. He used an unconventional batting stance, placing his weight <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> foot rather than on his back foot.|$|E

5|$|Mose Wright stayed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> porch {{for twenty}} minutes waiting for Till to return. He did {{not go back to}} bed. He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around trying to find Till. Unsuccessful, they {{returned}} home by 8:00am. After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E

25|$|On December 31, 1862, {{the first}} day of the Battle of Stones River, Sheridan {{anticipated}} a Confederate assault and positioned his division in preparation for it. His division held back the Confederate onslaught <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> until their ammunition ran out and they were forced to withdraw. This action was instrumental in giving the Union army time to rally at a strong defensive position. For his actions, he was promoted to major general on April 10, 1863 (with date of rank December 31, 1862). In six months, he had risen from captain to major general.|$|E
25|$|Savile {{lived in}} Salford from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the later period with Ray Teret, who became his support DJ, {{assistant}} and chauffeur. Savile managed the Plaza Ballroom on Oxford Road, Manchester, in the mid-1950s. When {{he lived in}} Great Clowes Street in Higher Broughton, Salford, he was often seen sitting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> door steps. He managed the Mecca Locarno ballroom in Leeds in the late 1950s and early 1960s {{as well as the}} Mecca-owned Palais dance hall in Ilford, Essex, between 1955 and 1956. His Monday evening records-only dance sessions (admission one shilling) were popular with local teens.|$|E
25|$|Sensing victory, Moreau ordered Grenier's {{divisions}} and Grouchy to attack around noon. Undeterred by Latour's weak pressure <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front,</b> Ney swung {{to his right}} and began pounding Kollowrat's troops. Pressing his attack, he overran their positions, capturing 1,000 soldiers and ten cannon. Grouchy also returned to the offensive. Hemmed in on three sides by Ney, Grouchy and Richepanse, Kollowrat's column finally disintegrated in a disorderly rout. Archduke John escaped capture on a fast horse, but many of his men were not so lucky and thousands of demoralized Austrians and Bavarians surrendered. In addition, over 60 artillery pieces fell into French hands.|$|E

25|$|As morning dawned, Grant {{realized}} his assumptions about Lee's dispositions were wrong and that Hancock {{was facing a}} significant threat <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front.</b> However, this opened a new opportunity. He guessed (incorrectly) that the troops facing Hancock had been withdrawn from Laurel Hill. He ordered Hancock to withdraw north of the Po, leaving a single division in place to occupy the Confederates in that sector, {{while the rest of}} his army was to attack at 5 p.m. across the entire Confederate line, which would identify and exploit any potential weak spot. Hancock left Francis C. Barlow's division in behind hasty earthworks along Shady Grove Church Road and withdrew the remainder of his men north of the Po.|$|E
25|$|On lap 173, Earnhardt {{drove his}} {{familiar}} black No. 3 car in third place, {{with two of}} his team's cars, the blue No. 15 Chevrolet driven by Michael Waltrip and the red No. 8 Chevrolet driven by his son Dale Earnhardt, Jr., running first and second in front of him. On that lap, a huge crash on the back straightaway eliminated 18 cars in a spectacular fashion. Those involved in the crash were Jason Leffler, Steve Park (another of Earnhardt's drivers), both Rusty (who would rally back to finish third) and Kenny Wallace, Jeff and Robby Gordon, both Bobby (the defending Cup Champion) and Terry Labonte, Mark Martin, Tony Stewart, Elliott Sadler, Jeff and Ward Burton (who had led the most laps in the race so far with 53), Jerry Nadeau, John Andretti, Buckshot Jones, Dale Jarrett (the defending Daytona 500 winner), and Andy Houston. The crash began when R. Gordon turned W. Burton at the exit of turn 2. Stewart got hit by W. Burton, turned backwards against the outside wall, and was pushed airborne over R. Gordon. Stewart then flipped over twice, hooking to B. Labonte's hood, and stood <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> wheels before coasting to a stop in the infield, while W. Burton's car turned sideways and collected most of the field behind him. Earnhardt, Ron Hornaday, Jr., Ricky Rudd and Ken Schrader were four of the few drivers who escaped the crash scene. The race was red-flagged to remove cars from the racetrack, and clean up debris.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of Bryan's message, Hanna was convinced the Democrat's support would recede. [...] "He's talking Silver all the time, and that's where we've got him", Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July. [...] He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. [...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> lawn, [...] "I {{do not know what}} you think about it, but I believe it is a good deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E
50|$|Suzuka Mambo was foaled on April 28, 2001, at Japan's Grand Stud. He was sired by 1989 Kentucky Derby winner Sunday Silence, {{and out of}} Spring Mambo, a {{daughter}} of Kingmambo; he was a dark bay stallion with a white blaze, white stockings <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right <b>front</b> and left rear legs, and a partial coronet marking <b>on</b> <b>his</b> left foreleg.|$|R

500|$|Because Mucho Macho Man {{was born}} {{late in the}} year for a Thoroughbred foal, as a growing two- and three-year-old he had to compete against horses that were several months older and more mature. [...] He was also very tall, and as a young racehorse {{sometimes}} got in his own way; as a three-year-old, he stepped <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> feet with his hind feet and tore off a horseshoe in two different races. In 2011, he competed in all three Triple Crown races, coming in third in the Kentucky Derby. [...] Following a five-month layoff due to surgery that addressed a problem with his breathing, he returned to the track in November 2011 with a win, won three graded stakes races in 2012, and finished a close second to Fort Larned in that year's Breeders' Cup Classic.|$|E
500|$|<b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> porch, McKinley urged sound money, {{though he}} never ceased to promote {{protectionism}} to support American industry. Horner noted, [...] "the campaign effectively linked both gold and protectionism with patriotism." [...] McKinley felt {{that he could not}} campaign entirely on the money issue, as many midwestern Republicans who supported silver considered protection the major issue of the campaign, and would stay with the party if it promoted tariffs. These issues were given different emphases sectionally: in the East and South, the money issue was stressed most strongly, while tariffs were given more attention in the Midwest. McKinley had little support in the mining-dominated Rocky Mountain states, where even most Republicans were for silver and Bryan. On the Pacific coast, where there was strong silver sentiment, but where McKinley had some hope of winning, the tariff was made the major issue.|$|E
500|$|As a batsman, Fender's {{approach}} was aggressive; whatever the circumstances {{he hit the}} ball very hard, {{and his ability to}} play a variety of strokes made it difficult for captains to place fielders effectively. He batted with his weight mainly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> foot and used powerful wrist-work to send the ball in different directions while playing the same stroke. Among his favoured shots were the drive, pull and cut. Other than his 35-minute century, he played many innings in which he scored quickly, and the cricket historian Gerald Brodribb has calculated that Fender was among first-class cricket's [...] fastest scorers, with an average rate of 62 runs an hour. He also recorded several notably powerful hits, including one which sent the ball 132 yards. Fender's aggressive approach made him an inconsistent scorer, but Surrey had a strong batting side and his hitting power was more valuable to the team than if he had played in more orthodox fashion. The side's batting strength meant that Fender rarely had to play defensively, although he could do so if the situation demanded.|$|E

500|$|Mucho Macho Man is a {{bay horse}} with white {{markings}} {{that include a}} star and stripe on his face, a sock on his left hind leg, and a coronet <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front</b> right leg. He stands over [...] high. [...] He was sired by Macho Uno, who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and was named American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 2000. Macho Uno was a son of Hall of Fame champion Holy Bull. [...] Mucho Macho Man's dam is the 2001 Anoakia Stakes winner Ponche de Leona. Both sire and dam were owned by Frank Stronach's Adena Springs Farms {{at the time of}} mating; the pregnant mare was subsequently purchased by John and Carole Rio of Florida, where Mucho Macho Man was foaled, and thus the Rios are officially listed as his breeders. Mucho Macho Man was Ponche de Leona's second foal and was born extremely late in the foaling season on June 15, 2008; this meant that as a two- and three-year-old, not yet fully grown, he had to compete on equal terms with horses who were as much as five months older than he.|$|E
500|$|The first {{sounds of}} battle Howe heard were musket {{fire from the}} barracks, but these were rapidly {{followed}} by cannon fire {{and the appearance of}} charging British and German troops <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front.</b> [...] He ordered an immediate retreat, but it rapidly turned into a rout. [...] His untried troops hardly bothered to return fire, some throwing down their weapons before attempting to run away through the swampy terrain. [...] Campbell reported that [...] "It was scarcely possible to come up with them, their retreat was rapid beyond Conception." [...] The light infantry in the Continental rear cut off the road to Augusta, the only significant escape route, forcing a mad scramble of retreating troops into the city itself. [...] The Georgia soldiers on the right attempted to find a safe crossing of Musgrove Creek, but one did not exist, and many of the troops were taken prisoner. [...] Soldiers who did not immediately surrender were sometimes bayoneted. [...] Colonel Huger managed to form a rear-guard to cover the escape of a number of the Continentals. [...] Some of Howe's men managed to escape to the north before the British closed off the city, but others were forced to attempt swimming across Yamacraw Creek; an unknown number drowned in the attempt.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{problem with}} McClellan's war strategy {{was that he}} was convinced the Confederates were ready to attack him with overwhelming numbers. On August 8, believing that the Confederacy had over 100,000 troops facing him (in contrast to the 35,000 they had actually deployed at Bull Run a few weeks earlier), he {{declared a state of emergency}} in the capital. By August 19, he estimated 150,000 rebel soldiers <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>front.</b> McClellan's subsequent campaigns were strongly influenced by the overblown enemy strength estimates of his secret service chief, detective Allan Pinkerton, but in August 1861, these estimates were entirely McClellan's own. The result was a level of extreme caution that sapped the initiative of McClellan's army and dismayed the government. Historian and biographer Stephen W. Sears observed that McClellan's actions would have been [...] "essentially sound" [...] for a commander who was as outnumbered as McClellan thought he was, but McClellan in fact rarely had less than a two-to-one advantage over the armies that opposed him in 1861 and 1862. That fall, for example, Confederate forces ranged from 35,000 to 60,000, whereas the Army of the Potomac in September numbered 122,000 men; in early December 170,000; by year end, 192,000.|$|E
