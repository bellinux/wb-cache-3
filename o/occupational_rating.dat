40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of personal networks on changes of <b>occupational</b> <b>rates</b> {{of men and women}} becoming parents. It discusses and measures the effects of various interconnected dimensions of network structures and compositions, such as density, degree of overlap between partners' networks, geographical distance between network members, and types of relations(family, friendship, or others). A set of longitudinal analyses on 235 couples becoming parents in Switzerland shows that for women, higher density in emotional support triggers a reduction in <b>occupational</b> <b>rates</b> once the first child is born, while for men, a higher density in practical support is associated with an increase of <b>occupational</b> <b>rates,</b> with a resulting increase of gender inequalities in the division of paid labour. Results are valid both for intended changes and for changes observed in the transition, and they hold when controlling for parents' educational level, income and personal values about gender equality...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to attempt to look at the link between labor market risks and social {{insurance}} demands by taking <b>occupational</b> unemployment <b>rates,</b> and specificity of skills into account. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Occupational</b> unemployment <b>rate</b> is treated as an estimate of labor market risk in addition to human capital investment. Then, the variations in Germany and the USA – with diverse labor markets and a considerable difference in terms of social insurance support – are examined. Findings – The results suggest that <b>occupational</b> unemployment <b>rate</b> is explanatory for the demands for social insurance along with income. Practical implications – Conclusions reached in the paper aim to contribute to the understanding of the political support for social insurance and hence provide tools for the design of such insurance mechanisms. Originality/value – Contrary to the widespread association between the type of human capital and social insurance preferences in the literature, the paper argues that the cross-country variations can be explained by <b>occupational</b> unemployment <b>rates.</b> Germany, Human capital, Investments, Social benefits, Unemployment, United States of America...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this review}} is to examine whether {{immigrant}} workers have a higher <b>occupational</b> injury <b>rate</b> than native employees. We collected 72 studies from around the world. A calculation based on 31 of these studies shows {{that the risk of}} occupational injury for foreign-born workers is 2. 13 times higher than that of native-born workers. In seven studies immigrants actually had a lower <b>occupational</b> injury <b>rate.</b> At highest, immigrant workers had ten times the injury rate of native workers, whereas in one USA study the <b>occupational</b> injury <b>rate</b> of immigrant workers was only half of that of American-born workers. However, three studies consistently showed that immigrant workers had a higher injury rate than the original population during their first five years at the workplace, but that after five years their rate decreased to below the level of native workers. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} immigrant workers have a worse work conditions than native workers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{inspects}} {{the relationship}} between labor market risks and demand for social insurance with a particular emphasis on unemployment insurance. It considers income, skill specificity and unemployment risk as the chief determinants of political support for such policies. <b>Occupational</b> unemployment <b>rate</b> is treated as an estimate of labor market risk. Then, the paper looks at the cross-country variations in unemployment insurance and delineates the links with these and one’s position in the labor market.

50|$|Belgium, like {{neighboring}} Netherlands, has {{a strong}} tradition of women fulfilling a predominantly domestic role, rather than a professional one. Roman Catholicism, the traditional religion in Belgium, has supported different gender roles for men and women. However, from the 1990s onward, this has started to change. The occupational gender gap has been decreasing in recent years, especially among younger generations. However, the higher <b>occupational</b> <b>rate</b> of women is primarily due {{to an increase in}} part-time jobs. In 2011, 43.3% of employed women worked part-time, compared to only 9.2% of men. There is also a strong segregation by field, and there are less women in Belgium working in STEM and engineering than the EU average.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{structure}} for an automated competency management system model is presented. The system involves an advanced approach to competency identification and evaluation {{that takes into}} account the prediction of future activities in competency development. Once competencies are identified and graded for all resources, they are then matched to running projects via a domain of action related to each project. The acknowledged competencies are then linked to a time management factor, or the <b>occupational</b> <b>rate,</b> in a manner that the percentage of time dispensed by each resource on a project in a domain of action including a defined competency is shown. An enrollment criterion for the automated competency management system is proposed. The presented model may be applied for both products and services...|$|R

40|$|Background Occupational risk due to {{airborne}} disease challenges healthcare institutions. Environmental {{measures are}} effective but their cost-effectiveness is still debatable {{and most of}} the capacity planning is based on <b>occupational</b> <b>rates.</b> Better indices to plan and evaluate capacity are needed. Goal To evaluate the impact of installing an exclusively dedicated respiratory isolation room (EDRIR) in a tertiary emergency department (ED) determined by a time-to-reach-facility method. Methods A group of patients in need of respiratory isolation were first identified-group I (2004; 29 patients; 44. 1 +/- 3. 4 years) and the <b>occupational</b> <b>rate</b> and time intervals (arrival to diagnosis, diagnosis to respiratory isolation indication and indication to effective isolation) were determined and it was estimated that adding an EDRIR would have a significant impact over the time to isolation. After implementing the EDRIR, a second group of patients was gathered in the same period of the year-group II (2007; 50 patients; 43. 4 +/- 1. 8 years) and demographic and functional parameters were recorded to evaluate time to isolation. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, gender and inhospital respiratory isolation room availability were obtained. Results Implementing an EDRIR decreased the time from arrival to indication of respiratory isolation (27. 5 +/- 9. 3 X 3. 7 +/- 2. 0; p = 0. 0180) and from indication to effective respiratory isolation (13. 3 +/- 3. 0 X 2. 94 +/- 1. 06; p = 0. 003) but not the respiratory isolation duration and total hospital stay. The impact on crude isolation rates was very significant (8. 9 X 75. 4 / 100. 000 patients; p < 0. 001). The HR for effective respiratory isolation was 26. 8 (95 % CI 7. 42 to 96. 9) p < 0. 001 greater for 2007. Conclusion Implementing an EDRIR in a tertiary ED significantly reduced the time to respiratory isolation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the relationship between changes in employment in North Carolina in the 1980 s and fatal <b>occupational</b> injury <b>rates.</b> METHODS: Unintentional fatal occupational injuries (n = 1989) in North Carolina between 1978 and 1991 were identified via the medical examiner's system. RESULTS: Overall fatal injury rates declined during the 1980 s, but rates increased 9. 6 % per year among manufacturing industries that declined in employment size; rates fell among service sector and manufacturing industries that grew. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing <b>occupational</b> fatal injury <b>rates</b> accompanied the decline in workforce in North Carolina's traditional, labor-intensive manufacturing industries during the 1980 s, while service sector and expanding manufacturing industries have experienced declining fatal injury rates...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES:This study {{examined}} employment patterns of African-American and White workers {{and rates of}} unintentional fatal injuries, METHODS: Medical examiner and census data were used to compare <b>occupational</b> fatality <b>rates</b> for African Americans and Whites in North Carolina and to adjust for racial differences in employment patterns. RESULTS: African Americans' <b>occupational</b> fatality <b>rate</b> was higher {{by a factor of}} 1. 3 to 1. 5. Differences in employment structure appear to explain much of this disparity. However, the fatality rate for African-American men would have been elevated even if they had had the same employment patterns as White men. CONCLUSIONS: inequalities in access to the labor market, unequal distribution of risk within jobs, and explicit discrimination are all potential explanations for racial disparities in occupational injury mortality. These conditions can be addressed through a combination of social and workplace interventions, including efforts to improve conditions for the most disadvantaged workers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: The mining {{industry}} {{has one of}} the highest <b>occupational</b> <b>rates</b> of serious injury and fatality. Mine staff involved with rescue operations are often required to respond to physically challenging situations. This paper describes the physical attributes of mining rescue personnel. Methods: 91 rescue personnel (34 ± 8. 6 yrs, 1. 79 ± 0. 07 m, 90 ± 15. 0 kg) participating in the Queensland Mines Rescue Challenge completed a series of health-related and rescuerelated fitness tasks. Health-related tasks comprised measurements of aerobic capacity (VO 2 max), abdominal endurance, abdominal strength, flexibility, lower back strength, leg strength, elbow flexion strength, shoulder strength, lower back endurance, and leg endurance. Rescue-related tasks comprised an incremental carry (IC), coal shovel (CS), and a hose drag (HD), completed in this order. Results: Cardiovascular (VO 2 max) and muscular endurance was average or below average compared with the general population. Isometric strength did not decline with age. The rescue-related tasks were all extremely demanding with heart rate responses averaging greater than 88...|$|R
40|$|Serological {{studies in}} {{developed}} and developing countries using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have validated this technique as a rapid, noninvasive method for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infections. The prevalence of serum antibodies to H pylori was studied in 473 Canadian blood donors from Manitoba, 212 healthy Japanese. and 226 healthy Americans. As expected, the seroprevalence rose progressively with age in the three populations and reached its peak (greater than 55 %) in subjects 60 {{years of age and}} older. The seroprevalence did not decrease in elderly persons (60 to 99 years), indicating a persistent immune response. More detailed analysis was perfom 1 ed on the Canadian population. Age-adjusted prevalence rates in men and women were similar. Among young adults (15 to 29 years). farmers had a significantly higher seroprevalence rate than white-collar or blue-collar workers. but in older persons <b>occupational</b> <b>rates</b> were similar. A multiple linear regression analysis of the data confirmed that age and occupation in young adults were both significantly associated with seroprevalence of H pylori infections...|$|R
40|$|Participation {{is often}} the {{comprehensive}} objective of treatment but also {{an indication of the}} extent to which the process of occupational therapy is client-centred. The purpose of this study was to explore levels of participation during occupational therapy among clients in the area of mental health from the occupational therapists' perspectives. Additionally the authors sought to identify factors that might hinder client participation. Postal questionnaires were sent out to 670 Swedish occupational therapists working with persons with mental illness and learning disabilities. The questionnaire required therapists to rate clients' levels of participation during occupational therapy. Findings indicated that the most common level of participation for the clients was interdependent, meaning that problems, goals, and plans were identified jointly and collaboratively with the occupational therapist. However, more than 20 % of the clients were described as being dependent. Almost 90 % of the <b>occupational</b> therapists <b>rated</b> client participation in therapy to be very important and nearly 70 % claimed that client participation in general needed to be increased. <b>Occupational</b> therapists <b>rated</b> the primary barriers to participation as being clients' inability to participate and organizational and financial problems. Implications of these findings for education in client-centred practice approaches are discussed...|$|R
