5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|An unusually {{heavy rain}} storm {{affected}} a GO train on July 8, 2013, when a record-breaking 123mm fell <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours. A Richmond Hill-bound GO train encountered flood {{waters in the}} Don Valley and stopped. As the crew worked to change {{the direction of the}} train, flood waters continued to rise and submerged the tracks behind the train. The train itself began to flood, and approximately 1,400 passengers had to be rescued by boat.|$|E

5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. <b>Over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E

The two spend the evening in conversation <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport. He now feels as if he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{currents}} induced in the ionosphere generate {{magnetic fields}} (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated {{near where the}} atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields {{by as much as}} one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).|$|E

5|$|Gatwick Airport, {{nowadays}} one of Britain's busiest international airports, {{opened on}} the edge of the town in the 1940s, encouraging commercial and industrial growth. After the Second World War, the British Government planned to move large numbers of people and jobs out of London and into new towns around South East England. The New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of one of these. A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, and rapid development greatly increased the size and population of the town <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> decades.|$|E
5|$|In astrophysical plasmas, Debye {{screening}} prevents electric fields from directly {{affecting the}} plasma over large distances, i.e., {{greater than the}} Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Once {{males and}} females are both sexually mature, mating is spread <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks. Insects are active when {{temperature}} reaches 20°C; temperatures above 25°C are very favorable to their activity in the field whereas colder temperatures below 15°C and wet weather limit insect mobility. Once fertilized, females B. rufimanus lay eggs on developing pods of faba beans. Rain, wind and temperatures below 20°C put on hold the oviposition process. Eggs are laid predominantly on the lowest parts of the plant. Eggs are small (< 2mm diameter), white-yellowish. A maximum of ten eggs per pod is observed. Females lay between 50 and 100 eggs. Rain might increase egg mortality.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{take time to}} develop, {{and as many as}} half of cases are asymptomatic at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or fourhours after the trauma. Hypoxemia (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.|$|E
5|$|The Frenchmen {{were caught}} off guard and five were killed, with three seriously wounded. The mutineers managed to win <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more tirailleurs from the 5th and 6th {{companies}} of the battalion, and even managed to raise {{the flag of the}} VNQDĐ on top of one of the buildings. They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders of the uprising sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely claiming that they had already eliminated the entire French officer corps.|$|E

5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
5|$|NASA has speculated on the {{feasibility}} of mining the atmospheres of the outer planets, particularly for helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on Earth and could {{have a very high}} value per unit mass as thermonuclear fuel. Factories stationed in orbit could mine the gas and deliver it to visiting craft. However, the Jovian system in general poses particular disadvantages for colonization because of the severe radiation conditions prevailing in Jupiter's magnetosphere and the planet's particularly deep gravitational well. Jupiter would deliver about 36Sv (3600rem) per day to unshielded colonists at Io and about 5.4Sv (540rems) per day to unshielded colonists at Europa, which is a decisive aspect {{due to the fact that}} already an exposure to about 0.75Sv over a period of a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning, and about 5Sv <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days is fatal.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Channel is {{difficult}} to categorize into a genre, as it incorporates elements of adventure, simulation, and digital pet games. The graphics are in 3D, the perspective is first-person, and the player navigates and selects things with a cursor. The game centers on watching television programs with a Pikachu, a mouse-like Pokémon. The player, {{who lives in a}} house, can channel-surf freely among the various channels of a television network created by the pokémon professor, Professor Oak, as well as explore one room of the house and several outdoor areas. Pikachu sometimes displays emotional reactions while watching, such as happiness or anger. The game takes place <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days, with unique plot events on each. The GameCube's inner clock tracks time such that every in-game day lasts at least as long as one real-time day.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours to a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve {{the muscles of the}} head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|Stratton went on {{to become}} a first-generation {{experimental}}ist in psychology. Wundt's lab in Leipzig, with experimental programs bringing together the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory physiology and nervous-system studies, was a part of the career of most of the first generation. It was the exposure there, added to the graduate work at Yale, that influenced Stratton into becoming a psychologist. It was there that he started his binocular vision experiments as well. In these experiments, he found himself adapting to the new perception of the environment <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days, after inverting the images his eyes saw on a regular basis. For this, he wore a set of glasses inverting images both upside-down and left-right. Stratton wore these glasses over his right eye and covered the left with a patch during the day, and slept blindfolded at night. Initial movement was clumsy, but adjusting to the new environment took only a few days.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E
