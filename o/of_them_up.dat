500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned. Standard {{procedure}} was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women {{to the bathroom to}} verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room {{in the back of the}} bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, [...] "My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!"

The record features turntable scratches contributed by famed hip-hop record producer DJ Premier. After West had played the demo for [...] "Everything I Am" [...] over the phone for DJ Premier and asked him what he thought of it, DJ Premier then replied that he enjoyed the lyrics and the innovative beat and offered to scratch over it. When working on the track, and while following the numerous instructions that were supplied by West, DJ Premier took seven different styles of scratches, including drum breaks, then cut all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> into different rhythms, and scattered them all throughout the track, providing West with many different ideas to choose from.|$|E

2500|$|Neuro-linguistic {{programming}} (NLP) is {{an approach}} to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please tell us about that. RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't there a way to maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't need them to see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>up</b> to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where we set up a mechanism in the back of their mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases. Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started. Now I cannot prove that but I've seen it enough times that I'm impressed with it.}} allergy, common cold, and learning disorders.|$|E
