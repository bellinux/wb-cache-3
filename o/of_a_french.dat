5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over the threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 and concluded that its guns were too closely packed together {{and that they could}} not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E
5|$|Charlemagne was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} {{built for}} the French Navy in the mid-1890s, name ship of her class. She {{spent most of her}} career assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron (escadre de la Méditerranée). Twice she participated in the occupation of the port of Mytilene on the island of Lesbos, then owned by the Ottoman Empire, once as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> expedition and another as part of an international squadron.|$|E
5|$|Departing from Brest on 13 December 1805, it was 12 {{days before}} the Admiralty in London {{were aware of the}} French movements, by which time the French squadrons were deep in the Atlantic, one under Vice-Admiral Corentin-Urbain Leissègues {{intending}} to cruise in the Caribbean and the other, under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, sailing for the South Atlantic. Two British squadrons were hastily mustered and dispatched in pursuit, one under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and the other under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren. These squadrons were joined by a third under Rear-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth, who had deserted his station off Cadiz when he learned news <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> squadron to his south and subsequently crossed the Atlantic in pursuit of Willaumez. Although Willaumez managed to escape into the South Atlantic, Leissègues was less successful and was discovered and destroyed at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806 by a combined force under Duckworth and Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Other squadrons already at sea became embroiled in the campaign: a smaller squadron that had been raiding the African coast under Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien L'Hermite since August 1805 provided a diversion to the major campaign but failed to draw off significant British forces, while the remnants <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois that had been operating in the Indian Ocean since 1803 was intercepted and defeated by Warren in March, after a chance encounter on its journey back to France.|$|E

5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E
5|$|Fears in Solitude {{was written}} after rumors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> {{invasion}} spread across England. Although Coleridge {{was opposed to}} Prime Minister William Pitt's control over the British government, he sided with his homeland. He began work on the poem during April 1798 and it {{was first published in}} a small pamphlet along with Frost at Midnight and France: An Ode. It was eventually printed seven times with a later printing removing any anti-Pitt sentiment.|$|E

5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III {{did not like the}} idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to be a combination of those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|Kingswear Castle {{was built}} to protect the coastal town of Dartmouth in Devon. In the medieval period, the town's harbour, located in the estuary of the River Dart, was an {{important}} trading and fishing port, able to hold up to 600 vessels. Fears <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> invasion, combined {{with the hope of}} retaining a valuable royal subsidy, led the town to develop Dartmouth Castle, {{on the west side of}} the estuary, into an artillery fort between 1486 and 1495.|$|E
5|$|The Bombardment of Salé was a naval {{attack against}} the Moroccan city of Salé that took place between 26 and 27 November 1851, in {{response}} to the looting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> cargo ship by residents of the city. After seven hours of fighting, the Moroccan artillery suffered severe damage, and the French bombarded the city through the night, damaging the city's infrastructure and the Great Mosque of Salé.|$|E

5|$|The action {{came over}} {{eight months after}} the British had {{achieved}} a decisive victory over the French at the Battle of Lissa and was the first squadron action since that engagement. The action of November 1811 {{was the result of the}} British interception <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> military convoy traveling from Corfu to Trieste with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action was a factor in Napoleon's decision to change the direction of his planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} invasion threat passed, but {{the castle}} was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> attack. Around 1570, the main bastions {{were filled with}} earth, probably to allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 {{in response to the}} threat posed by the Spanish armada, and were probably kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|The results {{obtained}} by the Morea scientific expedition underscored the {{need to create a}} permanent, stable structure that would allow its work to continue. From 1846, it was possible to “systematically and permanently continue the work so gloriously and so happily begun by the Morea scientific expedition” due to the creation on rue Didot, at the foot of Mount Lycabettus, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> scientific institution, {{in the form of the}} French School at Athens.|$|E

5|$|The threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> {{invasion}} passed, {{and peace}} was declared in 1558. Attention {{shifted away from}} Portland, and a 1574 survey reported that the castle was in a poor condition, with similar concerns being repeated in 1583. Tensions with Spain grew and military attention focused on {{the threat to the}} south-west of England. War broke out in 1585, and £228 was spent on renovating Portland Castle. In 1596, the garrison still comprised a captain and 13 men.|$|E
5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|A second colony was {{established}} at the Arguin archipelago off the West African coast (now part of Mauritania). In contrast to the Guinean colony, Arguin had been a colony before: In 1520, Portugal had built a fort on the main island, which with all of Portugal came under Spanish control in 1580. In 1638 it was conquered by the Dutch Republic, and in 1678 by France, who due to high maintenance costs abandoned it and demolished the fort soon after. On 27 July 1685, an expedition was mounted by Frederick William and Raule, who took possession of the vacated colony on 1 October. Subsequently, the fort was rebuilt and contacts to the indigenous population established. France was alarmed and sent a vessel to re-conquer the fort in late 1687, but the attack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> frigate and a smaller vessel was beaten back by the Brandenburg-Prussian garrison. The victory improved the relations to the indigenous people, {{many of whom were}} carried off as slaves by the French before. While Arguin did not reach the economic importance of Großfriedrichsburg, it temporarily advanced to the world's primary staple port for slaves.|$|E
