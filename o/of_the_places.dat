5|$|A {{direct grant}} grammar {{school was a}} type of {{selective}} secondary school in England and Wales that existed between 1945 and 1976. One quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> in these schools were directly funded by central government, while the remainder attracted fees, some paid by the Local Education Authority and some by private pupils. On average, the schools received just over half of their income from the state.|$|E

5|$|Before Æthelberht's {{death in}} 616 {{a number of}} other bishoprics had been {{established}} but after that date, a pagan backlash set in and the see, or bishopric, of London was abandoned. Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburg, married Edwin, the king of the Northumbrians, and by 627 Paulinus, the bishop who accompanied her north, had converted Edwin and {{a number of other}} Northumbrians. When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee to Kent. Although the missionaries could not remain in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> they had evangelised, by the time the last of them died in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman tradition to the practice of Christianity in Britain.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{the fact}} that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> names in <b>the</b> {{gazetteer}} record the spatial information only in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> center coordinates,which lacks <b>the</b> description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific spatial extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> name,one-sidedness and limitations exist in the toponym information retrieval. Based on <b>the</b> fully analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> names,spatial attributes and spatial relations,the paper proposes a weighted Voronoi diagram-based retrieval approach for point-like toponym information,which considers <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> different properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> names belonging to the same type in the information retrieval,and takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weighted Voronoi diagram in <b>the</b> boundary approximation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place.</b> <b>The</b> approach constructed weighted Voronoi diagram based on <b>the</b> area properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same type <b>place</b> names,and approximated <b>the</b> spatial extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>place.</b> Then,spatial relation between two places could be described,and the spatial similarity was achieved by the given equations to calculate <b>the</b> similarities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> topological,directional and distance relationship. The approach was verified by approximating boundaries of administrative divisions and retrieving their information. The experiment results show that the approach can be better applied in <b>the</b> approximation <b>of</b> spatial extents and relations <b>of</b> <b>place</b> names,and <b>the</b> spatial similarity matching between query words and geographical information resources can be improved. Finally,the proposed approach is better than the traditional approaches...|$|R

5|$|Aldfrith {{appears to}} have had the support of leading ecclesiastics, most notably his {{half-sister}} Ælfflæd and the highly respected Bishop Cuthbert. He is known to have received confirmation at the hands of Aldhelm, later the Bishop of Sherborne in the south-western Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Wessex. Aldhelm too had received an Irish education, but in Britain, at Malmesbury. Correspondence between the two survives, and Aldhelm sent Aldfrith his treatise on the numerology of the number seven, the Epistola ad Acircium. Aldfrith also owned a manuscript on cosmography, which (according to Bede) he purchased from Abbot Ceolfrith of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in exchange for an estate valued at eight hides. Aldfrith was a close friend of Adomnán, Abbot of Iona from 679, and may have studied with him. In the 680s Aldfrith twice met with Adomnán, who came to seek the release of the Irish captives taken in Berht's expedition of 684. These were released and Adomnán presented Aldfrith with a copy of his treatise De Locis Sanctis ("On the Holy Places"), a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> of pilgrimage in the Holy Land, and at Alexandria and Constantinople. Bede reports that Aldfrith circulated Adomnán's work for others to read.|$|E
5|$|Art in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} artistic production within the modern borders of Scotland, between the fifth century and {{the adoption of the}} Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. In the early Middle Ages, there were distinct material cultures evident in the different federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art was the only uniquely Scottish Medieval style; it {{can be seen in the}} extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hoards. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata suggests that it was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places,</b> as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.|$|E

5|$|Bede's primary {{intention}} {{in writing}} the Historia Ecclesiastica was to show {{the growth of the}} united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; {{by the end of the}} Historia the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons. This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the Historia is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> and people about which he wrote.|$|E

The bus also recorded video footage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> that it visited. A second bus was introduced in 1996. The two original buses were retired in 2010, and the C-SPAN Digital Bus was inaugurated, introducing the public to C-SPAN's enhanced digital products. C-SPAN has also equipped six Local Content Vehicles (LCVs) to travel the country and record unique political and historical stories, with each vehicle containing production and web-based technologies to produce on-the-spot content.|$|E
5|$|Dorset is famed in {{literature}} {{for being the}} native county of author and poet Thomas Hardy, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places</b> he describes in his novels in the fictional Wessex are in Dorset, which he renamed South Wessex. The National Trust owns Thomas Hardy's Cottage, in Higher Bockhampton, east of Dorchester; and Max Gate, his former house in Dorchester. Several other writers have called Dorset home, including Douglas Adams, who wrote much of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy while he lived in Stalbridge; John le Carré, author of espionage novels, was born in Poole; Tom Sharpe of Wilt fame lived in Bridport; John Fowles (The French Lieutenant's Woman) lived in Lyme Regis before he died in late 2005; T.F. Powys lived in Chaldon Herring for over 20 years and used it as inspiration for the fictitious village of Folly Down in his novel Mr. Weston's Good Wine; John Cowper Powys, his elder brother, also set {{a number of his}} works in Dorset, such as the novels Maiden Castle and Weymouth Sands. The 19th-century poet William Barnes was born in Bagber and wrote many poems in his native Dorset dialect. Originating from the ancient Norse and Saxon languages, the dialect was prevalent across the Blackmore Vale but has fallen into disuse.|$|E

5|$|Only {{fragments}} of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland. Pictish {{art can be}} seen in the extensive survival of carved Pictish stones, particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno (Angus). There are a few survivals of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the Whitecleuch Chain, and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include items such as the Hunterston brooch, which with other items such as the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>places,</b> as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art include metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. After the Christian conversion of what is now Scotland in the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E

Pictish art {{can be seen in}} the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus).

Insular art is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland after the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved High crosses found most frequently in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created on Iona. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.|$|E
