5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can <b>overturn</b> the {{decisions}} of the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot <b>overturn</b> decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively <b>overturn</b> decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or <b>overturn</b> decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E

To our knowledge, no studies have incorporated the spatial scan statistic in identifying high-risk areas for tractor <b>overturns.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether tractor <b>overturns</b> cluster in certain parts of Kentucky and identify factors associated with tractor <b>overturns.</b> A spatial statistical analysis using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic was performed to identify county clusters at greatest risk for tractor <b>overturns.</b> A regression analysis was then performed to identify factors associated with tractor <b>overturns.</b> The spatial analysis revealed a cluster of higher than expected tractor <b>overturns</b> in four counties in northern Kentucky (RR =  2. 55) and 10 counties in eastern Kentucky (RR =  1. 97). Higher rates of tractor <b>overturns</b> were associated with steeper average percent slope of pasture land by county (p =  0. 0002) and a greater percent of total tractors with less than 40 horsepower by county (p< 0. 0001). This study reveals that geographic hotspots of tractor <b>overturns</b> exist in Kentucky and identifies factors associated with <b>overturns.</b> This study provides policymakers a guide to targeted county-level interventions (e. g., roll-over protective structures promotion interventions) with the intention of reducing tractor <b>overturns</b> in the highest risk counties in Kentucky...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTurbulent <b>overturns</b> are {{distinguished}} from salinity-compensated intrusions in high-resolution moored thermistor string observations. The buoyancy frequency N {{is used to}} make the time dimensionless, "t*. " This results in a primary, visual means to easily compare the duration of <b>overturns</b> with N, the natural frequency that separates internal waves from turbulent <b>overturns.</b> As a secondary means, the shapes of <b>overturns</b> are investigated. Above various sloping topography between 500 and 1, 000 m water depth where the buoyancy period varies between ∼ 1, 300 and 2, 600 s, vertical <b>overturns</b> of ∼ 40 m last Δt* = 0. 2 – 0. 4. This corresponds with the timescale of growth of model-stratified turbulence {{in the wake of a}} grid. Smaller-scale, weaker-turbulent, shear-induced Kelvin-Helmholtz <b>overturns</b> of ∼ 5 m are observed to last approximately Δt* = 0. 03, whereas the passage of their train of multiple consecutive <b>overturns</b> lasts up to approximately Δt* = 0. 95.

5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant <b>overturn</b> at the ministerial level. In {{less than three years}} Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative with the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio {{for a longer period of}} time, as he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the <b>overturn</b> in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E
40|$|An annual-mean surface-forced {{component}} of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC) in density space, surf(,?), is diagnosed from observed surface heat and freshwater fluxes. The climatological mean of surf over 1980 – 97 indicates steady <b>overturning</b> rates for those water masses that are principally formed through surface buoyancy forcing: 8 Sv of Greenland Sea Deep Water (GSDW), 4 Sv of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), and 4 Sv of 18 ° Water (STMW). Obtained for each year over 1980 – 97, surf reveals interannual-to-decadal variability in the renewal and <b>overturning</b> of these water masses. The total surface-forced <b>overturning</b> rate varies in the range 10 – 20 Sv, reaching peak values in 1989 – 90 and generally decreasing over the period 1990 – 97. More dramatic changes are apparent in the <b>overturning</b> of different water masses. The <b>overturning</b> of STMW exhibits large-amplitude interannual variability. A background positive trend over 1980 – 97 is dominated by variance of 13. 4 Sv. By contrast, the <b>overturning</b> rates of LSW and GSDW vary more slowly, on decadal timescales. LSW <b>overturning</b> rates increase from near zero in the early 1980 s {{to a maximum of}} 10 Sv in 1990 and return to near zero by 1997. Seemingly in antiphase, GSDW <b>overturning</b> rates decline from a peak rate of 11 Sv in 1981 to a minimum of 3. 5 Sv in 1991, and then increase somewhat up to 1997. The variability in these <b>overturning</b> rates is related to changes in the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic oscillation (AO) over 1980 – 97. Correlation coefficients between total <b>overturning</b> rate and three versions of the NAO index are significantly positive at a 99 % confidence level. Also highly significant is a correlation of LSW <b>overturning</b> and the AO index, and an anticorrelation between <b>overturning</b> of LSW and GSDW. The <b>overturning</b> of STMW is more weakly (and not significantly) anticorrelated with NAO indices, although there is highly significant anticorrelation between interannual changes in STMW <b>overturning</b> and one version of the NAO index. Stronger LSW (GSDW) <b>overturning</b> in years when NAO indices are relatively high (low) is consistent with recent hydrographic evidence. The extent to which these relationships support a hypothesis that the NAO drives interannual-to-decadal variability in the THC, through wintertime atmospheric buoyancy forcing of the ocean, is discussed. <br/...|$|R

The fact that the Court {{accepted}} this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v.

40|$|In {{this report}} a {{description}} is given of research into <b>overturning</b> of lorries, based principally on literature from Western Europe and the United States. Emphasis {{is placed on}} possible measures {{that can be taken}} to prevent <b>overturning</b> of lorries. In Europe, <b>overturning</b> occurs in 3 % to 10 % of all accidents involving lorries. In the United States, <b>overturning</b> occurs in 4 % to 9 % of all accidents involving lorries, in one third of single vehicle accidents with lorries, and in 15 % of the fatal accidents with lorries. Among the factors playing a role in <b>overturning,</b> 'high speed', `swerving', and `curves' are highly represented. High wind is an important cause inoverturning. Measures that can be taken to prevent <b>overturning</b> of lorries are: (1) Impose a limitation on traffic during times when gusts of winds are higher than 17 to 20 m/s; (2) Indicate a safe speed at which lorry drivers can take curves; and (3) use premium differentiation and compulsory excess to stimulate hauliers to use vehicles less susceptible to <b>overturning.</b> In addition, a number of measures are made to reduce the consequences of <b>overturning</b> of lorries, for instance: install automatic three-point seatbelts in lorries, with all anchorages located on the seat...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of the {{electromagnetic}} (EM) scattering of time-varying <b>overturning</b> wave crests is a worthwhile endeavor. <b>Overturning</b> wave crest {{is one of the}} reasons of sea spike generation, which increases the probability of false radar alarms and reduces the performance of multitarget detection in the environment.

40|$|Understanding {{changes in}} ocean {{circulation}} {{during the last}} deglaciation is crucial to unraveling the dynamics of glacial-interglacial and millennial climate shifts. We used neodymium isotope measurements on postdepositional iron-manganese oxide coatings precipitated on planktonic foraminifera to reconstruct changes in the bottom water source of the deep western North Atlantic at the Bermuda Rise. Comparison of our deep water source record with <b>overturning</b> strength proxies shows that both the deep water mass source and the <b>overturning</b> rate shifted rapidly and synchronously during the last deglacial transition. In contrast, any freshwater perturbation caused by Heinrich event 1 could have only affected shallow <b>overturning.</b> These findings show how changes in upper-ocean <b>overturning</b> associated with millennial-scale events differ from those associated with whole-ocean deglacial climate events. Changes in ocean <b>overturning</b> affect re-gional climate through the redistributionof heat energy to the high latitudes (1).

40|$|The Atlantic meridional <b>overturning</b> {{circulation}} {{affects the}} latitudinal distribution of heat, {{and is a}} key component of the climate system. Proxy reconstructions, based on sedimentary Pa- 231 /Th- 230 ratios and the difference between surface-and deep-water radiocarbon ages, indicate that during the last glacial period, the <b>overturning</b> circulation was reduced during millennial-scale periods of cooling(1 - 5). However, much debate exists over the robustness of these proxies(6 - 8). Here e combine proxy reconstructions of sea surface and air temperatures and a global climate model to quantitatively estimate changes in the strength of the Atlantic meridional <b>overturning</b> circulation during the last glacial period. We find that, relative to the Last Glacial Maximum, the <b>overturning</b> circulation was reduced by approximately 14 Sv during the cold Heinrich event 1. During the Younger Dryas cold event, the <b>overturning</b> circulation was reduced by approximately 12 Sv, relative to the preceding warm interval.
