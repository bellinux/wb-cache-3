5|$|The WonderSwan Color remake was {{released}} in Japan on December 9, 2000, and featured many new graphical changes. The 8-bit graphics of the original Famicom game were updated, battle scenes incorporated full background images, and character and enemy sprites were redrawn to look more like the <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Super Famicom Final Fantasy games.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} federation {{was created}} in 1956 and became a FIFA affiliate in 1956. However women's football {{is not included in}} the country's FIFA coordinated Goals! project. By 2011, inside the Saudi Arabia Football Federation, there has been an effort to create women's football programs at universities. Input had been sought on how to do this from other national federations including <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States, Germany, Brazil and the United Kingdom. On the men's side of the game, the national federation has funded efforts {{to improve the quality of}} the Saudi Arabia men's national football team.|$|E
5|$|Brunel and Gooch both {{gave their}} {{locomotives}} names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies {{that became a}} part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge <b>ones.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> time of Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives– both broad and standard– were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the final}} days of the Mandate period, the museum was {{administered}} by the British Palestine Government. In April 1948, the High Commissioner appointed a council of international trustees to administer the museum. The council consisted of twelve members: two representing <b>the</b> High Commissioner, <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Academy, <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British Museum, <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French National Academy, <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Antiquities Departments of the Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iraqi or Transjordanian governments; <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew University of Jerusalem, <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Royal Swedish Academy, <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American Institute of Archaeology, and <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem.|$|R

5|$|The hardy plants Robinson {{endorsed}} {{were not}} all natives by any means: two chapters {{are devoted to}} the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design, in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E
5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the course}} of the Middle Ages names derived from Christian Saints became more common than Germanic <b>ones.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> 12th century onwards it became custom for the child to receive a Christian name, {{although}} some names of Germanic origin like Gertrude and Hubertus remained prevalent as these too became names of Christian saints.|$|E

25|$|A demo of {{the game}} was {{originally}} featured in the spin-off The Misadventures of Tron Bonne, with its purpose being to show an overview {{of the game}}play of the title despite having an independent story. Critical reception to Mega Man Legends 2 has overall been positive with video game publications praising how the graphics and the gameplay improved over the ones from its prequel. Additionally, the game's story was praised for how complex it is in comparison to the <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original series.|$|E
25|$|Hypercube graphs, partial cubes, and median graphs are bipartite. In these graphs, the {{vertices}} may {{be labeled}} by bitvectors, {{in such a}} way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding bitvectors differ in a single position. A bipartition may be formed by separating the vertices whose bitvectors have an even number of <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vertices with an odd number of ones. Trees and squaregraphs form examples of median graphs, and every median graph is a partial cube.|$|E

25|$|A highly industrialized land, {{the nominal}} GDP of Catalonia in 2014 was €200 billion (the highest in Spain) and {{the per capita}} GDP was €27,000 ($30,000), behind Madrid (€31,000), the Basque Country (€30,000), and Navarre (€28,000). In that year, the GDP growth was 1.4%. In recent {{years there has been}} a {{negative}} net relocation rate of companies based in Catalonia moving to other autonomous communities of Spain. In 2014, for example, Catalonia lost 987 companies to other parts of Spain (mainly Madrid), gaining 602 new <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest of the country.|$|E
25|$|In 1624, Great Inquisitor Fernando Martins Mascarenhas created, {{with the}} help of Jesuit Baltasar Álvares, the first Index of the 17th century, which had a new feature: general {{guidance}} - the rules of the Portuguese Catalogue - besides the <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Universal Roman Catalogue. The Index consisted, therefore, of three parts: the Tridentine Index, the Index pro Regnis Lusitaniae, and a section detailing the content to be removed from any book published about the Scriptures, philosophy, theology, the occult, and even science and literature. This Index would be in use until the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Second, new {{churches were}} built and others restored, {{with the help}} of ktitoriPrinces, officials, hierarchs, monks, merchants, etc. Thus, at least nine monasteries were {{established}} in the area, and nine churches in the city. Of these, the churches from the 15th and 16th centuries were either a simple nave with no bell tower or had the trefoil cross plan of Cozia Monastery. The <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 17th century followed the native Wallachian style adopted under Matei Basarab's reign, while those of the 18th century show many Brâncovenesc characteristics, including a balcony.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} of the two ex-college campuses {{has changed over the}} years. While at the time of unification each had approximately equal numbers of students, buildings at Marischal College began to be expanded in the late-19th century with a significant rebuilding effort completed in 1906. In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King's College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1960s onward were constructed in brutalist style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} textual {{variants}} of Luke–Acts, the Western text-type and the Alexandrian. The oldest complete Alexandrian manuscripts date from the 4th century and the oldest Western <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 6th, with fragments and citations {{going back to the}} 3rd. Western texts of Acts are 6.2–8.4% longer than Alexandrian texts, the additions tending to enhance the Jewish rejection of the Messiah {{and the role of the}} Holy Spirit, in ways that are stylistically different from the rest of Acts. These conflicts suggest that Luke–Acts was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century. The majority of scholars prefer the Alexandrian (shorter) text-type over the Western as the more authentic, but this same argument would favour the Western over the Alexandrian for the gospel of Luke, as in that case the, Western version is the shorter. The debate therefore continues.|$|E
25|$|The five-year {{waiting period}} was {{established}} in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active <b>ones.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; Joe DiMaggio received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s Simpson Simpson and A. J. Tuzzolino {{developed}} the dust flux monitor instrument which involved a thin sheet of plastic which was polymerized {{in the presence}} of a strong electric field perpendicular to the plane of the plastic, and then electrically polarized carrying a positive electric charge on one of its surfaces and a negative charge on the other. The way it operated was such that a dust particle or heavy nucleus penetrating through the sheet first vaporizes in a small area releasing the charges, then the electrical signal indicates the location and size of the hole in the plastic which is then calibrated to give information on its speed and size. These calibrations took place from 1985 until 1989. Simpson's device was used on spacecraft Vega 1 and Vega 2 to Halley's comet in 1986, and earned him the Gagarin Medal for Space Exploration that year for his contribution towards the success of the Vega mission, as his instruments had been the only <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States to encounter the comet.|$|E
25|$|From {{the outside}} it is {{difficult}} to differentiate between the first three types of LRVs. There are, however, distinct features that one can use to tell them apart; Phase III LRVs still retain their original green electronic displays while all other LRVs have new orange electronic displays. Phase I cars also have a wide window at the rear that can be opened in case of an emergency, while Phase II cars have a door at the back. The interior of the phase three cars has a greenish look and the doors are also green. The Phase IV LRVs have a completely different appearance in contrast to the older phase. It has a white exterior livery with olive green and purple line on the side. The shape of the front of the LRV is more streamlined than the older phases. The door opening and closing mechanism was similar to the <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> K-class cars used in the Tseung Kwan O line and Tung Chung line. The Phase IV has 3 surveillance cameras in each vehicle. Seat belts and wheelchair positions were also available in the Phase IV. On older-generation LRVs there is a poach seat but the Phase IVs do not maintain this feature. The Phase IV LRV has orange electronic display. The refurbished Phase I LRVs have rounded rectangular windows while Phase IV LRVs have square ones.|$|E
