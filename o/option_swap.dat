40|$|Publisher's version {{available}} accessed from [URL] {{paper will}} attempt to discuss the main features and other basic facts of <b>options</b> and <b>swaps</b> and also their use as risk management tools. A number of diagrams have been drawn to vividly illustrate the key points of the arguments presented, especially on different option strategies used in options markets. Increased financial risk causes losses to otherwise profitable business organisations. Although {{a lot of people}} in general and investors in particular have become skeptical about financial derivatives, there is a general belief that where such financial instruments are used with great caution, a lot of benefits will be derived from their use, resulting in the maximization of shareholdersâ€™ wealth. This underlines the importance of <b>options</b> and <b>swaps</b> as risk management tools, especially to hedge against uncertainty. Derivatives provide an effective solution to the problem of risks caused by uncertainty and volatility in underlying assets. This article specifically analyses two types of derivatives which are <b>options</b> and <b>swaps</b> and how they can be used to mitigate against various types of risks to which organizations and markets are exposed.

40|$|This paper {{makes an}} {{analysis}} on a default <b>swap</b> <b>option</b> that an investment bank in Japan produced on the credit-risk of a convertible bond issued by a third company C. In this default <b>swap</b> <b>option,</b> a protection buyer A against a default of C owns the right of starting an interest swap between the buyer and a protection seller B when a credit event happens. When B starts the swap after a default, the floating rate {{is associated with the}} protection premium. After a certain simplification, this paper gives a no-arbitrage valuation formula for the premium in a discrete time approach. In addition, when the credit quality of the parties A and B is taken into account in the valuation, a fair value of the default <b>swap</b> <b>option</b> is also derived. 1. Intoroduction In this paper, we consider a valuation problem on a default <b>swap</b> <b>option</b> (DSO) or equivalently an asset <b>swap</b> <b>option</b> sold in Japan. The product is an option that gives the right to start an asset swap when one of the default events specified in the contract takes place. When the swap is started, at the outset a specific CB (convertible bond) issued by a third company is exchanged with its principal amount and then an interest swap follows with the coupon rate of the CB as a swap rate. In the swap, the receiver of th...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} whitnessed {{increased}} investors' interest in commodity markets also in Poland. Investment in commodities is possible through various vehicles: {{purchase of a}} physical commodity or a commodity-related stock, forward and futures contracts, <b>options,</b> <b>swaps,</b> exchange traded funds, and commodity-linked time deposits. As in 2012 in Poland, several banks offered such deposits, the paper aims at evaluating their profitability from an investor's perspective. As those instruments use some elements typical for options, there were created and studied some options (barrier, Asian, basket, standard) constituting alternatives for the deposits. From the set of analyzed time deposits, only those linked to oil prices appeared to be profitable in the considered period. However, the highest profit would be produced by the combination of barrier options on crude oil...|$|R

The underlying dynamics of the yield curve is modelled by a random string whose trajectory produces a random surface described by a Brownian sheet. Generalising Black-Scholes' PDE methodology, we derive the Kolmogorov field equation which describes the time-evolution of the contingent claims and obtain explicit pricing formulae for a large class of interest rate options including European calls, compound <b>options,</b> <b>swaps,</b> swaptions, caps and captions. This model {{can be thought of as}} an infinite-factor Gaussian model in the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework and can be implemented without having to calibrate explicit parameters in the covariance function of the discount bond returns.
