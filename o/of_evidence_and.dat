5|$|A 2016 {{analysis}} of archaeological finds from Southwark in London, {{the site of}} the ancient Roman city Londinium in Roman Britain, suggests that two or three skeletons from a sample of twenty-two dating to the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD are of Asian ancestry, and possibly of Chinese descent. The assertion is based on forensics and the {{analysis of}} skeletal facial features. The discovery has been presented by Dr Rebecca Redfern, curator of human osteology at the Museum of London. No DNA analysis has yet been done, the skull and tooth samples available offer only fragmentary pieces <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> <b>and</b> the samples that were used were compared with the morphology of modern populations, not ancient ones.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the complexities <b>of</b> <b>evidencing</b> <b>and</b> assessing work-based learning, within educational, professional programmes at post-qualifying levels. Through {{an exploration of}} how learning takes place in practice situations and {{the most commonly used}} method <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> collection <b>and</b> assessment, portfolio-building, the paper debates the principles, rationale and characteristics underpinning assessment of practice in health and social care. The author concludes that there are two aspects <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> collection <b>and</b> its assessment that must be clarified. One aspect being that the objectives <b>of</b> collecting <b>evidence</b> need to be understood by all stakeholders, particularly in respect of the interface between professional regulation and professional development. The second aspect relates to the format and focus of the assessment strategy. The paper offers a framework for understanding the nature <b>and</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> collection <b>and</b> its place in the assessment of practice in the context of post-qualifying continuing professional education. The author’s objective is that this paper and the analytical model proposed, should contribute to the professional knowledge-base about ‘practical experiences in professional education’ by raising awareness and debate about how professional post-qualifying education and learning in practice is <b>evidenced</b> <b>and</b> assessed...|$|R
