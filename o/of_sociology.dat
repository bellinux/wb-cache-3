Znaniecki never finished his magnum opus, Systematic Sociology, which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology (1965).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the science <b>of</b> <b>sociology,</b> Znaniecki was also deeply interested in the larger field of the sociology of science. He analyzed the social roles of scientists, {{and the concept of}} a school of thought.|$|E
5|$|Outside <b>of</b> <b>sociology,</b> he {{influenced}} philosophers Henri Bergson and Emmanuel Levinas, and {{his ideas}} {{can be found}} latently {{in the work of}} certain structuralist thinkers of the 60s, such as Alain Badiou, Louis Althusser, and Michel Foucault.

5|$|Establishment <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> as an independent, {{recognized}} {{academic discipline}} is amongst Durkheim's {{largest and most}} lasting legacies.

5|$|Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French {{economist}} and physician. He {{was known for}} his early studies of social epidemiology, or the effects of socioeconomic status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for hygienic reform in factories and prisons. His work is considered pivotal {{in the history of the}} fields <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> and statistical inquiry, and he is considered a founder of epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|Much of Durkheim's {{work was}} {{concerned}} with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity; {{an era in which}} traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social institutions have come into being. His first major sociological work was The Division of Labour in Society (1893). In 1895, he published The Rules of Sociological Method and set up the first European department <b>of</b> <b>sociology,</b> becoming France's first professor <b>of</b> <b>sociology.</b> In 1898, he established the journal L'Année Sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{areas and}} {{directions}} {{of the scientific}} researches involve: global problems of contemporary civilization and Russia; analysis and forecasting of Russia’s socio-political development; social dynamics, structure and stratification of Russian society; methods and instruments for sociological research; <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> management; political and economic sociology; demographic and migratory processes; <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> federate and interethnic relations; social problems <b>of</b> national security; <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> human rights; <b>sociology</b> <b>of</b> youth; social ecology, etc.|$|R
5|$|Polish {{sociologist}} {{and historian}} of ideas Jerzy Szacki writes that Znaniecki's major contributions include: the founding <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> in Poland; {{his work in}} empirical sociology; and his work in sociological theory. Szacki notes that Znaniecki sought to bridge a number of gaps: between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches; between objectivity and subjectivity; between humanistic and naturalistic methodologies and viewpoints; and between American and European intellectual traditions.|$|E
5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is a fairly}} recent {{subfield}} <b>of</b> <b>sociology,</b> compared to more traditional subfields such as sociology of work, sociology of the family, and sociology of education: it saw most of its development {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of society. Leisure is now recognized as a major social institution, deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.|$|E
5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None of the founding fathers <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view <b>of</b> <b>sociology</b> as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E
