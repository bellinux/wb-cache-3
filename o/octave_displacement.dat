50|$|The {{first of}} the note changes begins in measure 44 on beat two, where there is an added D sharp as a double stop against a D natural. In the next measure, the first beat is {{transposed}} down an octave, probably to facilitate performance. Everything remains consistent until measure 54. At this point Tibor Serly has the viola resting, and yet Peter Bartók has actually included two measure of a melody to the soloists’ line. The most significant changes have yet to appear. Tibor Serly’s edition places measure 67 as a 6/4 bar, but Peter Bartók splits it into a 4/4 bar plus a 3/4 bar, and he actually adds a group of triplets. It is now clear why an orchestra must be absolutely certain which edition they are performing and ensure everyone has the same parts. This trend of alterations continues as Peter Bartók adds <b>octave</b> <b>displacements,</b> and even omits what is measure 74 in the Tibor Serly score.|$|R

[...] Zaimont describes her style as “highly dramatic with non-traditional but tonal underpinnings.” As Zaimont writes, “My style is essentially chromatic and non-contrapuntal.” [...] She also places importance on texture and has a strong ability to write idiomatically for all instruments, which is a result of her strong sense of inner hearing. She was forced to rely on this when an operation for otosclerosis in 1984 left her with hearing loss in her left ear. “When I woke up the next morning, I couldn’t hear birds.

5000|$|... "Savaşkan is a {{singular}} {{figure on the}} new music scene. His music employs highly personal pitch-time structuring methods, derived from notions of spatial perspective and architecture. This pitch-time technique was first displayed in his chamber works 'Many Stares Through Semi-Nocturnal Zeiss Blink' (1979) and 'Antedonia' (1980). The basis of the technique is the gradual circular rotation of pitch-classes moving at different speeds simultaneously; this rotation can be effected chromatically, micro-chromatically or through glissandi, or any combination of these. Since each rotating pitch-class may also be transposed through <b>octave</b> <b>displacement,</b> the resultant harmonic implications of three or more parts rotating in different directions at separate speeds can be quite complex and rich. 'Nodal' points are reached when two or more parts reach either a pure unison, or an octave, or some other simple consonance such as a perfect fifth, and these lend his music an unexpectedly clear sense of cadence at crucial structural points. In some pieces, such as the string quartet 'Speed/1969' (1986) the natural overtones of a rotating pitch may also {{be incorporated into the}} work's harmony. In others, such as the saxophone quartet 'The Street' (1982) the pitch-construction may incorporate elements from pre-existent popular or traditional musics.|$|E

All of these features demonstrate that the music has strong structural elements in form, motives, and sonorities, which unify the piece in an aurally coherent style as an organic whole.

40|$|The {{experimental}} choral psalm {{settings of}} Charles Ives (1874 - 1954) show rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic innovations that pre-date {{many of his}} composing contemporaries such as Schonberg and Stravinsky. Of these works, only Psalm 67 is performed regularly. Regardless of their historical significance, the remaining experimental settings; Psalms 14, 24, 25, 54, 100, 135, and 150 are rarely performed {{due in part to}} their level of difficulty. This study presents a series of learning sequences for these psalm settings that can be implemented into typical rehearsal periods for advanced or auditioned choral ensembles. The sequences includes choral exercises and drills that introduce pertinent scalar and tonal structures, harmonic considerations, and varying rhythmic patterns. Various techniques are applied including musical chunking and <b>octave</b> <b>displacement.</b> A preliminary study was performed for the learning sequences designed for portions of Psalm 25. Participants and observers found the learning sequences to be effective in fostering an efficient use of rehearsal time. Revisions to the sequences were made according to suggestions from choral music faculty observers and completed participant questionnaires. Upon completion of the revisions for the method for Psalm 25, similar learning sequences were developed for the remaining psalm settings. Gregg Smith, conductor of the Gregg Smith Singers and editor of the psalm settings, was also interviewed regarding his editing, rehearsing, and performing experiences with these works.

40|$|During the mid 1960 s, record {{producers}} and jazz critics coined the phrase Sidewinder Syndrome {{to describe the}} funky style of music popularized through the success of Lee Morgan's solo release of "Sidewinder. The funky style, rooted {{in the heart of}} the hard bop period (1955 - 1965), united jazz, Latin influences, and popular black traditions such as gospel and urban blues. Lee Morgan (1938 - 1973), composer of "Sidewinder," and Richard "Blue" Mitchell (1930 - 1979) were two prolific trumpet artists from this time period who embraced the Sidewinder Syndrome, and as a result provided a rich improvisational vocabulary, as it pertains to trumpet performance practice. This study presents six annotated transcriptions from each artist focusing on elements of jazz vocabulary and solo construction. The study reveals vocabulary and solo construction preferences within the Sidewinder Syndrome. Results indicated the three most common harmonic generalization elements were digital patterns, change-running, and the bar-line shift. Complex harmonic generalization elements included bebop scale, 3 -b 9 movement, linear chromaticism, and tri-tone substitution / altered dominant. Vocal inflections derived from gospel music and urban blues were the half-valve, grace note, alternate fingerings, note bending, and fall. Bebop influenced articulation included upbeat-to-downbeat articulation and ghost note. Bebop influenced ornamentation included the two-sixteenth note ornament and the turn. Results suggest solo construction relied heavily upon the sequencing of rhythmic and melodic motives. Space was utilized for clarity, new concepts, and <b>octave</b> <b>displacement.</b> Developmental concepts included running eighth and sixteenth note lines. This study provides an opportunity for students of improvisation to isolate and study jazz vocabulary and solo construction of the Sidewinder Syndrome. School of Music"May 5, 2006. "Thesis (D.

40|$|This {{document}} {{centers on}} the Choralwerk, {{a large body of}} organ literature consisting of twenty-one volumes of chorale-based works, written by the twentieth-century Austrian composer, Johann Nepomuk David. The works, composed over a period of nearly fifty years, display a wide range of compositional techniques. ^ The Choralwerk compositions are examined by means of a set of criteria, delineating specific characteristics related to melody, harmony, texture, rhythm, meter and performance problems. By this means the reader may gain insight into the characteristics and challenges, both intellectual and technical, of David 2 ̆ 7 s chorale-based organ works. The ultimate purpose of this investigation is a pedagogical one: to provide organ teachers with information about the Choralwerk that will enable them to choose appropriate works from all levels of difficulty, and to teach those pieces more knowledgeably. ^ The thesis consists of two parts, followed by appendices. Part I is devoted to background information, including a brief survey of early twentieth-century musical currents and trends, a biographical account of David 2 ̆ 7 s life, and a summary of his compositional activity. A chronological listing of David 2 ̆ 7 s organ works in relation to important life events is given in Appendix A. ^ The second part of the thesis discusses criteria used to determine accessibility levels. It begins with melodic considerations (i. e., diatonicism and chromaticism, <b>octave</b> <b>displacement</b> and chromatic alteration). Harmonic criteria (i. e., dissonance treatment, poly and atonality) are discussed next, followed by textural characteristics. Criteria relating to rhythm and meter (i. e., rhythmic and metric independence of voices) are examined next, and the discussion concludes with other considerations such as David 2 ̆ 7 s use of alto clef, large intervallic reaches, and registrational requirements of the compositions. ^ Appendix B offers an accessibility rating for each composition in the Choralwerk, and Appendix C contains a listing {{of some of the most}} accessible and attractive pieces. A letter from Heinrich Fleischer (a former colleague of David) in Appendix D, offering unique insight into several areas pertaining to David and his organ works, concludes the document. ...|$|E
