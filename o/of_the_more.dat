40|$|I examine here how Sumner’s concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> {{applies to}} modern urban society&mdash;in {{particular}} to law as an epiphenomenon <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> {{rather than an}} influence on them. Strongly-held mores are rare in contem-porary societies. Rather, submores pervade, causing conflict among antag-onistic interests. Law can sometimes bridge these submores, as in labor-management conflict. Law can also provide a framework within which pervasive mores may evolve. For these reasons, law can and does contribute much <b>more</b> to <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> <b>of</b> complex urban societies than Sumner perceived. 1 ntroduction William Graham Sumner, the great Yale sociologist, influ-enced generations of social scientists by his view of law as an epiphenomenon (Sumner 1906 : 53, 209), a position partially em-bodied by his disciples in the resounding metaphor, &dquo;law nm-ning counter to <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> cannot stand. &dquo; The master himself put it this way: &dquo;Acts of legislation come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mores</b> [...] Legislation [...] . has to seek standing ground on the exist...|$|R
