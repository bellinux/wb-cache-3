5000|$|The Pioneer <b>Oil</b> Company <b>Filling</b> <b>Station</b> is a {{historic}} building located in Grinnell, Iowa, United States. The northern half of the building {{dates back to the}} 1920s when it was associated with a local farmers' cooperative. One of the services they provided was selling gasoline. The building was expanded in 1931 into a more traditional <b>filling</b> <b>station</b> as selling fuel became a more prominent part of the operation. The building attained its present appearance in 1937 when the service bays and the decorative brick veneer were added. It retained its original name, [...] "Pioneer Oil Company," [...] throughout its time as a service station even though it became affiliated with Mobilgas in 1936. [...] That affiliation ended in 1962. During World War II it became a tire inspection center under the wartime tire rationing program. The service station ceased operations around 2004. The building was re-purposed into the Mobil Wash and Wax, an automotive detailing business located in the service bays, and the Candyland Cafe in the northern portion of the building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.|$|R

When word of the spacemen goes public, the Republican Party bounces William Howard Taft as their '08 nominee, reasoning that only a man as brilliant as Edison would be able to steer America through such incredible new times.In 1909, Edison has the aliens placed under house arrest in New York so that he can pry technological secrets from them. They escape (thanks to former president Roosevelt), however, and head to Europe, and Edison is obliged to dispatch Marines to go after them. When he finally has them in his clutches again, President Edison realizes that the amount of technology the aliens possess would, if widely distributed, cause widespread upheaval."Nearly free power for everyone, available tomorrow, ain’t that grand?
