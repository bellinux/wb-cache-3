The other Republican incumbent, Donald C. Rubel, who had won a special election as an independent Republican backed by Democrats, lost his spot to Thomas M.

5|$|Octavian {{was left}} to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of {{thousands}} of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> <b>side</b> with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination {{of one of the}} Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Spanish <b>Republican</b> Air Force was {{popularly known}} as [...] "La Gloriosa" [...] (The Glorious One). But, {{according}} to some historians, the command structure of the Spanish loyalist forces was marred by ineptitude and lack of decision-making throughout the Civil War. Starting from the crucial first weeks of the conflict in July 1936, the rebel side was able to undertake a massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco using mostly the slow Ju 52, without any Spanish Republican interference. This was the world's first long-range combat airlift and <b>the</b> military planes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Spanish <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> failed to check it.|$|R

50|$|During {{the civil}} war the MacSwiney sisters were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican,</b> anti-Treaty <b>side</b> in {{opposition}} to the pro-Treaty Free State government. In the autumn of 1922, Patrick MacSwiney had, at Mary’s request, taken charge of a bag for a friend whose premises were in danger of being raided by government forces. MacSwiney did not examine the contents and deposited the bag in the Clifton convent of which he was chaplain, which was raided shortly afterwards by Free State government forces. The bag was found to contain ₤3,000. It was rumoured by government supporters that this was part of the ₤100,000 that had been robbed by <b>republican</b> forces from <b>the</b> Customs House in Dublin and that the priest had abused the nuns’ trust by hiding the stolen money in <b>the</b> convent <b>on</b> behalf of Mary MacSwiney. The incident led to his being removed from his clerical duties in Cork and sent to Dunmanway.|$|R
25|$|The armies kept growing. The {{principal}} {{source of}} manpower was conscription; both sides continued and expanded their schemes, the Nationalists drafting somewhat more aggressively, {{and there was}} little room left for volunteering. Foreigners contributed little to further growth; on the Nationalist side the Italians scaled down their engagement, while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> the influx of new interbrigadistas did not cover losses suffered by these units on the front. At the turn of 1937/1938 both armies achieved numerical parity and equalled about 700,000 each.|$|E
25|$|Tom Mann {{continued}} to actively champion socialism, communism and co-operation, {{until his death}} in 1941. He published further pamphlets and regularly addressed public meetings, in Britain and abroad. He was arrested for sedition, on several occasions.

During the Spanish Civil War, he wanted to fight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> but was by that time far too old. A unit of the International Brigade, the Tom Mann Centuria, was named in his honour.|$|E
25|$|George W.

The result forecast a tough two-man race for the GOP nomination, which would carry on until Super Tuesday in March. Al Gore helped himself with a narrow win in the Democratic primary, which somewhat assuaged his supporters' concerns about Bill Bradley's insurgent campaign.|$|E
25|$|The IRA {{considered}} {{itself to}} be upholding the Republic that was declared in the 1916 Proclamation, and held {{that the government of}} the Irish Free State was illegitimate. It maintained that it remained the army of that Republic, in direct continuity with the IRA of the War of Independence period. There were several competing organisations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radical <b>republican</b> <b>side</b> of Irish politics during this period. In addition to the IRA, these included the hard-line elements of anti-Treaty Sinn Féin, such as Mary MacSwiney, who had not followed de Valera into constitutional politics, and the rump of the anti-Treaty members of the Second Dáil, still proclaiming themselves the only legitimate Irish parliament. For most of this period, the IRA's relations with Sinn Féin were poor (IRA members were even forbidden to join the party), despite the reconciliation attempt represented by the 1929 Comhairle na Poblachta. In December 1938, a reconciliation finally took place between the IRA and the rump of the Second Dáil.|$|R
5000|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> other <b>side,</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{were upset}} {{when they learned}} {{that some of the}} voters casting ballots were under the age of 18. State senator Gregory Lavelle, who served as Marino's {{campaign}} manager, said this was [...] "outrageous" [...] and filed a complaint of his own when he heard of it by noon that day. However, New Castle County's Election Department explained that state law allows those as young as 16 to register when they receive their driver's licenses, as long as they will be 18 by the next general election.|$|R
5000|$|Paris was by now {{established}} informally as {{the western}} {{headquarters of the}} German Communist Party in exile. In 1937 she started working for [...] "Deutsche Freiheitssender 29.8", a radio operation which provided broadcasting facilities for and <b>on</b> behalf of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side</b> in <b>the</b> Spanish Civil War. The radio station transmitted initially from Madrid, but celebrity supporters (and others) {{unable or unwilling to}} make their way across war torn Spain, including Bertolt Brecht, Albert Einstein, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Mann, were also able to speak <b>on</b> <b>the</b> station from an improvised studio in Paris. The radio station therefore retained a small editorial team in Paris of which Rothstein was a member. Another member was the communist political activist Gerhart Eisler whom, a few years later, she would marry.|$|R
25|$|A few {{well-known}} people fought <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> such as English novelist George Orwell (who wrote Homage to Catalonia (1938), {{an account}} of his experiences in the war) and Canadian thoracic surgeon Norman Bethune, who developed a mobile blood-transfusion service for front-line operations. Simone Weil added herself {{for a while to}} the anarchist columns of Buenaventura Durruti, though fellow fighters feared she might inadvertently shoot them because she was short-sighted, and tried to avoid taking her on missions. By the account of her biographer Simone Petrement, Weil was evacuated from the front after a matter of weeks because of an injury sustained in a cooking accident.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the greater part of the Spanish coast was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> <b>side</b> and despite the great number of naval units {{belonging}} to the Spanish Republican Navy, {{there was a lack of}} effective action in the first, decisive weeks of the war. Some of the most experienced commanders, such as Francisco Bastarreche, Pedro Nieto Antúnez, Francisco Núñez Rodríguez, Gabriel Pita da Veiga y Sanz, Francisco Regalado Rodríguez, Manuel Vierna Belando and the brothers Francisco and Salvador Moreno Fernández, had defected to the rebels. In addition the crew committees (Comités de Buque) that had taken over the command of the ships were not able to deal with the high coordination that was required at the time.|$|E
25|$|Before it {{was officially}} disbanded, however, the Spanish Civil War intervened and the corps split and served {{both sides with}} the {{garrison}}s of Ferrol and Cádiz on the Nationalist side and the garrison of Cartagena, {{as well as a}} detachment in Madrid, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side.</b> During the bitterly fought war the Marines performed garrison duties, led landing parties, and provided expert artillery and machine gun crews. The Republican 151 Brigada Mixta fought mostly inland battles far away from the sea. Photographer Robert Capa took pictures of the Spanish Republican Navy Marines in the Battle of the Segre. Republican Infantería de Marina Lieutenant Colonel Ambrosio Ristori de la Cuadra, killed in action during the Siege of Madrid, was posthumously awarded the Laureate Plate of Madrid.|$|E
50|$|The {{massacre}} of Badajoz was of great {{significance in the}} development of the war. In late August, as the Basque towns of Irun and Fuenterrabia were being shelled from the sea and bombed from the air, the rebels dropped pamphlets threatening to deal with the population as they had 'dealt with' the people of Badajoz. In consequence, panic-stricken refugees headed for France. The publication in the foreign press of the events meant that Franco ordered that such massacres were to cease, as they would harm the image of <b>the</b> rebels. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other <b>side,</b> <b>Republican</b> propaganda publicised <b>the</b> massacre enormously and used it to justify atrocities on their side, such as the Paracuellos {{massacre of}} November 1936.|$|R
50|$|The {{abbreviations}} {{used in the}} lyrics are a selection of civil war references from 1970s headlines, a suggestion of what could happen in the United Kingdom. The IRA and the UDA were the largest paramilitary armies in the conflict in Northern Ireland: the heavily armed IRA (Irish <b>Republican</b> Army) were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> (anti-British, pro-unification) <b>side,</b> while the thousands-strong UDA (Ulster Defence Association) were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Loyalist (pro-British, anti-unification) side. The MPLA (Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola, or the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) were the political group that took control of Angola, formerly one of Portugal's African colonies, in a 1975-76 civil war, and still run the country today. When Rotten sings, “I use the enemy,” it’s a deliberate homonym for “I use the NME,” or New Musical Express, the British weekly music newspaper.|$|R
5000|$|United States House of Representatives Page Program was {{a program}} {{run by the}} United States House of Representatives, under {{the office of the}} Clerk of the House, in which {{voluntary}} appointed high school juniors applicants acted as non-partisan federal employees in the House of Representatives, providing supplemental administrative support to House operations in a variety of capacities in Washington, D.C., at the United States Capitol. Pages reported to [...] "Chief Pages", commonly referred to as work bosses (or [...] "House Page Work Supervisors") <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Democratic and <b>Republican</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> House of Representatives Floor. As was the practice in Middle Ages, pages were used as a messaging service for the four main House Office Buildings (Rayburn, Longworth, Cannon, and Ford) as well as inside the Capitol. Other Page responsibilities included: taking statements from members of Congress after speeches (for the Congressional Record), printing and delivering vote reports to various offices, tending members' personal needs while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of the House, managing phones in the cloakrooms, and ringing the bells for votes. Pages were nominated by representatives based upon a highly competitive application process. Congressional Pages had served within the U.S. House of Representatives for almost 180 years.|$|R
25|$|The Spanish Civil War {{proved a}} major test for {{international}} pacifism, {{and the work}} of pacifist organisations (such as War Resisters' International and the Fellowship of Reconciliation) and individuals (such as José Brocca and Amparo Poch) in that arena has until recently been ignored or forgotten by historians, overshadowed by the memory of the International Brigades and other militaristic interventions. Shortly after the war ended, Simone Weil, despite having volunteered for service <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> <b>side,</b> went on to publish The Iliad or the Poem of Force, a work that {{has been described as a}} pacifist manifesto. In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as Richard B. Gregg, devised plans for a campaign of nonviolent resistance in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.|$|E
25|$|The race {{to assume}} Cunningham's seat was highly contested, {{especially}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side,</b> with 14 Republicans (compared with only 2 Democrats) officially {{running for the}} position. Leading up to the initial all-candidate election that would determine the parties' candidates in a runoff election, Bilbray was in a virtual tie with Republican businessman Eric Roach, slightly ahead of former State Assemblyman Howard Kaloogian. Four days before the election, businessman Alan Uke, {{one of the major}} Republican candidates, ran an attack ad accusing Roach of outsourcing thousands of jobs at the expense of American workers. In the initial all-party special election on April 11, 2006, Bilbray was the Republican candidate with the most votes, receiving 15% of the total vote to Roach's 15%. He then faced the top vote getters of all the other parties in a runoff election on June 6, 2006: Democrat Francine Busby, Libertarian Paul King, and William Griffith, an independent.|$|E
25|$|Orwell married Eileen O'Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the {{political}} crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At {{the end of}} the year, concerned by Francisco Franco's military uprising, (supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and local groups such as Falange), Orwell decided to go to Spain {{to take part in the}} Spanish Civil War <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>side.</b> Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on John Strachey's recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked him whether he would undertake to join the International Brigade and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation in situ, Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona.|$|E
