500|$|The author {{writes about}} Donald Trump's {{campaign}} style, [...] "He can do plenty of damage just by {{encouraging people to}} be as uninhibited in their stupidity as he is." [...] Taibbi refers to Trump as an ignorant individual engaged in confidence tricks, [...] "bloviating and farting his way" [...] along {{the trail of the}} 2016 election. The author recalls Trump, [...] "saying outrageous things, acting like Hitler one minute and Andrew Dice Clay the next." [...] The book offers a positive assessment of the campaign of Bernie Sanders for president. Taibbi writes, [...] "More than any politician in recent memory, Bernie Sanders is focused on reality. It’s the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> lost." ...|$|E

Other Los Baños prisoners later said: [...] "We are absolutely certain that {{had it not been for}} these nurses many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> alive and well would have died." [...] The nurses were awarded the Bronze Star Medal by the Army, a second award by the Navy and the Army's Distinguished Unit Badge.|$|E

So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril.

2500|$|In {{relation}} to non-intersectional feminism in the United States, Lorde famously said, [...] "Those {{of us who}} stand outside the circle of this society's definition of acceptable women; {{those of us who}} have been forged in the crucibles of difference -- those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> poor, who are lesbians, who are Black, who are older -- know that survival is not an academic skill. It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pro-peace {{attitude}} {{of the people of}} the Soviet Union and People's China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life. One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. [...] "We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We know that we can take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> trying to build a socialist society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "In {{the final}} analysis," [...] he wrote, [...] "a Justice's {{vote in a}} case like this depends more on his or her views about the {{respective}} lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and this Court than on conflicting policy interests. Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters' representatives on nonconstitutional matters." [...] While he had admittedly helped start the discussions about the various interpretations of Wilko in his dissent in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver, Inc. while chief judge of the Seventh Circuit, he said [...] "one of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been settled for many years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lorde {{actively}} strived for {{the change}} of culture within the feminist community by implementing womanist ideology. In the journal [...] "Anger Among Allies: Audre Lorde's 1981 Keynote Admonishing the National Women's Studies Association," [...] it is stated that Lorde's speech contributed to communication with scholars' understanding of human biases. While [...] "anger, marginalized communities, and US Culture" [...] are the major themes of the speech, Lorde implemented various communication techniques to shift subjectivities of the [...] "white feminist" [...] audience. Lorde further explained that [...] "we are working {{in a context of}} oppression and threat, the cause of which is certainly not the angers which lie between us, but rather that virulent hatred leveled against all women, people of color, lesbians and gay men, poor people—against all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> seeking to examine the particulars of our lives as we resist our oppressions, moving towards coalition and effective action." ...|$|E

They said don't give any info to anyone, because they were concerned that he would be subjected to more torture." [...] Businessman and POW advocate Ross Perot paid for Carol's medical care, and she remained grateful, later remarking: [...] "The military families are in Ross's heart and in his soul...There are millions <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> extremely grateful to Ross Perot". Years after John found out about Perot's help, he said [...] "we loved him for it".

2500|$|Recent biographies try to {{separate}} fact from legend and counter the folklore of ridicule that had formed around King John and which lacks documentary basis. Lúcia Bastos warns that even today {{we need to}} be careful to place certain matters in their historical context, such as the question of corruption, noting that although there were enormous costs and clear abuses, at that time there was no clear separation between the public treasury and the monarch's private accounts, and in the logic of the Old Regime [...] "the king is the owner of the state... of which the distribution of spoils forms part: the king is the dispenser of justice and spoils". In the words of Leandro Loyola, [...] "from the new research a ruler emerges who had his limitations, but who encountered a totally adverse situation and survived it, despite governing a small, poor, decadent country such as Portugal {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century." [...] Before dying on Saint Helena, his most powerful enemy, Napoleon, said of him: [...] "He was the only one who deceived me." [...] José Joaquim Carneiro de Campos, Marquis of Caravelas, praised him in the Brazilian Senate on the occasion of John's death, saying, [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> here have many reasons to praise the memory of King John VI, we all ought to be grateful, for the benefits he gave us: he raised Brazil to a kingdom, provided well for all of us, treated us always with great affection, and all Brazilians are obligated to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 2015, the Canadian House of Commons {{public safety}} {{committee}} passed {{a motion to}} invite RCMP Commissioner Paulson to [...] "publicly display and discuss the video" [...] that Zehaf-Bibeau recorded at a future meeting of the committee. Commissioner Paulson showed the video (minus 18 seconds which the RCMP said might be pertinent to investigations into accomplices) at the public safety committee meeting of March 6. Zehaf-Bibeau is quoted as saying: [...] "This is in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper [...] wants to send his troops to Iraq. Canada's officially become one of our enemies by fighting and bombing us and creating a lot of terror in our countries and killing us and killing our innocents. So, just aiming to hit some soldiers just to show that you're not even safe in your own land, and you gotta be careful. We'll not cease until you guys decide to be a peaceful country and stay to your own and stop going to other countries and stop occupying and killing the righteous <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> trying to bring back religious law in our countries. Thank you." [...] The video was recorded in the car, in Ottawa, {{on the day of}} the shootings and was found in the car abandoned in front of Parliament. Paulson said he believes that someone else was involved, and if they were found to have aided Zehaf-Bibeau, that they would be charged with terrorism offences. Paulson also said a post-mortem test for drugs and alcohol on Zehaf-Bibeau was negative and that he had a long knife tied to his wrist when he was killed by Parliament Hill security.|$|E
