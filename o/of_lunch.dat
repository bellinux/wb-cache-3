5|$|Five {{years after}} the original, Thompson {{returned}} to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during the Second World War, and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal. Building on the first film's success, it was another UK box office number one and the sequel was widely seen as an improvement. The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song <b>of</b> <b>Lunch,</b> which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.|$|E

Head Heritage described it as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>Lunch's</b> strongest statements. A difficult, overlooked but vital gem".|$|R
25|$|The first Test {{match at}} Lord's saw Chris Tremlett make his England Test debut. Michael Vaughan won the toss and chose to bat first. Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook took {{advantage}} of average Indian bowling scoring 40 runs after only 5 overs putting on 76 before Sourav Ganguly made the break through dismissing Cook on 36 lbw from his fourth ball of the match. No further wickets fell in the morning session although Strauss was dropped on 43 by Dinesh Karthik at the stroke <b>of</b> <b>lunch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starc {{dismissed}} Root for 130 {{and took}} two more wickets {{on the morning}} of the second day, but a quickfire lower-order partnership between Moeen Ali and Broad pushed England's total higher. England decided to declare at the brink <b>of</b> <b>lunch</b> when their total had reached 391/9. Australia's second innings began with a 113-run opening stand between Warner and Rogers. Ben Stokes took the first three Australian wickets and triggered a collapse. Adam Voges showed some resistance while wickets fell at the other end, taking Australia to 241/7 at the close of the day's play.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{opted not}} to enforce the follow-on, and he and Slater put on 109 in even time before Gough made the breakthrough, {{followed}} by two strikes from Tufnell, removing Boon, as the England bowlers fought back. Phillip DeFreitas also chipped in {{with a couple of}} wickets, but Healy (45 not out) helped the Australians set a target of 508 for England to chase. Warne struck either side <b>of</b> <b>lunch</b> to dismiss Stewart and Atherton, but Hick (80) and Graham Thorpe (67) gave the England fans some hope, adding 152 in four hours together before the close, playing Warne and May with relative ease.|$|E

25|$|The {{fourth day}} started brightly for England, Damien Martyn hooking a short ball from Flintoff {{straight}} {{into the hands of}} Collingwood, in the third over of the day, having added only one to his overnight score of nine. Further wickets fell, with an excellent knock by Matthew Hayden been brought to an end by Andrew Flintoff. Flintoff continued with impetus and trapped Simon Katich lbw for 1, before Hoggard had Adam Gilchrist lbw with an inswinger at the stroke <b>of</b> <b>lunch.</b> Gilchrist, however, had added a quick 23 that could be vital, as Australia went into the pavilion 17 runs behind with four wickets in hand.|$|E

25|$|However, in sunny {{conditions}} {{and on a}} good batting track, India found the going very easy. Admittedly Dabengwa dropped a hard catch off Virender Sehwag on 5, and Sehwag made the Zimbabweans pay, pounding six fours and one six in a 44 before Mahwire found a way through his defences at the stroke <b>of</b> <b>lunch.</b> India had added 88 for the first wicket, however, and although Gautam Gambhir departed for 46 shortly after lunch, the foundation was laid down. Rahul Dravid was back to his form from before the one-day series, and VVS Laxman also survived a tricky period to hit his eighth Test century. Mahwire added yet another wicket to his tally, as he lured Dravid into an edge that fell into Brendan Taylor's hands, but Laxman pounded Zimbabwe's bowlers in the evening session, giving them a relatively comfortable lead of 46 runs at stumps on day two.|$|E
25|$|Returning home, Cook {{was again}} {{selected}} for the first XI during Sri Lanka's tour. For his debut match at Lord's, Cook was shuffled down to third {{to make way for}} the returning Trescothick. However, he still walked to the crease alongside his teammate as Strauss fell at the stroke <b>of</b> <b>lunch.</b> Cook and Trescothick put on 127 in their partnership as Trescothick made a century while Cook later stumbled just before at 89; there was no second innings as England enforced the follow-on but were one wicket away from victory, with Cook being targeted among others for two significant dropped catches. Cook's first taste of victory came in the second Test, guiding the team past the target of 78 in the second innings with an unbeaten 34 alongside Andrew Flintoff furthering the reputation of his calm, meticulous style of play against the dangerous spin of Muttiah Muralitharan who took 4–29. Although not initially {{selected for the}} one-day series, Cook made his limited overs debut in the fourth match scoring 39 from 38 balls in a bright spot of an otherwise dour England performance hampered by injuries.|$|E
25|$|As England {{returned}} home weary from an entire Winter without a series victory after the euphoria {{of the previous}} two years, they completed a subcontinential triumvirate when Sri Lanka arrived to prove that Asian dominance was not particular to the Indian subcontinent. With the captaincy crown returned to Flintoff, Strauss could focus solely on his batting prowess at the ground that made him famous. Opening once again with Trescothick, Strauss fell two short of a half century to the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan at the stroke <b>of</b> <b>lunch,</b> allowing Cook to walk out to the wicket afterwards with company. Strauss went on to take the final wicket of Sri Lanka's first innings, Nuwan Kulasekara, catching him off Flintoff to allow England to enforce the follow-on which they could not capitalise on, forcing a draw. In the second Test, England took the lead with a victory after Strauss scored the second highest runs in both English innings, being controversially caught for 16 in the second off his pads. He recorded another half century in the third Test, {{though it was not}} enough to stave off a 134 run defeat. Once again he was offered the captaincy for the short form game, leading England in a tense, two run loss to Sri Lanka where he put on an opening partnership with Trescothick for 59. Under Strauss' captaincy England endured a five match whitewash where Strauss failed to muster even fifty though it was acknowledged that the team, particularly the bowling side, were under strength.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 This was an {{observational}} {{study of the}} food and nutrient contribution <b>of</b> <b>lunches</b> in the Food Pyramid Choices Menu system as offered to and eaten by 93 third graders participating from two schools in the Reynolds school district in Oregon. In response to current public health concerns in the U. S. and the emphasis on diets of moderation rather than simply nutritional adequacy, this study focused on the total and saturated fat content <b>of</b> the <b>lunches</b> offered to and eaten by third graders. In the Food Pyramid Choices Menu system, children are allowed to select their own lunches from a variety of entrees, milk, fruits, vegetables, and grain products. The meals as offered to the children were calculated as the mean amount of each food offered to each student in the school. Nutrient analysis for the average lunches as offered was done with Nutrikids (Lunchbyte Systems, Inc.) nutrient analysis software. One week <b>of</b> <b>lunches</b> were analyzed and averaged over the week. The meals as eaten were determined for each child by measuring the foods selected by each child, and subtracting the amount that was leftover by that child. The nutrient analysis for each child's lunches, as eaten, was averaged over the number of days that each child ate lunches while participating in the study. The nutrient content <b>of</b> <b>lunches</b> was analyzed using ESHA's Food Processor. Each student's data for each day was averaged over the week and then with data from all the students participating to arrive at the mean daily food and nutrient intakes.

500|$|The teams {{returned}} to Dhaka {{for the second}} Test, and made three changes; Bangladesh selected Shafiul Islam and Jahurul Islam to replace Aftab Ahmed and Shahadat Hossain, while England added a second spinner, with Carberry making way for Tredwell. The toss was once again won by Bangladesh, who opted to bat first. Tamim Iqbal, on his 21st birthday, scored runs with freedom on the first morning, reaching a half-century from 34 balls. He was dropped twice before that, by Collingwood and Cook, but his innings was described by David Hopps in Wisden Cricketers' Alamanack as [...] "taking something normally sedate and slightly forbidding, and making it wild and intoxicating." [...] Tamim's batting drew interest that he could become the fifth player in Test history to score a century on the first morning, but he was dismissed by Tredwell for 85, attempting a sweep. Swann, who had been particularly expensive against Tamim, took wickets either side <b>of</b> <b>lunch</b> to leave Bangladesh on 167 for 4. Shakib and Mahmudullah steadied the innings, scoring 59 runs together, before both were dismissed in close succession. Another patient partnership between Mushfiqur Rahim and Naeem Islam took Bangladesh past 300 runs. On the second morning, Bangladesh pressed aggressively, particularly through Shafiul Islam, who scored a half-century at just quicker than a run-a-ball. Cook's captaincy was criticised in Wisden where Hopps claimed that Cook's fields [...] "defied logic", while ESPNcricinfos Sahil Dutta described his captaincy as [...] "more robotic than insightful". Naeem Islam remained 59 not out as Bangladesh were bowled out for 419.|$|E
