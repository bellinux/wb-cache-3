I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there were a lot of people just standing there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole. It is what it is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} of coal mining in the Middle Ages in the shaft mounds, waggonways and similar archaeological features resulting from early mining activity in Middleton Woods. Before the 17th century the pits were bell pits and adits or day holes dug horizontally into the hill sides where the coal seam outcropped. In 1669 Frances Conyers of New Hall had [...] "cole pits" [...] in Middleton. The pits were small and numerous and many worked for a short time. Gin pits using horses to turn the windlass were the next development and the deeper pits had brick-lined shafts and wooden headgear for hauling tubs of coal and miners out of the workings. This type <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> in operation when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling whose family owned collieries in Durham. Brandling's 1,200 acre Middleton estate supplied coal to Leeds but was disadvantaged in the trade by poor roads. Deep mining arrived {{with the advent of}} steam engines to pump water out of the mines and keep the workings dry making it possible to raise coal from greater depths. In 1780 a Newcomen engine was installed at Middleton and by 1808 the mine employed 90 hewers and 60 putters. The market for coal grew as Leeds and its industries expanded.|$|E

500|$|The New Testament {{served as}} the basis for many of the lyrics of [...] "Amazing Grace". The first verse, for example, {{can be traced to the}} story of the Prodigal Son. In the Gospel of Luke the father says, [...] "For this son <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found". The story of Jesus healing a blind man who tells the Pharisees that he can now see is told in the Gospel of John. Newton used the words [...] "I was blind but now I see" [...] and {{declared}} [...] "Oh to grace how great a debtor!" [...] in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752. The effect of the lyrical arrangement, according to Bruce Hindmarsh, allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation [...] "Amazing grace!", to be followed by a qualifying reply in [...] "how sweet the sound". In An Annotated Anthology of Hymns, Newton's use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called [...] "crude but effective" [...] in an overall composition that [...] "suggest(s) a forceful, if simple, statement of faith". Grace is recalled three times in the following verse, culminating in Newton's most personal story of his conversion, underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners.|$|E

They’re not insignificant, but they are certainly quirky" [...] although the album [...] "could reward you, but not right away, and it's riddled with tics and mannerisms that are almost purposefully thrown in to turn you away".|$|E
