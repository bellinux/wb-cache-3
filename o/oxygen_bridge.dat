2500|$|The lolines are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} pyrrolizidine alkaloids produced by many plants, notably the necine ring containing a tertiary amine. This {{led to the}} early hypothesis that the biosynthesis of the lolines {{is similar to that}} of the plant pyrrolizidines, which are synthesized from polyamines. However, feeding studies with carbon isotope–labeled amino acids or related molecules in pure cultures of the loline-producing fungus N. uncinatum recently demonstrated that the loline alkaloid pathway is fundamentally different from that of the plant pyrrolizidines. The basic loline chemical structure is assembled in several biosynthetic steps from the amino acid precursors, L-proline and [...] L-homoserine. In the proposed first step in loline biosynthesis, these two amino acids are coupled in a condensation reaction linking the γ-carbon in homoserine to the secondary amine in proline in a PLP–type enzyme–catalyzed reaction to form the loline intermediate, N-(3-amino-3-carboxy)propylproline (NACPP). Further steps in loline biosynthesis are thought to proceed with sequential PLP-enzyme-catalyzed and oxidative decarboxylations of the carboxy groups in the homoserine and proline moieties, respectively, cyclization to form the core loline ring structure, and oxidation of the C-2 and C-7 carbons to give the <b>oxygen</b> <b>bridge</b> spanning the two pyrrolizidine rings.|$|E

5000|$|ZSM-5 is {{composed}} of several pentasil units linked together by <b>oxygen</b> <b>bridges</b> to form pentasil chains. A pentasil unit consists of eight five-membered rings. In these rings, the vertices are Al or Si and an O {{is assumed to be}} bonded between the vertices. The pentasil chains are interconnected by <b>oxygen</b> <b>bridges</b> to form corrugated sheets with 10-ring holes. Like the pentasil units, each 10-ring hole has Al or Si as vertices with an O assumed to be bonded between each vertex. Each corrugated sheet is connected by <b>oxygen</b> <b>bridges</b> to form a structure with [...] "straight 10-ring channels running parallel to the corrugations and sinusoidal 10-ring channels perpendicular to the sheets." [...] Adjacent layers of the sheets are related by an inversion point. The estimated pore size of the channel running parallel with the corrugations is 5.4-5.6 Å. The crystallographic unit cell of ZSM-5 has 96 T sites (Si or Al), 192 O sites, and a number of compensating cations depending on the Si/Al ratio, which ranges from 12 to infinity. The structure is orthorhombic (space group Pnma) at high temperatures, but a phase transition to the monoclinic space group P21/n.1.13 occurs on cooling below a transition temperature, located between 300 and 350 K.|$|R

50|$|In Hemopure, {{the average}} oxygen content is maximized {{due to the}} reduced size of the {{stabilized}} HBOC molecules in comparison to red blood cells (RBCs). Oxyglobin primarily differs from Hemopure in molecule size of the stabilized HBOC. Oxyglobin is approved for oxygen fluid therapy and an alternative to RBC transfusion in dogs, and is administered intravenously as well. The stabilized HBOC then flows through the blood plasma in the body, where oxygen transport takes place. Due to the reduced size of the HBOC in Hemopure, oxygen can be transported to restricted areas where normal RBCs fail to reach. Another advantage of this patented oxygen technology is the increased shelf life of 36 months through storage conditions at room temperature, while RBCs must be refrigerated and must be discarded after six weeks. However, these products are only indicated for temporary oxygen replenishment through the <b>oxygen</b> <b>bridge,</b> with an average half-life of 19 hours (specifically Hemopure), therefore long term oxygen support requires RBC blood transfusion.|$|E

40|$|It is {{customary}} {{to think}} of the morphine molecule as built upon a phenanthrene nucleus or upon phenanthrylene oxide if the <b>oxygen</b> <b>bridge</b> is taken into account. Close examination, however, will show that there is present also a dibenzofuran nucleus which might be considered the basic structure. Di-benzofuran contains only two of the three 6 -carbon rings of phenanthrene or morphine but it does have the <b>oxygen</b> <b>bridge</b> of the morphine structure (fig. 1). A previously described parallel study (1) has shown that even simple derivatives of dlibenzofuran as well as of phenanthrene may exhibit definite analgesic action and this and other phenan-threne studies (2, 3) have suggested the desirability if not the necessity of the presence of an amino nitrogen for the production of an analgesic compound. However, whether or not an analgesic compound of morphine-like intensity must contain a phenan-threne or closely similar nucleus is still an open question and may remain so until many additional nuclei have been tried. By replacing the oxygen of clibenzofuran by an imino group we arrive at one of these, namely, carbazole, which in spite of its superficial resemblance has no relation to phenanthrene or phenanthrylene oxide.

The central reaction for these syntheses was the base mediated β-elimination of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>bridge</b> of the oxanorbomene adducts or their derivatives.
