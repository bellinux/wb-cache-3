25|$|Twins are {{considered}} an extremely ominous occurrence, one where spirits {{are considered}} to interfere with human matters. The Akha believed that only animals could give birth {{to more than one}} offspring and therefore considered twins as beasts. Up until about 20 years <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago,</b> they would have been killed immediately. According to Laos locals, the practice is still common although the government is trying to discourage it. Akha men whose wives had given birth to twins {{would not be allowed to}} participate on the hunt for a specific period.|$|E
25|$|Until {{a decade}} <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago,</b> PV was used {{frequently}} to power calculators and novelty devices. Improvements in integrated circuits and low power liquid crystal displays {{make it possible}} to power such devices for several years between battery changes, making PV use less common. In contrast, solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive. Such applications include solar lamps, water pumps, parking meters, emergency telephones, trash compactors, temporary traffic signs, charging stations, and remote guard posts and signals.|$|E

50|$|Not all {{mushroom}} {{stones are}} situated close to modern lakes.

A remarkable example is located near Crancreagh Bridge in County Offaly, which marks the position of what must have been the north-western edge of ancient Lough Boora, on whose shores the first people of the Irish midlands camped in Mesolithic times 8,500 <b>or</b> <b>so</b> years <b>ago.</b> This ancient lake disappeared long ago, swamped by the growing expanse of bog, which buried not only the lake itself, but preserved the campsites of the early midlanders.|$|R
50|$|The {{mutation}} {{rates in}} these genomes have been {{estimated to be}} between 0.46 × 10−4 and 8.21 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. The most recent common ancestor of both the Reston and Zaire species has been estimated to be ~1960. The most recent common ancestor of the Marburg and Sudan species appears to have evolved 700 and 850 years before present respectively. Although mutational clocks placed the divergence time of extant filoviruses at ~10,000 years before the present, dating of orthologous endogenous elements (paleoviruses) in the genomes of hamsters and voles indicated that the extant genera of filovirids had a common ancestor at least {{as old as the}} Miocene (~16-23 million <b>or</b> <b>so</b> years <b>ago).</b>|$|R

40|$|About the book]: Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} Ice Age, ten {{thousand}} <b>or</b> <b>so</b> years <b>ago,</b> over the period which we know as 'History', about one hundred billion people have died. Seventy million people died last year, six hundred thousand of them in the U. K. Death is on the one hand an ordinary, inevitable, everyday, predictable, mundane event. It has to be budgeted for, decisions made, and relations between the living reorganized. Half of the essays deal with this aspect of death. On the other hand, humans have always sought to transcend the mundaneness of death in burial rituals and memorials. The later essays trace the importance of the business of 'Remembrance' from early human beings, through the Icelandic Sagas to the twentieth century...|$|R

When the parishes were originally laid out, a thousand <b>or</b> <b>so</b> years <b>ago,</b> in order to give each enough resources to provide a living, they were made long and narrow. In this way each parish had its share of marsh for pasture and perhaps salt making, Townland for arable farming, and fen for fowling, thatch and turf. As the wetlands were reclaimed other settlements were made in the newly inhabitable places and these needed to be distinguished from the main village. In Whaplode parish these outlying places are Whaplode St Catherine (...) and Whaplode Drove (...) [...] The village used to have a railway station to the south of the village on the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway.|$|R
50|$|The {{increased}} {{population of}} human inhabitants {{and the expansion}} of grasslands (due to human activity) has caused a fragmentation of the species into many sub-populations. Many factors (mostly related to human activity) contributed to the fragmentation of the population, including the expansion of farmland, human occupation, lack of accessible habitat and the sparsity of suitable or favorable habitat. Due to this isolation, gene flow has begun to slow and sub-populations are suffering from a lack of gene diversity which could mean a long term issue. A study conducted by researchers found that gene flow accompanied the divergence of western lowland and Cross River gorillas until just 400 <b>or</b> <b>so</b> years <b>ago,</b> which rather supports a scenario in which intensifying human activities may have increased the isolation of these ape populations. The recent decrease in the Cross River population is accordingly most likely attributable to increasing anthropogenic pressure over the last several hundred years.|$|R
