40|$|Background: Leukemia {{inhibitory}} factor (LIF) is {{an indispensable}} factor for maintaining mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency. A feeder layer and serum are {{also needed to}} maintain an undifferentiated state, however, such <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>materials</b> need to be eliminated for clinical applications. Therefore, a more reliable ES cell culture technique is required. Methodology/Principal Findings: We cultured mouse ES cells in simulated microgravity using a 3 D-clinostat. We used feeder-free and serum-free media without LIF. Conclusions/Significance: Here we show that simulated microgravity allows novel LIF-free and <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> material-free culture methods for mouse ES cells...|$|R

40|$|Human induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} have the potential to become an unlimited cell source for cell replacement therapy. The realization of this potential, however, depends on the availability of culture methods that are robust, scalable, and use chemically defined materials. Despite significant advances in hiPSC technologies, the expansion of hiPSCs relies upon the use of animal-derived extracellular matrix extracts, such as Matrigel, which raises safety concerns over the use of these products. In this work, we investigated the feasibility of expanding and differentiating hiPSCs on a chemically defined, xeno-free synthetic peptide substrate, i. e. Corning Synthemax(®) Surface. We demonstrated that the Synthemax Surface supports the attachment, spreading, and proliferation of hiPSCs, as well as hiPSCs' lineage-specific differentiation. hiPSCs colonies grown on Synthemax Surfaces exhibit less spread and more compact morphology compared to cells grown on Matrigel™. The cytoskeleton characterization of hiPSCs grown on the Synthemax Surface revealed formation of denser actin filaments in the cell-cell interface. The down-regulation of vinculin and up-regulation of zyxin expression were also observed in hiPSCs grown on the Synthemax Surface. Further examination of cell-ECM interaction revealed that hiPSCs grown on the Synthemax Surface primarily utilize α(v) β(5) integrins to mediate attachment to the substrate, whereas multiple integrins are involved in cell attachment to Matrigel. Finally, hiPSCs can be maintained undifferentiated on the Synthemax Surface for more than ten passages. These studies provide a novel approach for expansion of hiPSCs using synthetic peptide engineered surface as a substrate to avoid a potential risk of contamination and lot-to-lot variability with <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
40|$|Intercultural studies {{about the}} methods of use and {{perceptions}} of traditional remedies in Europe are strategically important in understanding how pharmaceutical means in our multicultural modern societies are differently accepted by diverse ethnic groups. In this survey, we analysed the biological means traditionally used in the ethnomedicine of three Arbï¿½reshï¿½ (ethnic Albanians) communities in the Vulture area (northern Lucania, southern Italy). The majority of remedies are represented by plants belonging to 54 botanical taxa. A few of the recorded species have a traditional therapeutic use that has never previously been reported in southern Italy. Other means—especially used in the past—are comprised of mineral, <b>animal</b> and industrial <b>derived</b> <b>materials.</b> In specific cases, some of these materials and even plants are neither applied externally or internally, but are instead utilised as symbolic ritual objects in spiritual healing ceremonies. Ethnopharmacological and anthropological considerations about these usages are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} in volume 14, issue 15 of Current Biology (pp. 1374 – 1379), we {{reported}} experiments on <b>animals</b> <b>derived</b> from the strain RB 629 {{and carrying a}} deletion in latrophilin, lat- 1 (ok 379). Our studies showed that <b>animals</b> <b>derived</b> from this strain were emodepside resistant, and we concluded that {{this was due to}} a putative loss of function in lat- 1 signaling. After publication of this work, David Bell reported to us his unpublished observations on RB 629. He could not balance lat- 1 (ok 379), nor could he identify animals homozygous for the deletion. We performed further analysis of RB 629 and confirmed that <b>animals</b> <b>derived</b> from this strain are emodepside resistant. However, we have also subsequently found that <b>animals</b> <b>derived</b> from the RB 629 strain can lose the ok 379 deletion but remain emodepside resistant. Therefore, the resistance in this strain does not correlate with the lat- 1 deletion, and our conclusions in this regard are invalid. The other substantial findings of the paper, the observation of emodepside resistance in animals treated with RNAi for lat- 1 and in mutants for other synaptic proteins, are not affected by this revision...|$|R

50|$|Dead {{plants or}} <b>animals,</b> <b>material</b> <b>derived</b> from <b>animal</b> tissues (such as skin cast off during {{moulting}} etc) gradually lose their form, due to both physical processes {{and the action}} of decomposers, including grazers, bacteria and fungi. Decomposition, the process through which organic matter is decomposed, takes place in many stages. Materials like proteins, lipids and sugars with low molecular weight are rapidly consumed and absorbed by microorganisms and organisms that feed on dead matter. Other compounds, such as complex carbohydrates are broken down more slowly. The various microorganisms involved in the decomposition break down the organic materials {{in order to gain}} the resources they require for their own survival and proliferation. Accordingly, {{at the same time that}} the materials of plants and animals are being broken down, the materials (biomass) making up the bodies of the microorganisms are built up by a process of assimilation. When microorganisms die, fine organic particles are produced, and if these are eaten by small animals which feed on microorganisms, they will collect inside the intestine, and change shape into large pellets of dung. As a result of this process, most of the materials from dead organisms disappears from view and is not obviously present in any recognisable form, but is in fact present in the form of a combination of fine organic particles and the organisms using them as nutrients. This combination is detritus.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{neutralization}} tests with PVM and serum obtained from numerous animal species indicate that antibodies agaiust this virus {{were present in}} the blood of all mammalian species tested, as not in that of fowls, and that their incidence in various species was widely different. They indicate, also, that in certain species, particularly the cotton rat, there were marked seasonal variations in the incidence of such antibodies; in the late winter and spring the incidence was much higher than during the summer and fall seasons. Cotton rats and hamsters which did not possess neutralizing antibodies against PVM were susceptible to manifest pulmonary infection with this virus, irrespective of the effects of previous experiments upon them, whereas those which possessed such antibodies were immune. It is suggested that circulating antibodies against PVM were present as a result of preceding infection with a latent virus; either PVM or an agent closely related to it in antigenic composition. Appropriate non-specific stimuli, e. g. the intranasal injection of suspensions of normal chick embryos, induced the development of neutralizing antibodies against PVM with significantly greater frequency in each of three species than occurred in control <b>animals.</b> <b>Materials</b> <b>derived</b> from patients with primary atypical pneumonia yielded results almost identical to those obtained with normal chick embryo suspensions. It is suggested that such materials, like the other non-specific stimuli employed, were effective in evoking a specific antibody response, because they unbalanced an equilibrium which previously existed between animal host and latent pneumotropic virus...|$|R

However, efforts are still needed to optimize production parameters {{in order to maximize}} volumetric productivity while maintaining product quality. Generally, in cell culture 5 % to 15 % serum is used as supplement in the standard basal media in addition to salts and amino acids for healthy cell growth. To overcome the serum related problems, serum <b>derived</b> and <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> substances are being used. The serum, serum <b>derived</b> or <b>animal</b> <b>derived</b> substances have some advantages and disadvantages which we have summarized in this review.
