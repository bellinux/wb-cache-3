During the last decade <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> has become an integral part of modern businesses since it is capable of detecting errors or offences which lead to fraud.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse company-specific factors {{associated}} with adoption of risk-based auditing. It seeks to explore the role of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in enterprise risk management (ERM). Design/methodology/approach – Findings are drawn from a questionnaire survey, sent in 2006, to all 96 chief internal auditors who were members of the Institute of Portuguese Internal Auditors. Findings – In planning an annual schedule of audits, the adoption of a risk-based approach is statistically significant in international firms (p= 0. 05) and companies listed on the Portuguese stock market (p= 0. 10). There is a strong (but not significant) association between risk-based annual audit planning and entities which are private, in the finance sector, and large. In planning each audit engagement, adoption of a risk-based approach is correlated positively with entity size. <b>Internal</b> <b>auditing</b> is more proactive in the implementation of ERM in smaller organisations, and is more important in the finance industry and the private sector. Practical implications – A better understanding emerges of factors associated with the adoption of risk-based auditing, together with an enhanced appreciation of the role of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in ERM. Originality/value – The paper reveals the specific characteristics of companies that are associated with the adoption of risk-based approaches in the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>process.</b> It is the first paper published about risk-based <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in Portugal. <b>Internal</b> <b>auditing,</b> Portugal, Risk management...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This study {{investigated}} why <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> mechanisms fail {{to detect and}} prevent common risks especially fraud and corruption risks in Thai local governments. The crucial causes of ineffectiveness of those systems were ascertained through 415 questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with 36 Thai local government internal auditors. Statistical techniques were used for analysing the questionnaires while content analysis and a phenomenological research approach based on Bandura’s theory of moral disengagement were used for analysing the interview transcripts. The results revealed that corruption methods used in Thai local governments generated factors which, in turn, generated ineffectiveness in <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> mechanisms in detecting and deterring risks. The corruption methods contributed {{to a lack of}} independence of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> systems; a lack of officials’ cooperation with <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> teams; a lack of efficiency of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> processes; a lack of support from administrators; a lack of interest of officials to internal control system; and a lack of promotion prospects. A lack of competency of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> teams also contributed to the inefficiency of the <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> systems. The Office of the Auditor General of Thailand (OAG) is implicit in the ineffectiveness because of its failure to use audit reports of local government to assess risks within local governments. Other related factors are concerned with the auditors’ personal behaviours designed to ensure their wellbeing and survival needs. The failure of Thai federal authorities to enforce their laws and regulations and to detect and deter corruption in their own ranks must be addressed before local government <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>processes</b> can be effective...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{perception}} of compliance personnel over audit technology tools implementation in Nigeria. The study provides an empirical analysis of input supplied by a sample of 173 professional auditors across 67 companies from 5 major sectors of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Subjects were tested of their perception on the application of audit technology tools in automated controls monitoring of financial transactions processing and assurance reporting. Although audit technology tools have been accessible for over a decade, the outcome of the study suggested that <b>internal</b> auditors and <b>audit</b> departments in Nigerian companies are not making substantial use of available tools. Internal auditors mostly have adopted audit software on an ad hoc basis with some repetitive use. In addition, most <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> departments and units do not have formal strategies and plans for integrating technology in their <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>processes</b> with the exclusion of the financial services sector. The study also discovered that the most significant factors inhibiting the use of technology tools in other sectors were audit software inaccessibility and training costs alongside lack of senior management support from additional comments obtained from survey instrument.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a survey of the chief audit executives in Australia, the study identifies the reporting mechanisms, functions and relationships of <b>internal</b> <b>audit,</b> including the contributions made towards good corporate governance. There is, however, some misalignment between the aspirations of internal auditors and their relationships with management.

The results also suggest that internal auditors have been providing an internal consulting and advisory role in matters concerning IT systems, strategic risks and financial issues. If internal auditors are to proactively contribute to good corporate governance, they need to define how, and in what way, this can be done. In regard to corporate governance processes, the results of the research indicate that issues surrounding internal control, risk assessment and management processes are regarded as the key factors for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> to contribute to good corporate governance.
