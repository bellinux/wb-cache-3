5|$|In ancient Hawaii, {{fishermen}} occasionally hunted dolphins {{for their}} meat by driving them <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and killing them. In their ancient legal system, dolphin meat {{was considered to}} be kapu (forbidden) for women together with several other kinds of food. Today, dolphin drive hunting no longer takes place in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} the whale was found dead, {{floating}} out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale {{and had it}} transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E

5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} {{side of the}} pier, causing four shops {{and part of the}} deck to collapse <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage to the pier was estimated to be £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines to haul them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert hall}} {{had its own}} {{in-house}} orchestra by November, and ticket sales for concerts accounted for 43% of the pier's revenue by 1920. The West Pier was favoured by locals, while the Palace Pier was used more by day trippers. A top-deck entrance {{was added to the}} hall in 1932. The pier's central decking was removed during World War II to prevent enemy landings, and its popularity began to decline. On 26 November 1944 a Royal Air Force Hawker Typhoon fighter hit the pier, crashing <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> The pilot sustained head injuries. The Typhoon was one of four aircraft escorting a VIP flight.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{infiltration}} of sediment through {{and along the}} peripheral breakwalls, the harbor requires regular dredging to maintain navigable channels. The dredging occurs approximately every 3 to 5 years, with excavated sediment deposited <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> surrounding <b>the</b> breakwalls.|$|R

5|$|Barkas and Ayrton {{went out}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> dunes {{to sit and}} think. Barkas {{recalled}} the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By {{the end of that}} afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
5|$|Because sea {{conditions}} were so rough, {{the decision was}} made for the 116th RCT to carry the DD tanks of the 743rd tank battalion {{all the way to the}} beach, after 27 of the initial 29 DD tanks of the 741st tank battalion swamped while wading to shore. Coming in opposite the heavily defended Vierville draw, Company B of the 743rd Tank Battalion lost all but one of its officers and half of its DD tanks. The other two companies landed to the left of B/743 without initial loss. On the 16th RCT front, the two DD tanks from the 741st tank battalion that had survived the swim ashore were joined by three others that were landed directly <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> because of their LCT's damaged ramp. The remaining tank company managed to land 14 of its 16 tanks (although three of these were quickly knocked out).|$|E

50|$|Humans can inhale aerosolized brevetoxins. Brevetoxins become aerosolized by bubble-mediated {{transport}} of extracellular toxins. Through this process, bubbles transport the toxins to the water's surface, as the bubbles rupture they release the toxins into the air. The wind can then sweep these toxins toward shore, <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> and into <b>the</b> communities {{where they can}} be inhaled by humans.|$|R
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E
5|$|In November 1651, Cromwell's troops {{called on}} Ogilvie to surrender, but he refused. During the {{subsequent}} blockade of the castle, {{the removal of}} the Honours of Scotland was planned by Elizabeth Douglas, wife of Sir George Ogilvie, and Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of Kinneff Parish Church. The king's papers were first removed from the castle by Anne Lindsay, a kinswoman of Elizabeth Douglas, who walked through the besieging force with the papers sewn into her clothes. Two stories exist regarding {{the removal of the}} honours themselves. Fletcher stated in 1664 that over the course of three visits to the castle in February and March 1652, she carried away the crown, sceptre, sword and sword-case hidden amongst sacks of goods. Another account, given in the 18th century by a tutor to the Earl Marischal, records that the honours were lowered from the castle <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> where they were collected by Fletcher's servant and carried off in a creel (basket) of seaweed. Having smuggled the honours from the castle, Fletcher and her husband buried them under the floor of the Old Kirk at Kinneff.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E

5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E
5|$|The 116th RCT of the 29th Infantry Division was to land two battalions in {{the western}} four beaches, to be {{followed}} 30 minutes later by the third battalion. Their landings were to be supported by the tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion; two companies swimming ashore in amphibious DD tanks and the remaining company landing directly <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> from assault craft. To {{the left of the}} 116th RCT the 16th RCT of the 1st Infantry Division was also to land two battalions with the third following 30 minutes after, on Easy Red and Fox Green at the eastern end of Omaha. Their tank support was to be provided by the 741st Tank Battalion, again two companies swimming ashore and the third landed conventionally. Three companies of the 2nd Ranger Battalion were to take a fortified battery at Pointe du Hoc, five kilometers (3mi) to the west of Omaha. Meanwhile, C Company 2nd Rangers was to land on the right of the 116th RCT and take the positions at Pointe de la Percée. The remaining companies of 2nd Rangers and the 5th Ranger Battalion were to follow up at Pointe du Hoc if that action proved to be successful, otherwise they were to follow the 116th into Dog Green and proceed to Pointe du Hoc overland.|$|E
5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E
