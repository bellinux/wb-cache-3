25|$|All {{versions}} {{incorporate a}} top-loading slot for game cartridges, although {{the shape of}} the slot differs between regions to match the different shapes of the cartridges. The MULTI <b>OUT</b> <b>connector</b> (later used on the Nintendo 64 and GameCube) can output composite video, S-Video and RGB signals, as well as RF with an external RF modulator. Original versions additionally include a 28-pin expansion port under a small cover {{on the bottom of the}} unit and a standard RF output with channel selection switch on the back; the redesigned models output composite video only, requiring an external modulator for RF.|$|E
5000|$|A DMX512 {{network is}} called a [...] "DMX universe". Each <b>OUT</b> <b>connector</b> on a DMX512 {{controller}} can control a single universe. Smaller controllers may have a single <b>OUT</b> <b>connector,</b> enabling them to control only one universe, whereas large control desks (operator consoles) may {{have the capacity to}} control multiple universes, with an <b>OUT</b> <b>connector</b> provided for each universe.|$|E

50|$|EAD cables are duplex {{connections}} replacing two thin-wire cables, the T-connector {{is integrated}} into the BNC end. The contacts of an EAD outlet are closed if no connector is plugged in. When a cable is plugged in, the normally closed contacts in the socket are opened so that signals pass through the loop cable. Worn <b>out</b> <b>connectors</b> or outlets can cause the same problems that haunted the simpler connectors but user errors are largely reduced.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{slave device}} has a DMX512 [...] "IN" [...] {{connector}} and usually an [...] "OUT" [...] (or [...] "THRU") connector as well. The controller, which has only an <b>OUT</b> <b>connector,</b> is connected via a DMX512 cable to the IN connector {{of the first}} slave. A second cable then links the OUT or THRU connector of the first slave to the IN connector of the next slave in the chain, and so on. For example, the block diagram below shows a simple network consisting of a controller and three slaves.|$|E

50|$|It {{supports}} MIDI, {{having a}} MIDI <b>Out</b> <b>connector</b> {{which allows the}} keyboard to control external MIDI equipment. It {{does not have a}} MIDI In connector. Although originally made for the consumer market, this keytar's MIDI out features are very powerful. Its drum rhythms and accompaniment are transmitted on separate MIDI channels, so that an external drum machine, sampler, or other MIDI equipment can be programmed to play the backing parts. Drums are transmitted on channel 16; Bass on 15; and three chord harmonies on channels 12-14. MIDI start/stop and tempo sync are also transmitted so an external sequencer may be utilized as well.|$|E

50|$|Ways {{to achieve}} higher speeds than 1,200 bits/s, include using {{telephone}} modem chips via {{the microphone and}} audio <b>out</b> <b>connectors.</b> This has been proven to work at speeds up to 4,800 bit/s using fax V.27 modems in half-duplex mode. These modems use phase shift keying which works fine {{when there is no}} amplitude shift keying, but at faster speeds such as 9,600 bit/s, signal levels become critical and they are extremely sensitive to group delay in the radio. These systems were pioneered by Simon Taylor (G1NTX) and Jerry Sandys (G8DXZ) in the 1980s. Other systems which involved small modification of the radio were developed by James Miller (G3RUH) and operated at 9,600 bit/s.|$|R
5000|$|Every MIDI {{connection}} is a one-way connection from the MIDI <b>Out</b> <b>connector</b> of the sending device to the MIDI In connector of the receiving device. Each such connection {{can carry a}} stream of MIDI messages, with most messages representing a common musical performance event or gesture such as note-on, note-off, controller value change (including volume, pedal, modulation signals, etc.), pitch bend, program change, aftertouch, channel pressure. All of those messages include channel number. There are 16 possible channels in the protocol. The channels are used to separate [...] "voices" [...] or [...] "instruments", somewhat like tracks in a multi-track mixer.|$|E
50|$|The 8800 series, codenamed G80, was {{launched}} on 8 November 2006 {{with the release}} of the GeForce 8800 GTX and GTS for the high-end market. A 320 MB GTS was released on 12 February and the Ultra was released on 2 May 2007. The cards are larger than their predecessors, with the 8800 GTX measuring 10.6 in (~26.9 cm) in length and the 8800 GTS measuring 9 in (~23 cm). Both cards have two dual-link DVI connectors and a HDTV/S-Video <b>out</b> <b>connector.</b> The 8800 GTX requires 2 PCIe power inputs to keep within the PCIe standard, while the GTS requires just one.|$|E
50|$|Such non-musical {{applications}} of the MIDI 1.0 protocol (sometimes over MIDI-DIN, sometimes using other transports) are possible because of its general-purpose nature. Any device built with a standard MIDI <b>Out</b> <b>connector</b> should in theory {{be able to control}} any other device with a MIDI In port, just as long as the developers of both devices have the same understanding about the semantic meaning of all the MIDI messages the sending device emits. This agreement can come either because both follow the official MIDI standard specifications, or else in the case of any non-standard functionality, because the message meanings are directly agreed upon by the two manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|MPU-APL: for the Apple II series. Single-card {{combination}} of the MIF-APL interface and MPU-401, featuring MIDI IN, <b>OUT,</b> and SYNC <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{back panel}} has quarter-inch jacks for {{recording}} data to cassette tape (one also doubling as a footswitch input), MIDI in and <b>out</b> DIN <b>connectors,</b> separate quarter-inch audio outputs {{for each of}} the two sounds and a mix audio out (both sounds combined), a power switch, and a fuse socket.|$|R
50|$|The VT1000 and VT1200 was {{packaged}} in a pizza box {{case with the}} monitor normally sitting on top and an LK400 series keyboard connected to it using a coiled cord and 4-pin modular connector. The three-button mouse was roughly puck-shaped, not unlike the original iMac mouse, and used a custom 7-pin round connector. The back panel included a coax connector for the monitor, mouse and keyboard ports, a Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) serial port for a printer, another MMJ serial port for host connections, and a thinwire Ethernet connector. It also included AC in and <b>out</b> <b>connectors,</b> the latter used to connect the monitor, allowing it to be turned on and off with the terminal using a single switch located {{on the side of}} the case beside the power connectors. The system supported a number of monochrome monitors, selected using a rotary switch beside the monitor port.|$|R

5000|$|Within {{continental}} Europe {{there were}} three choices by 1980, {{with the arrival of}} the Video 2000 format from Philips and Grundig, which replaced Philips' outdated [...] "VCR" [...] format. Although it featured many capabilities formerly only available on expensive broadcast video recorders, V2000 had too long a development cycle and arrived late to the market. Apart from this, to keep costs down many of its unique features, such as Dynamic Track Following, were only implemented on the most expensive models, meaning mainstream models suffered from indifferent video quality. Also, many features that came standard on VHS and Betamax machines (such as direct AV in and <b>out</b> <b>connectors),</b> were only available as expensive [...] "optional extras" [...] on V2000. The machines were also found to be less reliable than their VHS and Beta counterparts and for all these reasons the format never gained substantial market share. V2000 was cancelled in 1985, the first casualty of the format war.|$|R
50|$|They may be keyed {{to prevent}} {{insertion}} in the wrong orientation, connecting the wrong pins to each other, and have locking mechanisms {{to ensure that they}} are fully inserted and cannot work loose or fall <b>out.</b> Some <b>connectors</b> are designed such that certain pins make contact before others when inserted, and break first on disconnection; this protects circuits typically in connectors that apply power, e.g. connecting safety ground first, and sequencing connections properly in hot swapping applications.|$|R
5000|$|Personal {{computer}} sound cards. A DA15 connector on {{the outside}} of the board is often broken <b>out</b> into DIN <b>connectors</b> for MIDI. Some professional audio applications use rackmount breakout boxes. A patch panel can also function as a breakout box, in the case of multi-channel DB25 (or other) connectors used for multi-track recording.|$|R
50|$|Some {{computers}} {{or their}} sound cards have 15-pin D-subminiature connectors, called game ports, {{that can be}} used for MIDI IN/MIDI <b>OUT.</b> The <b>connector</b> supports both MIDI and analog joystick functions. Access to the MIDI signals is provided by a short adapter cable that converts the D-subminiature pinout into DIN connectors. The recommended method of connecting two 5-pin DIN cables to a 15-pin D-subminiature computer port can be found at the MIDI.org web site. The MIDI specification very conservatively states that the maximum distance MIDI can be transmitted is 15 meters (50 feet), but it can normally go much farther.|$|R
5000|$|Audigy card {{supports}} the professional ASIO 1 driver interface natively, {{making it possible}} to obtain low latencies from Virtual Studio Technology (VST) instruments. Some versions of Audigy featured an external break <b>out</b> box with <b>connectors</b> for S/PDIF, MIDI, IEEE 1394, analog and optical signals. The ASIO and break out box features were an attempt to tap into the [...] "home studio" [...] market, with a mainstream product.|$|R
50|$|Strain {{relief is}} often {{required}} for terminated electrical lines that are plugged into sockets or ports to prevent unplugging or accidentally ripping <b>out</b> of the <b>connector.</b> At {{which point the}} lines have to be strain relieved depends on the application. For PROFINET, for example, which is used in automation it is recommended to set the strain relief component approx. 1 m / 3.5 ft from the connection point.|$|R

50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} to both is {{that when}} a modem card is installed in the Communication Slot, the modem serial port {{on the back of}} the computer is disabled. Computers that came with this card installed had the modem port blanked <b>out</b> (though the <b>connector</b> was still present). Further, due to its unconventional architecture, the Performa 5200's printer port would be disabled if a network adapter was installed in the Communication Slot.|$|R
