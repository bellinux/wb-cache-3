5000|$|Camden High School is a New South Wales {{government}} coeducational {{secondary school}} {{in the town of}} Camden. Established in 1956, the school motto is [...] "Together We Achieve".It lays an emphasis on traditional subjects, while offering several vocational education courses. It has strong ties with the local community and emphasises involvement, caring and responsibility. It has a particularly strong co-curriculum that features the creative and performing arts, adventure programs and sports. Its mission statement emphasises its purpose to enable students to reach their full potential through encouraging achievement, positive values and the desire to learn. [...] Camden High School has one of the longest running sporting exchanges in Australia. Many thousands of young people have benefited from this wonderful sporting event, and lifelong friendships have been forged between city and country. In the early 1970s Mr Paul Montgomery, an English teacher at Camden High School had the idea that a sporting competition with another school over a three-day period would be a wonderful way of forging valuable links between students from different backgrounds. With the Principal, Mr Phillip Patterson, it was decided that the school should be a rural school of comparable size and approximately a four-hour distance from Camden. This would make the travelling time manageable while still providing enough distance to make the enterprise adventurous for the students.Letters were sent to a number of schools and Cowra was eventually chosen as the perfect school with which to establish the competition. In 1972, the first exchange occurred with Cowra students travelling to Camden for the inaugural games. It was decided at this stage to name the competition in honour of the late Robert Montgomery who had been the Deputy Principal at Camden High from 1969-1970. Many years later, the games continue to provide many students with wonderful sporting, cultural and social experiences. This {{is the result of the}} continued commitment of all staff at both schools and particularly the team coaches and the chief organisers. In recent years, Mrs Anna-Lisa Reeves from Camden High and Mr Steve Johnstone from Cowra High have spent a great deal of time and effort ensuring these games continue to flourish. Camden High School also has an <b>outstanding</b> <b>Trade</b> Training Centre which it shares with students from Elderslie High School and Elizabeth Macarthur High School.|$|E

40|$|While {{many studies}} explain the {{correlation}} between firm-level productivity and export status entirely by better firms self-selecting into exporting, a few studies find evidence of reverse causation. Especially in developing or ransition economies, exporters seem to improve performance after they start selling internationally. We provide evidence that the realization of scale conomies is {{one possible explanation for}} such a learning-by-exporting effect. Exporting enables small firms to expand output and exploit all scale economies that the production technology allows. With access to finance problems and weak contract enforcement at home, domestic expansion of SMEs is constrained by the necessity of awarding trade credit to new clients. We show that small firms with a lot of <b>outstanding</b> <b>trade</b> credit expand sales the most following export market entry. This is especially true if they operate in industries with higher scale economies or if they are located in provinces with weaker institutions. The same type of firms also enjoy the largest productivity gains immediately following export market entry. ...|$|E

40|$|Chile is {{strongly}} interconnected {{to the global}} markets through its trade relations. From a monetary perspective the country has shown an <b>outstanding</b> <b>trade</b> performance, having an equilibrated trade balance, avoiding debts and even presenting periods with high surplus. Nonetheless, the products Chile trade have embodied great social and ecological impacts. Thus, from a social and ecological perspective, Chile’s positive trade performance is being challenged. Ecological Unequal Exchange (EUE) is a theory that precisely analyses these dimensions in trade. However, EUE has several limitations that must be discussed and overpassed. This thesis, through a deep theoretical discussion and a detailed empirical study on Chile’s trade relations between 1960 and 2014, builds a critical analysis to EUE theory and its accuracy in explaining the issues related to trade and its consequences for the trading countries. This study concludes that depending on the EUE approach used, Chile can have or not have EUE relations. Furthermore, this thesis shows that strict-approaches to EUE fall short in explaining the complex interactions and consequences of trade. Therefore, a critical or relative-EUE approach is proposed, emphasising the impacts global relations has on local realities to understand the consequences of trade and achieve a more sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} distressed {{manufacturing}} firms increased sharply during recessionary phase 2009 - 13. Financial indebtness traditionally {{plays a key}} role in assessing firm solvency but contagion effects that originate from the supply chain are usually neglected in literature. Firm interconnections, captured via the trade credit channel, represent a primary vehicle of individual shocks’ propagation, especially during an economic downturn, when liquidity tensions arise. A representative sample of 11, 920 Italian manufacturing firms is considered to model a two-step econometric design, where chain reactions in terms of trade credit accumulation (i. e. default of payments to suppliers) are primarily analyzed by resorting to a spatial autoregressive approach (SAR). Spatial interactions are modeled based on a unique dataset of firm-to-firm transactions registered before the outbreak of the crisis. The second step in instead a binary outcome model where trade credit chains are considered together with data on the bank-firm relationship to assess determinants of distress likelihoods in 2009 - 13. Results show that <b>outstanding</b> <b>trade</b> debt is affected by the liquidity position of a firm and by positive spatial effects. Trade credit chain reactions are found to exert, in turn, a positive impact on distress likelihoods during the crisis. The latter effect is comparable in magnitude to the one exerted by individual financial rigidity, and stresses the importance to include complex interactions between firms in the analysis of the solvency behavior...|$|E
40|$|Before Islam, the African Sahara, had {{witnessed}} {{the spread of}} significant types of desert architectural constructions, namely residential fortified settlements known as "Qusur". The spread of Islam in Maghreb countries had {{a positive effect on}} the commercial activity between the north and south of the African Sahara. Consequently, these residential settlements or "Qusur" have turned into active trade centers that extended along this Sahara. Al-Qusur Al-Sahrawiyah have received particular attention on the part of many researchers in the field of the history of architecture. This attention was developed within the framework of descriptive analytical and comparative studies of the layout and planning of this type of constructions that sought to highlight the similarities and differences among them. However, it is noticed that these studies covered {{only a small number of}} those constructions compared to their great number as they spread throughout the Algerian Desert and other regions of the African Sahara. Therefore, the present paper reviews the features of the urban planning of Qasr Ouargla in the South-East of the Middle Maghreb Desert as one of the most important desert urban settlements. These settlements played significant roles in the history of this region and Algeria in general all over the stages of its Islamic history up till now. This Qasr has incorporated all the essential elements of urbanization, as it had all means of fortification such as trenches, walls, towers and gates. Furthermore, the Qasr had a government headquarter, military garrison fortress represented by the "Qasaba" and a mint. It was also an <b>outstanding</b> <b>trade</b> and economic center among Al-Qusur Al-Sahrawiyah in Algeria. This study is particularly significant as this Qasr still maintains a great deal of its architectural constructions and it is still populated while many other Al-Qusur Al-Sahrawiyah have been deserted and become extinct...|$|E
