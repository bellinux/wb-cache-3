25|$|With {{air traffic}} {{congestion}} reaching an unacceptable threshold in Mumbai, the AAI put its age-old plan of reviving the Juhu airport <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> to ease some pressure off of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) in 2010. The AAI appointed consulting major KPMG {{to draw up a}} development plan for Juhu airport. It was envisioned that the Juhu airstrip could take up to 18% load off CSI Airport with turboprop ATR and Boeing 737 aircraft. The plan was to extend the runway to 2000 meters in phases, this would have ultimately seen the airstrip jutting into the sea and utilizing reclaimed parts of the Juhu beach and seafront. Permission for the expansion was denied by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2010. Instead, the ministry asked for conservation of the land around the airstrip, stating that no development should take place there and that it should be conserved as a green space to compensate for the pollution caused by the airstrip.|$|E

This is a design decision when widening a double track section, and allows higher speed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Gene Autry, former movie cowboy, singer, {{actor and}} owner of Golden West Broadcasters (including Los Angeles' KMPC radio and KTLA television), {{attended}} the Major League Owners' meeting in St. Louis in 1960 in hopes of winning broadcasting rights for the new team's games. Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg was initially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> to be the team's first owner, with Bill Veeck as a partner. However, when O'Malley got word of Veeck's involvement, he invoked his exclusive right to operate a major league team in Southern California. In truth, O'Malley wasn't about to compete with Veeck, who {{was known as a}} master promoter. After it became obvious that O'Malley would never sign off on the deal as long as Veeck was a part-owner, Greenberg was forced to bow out. After another bid by Chicago insurance executive and future A's owner Charlie Finley failed, Autry was persuaded to make a bid himself. Autry (who had been a minority stockholder in the Angels' PCL rival, the Hollywood Stars) agreed, and purchased the franchise.|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2008, it was {{announced}} that The CW was developing a contemporary spin-off of Beverly Hills, 90210, which first aired on Fox from October 1990 to May 2000.

The Beverly Hills, 90210 creator, Darren Star, {{was announced}} not to be involved with the project, as well as producer Aaron Spelling, who died in 2006. The only surviving element from the original series was the Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency which masterminded the spin-off idea.

500|$|The science-fiction horror genre reemerged in {{the late}} 1990s. [...] In 1995, Warner Bros. began {{developing}} the film project, having owned the rights to Richard Matheson's 1954 novel I Am Legend since 1970 and having already made the 1971 adaptation The Omega Man. Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell. Protosevich's first draft took place in 2000 in San Francisco, and contained many similarities with the finished film, though the Darkseekers (called 'Hemocytes') were civilized {{to the point of}} the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict, as well as the fact that a Hemocyte character named Christopher joined forces with Neville. Warner Bros. immediately put the film <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track,</b> attaching Neal H. Moritz as producer.|$|E

2500|$|In 1966, Dodge {{took the}} Charger into NASCAR {{in hopes that}} the {{fastback}} would make their car a winner <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high-banks. However the car proved difficult to handle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>tracks</b> because its body generated lift. Drivers would later claim that [...] "it was like driving on ice." [...] To solve this problem Dodge installed a small lip spoiler <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trunk lid that improved traction at speeds above [...] This was made a dealer-installed option in late-1966 and in 1967 because of NASCAR rules, making the '66 Charger the first U.S. production vehicle to offer a spoiler.

2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{the lack of}} female heroes in video games, particularly in video games published by Activision, Gamasutra news director Leigh Alexander cited GLaDOS while arguing that the [...] "females do not sell" [...] notion is possibly false logic, stating that she was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> <b>track</b> to becoming one of gaming's most beloved characters. Gamasutra writers Leigh Alexander, Brandon Boyer, Simon Carless, and Christian Nutt listed GLaDOS as being the second-most affecting video game character, being the highest-ranked actual character because the most affecting video game character was the player. They attribute {{the overall quality of}} Portal to GLaDOS, stating that without her, Portal would not be nearly as quotable. They added that the relationship between GLaDOS and the player-character has been described as passive-aggressive, maternal, and a [...] "feminist manifesto".|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{heaviest}} casualty, however, was the city. Detroit's losses went {{a hell of}} a lot {{deeper than}} the immediate toll of lives and buildings.

The money was carried out in the pockets of the businesses and the white people who fled as fast as they could. The white exodus from Detroit had been prodigiously steady prior to the riot, totally twenty-two thousand in 1966, but afterwards it was frantic. In 1967, with less than half the year remaining after the summer explosionthe outward population migration reached sixty-seven thousand. In 1968 the figure hit eighty-thousand, followed by forty-six thousand in 1969.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{winning the}} 1000km Nürburgring, the 908 was {{anything}} but convincing in 1968. The older and smaller 2200 cc 907 had started the season with dominating wins and later delivered better results than Porsche's first serious attempt in the prototype category. Meanwhile, the older 4.7-litre Ford GT40s Group 5 Sports Cars were winning races <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>tracks,</b> with <b>the</b> Ford P68 being a failure, Ferrari remaining absent, and the Alfa Romeo 33 still utilizing a 2000cc enigine. With the minimum production requirement for the 5000cc Group 5 Sports Car category reduced from 50 units to 25 for 1969, Porsche decided to go one step further and build the required 25 examples of a new 12-cylinder car, the Porsche 917. This risky investment should take about a year, though, and the 908 was supposed to deliver results in the meantime.|$|R

50|$|Entirely {{redesigned}} for 1988, the NSR500 got a stiffer, twin-spar aluminium chassis {{and various}} engine changes. The changes {{made to the}} 1988 bike made it somewhat problematic for the riders, especially {{in the first half}} of the season. Wayne Gardner had a hard time in defence of his 1987 World Championship and although he eventually got <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> bikes problems and won three races in a row in mid-season (Dutch TT, Belgium and Yugoslavia), he could only finish second in the championship behind the Yamaha of Eddie Lawson. The main complaints about the 1988 NSR500 was that the engine, while undoubtedly the most powerful in 500cc racing, was very 'peaky' and had to run up high in the rev range to get the best out of it. Also the suspension geometry of the bike wasn't as good as in 1987 and the bike was noticeably harder to handle through the turns than the rival Yamaha YZR500 and Suzuki's new RGV500. While the engines power advantage was seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>faster</b> <b>tracks</b> such as Suzuka (which is actually owned by Honda), Assen, Spa and Paul Ricard, on tighter tracks such as Jarama and Jerez it was off the pace due to its handling.|$|R
