The cook said it would make her work simpler if she could keep a table entirely to herself. She said it quite confused her, having so many dead cats lying round among her joints and vegetables: {{she was afraid of}} making a mistake. Accordingly, the old table was placed under the window, and devoted to the cats; and, after that, she would never allow anyone to bring a cat, however dead, to her table.|$|E

Introduction: Many of us {{do not know how}} much <b>our</b> <b>kitchens</b> ought to mean to us and the {{consequence}} is they are often neglected. Our grandmothers loved and honored their kitchens and why should not we? Perhaps one reason for this was that in their day the house work was about the only occupation for women, but {{in this day and age}} woman is constantly taking up different occupations in life and thus comes the neglect {{of the kitchen}}. It may be said that there is a difference between <b>our</b> country <b>kitchens</b> and <b>our</b> city <b>kitchens,</b> both may be clean and neat but one is more inclined to think of the country kitchen as being more home like, perhaps too the one contains more good wholesome fruits and vegetables than the other, which is more likely to contain a larger proportion of sweets. Every one or nearly every one loves the old fireplaces much more than the ranges of today. The country kitchen contains nothing so elaborate as the city kitchen is liable to contain, and taking into consideration every thing, perhaps in the long run the country kitchen is more beautiful to the tired eye than the other, and one feels rested on entering it...|$|R

25|$|According to {{official}} directives concerning nourishment issued {{at the beginning}} of 1916, each week the prisoner was to have 600-1,000g of potatoes, 200-300g of vegetables at lunch, meat three times, fish twice and 150g of legumes. The reality could be far from what these menus prescribed. Not only was the food insufficient, it was often quite detrimental to health: “The other day I saw, in <b>our</b> <b>kitchens,</b> quarters of refrigerated beef of which the smell and greenish tint were so pronounced that our cooks refused to prepare them. The German head doctor, called to arbitrate, ordered them soaked in a solution of permanganate and, the day after the morrow, this meat, thus disinfected, decorated the ordinary one”.|$|R
