5|$|Standardized system: Boots and {{bindings}} have {{an integrated}} connection, typically a bar {{across the front}} end of the sole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot,</b> and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the most common type of binding.|$|E
5|$|General Dwight D. Eisenhower, now the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, {{visited the}} beachhead on 17 September, observing {{that the battle}} had been won. The {{following}} day the Germans had {{pulled out of the}} area, and the Forty-fifth was able to advance to Venafro before meeting any resistance. The division was at the far right of the Fifth Army, working up the center of the Italian boot, adjacent to Montgomery's British Eighth Army which was responsible for the eastern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot.</b> By 24 September the division had taken Oliveto and Quaglietta after some heavy fighting, and by 3 October they had taken Benevento. On 21 October the division was put into corps reserve, following almost six weeks of uninterrupted action. There was still some German resistance around Venafro, and elements of the 179th Infantry Regiment secured the town on 2 November. With this the fighting came to a large pause as Allied planners studied further action.|$|E

50|$|Conventional ski {{bindings}} attach to flanges {{extending from the}} toe and heel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ski <b>boot.</b> These are well-standardized in size and shape, under ISO 5355. However, as they are attached to <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boots,</b> <b>the</b> distance from the toe to heel changes from boot to <b>boot.</b> This requires <b>the</b> binding system {{to have the ability}} to move fore and aft on the ski to accommodate different sized boots.|$|R
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely at the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot,</b> which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over {{to one side of the}} hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E
25|$|The bassoon is held diagonally {{in front}} of the player, but unlike the flute, oboe and clarinet, it cannot be easily {{supported}} by the player's hands alone. Some means of additional support is usually required; the most common ones are a seat strap attached to the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> joint, which is laid across the chair seat prior to sitting down, or a neck strap or shoulder harness attached to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> joint. Occasionally a spike similar to those used for the cello or the bass clarinet is attached to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> joint and rests on the floor. It is possible to play while standing up if the player uses a neck strap or similar harness, or if the seat strap is tied to the belt. Sometimes a device called a balance hanger is used when playing in a standing position. This is installed between the instrument and the neck strap, and shifts the point of support closer to the center of gravity, adjusting the distribution of weight between the two hands.|$|E
25|$|Cap-strap {{bindings}} are {{a recent}} modification {{that provide a}} very tight fit to the toe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot,</b> and seats the boot more securely in the binding. Numerous companies have adopted various versions of the cap strap.|$|E

25|$|The four {{fingers of}} the right hand {{have at least one}} {{assignment}} each. The index finger stays over one hole, except that when E4 is played a side key at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> is used. The middle finger remains stationary over the hole with a ring around it, and this ring and other pads are lifted when the smallest finger on the right hand pushes a lever. The ring finger typically remains stationary on the lower ring-finger key. However, the upper ring-finger key can be used, typically for B2 and B3, in place of the top thumb key on the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> joint. The smallest finger operates three keys. The backmost one, closest to the bassoonist, is held down throughout most of the bass register. The key is not used after F1 is played. F2 is created with this key, as well as G4, B4, B4, and C4. The lowest key for the smallest finger on the right hand is primarily used for A1 (G1) and A2 (G2) but can be used E4, and F4. The frontmost key is used with the bottom thumb key on the boot joint to create A1 and A2.|$|E
25|$|Stomp pads, {{which are}} placed between the {{bindings}} {{closer to the}} rear binding, allow the rider to better control the board with only one boot strapped in, such as when maneuvering onto a chair lift, riding a ski tow or performing a one footed trick. Whereas the upper surface of the board is smooth, the stomp pad has a textured pattern which provides grip to the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot.</b> Stomp pads can be decorative and vary in their size, shape and the kind and number of small spikes or friction points they provide.|$|E
25|$|Each Nintendo 64 Game Pak {{contains}} a lockout chip (conceptually {{similar to the}} 10NES) to prevent manufacturers from creating unauthorized copies of games and discourage production of unlicensed games. Unlike previous versions, the N64 lockout chip {{contains a}} seed value {{which is used to}} calculate a checksum of the game's boot code. To discourage playing of copied games by piggybacking on a real Game Pak, Nintendo produced five different versions of the chip. During the boot process, and occasionally while the game is running, the N64 computes the checksum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> code and verifies it with the lockout chip in the Game Pak, failing to boot if the check fails.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Network <b>booting</b> is <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>booting</b> a {{computer}} from a network {{rather than a}} local drive. In this paper, a novel intelligent network booting protocol is proposed. It extracts all <b>the</b> states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clients from their booting requests to their normal operations, which is depicted with a finite state machine. Based on the protocol, an intelligent network booting system is implemented with distributed modules, where <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network <b>booting</b> system is automated, such as <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virtual <b>booting</b> partition for <b>the</b> client, loading and passing <b>the</b> <b>booting</b> parameters, and so on.

25|$|Unlike when {{a person}} is {{suspended}} by their wrists, rope suspension around the ankles can be maintained for much longer as the ankle region naturally is able to take far more weight and stress than the wrists. This is especially so if boots are used as the ropes can run around the outside surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> thus protecting the skin from damage. The person may be suspended with their legs together, or held apart either by using a spreader bar or by securing the ankles to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.|$|E
25|$|The {{most visible}} {{difference}} {{in relation to}} ice hockey skates is that figure skates {{have a set of}} large, jagged teeth called toe picks on the front part of the blade. The toe picks are used primarily in jumping and should not be used for stroking or spins. If used during a spin, the toe pick will cause the skater to lose momentum, or move away from the center of his/her spin. Blades are mounted to the sole and heel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> with screws. Typically, high-level figure skaters are professionally fitted for their boots and blades at a reputable skate shop. Professionals are also employed to sharpen blades to individual requirements.|$|E

At the rear, the Ford logo moved from the right to the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot,</b> except for the van and convertible models. The interior of the car was hugely revised too following heavy criticism of the original 1990 car which featured low quality plastics for its interior mouldings - the car now featured an all new dashboard arrangement of competitive quality.

25|$|After two years' deployment, Nilsen {{returned}} to Aldershot, where he passed his official catering exam before being deployed {{to serve as}} a cook for the British Army in Norway. In 1967, he was deployed to Aden, South Yemen, where he again served as a cook at the Al Mansoura Prison. This posting was more fraught with risks than his previous postings in West Germany or Norway, and Nilsen later recalled his regiment losing several men, often in ambushes en route to the army barracks. Nilsen was himself kidnapped by an Arab taxi driver, who beat him unconscious and placed him in the boot of his car. Upon being dragged out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> of the taxi, Nilsen grabbed a jack-handle and knocked the taxi driver to the floor before beating him unconscious.

25|$|Traditional Australian ugg {{boots are}} made from sheepskins with fleece attached. The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is {{assembled}} with the fleece on the inside. Some ugg boots have a synthetic sole, commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). The stitching is often prominent on the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot.</b> The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives isothermal properties to the boots: the thick fleecy fibres on the inner part of the boots wick moisture and allow air to circulate, keeping the feet at body temperature and allowing the boots to keep feet warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather. Produced {{by a number of}} manufacturers, they {{come in a variety of}} colours, including black, pink, blue, chestnut, and fuchsia. They are available in both pull-on and lace-up varieties and their height can range from just above the ankle to above the knee.|$|E
