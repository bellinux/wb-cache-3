The franchise's first manager was Rene Lachemann, who accumulated 285 losses during his four-season tenure.

Jack McKeon was named the team's interim manager in 2011, having been named to the position following the mid-season resignation of Edwin Rodríguez.

500|$|Ripken slumped offensively in 1990, batting [...]209 {{through his}} first 59 games. However, {{throughout}} the year he impressed players and fans with his fielding. On June 12, he broke Mark Belanger's Baltimore record for most consecutive errorless chances by a shortstop. He went 67 straight games before suffering what was originally scored an error on June 26. However, official scorer Bill Steka decided the error was really Mike Devereaux's fault and changed the call the next day.
