500|$|Ali Abu Nuwar {{was born}} in 1925 in al-Salt, Transjordan, which was then under British control. His father's family, the Abu Nuwar, was a {{prominent}} Arab clan in al-Salt. His mother was of Circassian descent. In his youth, Abu Nuwar {{was influenced by the}} discussions that his father and relatives held about the effects of the 1916 Arab Revolt, the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the 1920 Syrian Arab defeat at the Battle of Maysalun had on the fate of the Middle East. During the closing years of World War I, the Ottomans had been driven out of their Arab territories by an alliance of Hashemite-led Arab rebels and British forces, and were thereafter replaced by the British and French, who effectively occupied the Arab territories. Revolts and popular opposition against European rule in Palestine, Transjordan and elsewhere in the region emerged in the 1920s and 1930s. In his memoirs, Abu Nuwar recalled that his teachers in al-Salt would tell him and his classmates that the [...] "Arab Nation was colonized and fragmented and that it was on the shoulders <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>generation</b> to take responsibility for freedom and unity".|$|E
500|$|Today, Crane is {{considered}} one of the most innovative writers of the 1890s. His peers, including Conrad and James, as well as later writers such as Robert Frost, Ezra Pound and Willa Cather, hailed Crane as one of the finest creative spirits of his time. [...] His work was described by Wells as [...] "the first expression of the opening mind of a new period, or, at least, the early emphatic phase of a new initiative." [...] Wells said that [...] "beyond dispute", Crane was [...] "the best writer <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>generation,</b> and his untimely death was an irreparable loss to our literature." [...] Conrad wrote that Crane was an [...] "artist" [...] and [...] "a seer with a gift for rendering the significant on the surface of things and with an incomparable insight into primitive emotions". [...] Crane's work has proved inspirational for future writers; not only have scholars drawn similarities between Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms and The Red Badge of Courage, but Crane's fiction is thought to have been an important inspiration for Hemingway and his fellow Modernists. [...] In 1936, Hemingway wrote in The Green Hills of Africa that [...] "The good writers are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain. [...] That's not the order they're good in. [...] There is no order for good writers." [...] Crane's poetry is thought to have been a precursor to the Imagist movement, and his short fiction has also influenced American literature. [...] "The Open Boat", [...] "The Blue Hotel", The Monster and [...] "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky" [...] are generally considered by critics to be examples of Crane's best work.|$|E
500|$|Progressive education, a {{pedagogy}} promoting {{learning through}} real-life experiences, {{was at its}} zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in Progressive Education and other professional journals, and in 1938, the editor of Progressive Education, Gertrude Hartman, published {{a profile of the}} Avery Coonley School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, [...] "isitors {{from all parts of the}} United States and from foreign countries [...] to see the school—sometimes as many as thirty in a day." [...] Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that the most noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades it... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the kind of education described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of society than the education <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>generation</b> has produced... The method in which those in the school place their faith is the building into the very nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human relations can evolve. Finding Wisdom became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education.|$|E

2500|$|Leno faced heated {{criticism}} and increasing negative publicity for his perceived {{role in the}} timeslot conflict, with some critics predicting that his reputation—along with those of Jeff Zucker and NBC as a whole—had been permanently damaged by the incident. Critics pointed to the 2004 Tonight Show clip, wherein Leno claimed he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident. Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt {{was among the first}} celebrities to openly voice disappointment with Leno, saying, [...] "Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks;' it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>generation...</b> willfully has shut the switch off." [...] Rosie O'Donnell has been among O'Brien's most vocal and vehement supporters, calling Leno a [...] "bully" [...] and his recent actions [...] "classless and kind of career-defining". Howard Stern was also a harsh critic of Leno before and following the timeslot change announcement; Stern appeared on Late Night in 2006, and told O'Brien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up Tonight to anyone. The 67th Golden Globe Awards, which aired on NBC during the heat of O'Brien's settlement negotiations on January 17, featured numerous jokes on the controversy by Tina Fey, Tom Hanks, and show host Ricky Gervais: [...] "Let's get on with it before NBC replaces me with Jay Leno." ...|$|E

[...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This {{has nothing to do with}} the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>generation,</b> mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it.

[...] He accused the Jews in general of attempting to destroy what he claimed was a direct link between Romania and God, and the Legion campaigned in favor of the notion that there was no actual connection between the Old Testament Hebrews and the modern Jews. In one instance, making a reference to the origin of the Romanians, Codreanu stated that Jews were corrupting the [...] "Roman-Dacian structure of our people."

Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing.

Kraftwerk would also go on to {{influence}} other forms of music such as hip hop, house, and drum and bass, and they are also regarded as pioneers of the electro genre.
