This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
40|$|The main {{theme of}} this diploma thesis is Information Security Management System (ISMS) {{which is based on}} {{security}} standard ISO 27001 and ISO 27002. This thesis is one part of the project of integration ISMS to company RWE. First goal is analysis <b>of</b> actual <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> RWE. Second goal is proposal of ideal structure <b>of</b> ISMS <b>documentation.</b> Third goal is assignment the parts <b>of</b> RWE <b>documentation</b> to ideal structure <b>of</b> ISMS <b>documentation.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> actual <b>documentation</b> used knowledge about RWE documentation to create overview table with all documents and their relations. Ideal structure <b>of</b> ISMS <b>documentation</b> was based on selected parts of ISO 27001 and multicriterial analysis. Third goal of this thesis was reached by assignment parts <b>of</b> RWE <b>documentation</b> to selected parts of ISO 27001 from the second goal.

5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles to other forms <b>of</b> <b>documentation.</b> She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack <b>of</b> <b>documentation,</b> which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E

This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.|$|E
5|$|Stein's {{formulation}} {{has been}} criticized by historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, in part, {{on account of the}} lack of extensive historiography for the period. The 18th-century Wodeyar rulers of Mysore—in contrast to their contemporaries in Rajputana, Central India, Maratha Deccan, and Tanjavur—left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the paucity <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> on this older 'Old Regime'.|$|E

The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles. NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests, but limited availability of the expert resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half-year delay of the inspections.|$|E
