Sessitsch et al. (2013) also approved this hypothesis by demonstrating the influence of enhanced root system on uptake of trace elements.

40|$|Abstract This study reports {{concentrations}} of iron (Fe) and organic matter in young Antarctic pack ice and during its initial growth stages in situ. Although {{the importance of}} sea ice as an Fe reservoir for oceanic waters of the Southern Ocean has been clearly established, the processes leading to the enrichment of Fe in sea ice {{have yet to be}} investigated and quantified. We conducted two in situ sea-ice growth experiments during a winter cruise in the Weddell Sea. Our aim was to improve the understanding of the processes responsible for the accumulation of dissolved Fe (DFe) and particulate Fe (PFe) in sea ice, and of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, dissolved <b>organic</b> carbon, extracellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances,</b> inorganic macro-nutrients (silicic acid, nitrate and nitrite, phosphate and ammonium), chlorophyll a and bacteria. Enrichment indices, calculated for natural young ice and ice newly formed in situ, indicate that during Antarctic winter all of the measured forms of particulate matter were enriched in sea ice compared to underlying seawater, and that enrichment started from the initial stages of sea-ice formation. Some dissolved material (DFe and ammonium) was also enriched in the ice but at lower enrichment indices than the particulate phase, suggesting that size is a key factor for the incorporation of impurities in sea ice. Low chlorophyll a concentrations and the fit of the macro-nutrients (with the exception of ammonium) with their theoretical dilution lines indicated low biological activity in the ice. From these and additional results we conclude that physical processes are the dominant mechanisms leading to the enrichment of DFe, PFe, organic matter and bacteria in young sea ice, and that PFe and DFe are decoupled during sea-ice formation. Our study thus provides unique quantitative insight into the initial incorporation of impurities, in particular DFe and PFe, into Antarctic sea ice...|$|R

The aim of this work is to study the role of different floc-associated ciliates commonly reported in wastewater treatment plants-crawling Euplotes and sessile Vorticella- {{in the formation of}} aggregates. Flocs, in experiments with ciliates and latex beads, showed more compactation and cohesion among particles than those in the absence of ciliates. Ciliates have been shown to contribute to floc formation through different mechanisms such as the active secretion of <b>polymeric</b> <b>substances</b> (extrusomes), their biological activities (movement and feeding strategies), or the cysts formation capacity of some species. Staining with lectins coupled to fluorescein showed that carbohydrate of the matrix contained glucose, manose, N-acetyl-glucosamine and galactose.

This exocellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substance</b> can be obtained from the supernatant of shaken liquid cultures by cold ethanol precipitation, and yields as high as 3 mg/ml have been detected.

The total exocellular <b>polymeric</b> <b>substance</b> produced was proportional to the total biomass. The polymer is a heteropolysaccharide containing mannose as the major component. Glucose, galactose, and another unidentified sugar were also present, as well as amino sugars, uronic acids, and a considerable amount of sulfate, which accounts for the acidic nature of the polymer. The infrared spectrum and specific assays showed the absence of acyl groups. The rheological properties of polymer solutions were studied, showing a pseudoplastic behavior and a high apparent viscosity at relatively low concentrations.
