30|$|Indian coals of drift origin (Gondwana Coal) can be {{characterized}} by high ash content with impurities disseminated in the coal bed. Very thin bands (5  mm– 3  cm) of impurities are often encountered in between coal bands. Such coal has high near gravity material (NGM >  30  %) content. Liberation size of coal is much smaller; and significant improvement in yield is observed when coal is crushed down to as low as − 6  mm to − 3  mm and − 1  mm. However, operating a coal washery with such small coal size is not feasible under present techno-economics. This makes Indian Coal difficult to wash, resulting in poor yield and low <b>organic</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E

This paper reports an experimental approach for the determination {{and analysis of the}} pressure distribution in a variable displacement vane pump for high speed internal combustion engine lubrication. More in details, an actual application is presented for a seven-blades variable displacement vane pump equipped with a hydraulic geometry variation system. This unit is characterized by a high performance, in terms of rotational speed, delivery pressure and displacement variation. The experimental layout and some relevant facilities are described. An extended test campaign was performed on the pump to characterize its operational behavior. Rotational speeds from the idling regime to the maximum sustainable regime were tested by varying the hydraulic circuit load: the results of the pressure field are shown together with {{a detailed description of the}} oil physical behavior into the pump. Furthermore, several changes in the geometry of the pump, which were suggested by the experimental campaign, are presented and their influence on the performance of the pump is evaluated and discussed with a comparative performance analysis.

40|$|A circuit {{comprised}} of advanced fine coal cleaning technologies was evaluated in an operating preparation plant to determine circuit performance and {{to compare the}} performance with current technologies used to treat - 16 mesh fine coal. The circuit integrated a Floatex hydrosizer, a Falcon enhanced gravity concentrator and a Jameson flotation cell. A Packed-Column was used to provide additional reductions in the pyritic sulfur and ash contents by treatment of the Floatex-Falcon-Jameson circuit product. For a low sulfur Illinois No. 5 coal, the pyritic sulfur content was reduced from 0. 67 % to 0. 34 % at a combustible recovery of 93. 2 %. The ash content was decreased from 27. 6 % to 5. 84 %, which equates to an <b>organic</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 95 % according to gravity-based washability data. The separation performance achieved on a high sulfur Illinois No. 5 coal resulted in the rejection of 72. 7 % of the pyritic sulfur and 82. 3 % of the ash-forming material at a recovery of 8 1 %. Subsequent pulverization of the cleaned product and retreatment in a Falcon concentrator and Packed-Column resulted in overall circuit ash and pyritic sulfur rejections of 89 % and 93 %, respectively, which yielded a pyritic sulfur content reduction from 2. 43 % to 0. 30 %. This separation reduced the sulfur dioxide emission rating of an Illinois No. 5 coal from 6. 21 to 1. 75 lbs SO{sub 2 }/MBTU, which is Phase I compliance coal. A comparison of the results obtained from the Floatex-Falcon-Jameson circuit {{with those of the}} existing circuit revealed that the novel fine coal circuit provides 10 % to 20 % improvement in mass yield to the concentrate while rejecting greater amounts of ash and pyritic sulfur...|$|E

Polyurethane foam cubes were used as inert support in the reactor, and mixing was accomplished by recirculating the liquid phase. The effect of feeding time on reactor performance showed to be more pronounced at higher values of applied volumetric organic loads (AVOLs). Highest <b>organic</b> material removal <b>efficiencies</b> achieved at AVOL of 4. 5 gCOD L- 1 day(- 1) were 87 % at 4 -h feeding against 84 % at 2 -h and 6 -h feeding.
