5|$|Chopin {{published}} his music in France, England and the German states {{due to the}} copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition {{is different from the}} other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. <b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are found}} in the west, north, and east of Madagascar, but their {{distribution}} is discontinuous. Their habitat ranges from dry deciduous forests on the western coast of the island to rainforest in the east. They are also commonly found in secondary forest, but not in areas lacking continuous forest cover. They are most common in the west of the island. Fork-marked lemurs are not found in the southern spiny forests in the dry southern part of the island, and <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> been reported from the southeastern rainforest at Andohahela National Park, though this has not been confirmed. A team led by E.E.Louis Jr. has suggested that undescribed varieties may also exist elsewhere on the island.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. <b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E

5|$|<b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> {{attempts}} to improve {{health in the}} developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common {{in the developing world}}. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E

25|$|An android is a {{humanoid}} robot or synthetic organism {{designed to look}} and act like a human, especially one with a body having a flesh-like resemblance. Historically, androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction where they are frequently seen in film and television. <b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> advancements in robot technology allowed the design of functional and realistic {{humanoid robot}}s.|$|E

It was also used as a training area for the British Army. It might have been released earlier, but due to the period of unrest known as the Troubles, the British Government and military viewed the area as a useful vantage point, overlooking Belfast.|$|E
25|$|Some locks are {{operated}} (or {{at least}} supervised) by professional or volunteer lock keepers. This {{is particularly true}} on commercial waterways, or where locks are large or have complicated features that the average leisure boater {{may not be able}} to operate successfully. For instance, although the Thames above Teddington (England) is almost entirely a leisure waterway, the locks are usually staffed. <b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> boaters been allowed limited access to the hydraulic gear to operate the locks when the keeper is not present.|$|E

25|$|Twain's {{wife died}} in 1904 while {{the couple were}} staying at the Villa di Quarto in Florence. After some time had passed he {{published}} some works that his wife, his de facto editor and censor throughout her married life, had looked down upon. The Mysterious Stranger is perhaps the best known, depicting various visits of Satan to earth. This particular work was not published in Twain's lifetime. His manuscripts included three versions, written between 1897 and 1905: the so-called Hannibal, Eseldorf, and Print Shop versions. The resulting confusion led to extensive publication of a jumbled version, and <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> the original versions become available as Twain wrote them.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} Wetz had {{preferred}} {{the life in}} provincial Erfurt {{to that of the}} real music metropolises, and that he was never moved to create popular compositions which could have increased his reputation, did little to bring Wetz and his works to the broader general public. Indeed, some conductors questioned the quality of his compositions until the 1990s (especially during the arrangements for celebrations in his honour in Erfurt in 1955, 20th anniversary of his death and what would be his 80th birthday). <b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> his creations been rediscovered. For example, the requiem of the composer was performed {{for the first time in}} sixty years in September 2003 at the Erfurt church's music festival, under the direction of George Alexander Albrecht.|$|E
25|$|Herbert {{tended to}} use a {{slightly}} larger orchestra than Sullivan did in his comic operas, mostly through use of more types of percussion and occasionally by adding a harp. He generally wrote his own orchestrations, which were admired by music critics and other composers. In revivals of his works, however, new orchestrations have substituted saxophones and brass for strings. For many years, the only recording available of a Herbert show using his original orchestrations was one of Naughty Marietta, produced by the Smithsonian in 1981. <b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> more recordings of his operettas appeared with the original orchestrations intact. These include Naughty Marietta, Mlle. Modiste, Eileen, Sweethearts and The Red Mill by Ohio Light Opera and The Fortune Teller by The Comic Opera Guild, which also has recorded numerous Herbert operettas live in concert with two-piano accompaniment.|$|E

30|$|While Voisin (1988) {{advocated}} that overgrazing {{of plants}} {{was the greatest}} influence in land degradation, <b>only</b> more <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> the effects of partial rest and total rest been appreciated (Behnke 1999; Niamir-Fuller and Turner 1999; Cummins 2009) as factors that tend to countermand the influence of overgrazing and may be the principle factors degrading rangelands. Similarly, <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>has</b> the role of animal impact on the soil surface--as affected by animal density and herd behavior--become recognized as a significant interrelated factor (Westoby et al. 1989; Savory 1999; Teague et al. 2008).|$|R
50|$|This {{relative}} obscurity {{is partly}} due to her work <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>having</b> appeared in English translation; also because the Holocaust-literature canon has tended to focus on writers such as Anne Frank, Primo Levi and Elie Wiesel who have been in print for far longer.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indigenous}} people live within the rainforest as hunter-gatherers, or subsist as part-time small scale farmers supplemented {{in large part by}} trading high-value forest products such as hides, feathers, and honey with agricultural people living outside the forest. Peoples have inhabited the rainforests {{for tens of thousands of}} years and have remained so elusive that <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> some tribes been discovered. These indigenous peoples are greatly threatened by loggers in search for old-growth tropical hardwoods like Ipe, Cumaru and Wenge, and by farmers who are looking to expand their land, for cattle(meat), and soybeans, which are used to feed cattle in Europe and China. On 18 January 2007, FUNAI reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted tribes. The province of Irian Jaya or West Papua in the island of New Guinea is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.|$|E
25|$|Skilled readers {{move their}} eyes during {{reading on the}} average of every quarter of a second. During {{the time that the}} eye is fixated, new {{information}} is brought into the processing system. Although the average fixation duration is 200–250 ms (thousandths of a second), the range is from 100 ms to over 500 ms. The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7–9 characters. The saccade lasts for 20–40 ms and during this time vision is suppressed so that no new information is acquired. There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. Skilled readers make regressions back to material already read about 15 percent of the time. The main difference between faster and slower readers is that the latter group consistently shows longer average fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions. These basic facts about eye movement have been known for almost a hundred years, but <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> researchers begun to look at eye movement behavior as a reflection of cognitive processing during reading.|$|E

2500|$|In Yamamoto coupling, carbon-carbon {{bonds of}} aryl halogenide {{compounds}} are formed via mediation from {{a transition metal}} catalyst, most commonly bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0), often written as Ni(cod)2. An advantage to Yamamoto coupling is only a single halogen functionalized monomer is required, leading to diversity in monomer species, {{as well as a}} simple reaction procedure. While most research in CMPs focus on controlling pore size and surface area, the lack of flexibility in the monomers used in Yamamoto couplings give way to free volumes and porosity in CMPs. [...] <b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> controlled pore size and surface area CMPs via Yamamoto coupling been reported.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> sceptics {{focused on}} other {{perceived}} {{aspects of the}} Countess's personality: arrogance, stubbornness, blind devotion to an unworthy husband, and a disingenuous cleverness seen as taking the literary form of a tendency toward self-absorption and self-absolution that somehow never casts her in a negative light. For all these flaws, real or imagined, the saga of the prisoner of the Blue Tower [...] the fall of a mighty woman and her rise from despair to an even greater intellectual and spiritual might, as told {{against the backdrop of}} Europe during the Reformation [...] remains deeply compelling, even inspiring, as much to artists and the devout as to historians, patriots and feminists.|$|E
2500|$|Like Vasari and Van Mander before him, De Bie's biographies are {{interspersed}} with amusing anecdotes. Although such literary motifs {{belong to a}} long rhetorical tradition, many of these stories were labelled [...] "historically unreliable" [...] by leading historians in the 19th century and <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> <b>have</b> some of them been reinstated. However, since they were also often the only surviving {{source of information about}} certain painters, these stories have always been repeated as hard facts about the lives of other painters appearing in the stories. Examples are when Cornelis de Bie describes apprenticeships that were considered improbable because the artist painted in a completely different genre than the teacher. An example is De Bie's statement that Philips Wouwerman trained with Frans Hals. Later historians claimed this was improbable, because Wouwerman painted landscapes with horses and Hals was a portrait painter. Today this is still considered by some to be improbable, though Hals clearly had a large workshop and took on his sons as well as other pupils.|$|E
