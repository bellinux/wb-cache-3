Diarmait's deep-rooted authority in Norse-Gaelic Dublin lasted for two decades, and was a remarkable achievement that no other Irish king had ever accomplished. Unfortunately for the Uí Chennselaig, two of Diarmait's sonsMurchad and Glún Iairnunexpectedly predeceased their father in 1070, and Diarmait himself fell in battle two years later.|$|E

5|$|Ascall's {{father was}} Ragnall mac Torcaill (died 1146), {{a man who}} may well have ruled as King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin.</b> The men {{were members of the}} Meic Torcaill, a {{substantial}} landholding kindred in the kingdom. Several members of this Norse-Gaelic family held the kingship in the twelfth century. One such man was Ascall's uncle, Brodar mac Torcaill, King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin,</b> who was slain in 1160.|$|E
5|$|Domnall Gerrlámhach (died 1135), {{also known}} as Domnall Gerrlámhach Ua Briain, Domnall mac Muirchertaig, and Domnall Ua Briain, was an obscure twelfth-century Uí Briain dynast and King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin.</b> He {{was one of two}} sons of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. Domnall's father appears to have {{installed}} him as King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> in the late eleventh- or early twelfth century, which suggests that he was his father's successor-designate. Although Domnall won a remarkable victory in the defence of the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> {{in the face of an}} invasion from the Kingdom of Leinster in 1115, he failed to achieve the successes of his father. After his final expulsion from Dublin at hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht, and the death of his father, Domnall disappears from record until his own death in 1135. He was perhaps survived by two sons.|$|E
5|$|Domnall mac Murchada (died 1075), {{also known}} as Domnall mac Murchada meic Diarmata, was a leading late eleventh-century {{claimant}} to the Kingdom of Leinster, and a King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin.</b> As a son of Murchad mac Diarmata, King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> and the Isles, Domnall was a grandson of Diarmait mac Máel na mBó, King of Leinster, and thus {{a member of the}} Uí Chennselaig. Domnall was also the first of the Meic Murchada, a branch of the Uí Chennselaig named after his father.|$|E

5|$|Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115) was {{the ruler}} of the Kingdom of the Isles, the Kingdom of Thomond, and perhaps the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> as well. His father was Tadc, son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster, which meant that Domnall {{was a member of}} the Meic Taidc, a branch of the Uí Briain. Domnall's mother was Mór, {{daughter}} of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> and the Isles, which may have given Domnall a stake to the kingship of the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Domnall's rise {{to power}} in the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> took place in 1075, after the {{expulsion}} of the reigning Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill, King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> by the latter's overlord, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster. The circumstances surrounding Domnall's accession are uncertain. He may have collaborated with Gofraid to wrench the kingdom from {{the grip of the}} Uí Briain, or he may have been installed in the kingship by Toirdelbach himself, and ruled under the latter's overlordship. Whatever the case, Domnall died within the year, and Toirdelbach placed his own son, Muirchertach, upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach's hold on Dublin was {{short-lived}} as the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach records that Ímar replaced him as King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> in 1038. This annal-entry {{has been interpreted}} to indicate that Ímar drove Echmarcach from the kingship. There is reason to suspect that Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065) extended his presence into the Isles and the Irish Sea region at about this period. The evidence of Þórfinnr's power in the Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship. In fact, Þórfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> in 1038.|$|E

5|$|In 1862, Lee and the Shaws {{agreed to}} share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an {{affluent}} part <b>of</b> <b>Dublin,</b> and a country cottage on Dalkey Hill, overlooking Killiney Bay. Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts <b>of</b> <b>Dublin</b> shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly; thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with {{a wide spectrum of}} literature.|$|E
5|$|Whatever the {{circumstances}} of Domnall's accession, the Uí Chennselaig regime in Dublin was short-lived. The Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of the Four Masters, and the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, all reveal that, within the year, Domnall died after a brief illness, with the latter two sources specifying that he succumbed after three nights of sickness. The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of Ulster accord him the title King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin,</b> and make no mention of any connection with the Leinster kingship. Upon Domnall's demise, Toirdelbach had his own son, Muirchertach (died 1119), appointed King <b>of</b> <b>Dublin.</b> In so doing, Toirdelbach reinforced his authority in Dublin, and followed a precedent started by Domnall's grandfather, in which a claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland installed his own heir to the kingship <b>of</b> <b>Dublin.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's lieutenancy was {{primarily}} {{of a military}} nature; by the early 14th century, Ireland had become a rebellious and unruly dominion for the English crown. In this capacity Gaveston had considerable success, killing or defeating several major insurgents. He fortified the town of Newcastle McKynegan and Castle Kevin, and rebuilt the road from Castle Kevin to Glendalough. This helped pacify the county {{at least as far}} as the Wicklow Mountains, west <b>of</b> <b>Dublin.</b> In the field of administration he made less of a mark. The most notable issue with which he was involved concerned a dispute over murage – a toll on the town walls – between the citizens <b>of</b> <b>Dublin.</b> As during the regency, though, there is no evidence that Gaveston exploited his position for his own advantage and he did nothing to alienate the local elite.|$|E
