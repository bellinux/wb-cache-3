5|$|Diagnosis can be complex because {{concussion}} shares symptoms with <b>other</b> <b>conditions.</b> For example, post-concussion {{symptoms such as}} cognitive {{problems may}} be misattributed to brain injury when, in fact, due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E
5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, {{in which}} acanthocytes are a typical feature, are chorea acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes are seen less {{frequently}} in <b>other</b> <b>conditions</b> including Huntington's disease-like syndrome 2 (HDL2) and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN).|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of narcosis {{is simply to}} ascend to shallower depths; the effects then disappear within minutes. In the event of complications or <b>other</b> <b>conditions</b> being present, ascending is always the correct initial response. Should problems remain, then {{it is necessary to}} abort the dive. The decompression schedule can still be followed unless <b>other</b> <b>conditions</b> require emergency assistance.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and <b>other</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of <b>other</b> <b>{{conditions}},</b> due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, lung cancer, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, and depression. In those with severe disease, a feeling of always being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. <b>Other</b> <b>conditions</b> that can produce similar symptoms such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out. No laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. <b>Other</b> <b>conditions</b> that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E

5|$|In many cases, {{magnetic}} resonance imaging of the spinal cord is performed to distinguish between Guillain–Barré syndrome and <b>other</b> <b>conditions</b> causing limb weakness, such as spinal cord compression. If an MRI scan shows enhancement of the nerve roots, this may be indicative of GBS. In children, this feature is present in 95% of scans, {{but it is not}} specific to Guillain–Barré syndrome, so other confirmation is also needed.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms with <b>other</b> <b>conditions</b> and may {{be easily}} missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E

5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>conditions</b> {{that are}} {{closely linked to}} {{cerebellar}} degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Pope Clement VI (1342–1352) {{created more}} cardinal-nephews {{than any other}} pontiff, {{including}} six on September 20, 1342, {{the greatest number of}} cardinal-nephews elevated at one time. The capitulation of the 1464 papal conclave limited the Pope it elected (Pope Paul II) to appointing one cardinal-nephew, along with <b>other</b> <b>conditions</b> designed to increase the power of the College of Cardinals and reduce the Pope's ability to dilute that power.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have for}} years studied depression, alcoholism, aggression, maternal-infant bonding and <b>other</b> <b>conditions</b> and {{phenomena}} in nonhuman primates and other laboratory animals using an experimental maternal deprivation paradigm.

5|$|The eye {{problems}} associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the <b>other</b> <b>conditions,</b> with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. <b>Other</b> <b>conditions</b> that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection; however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble <b>other</b> <b>conditions</b> such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.|$|E

Traditionally, that something else was held to be evidential justification; today it is usually held to be either justification and also some <b>other</b> <b>condition,</b> or else some <b>other</b> <b>condition</b> instead of justification, which will avoid the Gettier problem.|$|R
