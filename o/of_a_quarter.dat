5|$|American {{emergency}} rations in World War I consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> ounce (7 grams) {{packet of}} double-strength instant coffee, packed one per man in containers with multiple types of foods meant for twenty-four men. Instant coffee {{was also used}} in reserve rations and trench rations. During World War II, the U.S. military again relied on Washington, but this time {{on an equal footing}} with the other major instant coffee brands that had emerged in the interwar period, most notably Nescafé, as well as the new companies formed to meet a renewed military demand.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back with the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation {{as he and his}} followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E

5|$|Aphilas {{introduced}} {{a number of}} different standards for all three metals, some of which lasted through to the 7th century, while the use of others ended with his reign. His new gold coins (issued in conjunction with the older) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned (each are known from only one specimen), and 1/16 aureus coins have been found, though these {{are more likely to be}} deliberate debasements to increase profit (Aksumite gold was generally very pure, however). Aphilas's silver coin, however, issued at half the weight of the former, became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage. The older coin was presumably more valuable than needed, and the new coin remedied the problem. Aphilas's bronze issue, however, was instead doubled to 4.83grams. The coin's rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market, as is assumed with his quarter-aureus. These two issues are the only one of Aphilas's issues to portray him frontally, rather than in profile.|$|E
5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war on Henry by Prince Richard and King Philip II of France in 1187, Geoffrey was given command <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of the English royal army. He and his father were driven from Le Mans, Henry's birthplace, in 1189. Geoffrey {{did not attend the}} subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry's death, unwilling to witness his father's humiliation, but he did help nurse him during his final days. Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or Bishop of Winchester, and Geoffrey used his father's seal to make appointments to York after Henry's death. Geoffrey then escorted Henry's body to Fontevrault Abbey for burial. He {{was the only one of}} Henry II's sons present at his death.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{stories to}} Si Ronda's include those of Si Jampang and Si Pitung; these stage plays centred on {{extraordinary}} men (referred to as jago) who, though living outside the law, generally {{fought for the}} common populace. Adaptations of the genre, manifested as bandit films, became popular in domestic cinema following the release of Si Tjonat by Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. This release {{was followed by the}} Wong brothers' Rampok Preanger (also 1929), and an adaptation of the Si Pitung stories in 1931. Not all films in this genre, which consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of all domestic releases for 1929–1931, maintained the heroic qualities of the central character: the Wongs' adaptation of Si Pitung, for instance, portrayed him as a simple bandit and not the Robin Hood figure of stage.|$|E
5|$|The Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, was {{instructed}} to prepare designs for pattern coins. Initially, Longacre worked with Liberty head designs such as were common at the time, but Snowden asked that a flying eagle design be prepared. This occurred as Booth's experiments continued; the first cent patterns with the flying eagle design were about the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter.</b> To promote the new alloy, the Mint had 50 half cents struck in it, and had them sent to Washington for Treasury officials to show to officials and congressmen. In early November 1856, Longacre prepared dies in what {{would prove to be}} the final design, depicting a flying eagle on the obverse and a wreathed denomination on the reverse, in the size sought by Booth.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{released}} by Chesterfield after he was not offered a new contract {{at the end of}} 2007–08. He trialled with Darlington of League Two, but was told by manager Dave Penney he was not what they were looking for. He then had a trial with newly relegated Conference Premier club Wrexham and eventually signed a contract with Gainsborough Trinity of the Conference North in late August. Smith made a goalscoring debut for Gainsborough with the team's goal in a 1–1 draw at home to Vauxhall Motors on 30 August. He joined York City in the Conference Premier on loan on 27 November, becoming Martin Foyle's first signing as manager, in a deal that would expire on 6 January 2009. Smith made his debut after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Craig Farrell in a 1–1 draw with Salisbury City. His first goal came after scoring the opener for York with a close range finish in a 3–1 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following this, Foyle stated his intention of extending Smith's loan at York. Smith said he was looking to join the club on a permanent contract and that Gainsborough manager Steve Charles would allow him to leave for a club in a higher division on a free transfer. However, a move to York stalled in January as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee, although Foyle refused to pay this. York eventually made an offer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of Gainsborough's asking price, which was rejected.|$|E

25|$|The American Quarter Horse, or Quarter Horse, is an American {{breed of}} horse that excels at sprinting short distances.

Note that the non-penalized team has the option to decline any penalty it considers disadvantageous, so a losing team cannot indefinitely prolong a game by repeatedly committing infractions.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Jews in France dates back over 2,000 years. In the early Middle Ages, France was a center of Jewish learning, but {{persecution}} increased as the Middle Ages wore on. France was the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution, but despite legal equality anti-Semitism remained an issue, as illustrated in the Dreyfus affair of the late 19th century. However, through the 1870 Décret Crémieux, France secured full citizenship for the Jews in then French-ruled Algeria. Despite the death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> of all French Jews during the Holocaust, France currently has the largest Jewish population in Europe.|$|E
