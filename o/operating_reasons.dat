40|$|The {{increasing}} attention {{devoted to}} air quality by legislative, scientific, industrial and public sectors {{has led to}} the development of different control strategies for the emission level monitoring. In this scenario, Predictive Emission Monitoring System (PEMS) is able to predict emission concentrations thanks to empirical or first principles models fed by real-time process data provided by measurement sensors. It follows that PEMS consistency (and, crucially, its acceptance from regulations-enforcing agencies) strictly depends on input accuracy and that reliable Sensor Validation (SV) strategies are fundamental. In this work, the capability of two different SV techniques, Feed Forward Neural Networks and Locally Weighted Regression, is tested exploiting a commercial software package (ABB's IMP) on actual field data from a fluid catalytic cracking unit. The results showed that both techniques are suitable as complement to PEMS applications, but Locally Weighted Regression results are preferable for performance, economic and <b>operating</b> <b>reasons...</b>|$|E

However, a regional airport authority was authorized by area voters in November 2008. The West Michigan Airport Authority consists of representatives from Holland, Zeeland, and Park Township.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although carbazole-containing {{copolymers}} {{are frequently}} used as hole-transporting host materials for polymer organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), they often {{suffer from the}} formation of undesired exciplexes when the OLED is <b>operated.</b> The <b>reason</b> why exciplexes sometimes form for electrical excita-tion, yet not for optical excitation is not well understood. Here, we use luminescence measurements and quantum chemical cal-culations to investigate the mechanism of such exciplex forma-tion for electrical excitation (electroplex formation) in a carbazole–pyridine copolymer. Our {{results suggest that the}} exci-plex is formed via a positively charged interchain precursor com-plex. This complex is stabilized by interactions that involve the nitrogen lone pairs on both chain segments. VC 2011 Wile...|$|R

50|$|HB1485, {{which was}} {{introduced}} by Rush and passed during the 2013 Legislative Session, is a proposal that would permit the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to postpone expiration of vehicle registrations if the DMV is unable to <b>operate</b> for <b>reasons</b> beyond its control. The postponement is then authorized by the Governor. This bill was utilized on January 30, 2015, when an internal power disruption temporarily interrupted DMV electronic services provided by the Commonwealth's data center. This disruption greatly impacted the ability of many Virginians to renew their driver's licenses and vehicle registration, which could have resulted in unnecessary fees for many drivers.
