5|$|According to a Wizards of the Coast article, Strahd {{has become}} one of the most infamous and {{well-known}} villains in the Dungeons & Dragons game, and he has appeared in a number of novels and rulebooks since his debut in Ravenloft. In an introduction to an online edition of RavenloftII, author John D. Rateliff described Strahd as a then-unusual fusion of a monster with the abilities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> character class; that is, a vampire magic-user. This design enables him to combine his own powers with the surrounding environment, making him a difficult opponent to defeat.|$|E

5|$|Feller {{was elected}} the inaugural {{president}} of the Major League Baseball Players' Association in 1956. As president, he appeared before Congress to speak about baseball's reserve clause. Feller was {{the first player to}} get a franchise to agree to a share of game receipts when he was the starting pitcher for Indians' games. He was also the earliest player to incorporate himself (as Ro-Fel, Inc.). He {{was also one of the}} first players to work for the right <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> to enter free agency.|$|E
5|$|SpaceChem was ported to the iPad in October 2011, using touch {{controls}} {{instead of}} mouse and keyboard {{to manipulate the}} visual program. An Android port was released in July 2012. Both mobile platforms include most of the full game excluding the defense puzzles. The sandbox mode was added at the request <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> {{who was trying to}} explore SpaceChem computational abilities. Alongside the sandbox mode, Zactronics offered a contest for the most interesting sandbox creation. This same user was able to demonstrate a brainfuck interpreter within SpaceChem, claiming that the visual programming language was Turing complete. Barth has mentioned the possibility of a sequel in an interview with IndieGamer.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{which acts}} as a {{companion}} to Type-0, was set {{in the world of}} Orience during a time of war between its four nations. The story is seen {{through the eyes of a}} player-created Cadet entering the Rubrum Magical Academy during a time of war, and chosen to become the Agito, a figure destined to save Orience from destruction. The original protagonists of Type-0 appear in different roles and act as secondary characters. The story was intended to be played repeatedly, tying into the nature of the game's world and the eventual culmination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> becoming the Agito.|$|E
50|$|Players {{must take}} control of certain points on the map. The more <b>of</b> these points <b>a</b> <b>player</b> controls, the more {{resources}} they acquire. This concept demands constant expansion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> territory. These points are connected like supply lines, and so, during the course <b>of</b> <b>a</b> battle <b>a</b> <b>player</b> can capture {{one point in the}} supply line, isolating the rest which had been connected to the base through it, therefore reducing the enemy's resource intake.|$|R

5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
5|$|In ODIs, {{there have}} been only 11 {{instances}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> carrying their bat. The first occasion was when Grant Flower made 84—in Zimbabwe's total of 205—against England in December 1994. The following year, Saeed Anwar became the first player to score an ODI century while carrying his bat; he made 103 against Zimbabwe in Harare. England's Nick Knight surpassed Anwar's score and went on to make 125 against Pakistan in 1996. , this remains a record in the ODI format. Australia's Damien Martyn and England's Alec Stewart are the only other players to score a century while performing this feat in ODIs. Sri Lanka's Upul Tharanga became the first cricketer from his team to carry the bat when he made 112 against Pakistan in October 2017. In T20Is, Chris Gayle is the only player to carry his bat, doing so against Sri Lanka during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, scoring 63 runs in West Indies' total of 101.|$|E

Host Shoko Nakagawa made note of how the player's Zoroark's sprite was a full body sprite as viewed from behind, when in the past all such sprites only showed a smaller portion of the player's Pokémon's body. On May 9, 2010, the episode of Pokémon Sunday revealed silhouettes of the three Pokémon available to choose from {{at the beginning of}} the games, which were later revealed to be the Grass Snake Pokémon Tsutarja, the Fire Pig Pokémon Pokabu, and the Sea Otter Pokémon Mijumaru. Other information revealed is that the game takes place in the Isshu Region which includes the Hiun City metropolis. On May 16, 2010, the episode of Pokémon Sunday showed game battle footage, illustrating the new in-battle animations and dynamic camera positioning; also described were Zoroark's Illusion ability and the special Zoroark acquired by the movie ticket pre-order gift Pokémon.|$|E

5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E

50|$|PER largely {{measures}} offensive performance. Hollinger freely {{admits that}} two of the defensive statistics it incorporates—blocks and steals (which was not tracked as an official stat until 1973)—can produce <b>a</b> distorted picture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> value and that PER is not <b>a</b> reliable measure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> defensive acumen. For example, Bruce Bowen, widely {{regarded as one of the}} best defenders in the NBA (at least through the 2006-07 season), has routinely posted single-digit PERs.|$|R
