5|$|Preceded by mixed Universal Carrier and {{motorcycle}} reconnaissance detachments, the 192nd and 193rd Regiments {{began moving}} to their designated areas after noon, and arrived there at nightfall. At this point, 192nd Regiment could muster only 295 men, while another 241 {{could not be}} moved by vehicle—presumably due to {{the large number of}} breakdowns and the lack of spare parts—and were ordered to proceed to Kilkis. Shortly after 17:00, about 45 German planes bombed the 192nd Regiment at the village of Theodorovo. Two officers and 15 men were killed, over 50 personnel were wounded, while two Carriers, ten Austins and ten motorcycles were destroyed, effectively destroying the 2nd <b>Open</b> <b>Tank</b> Company as a combat formation. Col. Sionidis' command, which was also in the village, suffered 13 dead and 45 wounded. Despite these losses, the 192nd Regiment reached its assigned positions, where it divided in two Resistance Centres: left, with the Tank Battalion and one of the 47mm anti-tank troops, and the right, with the Foot Battalion and a 20mm anti-tank troop. First German probing attacks during the night were successfully repelled. 193rd Regiment was more fortunate; it reached its deployment area without major obstacles, although a reconnaissance patrol clashed with the Germans near Kato Sourmena, and returned with a German prisoner. On the same evening, the division's 3.7cm Flak shot down a German reconnaissance plain over Krisia railway station, and reconnaissance patrols reported German infiltration along the entire line of the railway track between Mouries and Rodopoli. During the night, the division was allocated reinforcements from the 1st Security Battalion of Thessaloniki in the form of two infantry companies (one for each of the 192nd and 193rd Regiments), two MG squads and a 75mm battery. In order to reconstitute the 192nd Regiment's 2nd <b>Open</b> <b>Tank</b> Company, divisional command ordered the crews of the two Italian-equipped Closed Tank Companies to abandon their vehicles and help man the Universal Carriers. The Italian tanks were hence abandoned and took no part in the fighting, but the reorganization of the 2nd <b>Open</b> <b>Tank</b> Company was not completed until April 8. 191st Regiment was also ordered to send a squadron of its Tank Company to the Rupel Pass.|$|E

The cells grown in the open system had free lutein as the main carotenoid, with violaxanthin, β-carotene, and neoxanthin also present. Lutein content of the dry biomass ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 6 %, depending on the growth and environmental conditions. In addition, the biomass of Muriellopsis sp. had a high content in both protein and lipids with about half of the fatty acids being of the polyunsaturated type, with α-linolenic acid accounting for almost 30 % of the total fatty acids. The effect of determinant parameters on the {{performance of}} the cultures in <b>open</b> <b>tanks</b> was evaluated. Operating conditions that allow the maintenance of productive cultures were established under semicontinuous regime for 9 months throughout the year.

50|$|The {{less common}} open loop {{industrial}} chillers control {{the temperature of}} a liquid in an <b>open</b> <b>tank</b> or sump by constantly recirculating it.

In this case the condenser does not cool the hot refrigerant with ambient air, but uses water that is cooled by a cooling tower. This development allows a reduction in energy requirements by more than 15% and also allows a significant reduction {{in the size of the}} chiller, due to the small surface area of the water-based condenser and the absence of fans.

40|$|The {{survival}} of milkfish broodstock (body weight range 1 â€“ 11 kg) was determined until 30 days after handling and transport in <b>open</b> <b>tanks</b> or in sealed oxygenated bags containing chilled sea water (20 â€“ 25 Â°C). Maintenance of cool sea water {{was achieved by}} the gradual addition of ice chunks or frozen gel packs. A survival rate of 50 % after transporting fish at a loading density of 45 kg m âˆ’ 3 for 4 h in <b>open</b> <b>tanks</b> was {{not significantly different from}} those that were handled but not transported (86 %). Similarly, survival rates (67 â€“ 83 %) among broodstock confined for 8 h in chilled sea water at 40 and 60 kg m âˆ’ 3 were not significantly different from each other or from a group not subjected to confinement. Nevertheless, low dissolved oxygen (DO) and accumulation of total ammoniaâ€“nitrogen beginning 1 h after transport and confinement may be responsible for low survival rates of milkfish in <b>open</b> <b>tanks.</b> In contrast, all milkfish survived 10 h of overland transport in sealed bags with chilled and diluted (28 g L âˆ’ 1) sea water. Likewise, all milkfish survived after being bagged and immediately transferred to a communal rearing tank, or bagged and placed in a styrofoam box for 10 h. Except for total ammoniaâ€“nitrogen levels, which increased slightly (0. 7 â€“ 0. 8 mg L âˆ’ 1) above background, seawater temperature (20 â€“ 24 Â°C), salinity (28 g L âˆ’ 1) and DO (6 to >â€Š 20 mg mL âˆ’ 1) titres in transport bags were maintained during the 10 -h test. The effectiveness of handling and transporting milkfish broodstock in sealed bags containing chilled sea water was verified in actual field trials. Spawning of sexually mature milkfish subjected to these stressors was not impaired. These results demonstrate that mortalities of large milkfish broodstock can be minimized when fish are handled and transported in sealed oxygenated bags containing chilled sea water.
