5|$|Scheduled castes and tribes form 28.6% and 5.8% of the population, respectively, {{in rural}} areas, and 19.9% and 1.5%, respectively, in urban areas. A study {{conducted}} in three districts of West Bengal found that accessing private health services to treat illness had a catastrophic impact on households. This indicates {{the importance of}} public provision of health services to mitigate against poverty {{and the impact of}} illness <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> households.|$|E

5|$|The Man from London was {{the first}} of Tarr's films to premiere in {{competition}} at the Cannes Film Festival, but despite being highly anticipated, it won no prize. The French distributor blamed this <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> dubbing and a late showing, though the press were put off by the film's extended shots and leaden pace. After being re-dubbed, it was shown on the international film festival circuit.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E
5|$|In 1996 Chico left Sidley & Austin {{to become}} a senior partner of Altheimer & Gray. Oscar D’Angelo, a friend of Richard M. Daley and a former Altheimer partner, {{suggested}} to the firm’s managing partner that the firm hire Chico. In 2000, just four years later, at age 44, Chico became chairman of Altheimer. In 2002, the firm gave {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars to Governor Rod Blagojevich and Attorney General Lisa Madigan's campaigns. In 2003, while Chico was chairman and simultaneously running for the US Senate, Altheimer became insolvent and dissolved. Some partners blamed the bankruptcy <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> management by Chico, while an attorney who sat on two financial committees blamed an economic downturn.|$|E

5|$|The meat of Highland cattle {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. Highland cattle can produce beef at a reasonable profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Black cattle are the {{traditional}} breed of Wales. These hardy cows with horns and shaggy coats {{are able to}} thrive <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> quality pasture and moorland {{and can be used}} to provide both milk and beef. Large numbers were raised in Wales and herded on foot to be fattened in England for selling in English markets. On Welsh farms they were used to pull ploughs and sometimes wagons during the nineteenth century, and were the prized possessions by which a man's wealth could be estimated. Nowadays, many have been crossed with Charolais, Limousin or Hereford bulls but pure bred herds can still be found {{in many parts of the}} uplands.|$|E
50|$|Pinus virginiana (Virginia pine, scrub pine, Jersey pine) is a {{medium-sized}} tree, often found <b>on</b> <b>poorer</b> soils from Long Island in southern New York south through the Appalachian Mountains to western Tennessee and Alabama. The usual size range for this pine is 9-18 m, but can grow taller under optimum conditions. The trunk {{can be as}} large as 0.5 m diameter. This tree prefers well-drained loam or clay, but will also grow <b>on</b> very <b>poor,</b> sandy soil, where it remains small and stunted. The typical life span is 65 to 90 years.|$|R

5|$|A {{rapprochement}} {{between the}} two men was achieved in the winter of 1384, when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend, Jean Crespin, to celebrate the birth of his son. For the first time, Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris. Despite the tension between them, Carrouges and Le Gris shook hands and drank together, putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours. A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his influence with the Count, making substantial financial and territorial gains in the his rival's absence. Carrouges returned a year later, now a knight but bankrupt, ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign. When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend. Although it is not known what was said, the two men separated <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a state of agitation.|$|E
5|$|Begley {{obtained}} approvals {{to carry}} out excavations at the site {{in collaboration with the}} University of Pennsylvania and the University of Madras; she and K.V. Raman were the directors of operation from 1989 to 1992. Steven Sidebothom of the University of Delaware, who had back ground knowledge of Roman Egypt, {{was in charge of the}} trenching at the site. Further excavations were done during six working seasons from 1989 to 1992, which led to a contradictory view that the brick structures and the wells investigated by Wheeler were of poor quality as they were founded <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> sandy foundations. The wood work was also noted to be of poor quality and the houses had no waterproofing. The excavations also lead to a view that Arikamedu's Roman trading link was more of an inference. The excavations have now established that the trading with Rome extended to a period beyond that assessed by Wheeler; that trading continued from the second century BCE to the seventh or eighth century CE.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{and analysts}} deemed Windows RT to be commercially unsuccessful, citing these limitations, its unclear, uncompetitive {{position}} of sitting as an underpowered system between Windows Phone and Windows 8, {{and the introduction}} of Windows 8 devices with battery life and functionality that met or exceeded that of Windows RT devices. Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along with a decision by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began phasing out their Windows RT devices due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} who needed additional funds for education or vied for political office found farming as a decent profession which, although humble, was not {{looked down upon}} by fellow gentrymen. Wealthy nobles, officials, and merchants could own land, but they often did not cultivate it themselves and merely acted as absentee landlords while living in the city. They mostly relied <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> tenant farmers (diannong 佃農) who paid rent {{in the form of}} roughly fifty percent of their produce in exchange for land, tools, draft animals, and a small house. Wage laborers (gunong 雇農) and slaves were also employed on the estates of the wealthy, although they were not as numerous as tenants. During Western Han, the small independent owner-cultivator represented the majority of farming peasants, yet their economic struggle to remain independent during times of war, natural disaster and crisis drove many into debt, banditry, slavery, and dramatically increased the number of landless tenants by late Eastern Han. The social status of poor independent owner-cultivators was above tenants and wage laborers, yet below that of wealthy landowners. While wealthy landowners employed tenants and wage laborers, landowners who managed small to medium-sized estates often acted as managers over their sons who tilled the fields and daughters who weaved clothes and engaged in sericulture to produce silk for the home or sale at market.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens, {{like many}} {{mountain}} horses, is calm, docile and hardworking. The {{report of a}} comprehensive study on the heritability of the breed's temperament was published in Equ'idée in 2010. It is a versatile breed, and very hardy, able to live all year outside without suffering from the weather. Mérens {{are known for their}} endurance, agility and sure-footedness. They require very little care, and can survive <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> food, even when working. They are resistant to cold, but react poorly to heat. Mérens foals are often born in the snow, without human intervention, but are usually handled and accustomed to humans from an early age. They show increased resistance to the anticoagulant properties of some varieties of fern, the consumption of which can cause bloody sweats and blood in the urine in other horses.|$|E
5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> terms until Hooke's death.|$|E

5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was a best-seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank and honest statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, and went over the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was <b>on</b> <b>poor</b> terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E
