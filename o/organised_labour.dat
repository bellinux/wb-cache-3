5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as <b>organised</b> <b>labour</b> became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|The deepest rift in the Pankhurst {{family came}} in November 1913 when Sylvia {{spoke at a}} meeting of socialists and trade unionists in support of labour {{organiser}} Jim Larkin. She had been working with the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELFS), a local branch of the WSPU which had a close relationship with socialists and <b>organised</b> <b>labour.</b> The close connection to labour groups and Sylvia's appearance on stage with Frederick Pethick-Lawrence – who also addressed the crowd – convinced Christabel that her sister was organising a group that might challenge the WSPU in the suffrage movement. The dispute became public, and members of groups including the WSPU, ILP, and ELFS braced themselves for a showdown.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{assisted}} {{in the construction of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, including relocating indigenous communities living along the route. The force established a wide network of posts and patrols, enabling them to protect and assist the ranchers who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies. The living conditions of the police on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable, and only slowly improved over the course of the century. Meanwhile, the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west, creating new towns and industries, while the force restricted the First Nations to the reservations. The mounted police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation, especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to the white community. The force also became drawn into the growing number of industrial disputes between <b>organised</b> <b>labour</b> and company owners.|$|E

25|$|The Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920 {{produced}} the Constitution of 1917, which contained Article 123 that gave workers {{the right to}} <b>organise</b> <b>labour</b> unions and to strike.

50|$|As such, the new {{constitution}} created by SCAP granted {{civil and political rights}} to the people; consequently, leading to modernisation. It also allowed freedom of speech and association, right to <b>organise</b> <b>labour</b> association and movements, or create unions, and implemented grounds for incredible civil right for women.|$|R
5|$|The new {{industrial}} workforce often {{lived and}} worked under very poor conditions, and enjoyed few employment rights. Workers who left their jobs in protest could find themselves arrested by the mounted police {{under the terms of}} the Masters and Servants Act for deserting their employment, or alternatively detained under the vagrancy laws. Although the position of <b>organised</b> <b>labour</b> was weak in Canada – the trade unions only had very limited legal rights – the number of industrial disputes grew significantly over this period. The resulting lockouts and strikes sometimes required armed government intervention. The militia was most commonly used for this purpose, but the mounted police were cheaper to deploy and were considered to be more politically reliable.|$|E

50|$|VOC {{personnel}} lived {{separate to}} indigenous Indonesians, and Dutch people ranked low in indigenous status systems. As such, while the VOC introduced objects, techniques, corporate organisation into Indonesian society, {{its impact on}} Indonesian thinkers was minimal. Rather, {{at a time when}} Europe was denouncing autocratic rule, hierarchy and hereditary rights, the VOC borrowed these values from Indonesian societies. Governors-general acted like royalty and did not leave the enclaves they had established, and like Indonesian royalty, they employed the local nobility and Chinese agents to <b>organise</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|R
25|$|Pittoni {{joined the}} Social Democratic League, a Triestine {{branch of the}} SDAPÖ, and, by 1902, was {{involved}} in mediating between the socialists and <b>organised</b> <b>labour.</b> That year, he helped the senior socialist leader Carlo Ucekar in directing the Österreichischer Lloyd stokers strike, but lost control of it to anarchist agitators. The strike ended in bloodshed. The authorities were lenient toward the socialists, and willing to blame the strike on anarchists, but {{made a point of}} warning Pittoni to comply in the future.|$|E
25|$|Giolitti's {{policy of}} never interfering in strikes and leaving even violent demonstrations {{undisturbed}} at first proved successful, but indiscipline and disorder grew {{to such a}} pitch that Zanardelli, already in bad health, resigned, and Giolitti succeeded him as Prime Minister in November 1903. Giolitti’s prominent role in the years {{from the start of}} the 20th century until 1914 is known as the Giolittian Era, in which Italy experienced an industrial expansion, the rise of <b>organised</b> <b>labour</b> and the emergence of an active Catholic political movement.|$|E
25|$|The left-wing {{activities}} continued {{after the}} end of the war. The campaign for a 40-hour week, with improved conditions for the workers, took hold of <b>organised</b> <b>labour.</b> On 31 January 1919, a massive rally, organised by the trade unions, took place on George Square in the city centre of Glasgow. It has been estimated that as many as 90,000 people were present, and the Red Flag was raised in the centre of the crowd. The gathering descended into what is generally considered to have been a police riot, with the Riot Act being read, and attacks made on the strike leaders as they exited the City Chambers.|$|E
30|$|Dependent {{self-employment}} enables {{firms to}} benefit from flexibility while simultaneously shifting risk to the worker. In that respect, this form of <b>organising</b> <b>labour</b> is similar to temporary or agency work, as it makes the employment of labour more flexible and {{makes it possible for}} firms to operate more profitably. For workers, dependent self-employment can be seen as a chance to learn more about their skills, increase their entrepreneurial knowledge, and determine their preferences and risk attitudes. Much like temporary agency work, dependent self-employment can thus be interpreted as a stepping stone towards “genuine” self-employment.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{principles}} of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of <b>organised</b> <b>labour.</b> The ideal of the self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialisation and laissez-faire capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although socialism later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers – including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold – became early influential critics of social injustice.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{and down}} to the 15th century, Roma and Tatar slaves were all grouped into self-administrating sălaşe (Old Church Slavonic: челѣдь, čelyad) which were {{variously}} described by historians as being an extended family, a household or even a community. Their leaders, themselves slaves, were known as cneji, juzi or vătămani, and, in addition to sorting legal disputes, collected taxes and <b>organised</b> <b>labour</b> for the owners. With time, disputes between two Roma slaves were usually dealt by the community leaders, who became known as bulibaşi. Occasionally, the larger slave communities elected themselves a başbulibaşa, who was superior to the bulibaşi and charged with solving the more divisive or complicated conflicts within the respective group. The system went unregulated, often leading to violent conflicts between slaves, which, in one such case attested for the 19th century, led to boyar intervention and the foot whipping of those deemed guilty of insubordination.|$|E
25|$|However, in the meantime, MI5's role {{had been}} {{substantially}} enlarged. Due to the spy hysteria, MI5 had been formed {{with far more}} resources than it actually needed to track down German spies. As is common within governmental bureaucracies, this caused the service to expand its role, to use its spare resources. MI5 acquired many additional responsibilities during the war. Most significantly, its strict counter-espionage role blurred considerably. It became a much more political role, involving the surveillance not merely of foreign agents but also of pacifist and anti-conscription organisations, and of <b>organised</b> <b>labour.</b> This was justified through the common belief that foreign influence was {{at the root of}} these organisations. Thus, {{by the end of the}} World War I, MI5 was a fully-fledged investigating force (although it never had powers of arrest), in addition to being a counter-espionage agency. The expansion of this role continued after a brief post-war power struggle with the head of the Special Branch, Sir Basil Thomson.|$|E
5|$|Derwent Valley Mills is a World Heritage Site {{along the}} River Derwent in Derbyshire, England, {{designated}} in December 2001. It {{is administered by}} the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership. The modern factory, or 'mill', system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright. With advancements in technology, it became possible to produce cotton continuously. The system was adopted throughout the valley, and later spread so that by 1788 there were over 200Arkwright-type mills in Britain. Arkwright's inventions and system of <b>organising</b> <b>labour</b> was exported to Europe and the United States.|$|R
50|$|The new {{unionism}} of the 1890s {{was supported}} by the trades council, and many new unions affiliated during the 1890s, taking total membership to around 10,000. During this period, it supported a wide variety of industrial action, and convinced the city council to pay its workers at union rates. It affiliated to the Labour Representation Committee, and became the body <b>organising</b> <b>Labour</b> Party activity in Bristol until 1918. It suffered divisions during World War I, with Walter Ayles leading opposition to the war, while Frank Sheppard and William Whitefield led support for it. After extended debates, it decided to oppose conscription.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{occupation}} of United States, SCAP (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) was established, which was an institution in charge of formulating policies. The goal of SCAP was to dissolve the army and navy, and also to punish responsible leaders, and it established the New constitution of 1946. SCAP could not function without the assistance of Japanese government because the language barrier was too high. However, this actually helped make bigger changes in creating demilitarisation and democratisation. SCAP helped people to gain freedoms of speech, press {{and the right to}} <b>organise</b> <b>labour</b> or farmer unions.|$|R
25|$|The BEF's {{manpower}} shortage was {{not solely}} {{the fault of}} the politicians. 120,000 men of the BEF general reserve were kept in Britain to help the economy by spending their wages there. There were too many troops in the Middle East (2 divisions were rushed from there to France after the German offensive began), but this was partly the fault of Robertson who had attempted to prevent action there by submitting inflated estimates of troop requirements. 88,000 BEF men were on leave when the German offensive began. Haig seems to have had little sympathy with the government’s political constraints – he was unhappy at their lack of vigour in conscripting <b>organised</b> <b>labour</b> (diary 23 December 1917, 10 March), whilst as late as 29 March, following the first German Spring Offensive, Haig would press for the extension of conscription to Ireland (not just for military reasons but “for the good of Ireland”, and disagreeing with the King). Although there were about 1.5m soldiers under Home Forces Command in the UK at any one time, nearly a third of these were sick or wounded and another third engaged on legitimate work for various branches of the Army. Only around a third were potentially available for service on the Western Front, the majority of these being in training or under nineteen. Eighteen-year olds had to be sent to France after the German Spring Offensives in 1918.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 17th century silk making {{expanded}} due to demand for silk {{as part of}} fashionable garments. In an attempt to increase production {{through the use of}} water power, Thomas Cotchett commissioned engineer George Sorocold to build a mill near the centre of Derby on an island in the River Derwent. Although the experiment was unsuccessful, it convinced John Lombe– an employee of Cotchett– that if water power could be perfected there was a market for its produce. He engaged in industrial espionage and gained plans of Italian machines. He patented the design in 1719 and built a five-storey mill [...] next to Crotchett's mill. By 1763, 30years after Lombe's patent had expired, only seven Lombe mills had been built because the silk market was small, but Lombe had introduced a viable form of water powered machinery and had established a template for <b>organised</b> <b>labour</b> that later industrialists would follow.|$|E
500|$|The {{problems}} of industrial unrest continued to flare up, and the waterfront remained a flashpoint. In {{a review of}} the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1928, Bruce required industrial courts to consider the economic effects of its awards in addition to the welfare of worker. Immediate problems followed when a new award for waterside workers in 1928 worsened conditions for workers on economic grounds. New industrial action led by the Waterside Workers Federation broke out. In Melbourne these turned to riots, claiming casualties and at least one fatality. Reviving the [...] "red scare" [...] pitch for the 1928 election campaign, Bruce pushed the Transport Workers Act through parliament in response, which gave the executive unprecedented regulatory power in industrial relations. All waterfront workers now required federal licenses, or [...] "dog collars" [...] as they were derisively known, to work. The act allowed the Commonwealth government to effectively control who worked on the docks and nearly destroyed the Waterside Workers Federation, earning the government deep unpopularity among <b>organised</b> <b>labour.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the role of}} customers in service work has neglected work that does not involve significant face-to-face interaction, assuming it to be distant from customer influence and thus highly routinisable. This article uses ethnographic data from housekeeping and room service in two urban luxury hotels in the USA to look comparatively at how customers influence this work and its management. It argues that customers affect several non-interactive dimensions of these jobs, including timing, pace and effort. These effects also influence managerial strategies for <b>organising</b> <b>labour</b> processes, making routinisation impossible and shaping alternatives. These findings indicate the need for a reconceptualisation of customer influence in work. customers; hotels; labour process; routinisation; service work...|$|R
500|$|The 1918 {{parliament}} {{was dominated}} by Lloyd George's Liberal–Conservative coalition, which faced a fragmented and unorganised opposition. In May 1919 Bottomley announced the formation of his [...] "People's League", which he hoped would develop into a fully-fledged political party with a programme opposing both <b>organised</b> <b>labour</b> and organised capital. No mass movement emerged, but Bottomley joined with other Independent MPs to form the Independent Parliamentary Group, with a distinct policy stance including the enforcement of war reparations, the superiority of Britain over the League of Nations, exclusion of undesirable aliens, and [...] "the introduction of business principles into government". The group was reinforced through by-election victories of other Independents—including Charles Frederick Palmer, John Bulls deputy editor, until his premature death in October 1920. Bottomley was, {{at least for a}} year or so, a diligent parliamentarian who spoke on a range of issues, {{and from time to time}} teased the government as when, during the Irish Troubles, he asked whether, [...] "in view of the breakdown of British rule in Ireland, the government will approach America with a view to her accepting the mandate for the government of that country".

2500|$|Between 1750 and 1850, the English {{population}} nearly tripled, with {{an estimated}} increase from 5.7 million to 16.6 million, and all these people had to be fed from the domestic food supply. [...] This was achieved through intensified agriculture and land reclamation from the Fens, woodlands, and upland pastures. The crop mix changed too, with wheat and rye replacing barley. [...] Nitrogen fixing plants such as legumes led to sustainable increased yields. These increased yields, combined with improved farming machinery and then-new capitalist ways of <b>organising</b> <b>labour,</b> meant that increased crop production did not need much more manpower, which freed labour for non-agricultural work.
