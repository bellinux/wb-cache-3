[...] The titles featured design work by Cary Grazzini, and each featured an individual variation of the distinctive Dark Horse [...] "horse head," [...] an idea of Mike Richardson's to [...] "truly reflect... the spirit of independence that is Dark Horse Maverick." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nilsson {{was known}} for {{standing}} up to conductors. In a 1967 rehearsal of Die Walküre with Herbert von Karajan conducting, Nilsson responded to the gloomy lighting of the production by wearing a miner's helmet (complete with Valkyrian wings).

[...] When Georg Solti, in Tristan und Isolde, insisted on tempos too slow for Nilsson's taste, she made the first performance even slower, inducing a conductorial change of heart. After a tiff with Hans Knappertsbusch, Nilsson reported: [...] "He called me by a name that begins with [...] "A" [...] and ends with 'hole'".|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard says, [...] "all who {{are expecting}} do have <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> {{that they are}} expecting {{something}} in the future, because expectancy and the future are inseparable ideas." [...] But many people live in [...] "conflict with the future" [...] Yet, [...] "by the eternal, one can conquer the future, because the eternal is the ground of the future, and therefore through it the future can be fathomed. What, then, is the eternal power in a human being? It is faith. What is the expectancy of faith? Victory-or, as Scripture so earnestly and so movingly teaches us, that all things must serve for good those who love God." [...] Kierkegaard writes about expectancy once more in these discourses. Expectancy {{has to do with}} hope. [...] "The healthy individual lives simultaneously in hope and in recollection, and only thereby does his life gain true and substantive continuity. Thus he has hope and therefore does not wish to go backward in time, as do those who live only in recollection. What, then, does recollection do for him, for it certainly must have some influence? It places a sharp on the note of the moment; the further back it goes, the more often the repetition, the more sharps there are. For example, if in the present year he experiences an erotic moment, this is augmented by his recollection of it in the previous year etc. … Hope hovers over it as a hope of eternity that fills out the moment.|$|E

5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have <b>one</b> or more <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>common,</b> and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|R

6000|$|A second {{interesting}} circumstance is {{that this}} medieval age [...] produced two poets, Langland and Chaucer, who were more realistic [...] even than present-day writers in their portrayal of life, and who [...] together gave us such a picture of English society as no other [...] poets have ever equaled. Langland wrote his Piers Plowman in [...] the familiar Anglo-Saxon style for the common people, and pictured [...] their life to the letter; while Chaucer wrote his Canterbury [...] Tales, a poem shaped after Italian and French models, [...] portraying the holiday side of {{the middle and upper}} classes. [...] Langland drew a terrible picture of a degraded land, desperately in [...] need of justice, of education, of reform in church and state; [...] Chaucer showed a gay company of pilgrims riding through a [...] prosperous country which he called his [...] "Merrie England." [...] Perhaps [...] the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> with these two poets, the early types of [...] Puritan and Cavalier, was their attitude towards democracy.
