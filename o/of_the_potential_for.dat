5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable tubes, {{are reserved for}} when other methods fail because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> serious complications, which occur {{in as many as}} 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|The high {{temperatures}} and dew points created moderate instability across the outbreak area. CAPE values, a {{measurement of the}} level of tropospheric instability, were over 1000J/kg, and helicity levels, a measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> rotating winds, reached over 200m²/s². The upper level jet stream also contributed a large amount of wind shear. These factors were all indicative of a high potential for severe weather.|$|E

The Pakistani government also warned fishermen not to venture to the open seas, due to the uncertain effects of the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{transitioning}} into a post-tropical cyclone, Katia {{moved quickly}} across the North Atlantic and toward Europe, prompting the Met Office to begin warnings citizens for potential impacts over subsequent days on September9. Three days later, the organization raised a yellow severe weather alert {{for all of}} Ireland {{and most of the}} United Kingdom, with a more severe amber alert hoisted across Northern Ireland, the northernmost United Kingdom, and southern Scotland; both alerts warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> gale-force winds. Concurrently, Met Éireann outlined an extreme weather warning across Ireland, alerting residents to the potential for 130km/h (80mph) winds, downed trees, damaged buildings, and flooding. Irish ferries cancelled a number of its sails between Dublin and Holyhead. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute warned of gale-force winds along the coastline of Sweden, although a brunt of the rainfall was expected in neighboring Norway.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, but because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Hattie first posed {{a threat}} to the Yucatán Peninsula and British Honduras on October30 when it turned toward the area. Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. The {{warnings}} allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas. Most people in the capital, Belize City, were evacuated or moved to shelters, and a school was operated as a refuge. A hospital in the city was evacuated, and over 75% of the population of Stann Creek fled to safer locations. After Hattie made landfall, officials in Mexico ordered the closure of ports along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist in}} storm preparations, 105North Carolina National Guard members and 400state highway patrol {{officers}} helped facilitate evacuations and storm preparations along the state's coastline. Pamlico Sound ferry service was suspended, and various Independence Day activities rescheduled. Meanwhile, in Ocean City, Maryland, a celebratory fireworks event was postponed to July5, and in Boston, a Fourth of July Boston Pops concert and fireworks display were rescheduled to July 3. Fireworks displays were also postponed throughout Rhode Island. National Weather Service and Coast Guard officials warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> rip currents along the East Coast resulting from Arthur. The National Park Service-operated Wright Brothers National Memorial and Cape Lookout National Seashore were closed {{in anticipation of}} the storm. Several airlines waived change fees for travelers in areas affected by Arthur. Officials at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base sent more than 54aircraft to Dayton, Ohio to prevent the occurrence of potential wind damage. In Nantucket, Massachusetts, a school was converted to a temporary shelter in anticipation of Arthur's arrival.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{used his}} role in Parliament as a leading {{opposition}} MP to attack patents, a system he had already criticised as a judge. Historically, English patent law was based on custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents {{as a form of}} economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the Crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law concerning patents. To boost England's economy, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering letters of protection that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as a passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. This process continued for three centuries, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> raising revenue; a patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest {{as a result of the}} patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.|$|E

The French underwater association (Fédération Française d'Études et de Sports Sous-Marins) has produced a series of exercises using the tongue and soft palate to assist a diver in clearing their ears by these techniques. These recommendations were based on work done at the Médecine du sport, Bd st Marcel, Paris.|$|E

Undergraduate members, alumni advisors, national fraternities and University administration regularly collaborate on the shared goal of reducing risks. Self-policing by peer moderators and the incorporation of live-in adult mentors have been important tools in addressing this goal.|$|E
