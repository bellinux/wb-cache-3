5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility {{and the lack of}} disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} factors leading to low employment rate <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> physical <b>disability</b> in Tanzania. Specifically, it looked {{at how the}} education system cater for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> the treatment <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> at the workplace and identified environmental barriers <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> The work also determined the challenges facing <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> at the workplaces. The study findings showed that there were several factors which lead to low employment rate to <b>people</b> <b>with</b> physical <b>disability</b> in Tanzania which included poor implementation of the Policy of Special Education to <b>People</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disability,</b> social and environmental barriers, poor socio-economic status, poor public awareness towards disability, poor supervision and implementation of National Policy on Disability. Other factors reported by the respondents were (i) Social discrimination to disabled people, (ii) Social stigmatization towards <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> (iii) Lack <b>of</b> working facilities to <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> (iv) Low level of education to most <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> (v) Social misconception and myths toward <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> as well as, (vi) Social exclusion to <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in labor market.

40|$|The {{representation}} <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in {{the news}} media {{has been the focus of}} attention in Australia and beyond for many years.

40|$|Purpose: The Rapid Assessment of Disability (RAD) {{questionnaire}} {{was developed to}} provide governments and development agencies with an appropriate instrument to determine the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> within their target populations, and to design and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} disability inclusive activities in addressing their priorities and needs. The RAD {{questionnaire was}} developed using two conceptual frameworks: the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> (UNCRPD), and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Existing instruments were reviewed to inform the structure and content of the RAD questionnaire. The RAD questionnaire that was developed for field testing in Bangladesh comprised both a household questionnaire and a questionnaire for individuals within each household, with 5 sections: 1) Demographic information, 2) Assessment of functioning, 3) Awareness <b>of</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> 4) Well-being and quality of life, 5) Participation in the community. Methods: Prior to field-testing the RAD questionnaire in Bangladesh, a qualitative study was conducted to ensure the relevance of the questionnaire {{in the context of a}} developing country. In-depth interviews <b>with</b> 9 <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and a focus group of 8 parents of children <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> were conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Results: Qualitative findings highlighted factors relevant to the lives <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in Bangladesh, including discrepancies between the awareness and attainment <b>of</b> rights for <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> the wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and their families, as well as numerous barriers to full participation in their community. While the findings confirmed that the design and content of the questionnaire reflected all these aspects, some changes were made to the items in the questionnaire to ensure that it reflected the views <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> from the context of a developing country. Conclusions and Implications: This qualitative study was an important step in the development of the RAD questionnaire as it helped to achieve its aim - namely, to establish the prevalence of disability and to assist in the design and evaluation of disability inclusive interventions in the setting of a developing country...|$|R

500|$|In contrast, the {{narrative}} surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media's focus on stereotyped portrayals {{of the heroic}} and extraordinary achievements <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor Alan Toy noted [...] "Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement.

Do {{we have to be}} 'supercrips' in order to be valid? And if we're not super, are we invalid?" [...] The media's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the social model of disability, where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Diversion {{from the}} {{criminal}} justice system pursuant to s 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) is increasingly being deployed as a key response to the issues facing <b>people</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> cognitive impairment and/or mental illness in {{the criminal justice}} system. The ‘medical model’ of disability, which is focused on disability as an internal, individual pathology, contributes to the marginalisation <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> notably by providing a legitimate basis for the legal and social regulation <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> through therapeutic interventions. The scholarly field of critical disability studies contests the medical model by making apparent the social and political contingency of disability, including the intersection of <b>disability</b> <b>with</b> other dimensions of politicised identity (such as gender and Indigeneity) and the role of law and institutions (including {{the criminal justice system}}) in the disablement, marginalisation and criminalisation <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> Applying critical disability studies to s 32 problematises the characterisation of the legal subject with diagnosed impairment and this provides a new basis for questioning the coercion <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> through the criminal justice intervention of diversion. An empirical analysis of the diagnostics, demographics and criminal justice pathways of a sample of individuals who have received s 32 orders provides some material foundations for a more politically and socially directed analysis of s 32 and for a broader reflection {{on the role of the}} criminal law in issues facing <b>people</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> cognitive impairments and mental illness in the criminal justice system...|$|R
