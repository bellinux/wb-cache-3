25|$|The {{service to}} Horsham was {{neglected}} {{for some years}} during the 1980s with a shuttle service between Dorking and Horsham operating every two hours at <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> times. The service now provided is one train an hour through from London to Horsham, (headcode 84). The <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> service of two trains from London Bridge to Horsham via Sutton and Dorking ran {{for a number of}} years from about 1985 but had ceased by 2000. The former Horsham to Waterloo via Dorking North trains (headcode 15) ceased as early as 1980.|$|E

25|$|PHEVs {{and fully}} {{electric}} cars may allow for more {{efficient use of}} existing electric production capacity, much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time. This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology known as charge control to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads. This is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology. By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities {{as well as their}} owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime, and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the south}} the {{services}} divide: main-line trains run through London Bridge to East Croydon and Brighton, {{but the other}} route has a more convoluted history. In 1988–91 trains went via Bromley to Orpington and Sevenoaks, and via Herne Hill and East Croydon to Purley (<b>off</b> <b>peak</b> only). Later, non-Brighton trains ran via Elephant & Castle and Streatham to West Croydon, Carshalton Beeches, Sutton, Epsom, Leatherhead and Effingham Junction, to Guildford.|$|E

25|$|There was one unusual {{occurrence}} of a station having to close because of excessive demand. The tiny halt at Eden between Carrickfergus and Kilroot had platforms that were barely one coach long yet about one hundred passengers were forcing themselves {{on to it}} at the morning peak. There was a danger that some would be swept off by non-stop trains and the halt was closed. Later, Eden was reopened for some <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> services.|$|E
25|$|However, as the {{adoption}} of electric cars, such as the French Renault Fluence Z.E., over internal combustion engine vehicles increases, reducing fossil fuel dependence, France's comparatively cheap peak and <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> electricity prices could act as a strong customer incentive that may spur the speed of {{the adoption}} of electric vehicles, essentially turning the current perceived glut of relatively cheap fission-electricity into an asset, as demand for electric vehicle recharging stations becomes more and more commonplace.|$|E
25|$|Gas can be {{temporarily}} {{stored in}} the pipeline system itself, through a process called line packing. This is done by packing more gas into the pipeline {{by an increase in}} the pressure. During periods of high demand, greater quantities of gas can be withdrawn from the pipeline in the market area, than is injected at the production area. The process of line packing is usually performed during <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> times to meet the next day’s peaking demands. This method, however, only provides a temporary short-term substitute for traditional underground storage.|$|E

25|$|Seven four-car trains {{operated}} the line (six off-peak, seven during peak hours when Shoreditch was open). <b>Off</b> <b>peak,</b> train seven became the spare. The line operated {{some of the}} shortest trains on the network, necessitated by short platforms. The small number of trains made the line particularly sensitive to disruption caused by vandalism, train faults or staff shortages. Sometimes in the early 2000s only two trains were running. Trains were operated by just a driver: the decision to withdraw the guards prompted an unsuccessful strike by the National Union of Railwaymen in May 1985.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2009, it was {{announced}} that patronage had steadily increased and that the service was thriving with 25.5% more passengers over the previous year, and that additional carriages had been added to the train in some cases to satisfy demand. KiwiRail also announced that as a result, services would be extended to daily during the July school holidays, and the general peak season timetable extended to more than seven months each year. The service then became seven days a week from September through to May, with the winter <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> May to September being Friday, Saturday and Sunday.|$|E
25|$|Vehicle licence {{plates in}} Singapore {{are the same}} 520mm x 110mm size found in many European countries.

Since the end of January 2010, off-peak car usage is no longer restricted on Saturday, Sunday, and the days before public holidays. Off-peak licence plates cost less than regular ones. Standard licence plates in Singapore are usually black with silver or white lettering or the newer white front/yellow rear plate combination and Off-peak licence plates are white on red.|$|E

OC Transpo 94, a high frequency rapid transit route, serves Riverview station in the southbound direction and continues northward to Millennium station in Avalon.

25|$|Power to gas is a {{technology}} which converts electrical {{power to a}} gas fuel. There are 2 methods, {{the first is to}} use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. The second (less efficient) method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane, (see natural gas) using electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction. The excess power or <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen Fuel cell maker Hydrogenics and natural gas distributor Enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline in}} {{services}} {{on the line}} began on 24 November 1930 when non-peak through services to the city were ended. Off-peak the line operated as shuttle from Hawthorn, using a single ABM Swing Door motor car, every 15 minutes on weekdays and every 20 minutes on Sundays. This had {{a negative effect on}} patronage as people found changing trains inconvenient. On 29 November 1937 through services were eliminated during afternoon peak, with the train paths taken by services on the line to Ashburton (today's Alamein line). Bus substitution <b>off</b> <b>peak</b> begun on 5 June 1939 due to still falling patronage, with a local shuttle train operating from Hawthorn during peak hours and on Sunday mornings. By October 1939 the Sunday morning trains were also cut.|$|E
