5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E

5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E
5|$|Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no {{relation}} to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator. They {{were accused of}} accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> Both men denied all charges. Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there {{at some point during}} the day. No Matabele witness recognised either of them at the court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{announcements}} {{concerning the}} three titles, Operation Rainfall {{came into existence}} {{in an effort to}} persuade Nintendo to bring the titles to North America. Xenoblade Chronicles and The Last Story were chosen for their pedigree, while Pandora's Tower was selected due to its unique mechanics {{and the fact that it}} was also published by Nintendo for the Wii. The team also decided on the titles as they were already confirmed for an English release in Europe and had received critical acclaim in Japan, so they avoided trying to push for the release of critically and commercially unsuccessful games such as Earth Seeker. The campaign's title stemmed from the group's wish to inundate Nintendo of America with requests. Beginning in June 2011 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> boards of gaming site IGN, it was met with support from the gaming community. Its campaign was spread across letters and emails to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé, in addition to campaigns on Facebook and Twitter. Both physical and digital mediums were chosen for the campaign to make them more obvious and less able to be deleted, as a purely digital campaign would have been. To this end, letters and objects inspired by the titles were sent to Nintendo of America.|$|E

25|$|By this time, Taylor's {{relationship}} with Khánh had already broken {{down over the}} issue of the HNC, and the U.S. became more intent on a regime change as Khánh was reliant on Buddhist support, which they saw as an obstacle to an expansion of the war. Knowing that he was close to being forced out, Khánh tried to start negotiations with the communists, but this only increased the plotting. In early February, Taylor told Kỳ, who then passed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> to colleagues in the junta, that the United States was “in no way propping up General Khanh or backing him in any fashion.” Taylor thought his message had been effective.|$|E
25|$|All of the Society's {{publications}} now had {{a substantial}} international circulation; in 1973, for example, just 11% of institutional subscriptions were from the UK; 50% were from the USA. Contributions, however, were still mostly from British authors: 69% of Royal Society authors were from the UK in 1974. A Publications Policy Committee suggested that more overseas scientists could be encouraged to submit papers if the requirement to have papers communicated by Fellows was dropped. This did not happen until 1990. There was also a suggestion to create a ‘C' journal for molecular sciences to attract more authors in that area, but the idea never materialised. The conclusion in 1973 was a general appeal to encourage more British scientists (whether Fellows or not) to publish papers with the Society and to pass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> to their overseas colleagues; by the early 2000s, the proportion of non-UK authors had risen to around a half; and by 2009 it had passed 70%.|$|E

That same day Obrenović overheard a call for two engineers to be released from battle lines to build a road; suspicious of someone doing the engineers a favor, Obrenović checked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> and was told that the engineers were needed in Zvornik because of a task being carried out by Beara, Popović, and Nikolić. Obrenović knew that this must involve mass burials; he released the two engineers and ordered his aides to refrain from discussing the issue. Throughout the next days, Obrenović {{spent most of his time}} trying to find a solution for the column problem, but he also released further military police and infantry personnel from battle lines to assist with the execution of prisoners, and supplied earth moving machinery from his engineering battalions to dig mass graves.|$|E

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E

Prior to the film's release, Bramantyo consulted about twenty people, including several religious leaders, in an attempt to ensure that the film was not offensive.

500|$|With {{the help}} from system {{developers}} at QZ, the three {{set up their}} game – at the time just titled Stuga ("Cottage") – on Oden in 1978, and created the message board Thorvalds stugråd ("Thorvald's cottage council") for it; scientists working at QZ played the game, {{and were able to}} discuss it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> board. The developers participated in the discussions, and used the message board to find information about bugs in the game. The Eriksson brothers and Johansson used a single Texas Silent Writer computer terminal in the Erikssons' parents' bedroom to program the game, through which they could log into Oden. Connecting to Oden was expensive, so they sometimes visited KTH during the evening to work on the game, as Oden only cost money to use during the day. At KTH, they had access to one terminal each, which used actual monitors to display text, as opposed to their writer terminal at home which printed the text on [...] "enormous amounts of paper".|$|E

500|$|Critics have commented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> in the lyrics. Anderson noted a dark theme, while Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Allie Townsend of Time {{magazine}} and Jocelyn Noveck of The Associated Press suggested the previous relationships of both artists influenced the song. Levine gave it four stars out of five. According to Eric Hayden of The Atlantic Wire, the song {{refers to an}} alcoholic couple, possibly inspired by Rihanna's relationship with Brown. McAlphine awarded [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] four stars out of five. According to him, the song {{would not have been}} effective if it had featured only Eminem's point of view and feelings of regret; he wrote that Rihanna's representing {{the opposite side of the}} relationship shows [...] "proper storytelling" [...] and [...] "sends a message" [...] because of her breakup with Brown. McAlphine wrote that as a result the song depicts a more realistic abusive relationship and could be featured in a campaign for women's shelters. He praised Eminem's accuracy and understanding of the topic. Winston Robbins from Consequence of Sound attributed the song's poignancy to Rihanna's past abusive relationship, and a theme of infidelity and abuse.|$|E

Marc Hogan of Spin magazine commented that the visual expanded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> of the song, and deemed it a [...] "powerful piece of work". Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger wrote in his review of the song that its [...] "brutal" [...] music video took the critique of perfection and physical beauty further than what the track did. [...] Brandon Sodeber of the magazine Vice called the visual the best on Beyoncé and opined that it was [...] "an incredibly affecting mini-melodrama that underlines to Beyoncé's painful awareness that being black and female means you're never enough of something or other for mainstream America". However, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the video sent mixed messages. Brent DiCrescenzo from Time Out complimented Keitel's appearance in the clip, but criticized the visual's message because he felt that it came from [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} women in the world".|$|E
