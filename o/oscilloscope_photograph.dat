40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{attempts to}} improve the satellite range measurements obtained with a laser ranging system. The transmitted and received ranging pulses were displayed on an <b>oscilloscope</b> and <b>photographed.</b> The pulse images were measured and the measurement data analyzed by computer. The range errors are reduced by utilizing information contained in {{the shapes of the}} return pulses. The problem of determining the center of the irregular return pulse is discussed. The results of the investigation show that the corrections made from the <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>photographs</b> improve the accuracy of the range measurements...|$|R

Impact ionization signal response was measured in a time-of-flight (TOF) system for lanthanum hexaboride, carbonyl iron, and aluminum microparticle impacts on a tantalum target, primarily in the 1 - 8 km/s velocity range. <b>Oscilloscope</b> <b>photographs</b> of representative ion TOF signal response are given for each material studied. Graphs and histograms are presented of the total charge collected as well as the charge collected in each observed ion mass group.

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple flexural vibration test is developed for accurate {{measurement of the}} low-strain dynamic modulus and damping capacity of B/Al composite bar specimens from - 200 C to over 500 C. The specimens are prepared from 8 -ply unidirectional panels containing 50 volume percent fibers composed of 203 -micron commercial boron-on-tungsten fibers. The basic test technique consists of the forced flexural vibration of the composite bar specimens at their two lowest free-free symmetrical resonant modes in a high-vacuum cryostat furnace. Specimen damping is determined from <b>oscilloscope</b> <b>photographs</b> of the free decay obtained after simultaneously removing the resonant drive signal and grounding the vibration-drive electrode. The availability of time-temperature dynamic data coupled with the predictive accuracy of composite theory suggests a future potential for using such data in examining environmental effects on composite macrostructure and microstructure...|$|R

This was accomplished {{through the use of}} a light measurement technique and a test unit designed and constructed at the United States Naval Postgraduate School. Both the method and the test unit are discussed in detail. The cases of a film between surfaces with and without relative motion were investigated.

40|$|Reducing {{the cost}} of medical care should be the goal of all persons {{responsible}} for health care de livery. In nuclear medicine, {{a reduction in the}} costs of film and scan storage would be {{a step in the right}} direction. Minification of scintillationimagesoffers economic advantages without discernible loss of diag nosticability (1, 2). While the oscilloscopepresenta tion of data from the Anger camera lends itself to â€œminifiedâ€•film formats,data output from the recti linear scanner has usually been presented on 14 X 17 -in. x-ray film regardless of whether the image was minified or life-size. The output of a rectilinear scanner has been dis played on an <b>oscilloscope</b> and <b>photographed</b> on 35 -mm film (1). However, an attempt to accom push this by connecting a display oscilloscope in parallel with the storage scope of our scanner proved unsatisfactory because of an unstable Xâ€”Ysignal. We have madea simple relatively cheap modification of the Ohio-Nuclear dual-probe scanner (Solon, Ohio) which gives a stable positioning signal. The output of the scanner is displayed on an <b>oscilloscope</b> and <b>photographed</b> using an open-shuttered 4 X 5 -in. scope camera. MATERIALS AND METHODS The power supply to the positioning potentiom eters of the Ohio-Nuclear scanner was disconnected and replaced by one using two rechargeable nickel cadmium â€œDâ€•cells (Fig. 1). These batteries are re charged each weekend and furnish a stable position ing voltage. The Xâ€”Yinputs of the Tektronix Model 602 display oscilloscope were connected in parallel with the inputs to the scanner's storage scope. The z signalforthedisplayscopewasobtainedfromthe input to the scanner switch used to select the signal from the lower probe for display (Fig. 2). The signa...|$|R
40|$|The {{apparatus}} described {{is designed}} to measure relative illumination of finite conjugate lenses with comparable accuracy and reliability than existing methods and provides a graphical output with less time expended for data acquisition. An opto-mechanical scanning system is utilized for transmitting light pulses from known image field positions to a photomultiplier tube. The light pulses are transmitted to the phototube via an optical system consisting of an array of lucite rods (light pipes) positioned in the image plane of the lens under test. The rods terminate at a cylindrical housing which contains a rotating lens prism assembly which scans {{the end of each}} lucite rod in sequence and relays the illumination values to the photomultiplier. The output current of the tube is displayed on a cathode ray tube <b>oscilloscope</b> and <b>photographed.</b> Data obtained with this apparatus were compared to data obtained using photographic photometry. Results indicate that the apparatus is very repeatable and that data aquisition time is significantly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Very rapid measurements, {{ranging from}} a few {{microsecond}} to milliseconds in duration, characterize studies made in shock regions or behind them. A system to measure gas density under such conditions in a 15. 24 -cm (6 -in.) expansion tube is described. The basic elements are an electron beam of moderate energy and high current capability, an optical detector, and the associated electronics and data readout equipment. A heated-cathode electron gun, capable of pulsed operation and delivering up to 200 milliamperes current, provides the source of electrons. Optics include a simple collector lens, aperture, collimator lens, filters, and a photomultiplier tube.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the electrophysiological and contractile responses of isolated rabbit heart papillary muscles, to plasma {{from the blood}} of rabbits suffering prolonged hypovolemic shock (SP) and compared the production of oxygen free radicals and nitric oxide (NO) released {{as a result of}} the hypovolemic shock. Papillary muscles removed from the right heart ventricle of 11 rabbits, superfused in an organ bath with oxygenated (95 % O 2 + 5 % CO 2) Tyrode solution at 37 °C were stimulated at a constant rate (1 Hz). The action potentials (Aps) and contractions of papillary muscles were simultaneously recorded on a storage <b>oscilloscope</b> and <b>photographed.</b> SP exerted a time-dependent intense negative inotropic effect on the papillary muscles accompanied by depression of the +Vmax and prolongation of the fast and slow action potential duration in the late stages. The effects of SP were reversible, to a large extent, when the extracellular calcium concentration was increased from 1. 8 to 3. 6 and 5. 4 mM, or after washout. The recovery was completed within 15 min. Furthermore, NO levels increased by 50 times and SP antioxidant capacity declined by 50 % These results indicate that SP in hypovolemic shock contained humoral factors that: (a) promotes the pro duction of oxygen free radicals and NO, (b) acts an oxidative stress-induced alteration in the selectivity of the calcium channels inhibiting capacitative calcium entry or enhances endoplasmatic reticulum calcium uptake in cardiac cells, (c) effects in a direct way on voltaged gated potassium channels or indirect through the calcium activated potassium channels. The neutralisation of NO by superoxide O 2 -) leads to the formation of the noxious oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO-) that may be responsible for the observed excitation-contraction uncoupling...|$|R

An airborne telephotometric device (haze recorder) is now being constructed at the Boston University Physical Research Laboratory to collect the data necessary {{for a study of}} atmospheric haze. It is expected that this present study will indicate the existence of correlations between haze light intensity and parameters significant in aerial photography. The purpose of this thesis is the provide an operational plan including data reduction and preliminary analysis for the first exploratory test flights. 	The haze recorder is being constructed to measure up-welling light intensity in a narrow path from horizon through nadir to horizon. The plane of this sweep rotates in 450 intervals relative to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, and a filter wheel synchronized with the sweep from horizon to horizon passes light alternately through blue, green, and red filters. Thus a three-dimensional plot of up-welling light is formed for each of three spectral ranges. A photomultiplier tube transforms this intensity into an electrical signal which, after amplification, is displayed on an <b>oscilloscope</b> tube and <b>photographed.</b> 	[TRUNCATED...|$|R
