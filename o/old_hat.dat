5|$|Although Littleprincessemma, American Pharoah's dam, is the {{half-sister}} to graded stakes winner Storm Wolf, and to Misty Rosette, {{winner of}} the <b>Old</b> <b>Hat</b> Stakes in 2006, her own undistinguished racing career, combined with the modest record of her sire, Yankee Gentleman, dampened initial public expectations for her second-born foal. Yet American Pharoah's maternal bloodline includes Storm Cat, a Grade I winner retired early due to injury, Northern Dancer, a Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, and Terlingua, a celebrated broodmare, through whom he is a fifth-generation descendant of Secretariat. He is also descended through his dam from Flying Paster, a Grade I champion who was 1978 California Horse of the Year, and Exclusive Native (sire of Affirmed and Genuine Risk). Through both sire and dam, American Pharoah is a fifth- and sixth-generation descendant of Bold Ruler, {{as well as a}} sixth- and seventh-generation descendant of Tom Fool, one of the top thoroughbreds of the last century. His tail-female line traces back to The Oldfield Mare, foaled circa 1695.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. I mean, {{if you were going}} to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, it would have been nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty <b>old</b> <b>hat</b> for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E

I had the control panel in front of me, it's <b>old</b> <b>hat</b> now but we were the first to do it. There were pieces of rubber with silver paper on the back with a silver coil that moved up and down inside a magnet that produced a signal, so it was touch sensitive. I had 5 snares across the top and then ten tom-toms and then a whole octave of bass drums underneath my feet and then four lots of 16 sequencers, two on each side. There was a gap — to play a space — a tambourine, ebony stick, snare and three tom-toms. This was pre-chip days, back then you did it all with transistors. So it had something like 500 transistors. The electronic drums inside looked something like spaghetti. When it worked it was superb, but it was before its day, because it was so sensitive..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{aspects of}} training, management, and {{characteristics}} of a horse used to pull a vardo are unique. For example, the horse is trained not to stop until it reaches {{the top of a}} hill; otherwise it {{may not be able to}} get started again. Training begins at a very early age with the young horse tied [...] "with a short rope from the head to the trace-ring on the collar of the shaft-horse", and led along on the off side. An <b>old</b> <b>hat</b> is sometimes placed on a fearful horse's head so as to keep him from seeing back over the top of his blinkers at the wagon looming at his back. A horse used to pull a vardo which was a permanent home was usually in very good condition due to a combination of exercise, grazing a variety of greens in the hedgerows, and good quality care; the horse was considered part of the family. Since the family's children lived in close proximity to the horse, one having [...] "an unreliable temper could not be tolerated".|$|E
