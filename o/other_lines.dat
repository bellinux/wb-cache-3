5|$|The line shares tracks {{with the}} Green Line from L'Enfant Plaza northward to Fort Totten. It {{is a quick}} link between {{downtown}} Washington and National Airport, and shares nearly all of its track with either the Green or Blue Line. The Yellow Line has only two stations that are not shared by any <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> (Eisenhower Avenue and Huntington), and only two sections of track that are not shared by any <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> – the section {{at the south end}} of the line, and the section between the Pentagon and L'Enfant Plaza stations, crossing the Potomac.|$|E
5|$|BART {{has five}} rapid transit lines; most of each line's length {{is on track}} shared with <b>other</b> <b>lines.</b> Trains on each line run every 15 minutes on weekdays and 20 minutes during evenings, {{weekends}} and holidays; stations on the section of track between Daly City and West Oakland are served by four lines and therefore see 16 trains an hour on each track.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{northern}} and southern segments of the US395 corridor were used by railroads built in the 1880s branching from the First Transcontinental Railroad in Nevada.

5|$|The Rock Island Railroad {{built the}} first {{railroad}} bridge across the Mississippi River in 1856. It connected Davenport to Rock Island, Illinois. This railway connection resulted in significant improvements to transportation and commerce with Chicago, a booming 19th-century city. The addition of new railroad lines to Muscatine and Iowa City, and the acquisition of <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> by the Rock Island Railroad, resulted in Davenport becoming a commercial railroad hub.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{existing}} line had been upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, {{operation of the}} Brill Tramway {{was taken over by}} London's Metropolitan Railway and Brill became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.|$|E
5|$|BART service begins around 4:00 am on weekdays, 6:00 am on Saturdays, and 8:00 am on Sundays. Service ends {{every day}} near midnight with station closings timed {{to the last}} train at station. Two of the five lines, the Warm Springs/South Fremont–Daly City and Richmond–Daly City/Millbrae lines, do not have evening (after ~6:00p.m. and ~9:00p.m., respectively) or Sunday service, but all {{stations}} remain accessible by transfer from the <b>other</b> <b>lines.</b> The Coliseum–Oakland International Airport AGT line runs every 6 minutes, with approximately the same operating hours as the five rapid transit lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 and 1904, the Trunk Line was {{upgraded}} to double track. The section from Drammen to Kongsberg was converted to standard gauge on 1 November 1909. Between 1917 and 1920, dual gauge was laid between OsloV and Drammen, and from 13 November 1922, the Drammen Line was entirely operated with standard gauge. The first electrification of NSB's lines {{was put into}} service on 26 October 1922 on the Drammen Line between OsloV and Brakerøya. The section from OsloV to Sandvika was {{upgraded to}} double track on 26 November 1922. From 1922, NSB introduced El 1-hauled passenger trains on the Drammen Line, and later <b>other</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began {{automating}} the subway by Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). CBTC supplements, rather than replaces, the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate closer together. The BMT Canarsie Line, {{on which the}} L train runs, was chosen for pilot testing {{because it is a}} self-contained line that does not operate in conjunction with <b>other</b> <b>lines.</b> CBTC became operational in February 2009. Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the block system. The total cost of the project was $340 million.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth F.C., the city's {{professional}} football club, play their home games at Fratton Park. The city has several mainline railway stations that connect to London Waterloo amongst <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> in southern England. Portsmouth International Port is a commercial cruise ship and ferry port for international destinations. The port {{is the second}} busiest in the United Kingdom after Dover, handling around three million passengers a year. The city formerly had its own airport, Portsmouth Airport, until its closure in 1973. The University of Portsmouth enrols 23,000 students and is ranked among the world's best modern universities. Portsmouth is also the birthplace of author Charles Dickens and engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel.|$|E
5|$|The move 4.a3 allows White {{to avoid}} the {{annoying}} bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider it to be White's best move, with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? {{to be the best}} answer, one point being that Qd1–c2, so effective in most of the <b>other</b> <b>lines,</b> can be met by Bc8–b7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares. Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead, while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White.|$|E

5|$|A few <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> {{have been}} tried, {{with the outcome}} varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 Colonial Parliament passed The Railway Construction Act, which {{authorised}} fifty-nine {{new lines}} to almost {{every corner of}} the colony, and thus became known as the Octopus Act. The proposed lines would serve both new agricultural towns and support suburban land speculation. It was also this decade that the first narrow gauge line was opened from Wangaratta to Whitfield, with three <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> following by 1910. The South Gippsland line was also opened from Dandenong to Leongatha by 1891. However, by the late 1890s the majority of the colony was now covered in railways, {{with the exception of the}} Mallee country in the north west of the colony which saw further line openings, such as the Mildura line in 1903.|$|E

5|$|In November 1970, the Dovre Line was electrified, and {{the last}} steam {{locomotives}} were retired. A long-term plan to electrify half the lines was finished, and for two decades, NSB's operations were very stable with no major investments to infrastructure or closing of lines. NSB had slightly less diesel locomotives than they needed, but plans to order additional Di 3 was never fulfilled. In 1981, NSB took delivery of five Di 4 to supplement the older units. They were mainly used on the Nordland Line, and Di 3 units were predominantly used on the <b>other</b> <b>lines,</b> although they continued to operate som trains on the Nordland Line. On 1 April 1987, a Di 3 612 caught on fire; the damage was small enough {{that it could have}} been repaired, but NSB instead decided to put aside the unit. At the time NSB planned to order additional Di 4, but these plans were put on hold. In 1988, the Valdres Line was closed; this was the only time a line with Di 3 in regular service was closed.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, the {{president}} of SBASE highlighted plans for 2015–2019 on the Underground at a conference with other South American mass transit operators in Brazil. One of the largest changes to be made during this period is the upgrading of signalling systems on all lines, {{with the exception of}} Line E. Lines A and B are to receive Automatic Train Operation systems, replacing their ATS and ATP systems respectively, whilst lines C, D and H are to receive Communications Based Train Control systems. The implementation of these systems was already under way on Lines C and H as of September 2015, and is due to be completed on <b>other</b> <b>lines</b> before 2019. Line D is also te receive platform screen doors along with the CBTC system.|$|E
5|$|Initially, all trains on {{the line}} were hauled by steam locomotives, in {{particular}} NSB Class 20 and NSB Class 21 brought in used from <b>other</b> <b>lines.</b> The first diesel multiple units were taken into use in the 1930s, with the line seeing the use of both NSB Class Cmb 16 and Kristine Valdresdatter. During World War II, the line was again entirely hauled by steam locomotives and the service was reduced considerably. By 1945, there were three round trips per week, but after the war ended, the frequency increased and by 1947 there were four daily round trips. Various classes of multiple units have been used, including NSB Class 86, NSB Class 87 and NSB Class 91. During the 1950s, there were sometimes also trains that operated just from Kongsberg to Veggli.|$|E
