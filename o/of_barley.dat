5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked about the quality <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> crops to ensure adequate supply {{for the production of}} beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E
5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout. The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. Each year, six million litres of GFE are made using 9,000 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s. In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, Waterford, but in 2013 production returned to St James's.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century {{saw many}} {{changes in farming}} on Shapinsay. Mechanised {{implements}} came to the island, particularly after the Second World War. In common {{with the rest of}} Orkney, the amount of land given over to growing grass increased. The growing of grain (with the exception <b>of</b> <b>barley)</b> and turnips steadily declined as these were replaced as winter fodder for livestock by silage, usually harvested by mechanical forage harvesters.|$|E

5|$|Barley himself {{published}} {{four books}} under his patent. In March 1612, one <b>of</b> <b>Barley's</b> servants died, possibly from plague. After receiving charitable remuneration from the Stationers' Company, Barley moved, {{first to the}} parish of St Katherine Cree, and later to a house on Bishopsgate. Records from St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate indicate his burial on 11 July 1614. His widow, Mary, and their son, William, were legatees of the will <b>of</b> Pavier. Mary <b>Barley,</b> who later remarried, transferred five of her husband's patents to printer John Beale.

5|$|There {{are some}} {{variations}} in the foods that are eaten around the different areas of Wales. These variations trace their roots back to medieval cooking. Ingredients were historically limited by what could be grown; the wetter climate in highland areas meant that crops were restricted to oats, whilst the more fertile lowland areas allowed the growth <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> or wheat. Coastal inhabitants {{were more likely to}} include seafood or seaweed in their meals, whilst those living inland would supplement their farmed cereals with the seeds of land weeds to ensure there was enough to eat.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, a steam packet service {{started to}} run between Driffield and Hull. Three return trips each week were made, but the journey times were too long, and an {{advertisement}} in 1825 indicated that the engine had been altered and an express steam packet service would commence. Three boats were recorded as trading between Driffield and Hull every other day in a directory of Yorkshire published in 1823. Traffic for 1832 included 7,394 chaldrons of coal, 18,173 quarters of wheat, 7,745 quarters of oats, 19,396 quarters <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> and 4,555 sacks of flour. An additional 1,564 quarters of wheat and 8,194 sacks of flour were carried to or from Foston Mill, reached from Frodingham Beck.

5|$|The {{period between}} c. 500 and 1300 saw {{a major change}} in diet that {{affected}} most of Europe. More intense agriculture on an ever-increasing acreage resulted in a shift from animal products, like meat and dairy, to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population. Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow. A bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. Leavened bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread <b>of</b> <b>barley,</b> rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.|$|E
25|$|In addition, malts are {{distinguished}} {{by the two}} major species <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> used for malting, two-row and six-row.

5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges <b>of</b> Morley's monopoly, <b>Barley</b> most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many <b>of</b> <b>Barley's</b> goods were seized, including various books and reams <b>of</b> paper. <b>Barley</b> greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|R
25|$|In {{traditional}} classifications <b>of</b> <b>barley,</b> these morphological {{differences have}} led to different forms <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> being classified as different species. Under these classifications, two-rowed barley with shattering spikes (wild barley) is classified as Hordeum spontaneum K. Koch. Two-rowed barley with nonshattering spikes is classified as H. distichum L., six-row barley with nonshattering spikes as H. vulgare L. (or H. hexastichum L.), and six-row with shattering spikes as H. agriocrithon Åberg.|$|E
25|$|Barley (hordeum vulgare) was {{the most}} {{important}} grain during the biblical period, and this was recognized ritually {{on the second day of}} Passover in the Omer offering, consisting <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> flour from the newly ripened crop.

40|$|The {{productivity}} and quality <b>of</b> malting <b>barley</b> were evaluated using factorial combinations of four preceding crops: faba bean, field pea, rapeseed and barley as main plots, and four nitrogen fertilizer rates (0, 18, 36 and 54 kg N ha- 1) as sub-plots with three replications, at two sites on Nitisols of the Ethiopian highlands in 2010 and 2011 cropping seasons. Preceding crops other than barley, and N fertilizer significantly improved yield and quality <b>of</b> malting <b>barley.</b> The highest grain yield, kernel plumpness, protein content and sieve test {{were obtained for}} malting barley grown after faba bean, followed by rapeseed and field pea. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased yield, protein content and sieve test <b>of</b> malting <b>barley.</b> All protein contents were within the acceptable range for malting quality. Inclusion of legumes in the rotation also improved soil fertility through increases in soil carbon and nitrogen content. We conclude that to maximize yield and quality <b>of</b> malting <b>barley</b> {{it is critical to}} consider the preceding crop and soil nitrogen status. Use of appropriate break crops may substitute or reduce the amount of mineral N fertilizer required for the production <b>of</b> malting <b>barley</b> at least for one season without affecting its quality...|$|R
