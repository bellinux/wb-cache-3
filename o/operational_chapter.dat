40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{computers in the}} control and automation of railway systems led to the massive use of microprocessor-based devices in almost all critical elements of a modern railway infrastructure (e. g., signaling systems, trains control, etc.). Therefore, microprocessor-based systems {{play a crucial role}} in the safety, reliability and security of these infrastructures. The very strict safety standards, which must be guaranteed in a railway system, make the testing of all electronic components a unique and challenging case study. Software-based self-test represents a very attractive test solution to cope with the problem of on-line and off-line testing of microprocessor-based systems.

40|$|This {{document}} provides five brief {{reports that}} address several quality control procedures {{under the auspices}} of the Calibration and Validation Element (CVE) within the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Project. Chapter 1 describes analyses of the 32 sensor engineering telemetry streams. Anomalies in any of the values may impact sensor performance in direct or indirect ways. The analyses are primarily examinations of parameter time series combined with statistical methods such as auto- and cross-correlation functions. Chapter 2 describes how the various onboard (solar and lunar) and vicarious (in situ) calibration data will be analyzed to quantify sensor degradation, if present. The analyses also include methods for detecting the influence of charged particles on sensor performance such as might be expected in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). Chapter 3 discusses the quality control of the ancillary environmental data that are routinely received from other agencies or projects which are used in the atmospheric correction algorithm (total ozone, surface wind velocity, and surface pressure; surface relative humidity is also obtained, but is not used in the initial <b>operational</b> algorithm). <b>Chapter</b> 4 explains the procedures for screening level-, level- 2, and level- 3 products. These quality control operations incorporate both automated and interactive procedures which check for file format errors (all levels), navigation offsets (level- 1), mask and flag performance (level- 2), and product anomalies (all levels).

40|$|The central {{argument}} of this thesis {{is that the}} contradictions between modernisation and restoring a national identity, drawn from the Arab-Islamic culture, have generated tensions in the Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia). The thesis concentrates on the particular problems posed 4 y language and language policies in these contemporary circumstances. Chapter One {{provides an overview of}} the major concerns of the thesis, with a special stress on cultural and language questions. The main {{argument of}} Chapter Two is that Western theories of development are based on the assumption of the universality of the Western model, and undervalue the social and cultural elements of developing nations, including the Maghreb. Chapter Three extends the analysis to the role of language and nationalism in the process of nation building and analyses, with special reference to Algeria, the contradictions between development policies drawn from the West, and language policies stressing an Arab-Islamic identity. This chapter deals particularly with the problems of having Arabic as the national language and French as the <b>operational</b> language. <b>Chapter</b> Four examines comparatively the interrelationship between language policies and the social and educational contexts of the Maghreb. The arguments of the chapter are: that language policies have been influenced more by ideological than practical considerations; that contradictions at the political level are reflected in the social and educational contexts; that these contradictions are affecting the educational system adversely. Chapter Five draws the themes of the thesis together, and reassesses contemporary difficulties over language policies in the context of modernisation problems. The chapter makes proposals for new language policies in a complex linguistic, cultural and economic, situation, with some concluding comments on the specific case of Algeria...|$|R

40|$|This thesis asks {{why some}} centre-right {{formations}} {{have been more}} successful than others in the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. It does so by examining a single centre-right formation – the Romanian Democratic Convention. It adds to an existing body of literature that covers the development of political parties in post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe and to {{the small number of}} studies focusing on centre-right parties in the region. Specifically it adds to the literature on party success and failure and to that on Romanian party and electoral politics. The Romanian Democratic Convention is chosen to add new insights: it is unusual because it is a study of organisational failure and because there is a geographical imbalance in the published studies of the politics of the region towards the Visegrad states. The thesis acknowledges existing academic debate about the competing influences of historical legacies, agency and structural factors in relation to post-Communist democratisation. It aims to identify what led the Convention to first establish itself but then fail to consolidate and eventually to collapse. It draws on a range of sources: semi-structured interviews; contemporaneous newspaper reports; published diaries and autobiographies and a number of secondary sources. The thesis is structured thematically, examining the role of legacies and critical events in shaping long term behaviour by politicians (chapters three and four); organisational factors and the influence of <b>operational</b> objectives (<b>chapter</b> five); the search for a broad and integrative ideology (chapter six). The conclusions in chapter seven suggest that successfully crafting a new, broad political formation requires a degree of pragmatism, directive leadership and political entrepreneurship that was missing from the Democratic Convention because it was shaped by Romania’s transition from Communism, by its organisational structure and by differences within its leadership elite so that competing operational objectives could not be reconciled when the formation entered government...|$|R
40|$|Sleep {{debt and}} time of day/night (circadian rhythm) exert {{substantial}} effects on commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operator (e. g. truck and bus/motor coach, railroad engineer, aviation pilot) performance—and, therefore, safety. In this chapter, the influence of sleep debt and circadian effects on operator performance are described. Efficacy of various countermeasures is reviewed, {{and the influence of}} individual operator traits (genetic factors) is briefly discussed. It is concluded that sleep (napping) remains the best strategy for restoring and maintaining CMV operator neurobehavioral performance. Results from ongoing research will lead to occupation-specific and individualized strategies for managing sleepiness and fatigue in <b>operational</b> environments. This <b>chapter</b> is focused on (a) operator sleep debt and (b) time of day/night during which the operator works as two main factors that exert substantial impact on oper-ator cognitive performance and alertness.

40|$|International manuals in {{economic}} statistics have traditionally provided guidance about concepts, definitions, classifications, coverage, valuation, recording data, aggregation procedures, formulas, and so on. They have mainly aided compilers {{of the relevant}} statistics in individual countries. This Manual shares this same principal objective. The Manual will benefit users of PPIs, such as government and academic economists, financial experts, and other informed users. The PPI is a key statistic for policy purposes. It attracts much attention from the media, governments, and the public in most countries. The PPI is a sophisticated concept that draws on {{a great deal of}} economic and statistical theory and requires complex data manipulation. This Manual is therefore also intended to promote greater understanding of the properties of PPIs. In general, compilers and users of economic statistics must have a clear view of what the statistics measure, in principle. Measurement without theory is unacceptable {{in economic}}s, as in other disciplines. This Manual therefore contains a thorough, comprehensive, and up-to-date survey of relevant economic and statistical theory. This makes the Manual self-contained in both the theory and practice of PPI measurement. The Manual, consequently, is large. Because different readers may have different interests and priorities, {{it is not possible to}} devise a sequence of chapters that suits all. Indeed, users do not read international manuals from cover to cover in that order. Manuals also serve as reference works. Many readers may have interest in only a selection of chapters. The purpose of this Reader’s Guide is to provide a map of the contents of the Manual that will aid readers with different interests and priorities. A. An Overview of the Sequence of Chapters As mentioned in the preface, the chapters of this Manual are arranged so that practical and <b>operational</b> issues (<b>Chapters</b> 1 – 13 and the Glossary) are supported by theoretical underpinnings (Chapters 14 – 22). Specifically, the Manual is divided into four parts...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{vision of}} organic electronics comprises {{the use of}} organic conductors and semiconductors specifically designed to accommodate large strains to enable highly deformable and mechanically robust devices for organic photovoltaics, biosensors, and electronic skins. However, mechanical properties of organic materials are often overlooked; as a result, many of these materials are unable to accommodate the mechanical stresses required for their intended applications. Thus, {{it is important to}} understand the parameters that govern mechanical properties of these materials. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the characteristics, applications, and fabrications of stretchable electronics. The idea of intrinsically stretchable electronics comprising molecularly designs of semiconducting polymers is outlined. Chapter 2 focuses on the mechanical degradation and stability of organic solar cells. The key highlights are the importance of mechanical properties and mechanical effects on the viability of organic solar cells during manufacture and in <b>operational</b> environment. <b>Chapter</b> 3 and Appendix A investigate the effects of the length of the alkyl side chains in poly(3 -alkylthiophenes) on the deformability of the pure polymer films and their blends with fullerenes. Chapter 4, 5, and Appendix B provide studies on the inherent competition between good photovoltaic performance and mechanical compliance; a critical length of the alkyl side chains on the poly(3 -alkylthiophene) allows for co-optimization of both photovoltaic and mechanical properties. In Chapter 6 and Appendix C, the effect of incompletely separated grades of electron acceptors on the mechanical deformability of organic solar cells is investigated in an effort to simultaneously improve the mechanical robustness of the organic solar cells and reduce the energy of production. Chapter 7 describes the plasticization of the common transparent electrode using common processing additives. Chapter 8, 9, and 10 investigate the mechanical properties of low-bandgap polymers as the function of the molecular structure and solid-state packing. Chapter 11 introduces a novel experimental method, photovoltaic mapping (PVMAP), which combines the use of non-damaging electrode and gradients in processing parameter to spatially map the photovoltaic properties of organic solar cells...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyze the state of {{preparedness}} of nuclear power plants (NPP) for long term operation (LTO) based on the IAEA SALTO (Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation) peer review service, analysis {{of the most significant}} failures, accidents and operational experience with type reactors PWR/VVER focusing on cases caused by equipment ageing and identification of major structures and components limiting life time of PWR/VVER-type nuclear power plants, and possible measures to ensure their required service life. Based on the results of the IAEA SALTO peer review service, an analysis of the main deficiencies and measures of NPPs in preparation for a safe LTO was performed, focusing on topics whose deeper knowledge is important for the future more precise determination of technical factors limiting the lifetime of NPPs. The main deficiencies and measures in the preparatory phase for LTO and the most important technical measures are summarized in chapter 4. 5. The main deficiencies and the most important technical corrective measures in the area of ageing management of structures and components are discussed separately. The history of major failures and operational experience of nuclear power plants with PWR/VVER reactors {{from the point of view}} of ageing of structures and components is analyzed in chapter 6. 2. The result is a statistic analysis of ageing-related events, an overview of the most significant PWR/VVER reactor failures with an impact on their service life, a statistical overview and discussion of the most important degradation mechanisms, and other important findings from the history of major failures and <b>operational</b> experience. <b>Chapter</b> 6. 3 analyzes factors limiting the operation of nuclear power plants with PWR/VVER reactors with focus on structures and components potentially limiting the life of PWR/VVER reactors and possible measures to ensure their required life.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} novel {{technique}} for a low supply voltage temperature-independent reference voltage. With the scaling of supply voltages, the threshold voltages don’t scale proportionally and thus low supply reference circuits {{have replaced the}} conventional bandgap reference circuit. The first chapter of this work discusses the conventional bandgap references (The Widlar and Brokaw references). The terminology used in the bandgap world is introduced here. The second chapter investigates the existing low supply voltage reference circuits with their advantages and the limitations. A table discussing all the investigated circuits is provided {{towards the end of}} the chapter as a summary. Chapter Three proposes a novel technique to generate a temperature-independent voltage which does not use an <b>operational</b> amplifier.

A digital trimming scheme using an EE-PROM is proposed to manage almost all of the process variation effects on the circuit...|$|R
40|$|Through interdiction models, we infer the {{vulnerabilities}} {{inherent in}} an <b>operational</b> system. This <b>chapter</b> presents four applications of interdiction modeling: (i) to delay an adversary’s {{development of a}} first nuclear weapon; (ii) to understand vulnerabilities in an electric power system; (iii) to locate sensors in a municipal water network; and (iv) to secure a border against a nuclear smuggler. In each case, we detail and interpret the mathematical model, and charac-terize insights gained from solving instances of the model. We point to special structures that sometimes arise in interdiction models and the associated implications for analyses. From these examples, themes emerge on how one should model, and defend against, an intelligent adversary. This chapter describes how to assess the vulnerabilities of operational systems by using in-terdiction models. We {{do so in the}} context of four applications from the literature: delaying an adversary’s development of a first nuclear weapon; understanding vulnerabilities in an electric power system; locating sensors to rapidly detect an illicit contaminant injected in a municipal water system; and locating radiation sensors to detect a nuclear smuggler.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, Western {{military}} forces became frequently involved in missions to stabilize conflicts around the world. In those conflicts, the {{military forces}} increasingly found themselves operating among the people. The emerging need in military interventions to prevent casualties translated into a range of value-driven military technological developments, such as military robots and nonlethal weapons (NLW). NLWs are characterized by a certain technological and operational design 2 ̆ 2 window 2 ̆ 2 of permissible physiological effect, defined at each end by values: one value is a controlled physiological impact to enforce compliance by targeted individuals and the other value is the prevention of inflicting serious harm of fatality. Robot drones, mine detectors, and sensing devices are employed on the battlefield but are operated at a safe distance by humans. Their deployment serves to decrease casualties and traumatic stress among own military personnel and seeks to enhance efficiency and tactical and <b>operational</b> superiority. This <b>chapter</b> points out that societal and political implications of designing for values in the military domain are governed by a fundamentally different scheme than is the case in the civil domain. The practical cases examined illustrate how values incorporated in military concept and system designs are exposed to counteraction and annihilation when deployed in real-world operational missions...|$|R
40|$|Co-written by a {{lecturer}} and a practitioner, Banfield & Kay provide academic and practical insights that convey {{the reality of}} HRM. Designed specifically for students taking their first introductory module in human resource management, this textbook combines the academic and practitioner perspectives to produce a balanced introduction to the subject. This approach explores how HRM is actually practised and experienced in the workplace, which overcomes the idealistic and partial insights of many textbooks. By taking a truly holistic approach to the subject, this text avoids the presentation of HRM as a separate management function, and instead presents HR processes and challenges {{as an integral part}} of any business. The conversational writing style adopted by the authors is ideal for students, and has been highly praised for engaging the reader. The book is divided into 4 parts: The Foundations of HRM (Chapters 1 - 3) is followed by <b>Operational</b> Challenges (<b>Chapters</b> 4 - 8). Key HRM Processes are then examined (Chapters 9 - 12) before the final part presents three real-life case study chapters (Chapters 12 - 15), drawing on the topics covered earlier in the text such as planning, recruitment, selection, redundancy, learning, and training. Within each chapter, care has been taken to encourage students to think critically about the issues. A huge number of real life examples and case studies are included throughout, presenting the reader with opportunities to understand the theory in practice, and bringing the topics to life. A wide range of boxed learning features and a user-friendly writing style ensures the content is fully understood and encourages students to actively engage with the issues raised. The second edition features a new chapter on strategic human resource management. The authors have also undertaken interviews with practitioners from a range of organizations. These range from large public- and private-sector organizations such as Nottingham Trent University and Calor Gas to smaller companies including International Information Systems in Bahrain. These have been written up into a new 'Practitioner Insight' feature in every chapter, providing a reflection on practice from twelve different individuals. In addition a 'Research Insight' feature has been introduced, summarising key papers at relevant points within the chapter and encouraging students to extend their reading by following up these references...|$|R
40|$|From a {{planning}} perspective, this chapter discusses how to eﬀectively mitigate {{the spread of}} an extensive viral infection on a large scale, which requires timely, sen-sible and highly sound planning. The focus is on state level planning under the federal model for developing good <b>operational</b> plans. The <b>chapter</b> clariﬁes termi-nology, as “epidemic” rather than “pandemic,” as the preferred term for a local or state response. However, after that is explained, “pandemic,” which is the common and more frequently used name and in the chapter’s title, is referenced thereaf-ter in quotation marks. Post the introduction, this study presents {{a brief history of}} “pandemic inﬂuenza,” how a state prepares to develop a plan, agreements and trigger points which must be decided, the planning process itself, the operational plan with its important template for local use, and conclusions. Tracing a common operating picture from the federal, to the state, and to the city/county levels for “pandemic inﬂuenza,” planning is the ﬁrst theme. How to incorporate continuity of government and continuity of operations into a plan, {{in the face of a}} rapidly spreading “pandemic,” is the second one. Last, how to deliver from the state to the county level, one workable document called an Operational Plan (OPLAN) with a county template for local use, is the last theme. That template gives counties a “pandemic inﬂuenza” model for planning that is the same as states and regions use, which they can directly apply locally. Thus this planning process saves lives during a “pandemic. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Environmental Health)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006 Airport {{operations}} {{have become a}} major source of concern due to aircraft nOIse, particularly in areas close to airports and aircraft flight tracks. Public opposition to aircraft noise is a threat to the continued growth of civil aviation in South Africa. This study investigated the psychological effects of aircraft noise on residents and school activities at a neighbourhood close to the airport, particularly the area located under the flight tracks or adjacent to the landing and departure pattern of aircraft. Bishop Lavis was chosen as the experimental area and Kensington, about 17 km away from the airport, was chosen as a control area. Questionnaires coupled with oral interviews and observations were used to gather information. The findings are focused on annoyance and disturbance. The study revealed that noise exposure caused annoyance, activity disturbance and some mild effects on school results, when compared with the control area. Disturbances were experienced in some activities that need concentration. Aircraft noise also caused communication interference, sleep deprivation and affected the teaching process. The community at the experimental area indicated some non-acoustical effects, such as fear of aircraft crashing over their homes but they indicated no willingness to leave the area. As such, it becomes essential when locating and designing airports to optimise flight paths in a way to reduce noise exposure to nearby communities. Recommendations for mitigation of noise exposure are proposed, which include <b>operational</b> procedure, banning <b>chapter</b> I and 2 aircraft, restricting night flights, proper land use planning and enforcing international environmental regulations...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributed to}} the knowledge on the translation of approaches from businesses and services to improve the resource capacity planning on tactical and operational level in (oncologic) hospital care. The following studies were presented: * Chapter 2 surveyed the business approaches and tools that Dutch hospitals applied to improve resource capacity planning, and analyzed the results the hospitals claimed to have achieved. * Chapter 3 explored {{the application of the}} focused factory concept in four multiple case studies, by examining the degree of focus, the organizational context, and the <b>operational</b> performance. * <b>Chapter</b> 4 dealt with the feasibility, the process and the success factors of international (comprehensive) benchmarking in specialty hospitals and specialized cancer centres. * Chapter 5 examined how a combination of benchmarking and lean management can enable considerable patient growth in a chemotherapy day unit without adding proportionally staff, while sustaining current quality and patient satisfaction levels. * Chapter 6 examined the relation between simulation and the implementation of recommendations with a literature review and a survey to the authors included in the literature review. * Chapter 7 examined the use of computer simulation to reduce the time between the CT request and the consult in which the CT report is discussed while maintaining an acceptable idle time and overtime of the CT. Effects of the intervention were evaluated using a before-and-after design. All examined business approaches may contribute to the improvement of resource capacity planning. The recommendations were mainly context specific while applied and developed seem to be generally applicable. Critical factors to implement the approaches successfully were identified...|$|R
