40|$|An exact {{mathematical}} model is presented of the Space Shuttle Main Engine computer voting logic {{in the presence}} of High Pressure Fuel Turbine (HPFT) <b>overtemperature</b> events and fuel turbine temperature sensor failures. The model provides estimates of the probability of erroneous engine shutdown and the probability of not detecting a HPFT <b>overtemperature</b> event. Because it is believed that the likelihood of sensor failures and <b>overtemperature</b> events in the HPFT greatly overshadows those in the High Pressure Oxygen Turbine (HPOT), this modeling effort focused on the HPFT. However, because the redline protection logic is the same for both turbines, estimation of the model parameters using relevant HPOT data would provide estimates of the risk of erroneous engine shutdown and an undetected <b>overtemperature</b> event in the HPOT. Because of the complexity of the model, it was necessary to program the solution which thus makes it feasible to accommodate a changing data base.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{valuation}} of heating systems with respect to providing heat in rooms based on the momentary need. Due to the temporal and local changes in the room temperature there are unavoidable effects of overheating, whose kind and size significantly depend on the current heating system. Based on criteria for evaluating these effects of overheating (radiative distribution, dynamics in the heat supply) an optimized dynamic electrical area-heating system was developed as a concept. The main characteristics of this system are the relatively large heating areas {{in comparison with the}} room interior surface area, their low <b>overtemperatures</b> and a composition of the heating elements that is nearly free of storage mass. The investigation of the radiative temperature field within the room with regard to the effect on the user was carried out by using CFD simulations to derive information on the mean radiative temperature of the interior surface area, the radiative temperature asymmetry, and the thermal comfort experienced. In addition, the amount of losses for the dynamic area-heating system caused by temporal overheating effects was ascertained by carrying out thermal building simulations for a single room and for a living unit with several rooms used differently. These results were evaluated in comparison to standard heating systems. Different scenarios of heating and ventilation were taken into account. It was shown that the user’s type of ventilation has a great influence on the amount of heat required annually and that especially a combination of heating and ventilating based on momentary needs leads to significant economies that result from the exact adaptation of heating to the user’s behavior...|$|R
