5|$|Nine {{hours after}} this all-night session, the band {{returned}} to Abbey Road {{to carry out}} overdubs. Harrison added a second vocal and another acoustic guitar part, the latter consisting of riffs that recall {{the sound of a}} sitar, due to the strings buzzing against the frets. During the same session, McCartney overdubbed bass guitar onto the track. The recording was finished on 9 October, {{with the addition of a}} brief harmony vocal from McCartney and piano, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> eight, played by Chris Thomas.|$|E

5|$|The favored {{temperature}} {{range of the}} roughtail stingray is , {{which is the most}} important factor determining its distribution. It conducts seasonal migrations off the eastern United States: from December to May, this ray is found <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> and outer parts of the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Florida, with larger rays occurring further south than smaller ones. In the spring, the population moves north of the Cape and towards the coast into bays, inlets, and saltier estuaries, though preserving the north-south gradient of body sizes. A similar migration, from shallow coastal waters in summer to deeper offshore waters in winter, apparently occurs in the Mediterranean. Pregnant females tend to be found apart from other individuals.|$|E

5|$|Johnson and the Lions {{faced the}} Atlanta Falcons {{on the road}} on September 7, 2008, in the season opener at the Georgia Dome. As the {{official}} starting wide receiver behind Roy Williams, Johnson led the team in receptions and yards, collecting 7catches for 107yards, which included one 38-yard catch-and-run in the Lions' 34–21 loss. During Week2 versus the Green Bay Packers, he had two key touchdowns late in the game, which sparked a large comeback, though the Lions eventually lost the game, 4825. Both touchdowns catches included a run after the catch (the first catch going for 38yards and the second going for 47yards, both <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle)</b> displaying Johnson's speed and breakaway ability. He ended the game with 6receptions for 129yards and 2touchdowns. In the following two games, losses to San Francisco and Chicago, Johnson failed to score a touchdown or gain over 50yards receiving. However, against the Minnesota Vikings, Johnson had 4receptions for 85yards and his third touchdown of the season.|$|E
5|$|On Indianapolis' {{first drive}} of the game, {{defensive}} back Chris Harris intercepted a deep, third-down pass from quarterback Peyton Manning {{and returned it}} 6 yards to the Bears' 35-yard line. However, Chicago could not gain a first down on their ensuing possession and {{they were forced to}} punt. After several short runs and passes, Manning beat the Bears' defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne, cutting the Bears' lead to 7–6. The touchdown occurred because of a mental error on the Bears' secondary. Cornerback Charles Tillman passed Reggie Wayne onto safety Danieal Manning. However, Manning chose to follow tight end Ben Utecht <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle,</b> leaving Wayne all alone. The score remained the same, at 7–6, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the point-after-touchdown (PAT) attempt. On the ensuing kickoff, Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff while being tackled by Robert Mathis; Colts linebacker Tyjuan Hagler recovered the loose ball. However, on the next play, Indianapolis gave the ball back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled the handoff and Bears defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Portuguese dogfish {{is thick}} and {{cylindrical}} except for the flattened belly. The two dorsal fins are small and of similar size and shape, each bearing a tiny grooved spine in front. The first dorsal fin originates well behind the pectoral fins, while the second dorsal originates <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with a rounded margin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin has a short but well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The very large dermal denticles change in shape with age: in juveniles, they are widely spaced and heart-shaped with an incomplete midline ridge and three posterior points, while in adults they are overlapping, roughly circular, smooth, and flattened with a round central concavity, superficially resembling the scales of bony fishes. Young sharks are a uniform blue-black in color, while adults are brown-black; there are no prominent fin markings. In 1997, a partially albino individual, with a pale body but normal eyes, was caught in the northeastern Atlantic. This represented the first documented case of albinism in a deep-sea shark.|$|E

5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E

Two plays later, James Jones caught a 21-yard pass at the 8. The Steelers defense kept Green Bay out of the end zone, causing them to settle for Mason Crosby's 23-yard field goal that gave Green Bay a 31–25 lead with 2:07 left in regulation.|$|E

In reaction to the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.|$|E

25|$|Brière de l'Isle was {{committed}} to expanding French control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> Niger River valley, but unlike many of his predecessors the French governments of the late 1870s were more willing to sanction (or accept) direct conquest of territory. Ironically the merchant houses based in Saint-Louis were in this period still hesitant about direct control of the hinterlands, preferring to work through their own trade networks and the series of French military trading posts. In this way as well, Brière de l'Isle was representative of the next stage in French colonialism. See also: C. W. Newbury and A. S. Kanya-Forstner.
