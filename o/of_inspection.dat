5|$|Adams {{returned}} to Massachusetts in November 1774, {{where he served}} in the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, an extralegal legislative body independent of British control. The Provincial Congress created the first minutemen companies, consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moment's notice. Adams also served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, which convened despite the Massachusetts Government Act, and was appointed to the Committee <b>of</b> <b>Inspection</b> to enforce the Continental Association.

5|$|In September 1943, United States Lieutenant Colonel Albert B.

In November, Seitz and another American liaison officer, Captain Walter R. Mansfield, {{conducted}} a tour <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> of Chetnik areas, {{including that of}} Lukačević. During their tour they witnessed fighting between Chetniks and Partisans. Due to their relative freedom of movement, the Americans assumed that the Chetniks controlled the territory they moved through. However, despite the praise that Seitz expressed for Lukačević, the Chetnik leader was collaborating with the Germans {{at the same time}} that he was hosting the visiting Americans.|$|E

5|$|Iowa {{was then}} towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi, where {{over the next}} several months the {{battleship}} was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close-in weapon system Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Iowa was the first battleship to receive the RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. She could carry up to eight of the remotely controlled drones, which replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16inch (410mm)/50 cal Mark 7 guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire-control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. Armed as such, Iowa was formally recommissioned on 28 April 1984, ahead of schedule, within her budget at a cost of $500million, and under the command of Captain Gerald E. Gneckow. In order to expedite the schedule, many necessary repairs to Iowa engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory Navy Board <b>of</b> <b>Inspection</b> and Survey (InSurv) inspection was skipped.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours <b>of</b> <b>inspection.</b> After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible {{as long as they were}} afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E

40|$|Frequently one has {{to search}} within a finite {{population}} for a single particular individual or item with a rare characteristic. Whether an item possesses the characteristic can only be determined by close <b>inspection.</b> The availability <b>of</b> additional information about {{the items in the}} population opens the way to a more effective search strategy than just random sampling or complete <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the population. We will assume that the available information allows for the assignment to all items within the population of a prior probability on whether or not it possesses the rare characteristic. This is consistent with the practice of using profiling to select high risk items for inspection. The objective is to find the specific item with the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>inspections.</b> We will determine the optimal search strategies for several models according to the average number <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> needed to find the specific item.
