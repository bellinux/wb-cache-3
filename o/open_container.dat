5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} <b>open</b> <b>container</b> of alcohol in the {{passenger}} portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an <b>open</b> <b>container</b> of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for <b>open</b> <b>container</b> convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so <b>open</b> <b>container</b> laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook.|$|E
5|$|Casinos, {{and vendors}} serving, selling or storing {{alcoholic}} beverages for a casino, {{are required to}} obtain a casino hotel alcoholic beverage (CHAB) license from the Division of Gaming Enforcement. CHAB licenses must be renewed every five years. New Jersey's casino alcohol regulations are divided into five different regions of activity: (a) the casino floor (includes simulcasting facilities); (b) the hotel (includes restaurants and meeting rooms); (c) package goods; (d) room service; and (e) storage. Alcohol sold or given away on the casino floor and in hotel areas must be in an <b>open</b> <b>container</b> for immediate consumption, whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed. Alcoholic beverages brought to a patron as a room service may be open or closed, whereas storage areas must not be accessible to the public.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey's {{state parks}} and forests {{prohibit}} the possession or {{consumption of alcohol}}ic beverages except at pre-approved events. There is no state law against public consumption of alcohol in other locations, but most municipalities have <b>open</b> <b>container</b> laws prohibiting or restricting public consumption. The fine for alcohol possession in a state park is $71, whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can {{be as high as}} $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not a criminal offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility.|$|E
25|$|Duke's student newspaper, The Chronicle, {{depicted}} {{other examples}} of violence and dishonesty from Sgt. Gottlieb. It published that one student threw a party at his rental home off-East Campus before the Rolling Stones concert in October 2005. The morning after the concert, at 3 A.M., Sgt. Gottlieb led a raid on the home with nine other officers while the students were half asleep. It reported that one student was dragged {{out of bed and}} then dragged down the stairs. It reported that all seven housemates were put in handcuffs, arrested, and taken into custody for violating a noise ordinance and <b>open</b> <b>container</b> of alcohol violations. Sgt. Gottlieb reportedly told one student, an American citizen of Serbian descent, that the student could be deported. Other stories include the throwing of a 130pound male against his car for an <b>open</b> <b>container</b> of alcohol violation, refusing the ID of a student since he was international, searching through a purse without a warrant, refusing to tell a student her rights, and accusations of perjury.|$|E

The T-shirt has been cited in at least one lawsuit against the DBPD alleging police brutality, the lawyer in the case in which the client sustained broken ribs and a fractured eye socket during an arrest for an <b>open</b> <b>container</b> of beer, claims the T-shirt shows the DBPD condones violence.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{external}} bacterial contamination of local anaesthetic cartridges from newly <b>opened</b> and <b>open</b> <b>containers</b> was examined. Colonies of mainly Gram-positive cocci and Gram-positive rods were grown from cartridges {{from both the}} freshly <b>opened</b> and <b>open</b> <b>containers.</b> However, {{the total number of}} colonies grown from <b>open</b> <b>containers</b> was significantly higher than that from freshly opened ones. It was concluded that where local anaesthetic cartridges are bulk-packed in containers, strict infection control measures are to be instituted in clinical practice. We suggest that these include keeping containers tightly capped, removing cartridges only when needed, using forceps to handle cartridges and swabbing cartridges with alcohol prior to loading into syringes.

25|$|Today, alcohol {{laws are}} {{controlled}} by the state government, and local jurisdictions are prohibited from going beyond those state laws. Missouri has no statewide <b>open</b> <b>container</b> law or prohibition on drinking in public, no alcohol-related blue laws, no local option, no precise locations for selling liquor by the package (allowing even drug stores and gas stations to sell any kind of liquor), and no differentiation of laws based on alcohol percentage. State law protects persons from arrest or criminal penalty for public intoxication.|$|E

A news reporter stumbled upon an <b>open</b> <b>container</b> of androstenedione in McGwire's locker in August of the '98 season. At the time androstenedione was not on the banned substance list for Major League Baseball, but was viewed as a precursor to anabolic steroids and was already banned by the International Olympic Committee, the National Football League, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.|$|E
25|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} near water, not {{directly}} into it as other mosquitoes do, but typically near a stagnant pool. However, any <b>open</b> <b>container</b> containing water will suffice for larvae development, even {{with less than}} an ounce (30 ml) of water. It can also breed in running water, so stagnant pools of water are not its only breeding sites. It {{is more likely to}} lay eggs in water sources near flowers than in water sources without flowers. It has a short flight range (less than 200m), so breeding sites are likely to be close to where this mosquito is found.|$|E
