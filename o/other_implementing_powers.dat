40|$|We {{extend a}} class of analog CMOS {{circuits}} {{that can be used}} to perform many analog computational tasks. The circuits utilize MOSFET’s in their subthreshold region as well as capacitors and switches to produce the computations. We show a few basic currentmode building blocks that perform squaring, square root, and multiplication/division which should be sufficient to gain understanding of how to <b>implement</b> <b>other</b> <b>power</b> law circuits. We then combine the circuit building blocks into a more complicated circuit that normalizes a current by the square root of the sum of the squares (vector sum) of the currents. Each of these circuits have switches at the inputs of their floating gates which are used to dynamically set and restore the charges at the floating gates to proceed with the computation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of power control when nodes are non-homogeneously dispersed in space. In such situations, one seeks to employ per packet power control depending on the source and destination of the packet. This {{gives rise to a}} joint problem which involves not only power control but also clustering. We provide three solutions for joint clustering and power control. The first protocol, CLUSTERPOW, aims to increase the network capacity by increasing spatial reuse. We provide a simple and modular architecture to implement CLUSTERPOW at the network layer. The second, Tunnelled CLUSTERPOW, allows a finer optimization by using encapsulation, but we do not know of an efficient way to implement it. The last, MINPOW, whose basic idea is not new, provides an optimal routing solution with respect to the total power consumed in communication. Our contribution includes a clean implementation of MINPOW at the network layer without any physical layer support. We establish that all three protocols ensure that packets ultimately reach their intended destinations. We provide a software architectural framework for our implementation as a network layer protocol. The architecture works with any routing protocol, and {{can also be used to}} <b>implement</b> <b>other</b> <b>power</b> control schemes. Details of the implementation in Linux are provided. I...|$|R

In this paper, we motivate transmission power control and investigate the challenges involved in <b>implementing</b> <b>power</b> control in multiple access wireless packet networks. For this work, we focus on wireless ad-hoc networks, where the links connecting sourcedestination pairs are all wireless. Power control has been implemented in cellular networks such as CDMA (code division multiple access) for quite some time now. However, these protocols depend on centralized control (i. e. base stations) and duplex communications that are not inherently present in wireless multiple access packet networks.
