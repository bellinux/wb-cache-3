5000|$|According to Silvio Gesell, it is {{ineffective}} {{to establish}} welfare systems without abolishing private ownership of land because {{the proceeds of}} the labor of workers {{are determined by the}} proceeds of labor that they can <b>obtain</b> <b>on</b> free land. The benefits gained by the welfare system are not to increase the proceeds of labor that workers can <b>obtain</b> <b>on</b> free land, but rather to increase the proceeds of labor that they can <b>obtain</b> <b>on</b> the lands of landowners. Private ownership of land converts all the advantages of using one's land into cash and it belongs to the landowner. [...] In order not to cancel the effects of welfare policies, Silvio Gesell's Free-Land reform is needed.|$|R

5|$|A {{prospectus}} {{was issued}} which contained a detailed {{breakdown of the}} likely costs, revenue and profits of such a scheme, and the promotors prepared to obtain an Act of Parliament. During this time, someone challenged the original survey and another local surveyor was asked to review it. John Beauchamp suggested that no locks would be required on the upper section, but that costs {{were likely to be}} £15,234. This was later raised to £18,000, and the Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a canal that followed Hammett's plans, was <b>obtained</b> <b>on</b> 28 May 1827.

5|$|A {{week before}} the start of the Grand Prix weekend, Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde {{launched}} legal action against Sauber before the Supreme Court of Victoria, to enforce a contract he entered into in June 2014 to drive for the team during the 2015 season. This action was based on an award that van der Garde <b>obtained</b> <b>on</b> 2 March 2015 through international arbitration in Switzerland, which he initiated after the team announced in November 2014 that their 2015 drivers would instead be Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. On Wednesday, 11 March 2015, van der Garde succeeded by obtaining court orders compelling Sauber to permit him to drive in Melbourne. On the same day, Sauber appealed the orders made against them and also publicly announced that they would not compromise the safety of the team or other drivers by putting van der Garde in the car, since the C34 chassis had only been tailored to fit Ericsson and Nasr.|$|E

5|$|Fra Mauro is a {{widespread}} hilly geological area covering large portions of the lunar surface around Mare Imbrium, and {{is thought to be}} composed of ejecta from the impact which formed Imbrium. The area is primarily composed of relatively low ridges and hills, between which exist undulating valleys. Much of the ejecta blanket from the Imbrium impact is covered with debris from younger impacts and material churned up by possible moonquakes. Debris found in the formation may have originated from deep beneath the original crust, and samples collected there could give insight into the geologic history of the Moon. The petrology of the formation, based on data <b>obtained</b> <b>on</b> Apollo 14, indicates a history of impact and ejection possibly spanning over approximately 500 million years.|$|E
5|$|In 1720 {{the first}} Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} {{improvements to the}} river was obtained by three gentlemen of Cheshire. The act was dated 23 March 1720 and authorised work between Frodsham bridge and Winsford bridge. Rates for tolls were set, which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once the cost of construction had been met, and profits were then {{to be used to}} maintain bridges and highways within Cheshire. Each year the Justices of the Peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue. The Act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from the Weaver to Witton Bridge. Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich, who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation, a separate Act was <b>obtained</b> <b>on</b> 7 June 1721 to authorise improvements to the River Dane, but did not result in any work being undertaken.|$|E
