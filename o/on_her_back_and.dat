5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem {{could not be sure}} how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi {{will try}} to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a {{dragline}} made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles {{of the same species}} may contend for the same prey.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, {{he gave her a}} big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sabrina became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Rachel Saltz credited soprano Dessay with {{letting the}} hard work of rehearsals show through. She wears minimal makeup and [...] "lets the camera observe her closely. We see her bra strap, the freckles <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> <b>her</b> wrinkles <b>and</b> blemishes. For an opera star, for any kind of star, it’s remarkably unvain and oddly endearing." ...|$|R

25|$|Though {{there are}} a number of {{variations}} and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of penile penetration.|$|E
25|$|The missionary {{position}} or man-on-top position is generally a sex {{position in which}} a woman lies <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> a man lies on top of her while they face each other and engage in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity. Though commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, the sex position is also used by gay and lesbian couples.|$|E
25|$|The Viennese oyster {{position}} requires great flexibility {{from the}} woman to perform. The female lies <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> moves her legs behind her head, with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position {{and may not be}} suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.|$|E

25|$|During a {{press conference}} on June 26, Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard {{reported}} that Chris Benoit had killed {{his wife and son}} and committed suicide. A Bible was left by Nancy's body, and she died of asphyxiation. She had bruises <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> stomach consistent with an attacker pressing a knee into her back while pulling on a cord around her neck. Daniel also died of asphyxiation, without signs of restraint. He had internal injuries to the throat area, but no bruises, indicating he may have been killed by a choke. Chris killed Nancy on Friday, Daniel on Saturday, then asphyxiated himself with the cord of a weight machine in his basement early Sunday morning.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{month of}} Baldwin's arrival, Marie left Constantinople for Western Europe, {{assuming}} they followed the instructions of Blanche of Castille, Marie's great-aunt, who had arranged for her visit and had given Baldwin 20,000 livres in exchange for two promises: not to sell his properties at Namur, and to send Marie to visit her within a month after his return to Constantinople. Baldwin {{is said to have}} prepared four armed ships to take Marie and her escort abroad. Marie arrived in Cyprus while Louis IX and the Crusaders were there, only to have a strong wind blow her ship free of its anchor, taking it and all its cargo to Acre, leaving Marie with only the clothes <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> a cloak. The Crusaders there took care of her. Presumably soon after leaving Cyprus, Marie arrived in Negropont 30 January 1249, from where she reached France in May. According to the Chronique de Flandres, Marie stayed with her great-aunt until Blanche died in 1252, after which, it reports, Marie went to live in her husband's estates at Namur. For the next years Marie contested unsuccessfully with Henry of Luxembourg for control of those properties—which were the source of income for both Emperor and Empress—until her cession of these lands and castles 17 June 1258 to Margaret of Flanders. Despite this, the Castle of Namur refused to surrender to Henry of Luxembourg, the vassal of Margaret of Flanders, until St. Vincent's Day (21 January 1259). After this she had gone to the court of Castile where she successfully raised the money to ransom her son Peter, who was held hostage by bankers in Venice and who was released at some date between June 1258 and 1 May 1261.|$|E
500|$|Contests between Portia {{females are}} violent and embraces in P. labiata {{typically}} take 20 to 60seconds.

500|$|Bågenholm {{soon began}} {{to show signs of}} vitality, and woke up paralyzed from the neck down on 30 May. She feared she would spend {{the rest of her life}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> was angry with her colleagues for saving her. Bågenholm soon {{recovered}} from the paralysis, however, and later apologized to her friends; [...] "I was very irritated when I realized they had saved me. I feared a meaningless life, without any dignity. Now I am very happy to be alive and want to apologize." [...] Bågenholm's kidneys and digestive system were not working properly, so she had to recover in an intensive care unit for two more months. After spending 28days in the Tromsø intensive care unit, she was flown to Sweden in an ambulance helicopter for the remainder of her recovery.|$|E
500|$|McCay {{originally}} used {{a version}} of the film as part of his vaudeville act. [...] The first performance was on February8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. [...] McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with How a Mosquito Operates. [...] He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. [...] Standing {{to the right of the}} film screen, he introduced [...] "the only dinosaur in captivity". [...] As the film started Gertie poked her head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. [...] He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. [...] For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he [...] "reappeared" [...] in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.|$|E

500|$|Among P. schultzi {{and some}} other Portias, when adults {{of the same species}} but {{opposite}} sexes recognise each other, they display at 10 to 30centimetres. Males usually wait for 2 to 15minutes before starting a display, but sometimes a female starts a display first. Portias sometimes use [...] "propulsive displays", with which a member threatens a rival of the same species and sex, and unreceptive females also threaten males in this way. A propulsive display is a series of sudden, quick movements including striking, charging, ramming and leaps. In P. schultzi and in some other species, contests between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact. Contests between Portia females are violent and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. These occasionally include grappling that sometimes breaks a leg, but more usually the final move is a lunge. Sometimes one knocks the other <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. If the loser has a nest, the winner takes over and eats any eggs there.|$|E
500|$|The Cleveland Bay is a {{versatile}} horse {{and is still}} used today for many tasks, including driving and farmwork. In the 1920s, Cleveland Bays replaced black Hanoverians in the British royal stables, and both the Cleveland Bay and Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred crosses are used as royal carriage horses today. The horses are used as heavy hunters, as they are powerful and able to carry a man weighing [...] for {{a full day of}} hunting over large obstacles and through heavy clay. When crossed with Thoroughbreds, the resulting progeny are lighter and faster, but still strong and heavy of bone. When show jumping was first beginning as a sport during the mid-19th century, Cleveland Bays were among the initial stars. Two mares, Star and Fanny Drape, were two of the top performers. Fanny Drape was known to have cleared a [...] stone wall with a rider <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> a [...] bar while being jumped in-hand. In 2006, a Cleveland Bay stallion named Tregoyd Journeyman was used as a model for a new horse figure by Breyer Animal Creations, and the stallion participated in that year's Breyer model horse festival. Purebred and crossbred Cleveland Bays make up the majority of the bay horses in the Royal Mews, the British royal stables, where they receive intense training to desensitize them before they are put to work drawing royal carriages.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{believed it}} had a strong case {{despite the lack of}} known witnesses to the crime and the failure to recover the murder weapon. Clark's case was supported by DNA evidence, and she expected a conviction. From the physical evidence that was collected, the prosecution claimed that Simpson drove to Nicole Brown's house on the evening of June 12 with the intention of killing her. They maintained that Brown had put their two children to bed and was {{getting ready to go to}} bed herself when she opened the front door of her house after either responding to a knock on the front door or hearing a noise outside. Simpson allegedly grabbed her before she could scream and attacked her with a knife. Forensic evidence from the Los Angeles County coroner alleged that Ron Goldman arrived at the front gate to the townhouse sometime during the assault, and the assailant apparently attacked him and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while restraining him with an arm choke-hold. Brown was found lying face down when authorities arrived at the crime scene. According to the prosecution's account, after Simpson had finished with Goldman, he pulled Brown's head back using her hair, put his foot <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> slit her throat with the knife, severing her carotid artery. They argued further that Simpson left a [...] "trail of blood" [...] from the condo to the alley behind it; there was also testimony that three drops of Simpson's blood were found on the driveway near the gate to his house on Rockingham Drive.|$|E
