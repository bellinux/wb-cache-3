40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a multipurpose image watermarking scheme which embeds robust and fragile watermarks in the wavelet domain for image retrieval and content integrity verification simultaneously. The proposed scheme {{consists of two}} main phases, the offline process and the <b>online</b> <b>retrieval</b> process. In the offline process, the feature vector is extracted from each image as the robust watermark to be embedded in the low frequency subband and a copyright signature is used as the fragile watermark to be embedded in the high frequency subband. The <b>online</b> <b>retrieval</b> process consists of three sub-processes, i. e., query feature computation, watermark extraction and feature vector matching. Since the features are embedded in the image data, it is unnecessary to compute the features but only to extract it from the watermarked image. A series of experiments are carried out on a watermarked image database and the simulation results demonstrate {{the advantages of the}} proposed watermarking scheme...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The rapid {{development}} of Internet and multimedia technologies has made image retrieval and copyright problem be {{the two most}} important issues in the digital world. To solve these problems simultaneously, this paper presents a multipurpose watermarking scheme: to notify the copyright owner with a visible watermark, and to retrieve the image with an invisible watermark. The proposed scheme consists of two main phases, offline process and <b>online</b> <b>retrieval</b> process. A copyright symbol is used as the visible watermark and the feature vector is extracted from each image as the invisible watermark to be embedded into the image, which is the preprocessing operation called offline process. The <b>online</b> <b>retrieval</b> process consists of three processes, i. e., query feature computation, watermark extraction and feature vector matching. Since the features are embedded in the image data, it is unnecessary to compute the features but only to extract it from the watermarked image. We carry out a series of experiments on a watermarked image database, and simulation results indicate the advantage of the proposed watermarking scheme...|$|E
40|$|Image {{retrieval}} {{and related}} operations {{are always a}} ’hotspot ’ in the information era. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a vastly developing area in the multimedia technology domain. To enhance security, we apply watermarking technique into the retrieval system and propose an approach for JEPG image retrieval. The proposed image retrieval system consists of three main phases, offline pro-cess, <b>online</b> <b>retrieval</b> process and the feedback process. The offline process aims at the feature vector extraction from the image. Later these features will be stored in the database. When {{it comes to the}} <b>online</b> <b>retrieval</b> process, it actually extracts the image features from the input image and matches these feature vectors with those avail-able in the image database. In order to overcome the possible dis-similarity between bottom features and high-level semantics in the image retrieval; we introduce the feedback network to strengthen the retrieval efficiency. This is a simple categorized screening. Such a feedback scenario makes the system more user-friendly and ef-fective. The proposed feedback screening strategy filters the images from irrelevant categories and enriches the final result with more relevant images. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of clinicians' use of an <b>online</b> {{information}} <b>retrieval</b> system on their performance in answering clinical questions. Design: Pre-/post-intervention experimental design. Measurements: In a computer laboratory, 75 clinicians (26 hospital-based doctors, 18 family practitioners, and 31 clinical nurse consultants) provided 600 answers to eight clinical scenarios before and after the use of an <b>online</b> information <b>retrieval</b> system. We examined the proportion of correct answers pre- and post-intervention, direction of change in answers, and differences between professional groups. Results: System use resulted in a 21 % improvement in clinicians' answers, from 29 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 25. 4 – 32. 6) correct pre- to 50 % (95 % CI 46. 0 – 54. 0) post-system use. In 33 % (95 % CI 29. 1 – 36. 9) answers were changed from incorrect to correct. In 21 % (95 % CI 17. 1 – 23. 9) correct pre-test answers were supported by evidence found using the system, and in 7 % (95 % CI 4. 9 – 9. 1) correct pre-test answers were changed incorrectly. For 40 % (35. 4 – 43. 6) of scenarios, incorrect pre-test answers were not rectified following system use. Despite significant differences in professional groups' pre-test scores [family practitioners: 41 % (95 % CI 33. 0 – 49. 0), hospital doctors: 35 % (95 % CI 28. 5 – 41. 2), and clinical nurse consultants: 17 % (95 % CI 12. 3 – 21. 7; χ² = 29. 0, df = 2, p < 0. 01) ], {{there was no difference in}} post-test scores. (χ² = 2. 6, df = 2, p = 0. 73). Conclusions: The use of an <b>online</b> information <b>retrieval</b> system was associated with a significant improvement in the quality of answers provided by clinicians to typical clinical problems. In a small proportion of cases, use of the system produced errors. While there was variation in the performance of clinical groups when answering questions unaided, performance did not differ significantly following system use. <b>Online</b> information <b>retrieval</b> systems can be an effective tool in improving the accuracy of clinicians' answers to clinical questions. 7 page(s...|$|R
