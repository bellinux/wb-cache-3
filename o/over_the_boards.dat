5|$|Each period, {{and after}} each goal scored, play is {{restarted}} with a face-off. If a ball travels <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> {{and outside of}} the playing area, play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 Stanley Cup semifinals {{between the}} Maple Leafs and Red Wings was {{especially}} notable {{with the second}} game devolving into a brawl. The tone of the game was set early when Maple Leafs' defenceman, Rudolph Kampman, injured Red Wings' forward Cecil Dillon who became unable to play {{the rest of the}} night. In the second period, Maple Leafs' Red Horner and Red Wings' Alex Motter fought on the ice and continued {{to do so in the}} penalty box with local police called in to break it up. Later in the same frame, Red Wings' Don Grosso lifted Maple Leafs' Hank Goldup <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards,</b> dropping him on the cement floor. Goldup had to be assisted off the ice.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} online {{in the same way}} as <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>board,</b> but some aspects are unique to online bughouse. In games <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>board,</b> {{communication}} is heard by all players, while in online bughouse it is usually done via private messages between two partners. This makes communication a more powerful weapon. It is also easier to coordinate as <b>the</b> second <b>board</b> is more visible on <b>the</b> screen than <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>board.</b> <b>The</b> time aspect is altered due to existence of premove and lag. The latter can influence the diagonal time difference significantly, and it is good sportsmanship to restart the game when this difference gets too large.|$|R

25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the third}} period, Sid Abel scored for the Red Wings to narrow the Maple Leafs' lead to 3–1. However, a melee erupted when Abel and Maple Leafs' Gus Marker engaged one another. Within an instant, every player on the ice engaged an {{opponent}} in a fight, with players from both benches going <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> to join them. The brawl lasted for more than 10 minutes with the last two engaged players being Jimmy Orlando and Horner. When peace was restored, the referee assessed majors and misconducts to Gus Marker and Abel, a major to Orlando, and a misconduct to Horner, who left the penalty box to join the altercation. At the games conclusion, Red Wings' coach Jack Adams had his own altercation. As the Red Wings headed towards their own dressing room, a fan attempted to assault Adams before he punched the fan himself.|$|E
25|$|In Missouri, {{the exact}} {{opposite}} took place. The Missouri Baptist Convention (the existing state body) came {{under the control of}} the more conservative group which subsequently attempted to take <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> of the state's agencies and institutions and reshape them along the theological lines of the current SBC. In 2002, some congregations withdrew and affiliated with a new convention called Baptist General Convention of Missouri. Five of the old Missouri Baptist Convention agencies changed their charters in 2000 and 2001 to elect their own trustees instead of allowing them to be appointed by the Missouri Baptist Convention. Leaders of the Missouri Baptist Convention saw this as a blatant violation of convention bylaws. When the trustees of the agencies refused to settle the matter out of court, the Missouri Baptist Convention filed suit against them. As of April, 2010, two of the agencies named have been released from lawsuit, and the other agencies have prevailed in court, although the judgements are being appealed. To date, in excess of $10 million in lawyers' fees and court costs have been expended by these lawsuits. To fund these lawsuits, the Missouri Baptist Convention mortgaged its headquarters building in Jefferson City, Missouri.|$|E

The Flames, who had been struggling financially and were unable to sign Fleury to a new contract, chose to trade him {{less than two weeks}} after he broke the record rather than risk losing him to free agency. He was dealt to the Colorado Avalanche on February 28 for René Corbet, Wade Belak and Robyn Regehr. [...] Although it was expected to a certain extent, the trade nonetheless stunned fans in Calgary. His popularity was such that during a game in 1999, after Fleury was sent off the ice to change a bloody jersey, a fan threw his own souvenir jersey <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> so that Fleury would not miss a shift. He put the jersey on before realizing it was autographed and handed it back.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} method, {{used for}} small-scale production and often by hobbyists, is immersion etching, {{in which the}} board is submerged in etching solution such as ferric chloride. Compared with methods used for mass production, the etching time is long. [...] Heat and agitation {{can be applied to}} the bath to speed the etching rate. In bubble etching, air is passed through the etchant bath to agitate the solution and speed up etching. Splash etching uses a motor-driven paddle to splash boards with etchant; the process has become commercially obsolete since it is not as fast as spray etching. In spray etching, the etchant solution is distributed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>boards</b> by nozzles, and recirculated by pumps. Adjustment of the nozzle pattern, flow rate, temperature, and etchant composition gives predictable control of etching rates and high production rates.|$|E
