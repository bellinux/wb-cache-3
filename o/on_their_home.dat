5|$|Eons ago, Bor, {{father of}} Odin, clashes with the Dark Elf Malekith, who seeks to unleash a weapon {{known as the}} Aether on the nine realms. After conquering Malekith's forces, {{including}} enhanced warriors called the Kursed, <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> world of Svartalfheim, Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column. Unbeknownst to Bor, Malekith, his lieutenant Algrim, {{and a handful of}} Dark Elves escape into suspended animation.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} aberrations. The 1992 kit, {{sponsored}} by Triton Showers, {{was made of}} a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain. Birmingham have only worn stripes <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> shirt once; in 1999 they wore a blue shirt with a front central panel in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the Tesco supermarket carrier bag of the time.|$|E

5|$|When hunting, banded sea kraits {{frequently}} {{head into}} deep water far from land, but return {{to land in}} order to digest, shed skin, and reproduce. Individual banded sea kraits return to their specific home islands, exhibiting philopatry.

5|$|Darian Bernard Durant (born August 19, 1982) is a {{professional}} Canadian football quarterback for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football at the University of North Carolina. After his college career, he held school records for completion percentage, touchdowns, passing yards, total offense and completions. Durant was {{signed as a free}} agent by the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2006, and became the club's full-time starting quarterback in 2009. He was named a CFL West Division All-Star in 2009 and 2013. His brother Justin plays in the National Football League as a linebacker. Durant was the starting quarterback when the Saskatchewan Roughriders won the 101st Grey Cup in 2013 <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> field.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, NFF {{launched}} {{plans for}} a redevelopment of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a retractable roof and redevelopment of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and allow more matches to be played, grant the teams more practice time <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> pitch, make room for sponsor events, allow more concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held.|$|E

5|$|On September 6, Art Modell died in Baltimore {{at the age}} of 87. Although the Browns {{planned to}} have a moment of silence <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> opener for their former owner, his family asked the team not to, well aware of the less-than-friendly {{reaction}} it was likely to get. Weeden started the Browns' first game of the season. The 28-year-old rookie threw four interceptions in a 17–16 loss to Philadelphia in which the Browns' only touchdown was scored by the defense.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners {{lost their}} {{first three games}} of the premiership season, their first a narrow loss <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> ground. However, after the first loss at home, the Mariners were able to win seven {{consecutive}} matches at Topper Stadium. Despite this home ground record, Mariners {{were never able to}} win away from home. They lost all nine matches played away from their stadium, and subsequently missed out on the finals for the Super League season.|$|E
5|$|As with The Quatermass Xperiment, the {{screenplay}} for Quatermass 2 condenses {{many of the}} events of the original. The most significant change is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass and his assistant, Pugh, use Quatermass's rocket to travel to the asteroid to take on the aliens <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> turf whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, at the asteroid to destroy it. Several characters from the television version do not appear in the film, most notably Quatermass's daughter, Paula, and his assistant, Leo Pugh. Conversely, the character of Inspector Lomax reappears in the film version, having previously been in The Quatermass Xperiment, but does not appear in the television version. The character of Sheila the barmaid also appears only in the film version.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the BAA and NBL merged to {{form the}} NBA. The new league started the inaugural 1949–50 NBA season, {{featuring}} 17 teams, with the Lakers in the Central Division. Mikan again was dominant, averaging 27.4 points per game and 2.9 assists per game and taking another scoring title; Alex Groza of Indianapolis Olympians {{was the only other}} player to break the 20-point-barrier that year. After comfortably leading his team to an impressive 51–17 record and storming through the playoffs, Mikan's team played the 1950 NBA Finals against the Syracuse Nationals. In Game 1, the Lakers beat Syracuse <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> court when Lakers reserve guard Bob Harrison hit a 40-foot buzzer beater to give Minneapolis a two-point win. The team split the next four games, and in Game 6, the Lakers won 110–95 and won the first-ever NBA championship. Mikan scored 31.3 points per game in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{opened the}} new season by {{claiming}} the 1976 FA Charity Shield with a 1–0 win over Southampton, {{and went on to}} win the league largely <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> form, Kennedy's goal in a 2–1 win over title contenders Ipswich Town on 30 April proving to be decisive. Though Liverpool failed to win any of their last four league matches, they finished one point clear of Manchester City in second. Liverpool won the European Super Cup with a comprehensive 7–1 victory over German club Hamburg. Liverpool also reached the 1977 FA Cup Final, but lost the chance to follow Arsenal's feat at achieving the Double as they were beaten 2–1 by bitter rivals Manchester United. In the European Cup, Liverpool beat Crusaders (Northern Ireland), Trabzonspor (Turkey), AS Saint-Étienne (France), and FC Zürich (Switzerland) to reach the final against German side Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the final at Rome's Stadio Olimpico, Kennedy won a late penalty which Phil Neal converted to give Liverpool a 3–1 victory.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 1993, Leslie Alexander {{purchased}} the Rockets for $85 million. In Tomjanovich's second full year as head coach, the Rockets began the 1993–94 season by tying an NBA record with start of 15–0. Led by Olajuwon, {{who was named}} the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, the Rockets won a franchise-record 58 games. The Rockets recovered from being two games down to the Phoenix Suns {{in the second round}} of the playoffs, to advance to the finals. Houston was once again down by three games to two to the New York Knicks, but they managed to win the last two games <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> court, and claim their first championship in franchise history. Olajuwon was awarded the Finals MVP, after averaging 27 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots a game.|$|E

5|$|The 2013 {{season was}} {{arguably the best}} season of Durant's career. He set career highs in touchdowns, with 31, while {{limiting}} his interceptions to only 12. He began the year having attempted 212 consecutive pass attempts without being intercepted joining Dave Dickenson and later Ricky Ray as the only quarterback in CFL history to start 7 consecutive games without throwing an interception. He also set a career-high for passer rating with 95.7 (excluding his 2006 season in which he only completed one pass). He led the Riders to an 11-7 record and home-field in the Western Semi-Finals against the BC Lions where several of his rushing plays won the game for the Riders.
