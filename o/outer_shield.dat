[...] "R" [...] burners – D1R, D2R, D3R, and D4R – are designed for use in reflector-type headlamp optics. They have an opaque mask covering specific portions of the shield, which facilitates the optical creation of the light/dark boundary (cutoff) near the top of a low-beam light distribution. Automotive HID burners do emit considerable near-UV light, despite the shield.|$|E

40|$|Hypervelocity impact (HVI), {{ubiquitous}} in low Earth orbit with an impacting velocity {{in excess of}} 1 km/s, poses an immense threat {{to the safety of}} orbiting spacecraft. Upon penetration of the <b>outer</b> <b>shielding</b> layer of a typical two-layer shielding system, the shattered projectile, together with the jetted materials of the <b>outer</b> <b>shielding</b> material, subsequently impinge the inner shielding layer, to which pitting damage is introduced. The pitting damage includes numerous craters and cracks disorderedly scattered over a wide region. Targeting the quantitative evaluation of this sort of damage (multitudinous damage within a singular inspection region), a characterization strategy, associating linear with nonlinear features of guided ultrasonic waves, is developed. Linear-wise, changes in the signal features in the time domain (e. g., time-of-flight and energy dissipation) are extracted, for detecting gross damage whose characteristic dimensions are comparable to the wavelength of the probing wave; nonlinear-wise, changes in the signal features in the frequency domain (e. g., second harmonic generation), which are proven to be more sensitive than their linear counterparts to small-scale damage, are explored to characterize HVI-induced pitting damage scattered in the inner layer. A numerical simulation, supplemented with experimental validation, quantitatively reveals the accumulation of nonlinearity of the guided waves when the waves traverse the pitting damage, based on which linear and nonlinear damage indices are proposed. A path-based rapid imaging algorithm, in conjunction {{with the use of the}} developed linear and nonlinear indices, is developed, whereby the HVI-induced pitting damage is characterized in images in terms of the probability of occurrence.

40|$|It was {{theoretically}} {{shown by}} the authors that the current-carrying capacity of superconducting dc power cable can be enhanced by choosing a force-free configuration under a parallel magnetic field produced by the current flowing back in the <b>outer</b> <b>shielding</b> conductor. This was experimentally checked for a single layer cable using Bi- 2223 tapes in an applied parallel magnetic field. It {{was found that the}} current-carrying capacity took on a peak value under the force-free condition for the total magnetic field, including the self-field. This shows that the proposed structure is suitable for practical dc power transmission. The possibility of the innovative dc superconducting power cable with multi-layers with higher current-carrying capacity is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Another {{application}} for triaxial cables is in taking precision low-current measurements where the leakage current through the insulator between {{the core and}} shield would normally alter the measurements. The core (known as the force) and the inner shield (known as the guard) are kept at approximately the same electrical potential by a voltage buffer/follower, thus the leakage current between them is zero for all practical purposes, despite the imperfections of the insulation. Instead, the leakage current occurs between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shields,</b> which does not matter since that current will be supplied by the buffer circuit rather than the device under test and will not affect measurements. This technique can provide almost perfect elimination of leakage current but becomes less effective at higher frequencies as the buffer cannot follow the measured voltage.|$|R
50|$|Some cryopumps have {{multiple}} stages at various low temperatures, with the <b>outer</b> stages <b>shielding</b> the coldest inner stages. The outer stages condense high boiling point gases {{such as water}} and oil, thus saving the surface area and refrigeration capacity of the inner stages for lower boiling point gases such as nitrogen.|$|R
50|$|The {{best way}} to wire {{shielded}} cables for screening is to ground the shield {{at both ends of}} the cable. Traditionally there existed a rule of thumb to ground the shield at one end only to avoid ground loops. In airplanes, special cable is used with both an <b>outer</b> <b>shield</b> to protect against lightning and an inner shield grounded at one end to eliminate hum from the 400 Hz power system.|$|E

50|$|Some terminators have a {{metallic}} chain {{attached to them}} for grounding purposes, however many people never understood how to properly ground cabling and thus grounded the terminators at both ends rather than just one end.

40|$|Human {{ferritin}} {{heavy chain}} (HFt) {{has been demonstrated}} to possess considerable potential for targeted delivery of drugs and diagnostic agents to cancer cells. Here, we report {{the development of a}} novel HFt-based genetic construct (HFt-MP-PAS) containing a short peptide linker (MP) between each HFt subunit and an <b>outer</b> <b>shielding</b> polypeptide sequence rich in proline (P), serine (S) and alanine (A) residues (PAS). The peptide linker contains a matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) cleavage site that permits the protective PAS shield to be removed by tumor-driven proteolytic cleavage within the tumor microenvironment. For the first time HFt-MP-PAS ability to deliver doxorubicin to cancer cells, subcellular localization, and therapeutic efficacy on a xenogeneic mouse model of a highly refractory to conventional chemotherapeutics type of cancer were evaluated. HFt-MP-PAS-DOXO performance was compared with the novel albumin-based drug delivery system INNO- 206, currently in phase III clinical trials. The results of this work provide solid evidence indicating that the stimuli-sensitive, long-circulating HFt-MP-PAS nanocarriers described herein have the potential to be exploited in cancer therapy...|$|R

50|$|Two {{inert gases}} or gas {{mixtures}} are employed. The orifice gas at lower pressure and flow rate forms the plasma arc. The {{pressure of the}} orifice gas is intentionally kept low to avoid weld metal turbulence, but this low pressure {{is not able to}} provide proper shielding of the weld pool. To have suitable shielding protection same or another inert gas is sent through the <b>outer</b> <b>shielding</b> ring of the torch at comparatively higher flow rates. Most of the materials can be welded with argon, helium, argon+hydrogen and argon+helium, as inert gases or gas mixtures. Argon is very commonly used. Helium is preferred where a broad heat input pattern and flatter cover pass is desired without key hole mode weld. A mixture of argon and hydrogen supplies heat energy higher than when only argon is used and thus permits keyhole mode welds in nickel base alloys, copper base alloys and stainless steels.|$|R
50|$|Attenuation (loss) {{per unit}} length, in {{decibels}} per meter. This {{is dependent on}} the loss in the dielectric material filling the cable, and resistive losses in the center conductor and <b>outer</b> <b>shield.</b> These losses are frequency dependent, the losses becoming higher as the frequency increases. Skin effect losses in the conductors can be reduced by increasing the diameter of the cable. A cable with twice the diameter will have half the skin effect resistance. Ignoring dielectric and other losses, the larger cable would halve the dB/meter loss. In designing a system, engineers consider not only the loss in the cable but also the loss in the connectors.|$|E
5000|$|Coaxial cable, or coax (pronounced [...] ), {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} cable that has an inner conductor surrounded by a tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield.

Coaxial cable was invented by English engineer and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, who patented the design in 1880.Coaxial cable differs from other shielded cables because the dimensions of the cable are controlled to give a precise, constant conductor spacing, which is needed for it to function efficiently as a transmission line.|$|E

It is drawn down through the gauze then passes the flame and ascends the chimney. At the top it leaves through gauze and the top of the double shield. The inner chimney is made of copper coated with a fusible metal. If the lamp gets too hot the metal melts and closes up the air holes, extinguishing the lamp.|$|E
