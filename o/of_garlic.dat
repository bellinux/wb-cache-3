5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> and a bundle of mugwort, {{ordering}} them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{methods have}} {{confirmed}} the high prevalence of P. falciparum malaria in ancient Egypt. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus {{wrote that the}} builders of the Egyptian pyramids (circa 2700–1700 BCE) were given large amounts <b>of</b> <b>garlic,</b> probably to protect them against malaria. The Pharaoh Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} Fourth dynasty of Egypt, who reigned from around 2613–2589 BCE, used bed-nets as protection against mosquitoes. Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, similarly slept under a mosquito net. However, whether the mosquito nets were used for the purpose of malaria prevention, or for more mundane purpose of avoiding the discomfort of mosquito bites, is unknown. The presence of malaria in Egypt from circa 800 BCE onwards has been confirmed using DNA-based methods.|$|E
5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E

40|$|Black {{garlic is}} {{obtained}} from fresh garlic (Allium sativum L.) {{that has been}} fermented {{for a period of}} time at a controlled high temperature (60 – 90 °C) under controlled high humidity (80 – 90 %). When compared with fresh garlic, black garlic does not release a strong offensive flavor owing to the reduced content of allicin. Enhanced bioactivity <b>of</b> black <b>garlic</b> compared with that <b>of</b> fresh <b>garlic</b> is attributed to its changes in physicochemical properties. Studies concerning the fundamental findings <b>of</b> black <b>garlic,</b> such as its production, bioactivity, and applications, have thus been conducted. Several types <b>of</b> black <b>garlic</b> products are also available in the market with a fair selling volume.

40|$|Allyl sulfides, ajoenes and vinyldithiins are {{the three}} main groups of {{volatile}} organosulfur compounds that are formed when garlic is crushed. The manner garlic is processed (nature of the extraction medium, temperature…) has {{a major influence on}} their relative proportion and the amounts produced. It has been proven recently that the vinyldithiins are at the origin <b>of</b> <b>garlic’s</b> capacity to prevent adipocytes development. Their incorporation in garlic-based nutraceuticals is thus particularly interesting. In this context, this work aims to optimize the production <b>of</b> vinyldithiins from <b>garlic.</b> After having determined the best garlic origin (Spanish) and the best oil for the extraction (olive or sunflower oil), the extraction conditions were optimized (1 / 2 (w/w garlic oil), 37 °C, 6 h) and 133 mg of vinyldithiins was obtained from 100 g <b>of</b> fresh <b>garlic.</b> Carrying out the extraction under microwave irradiation allowed increasing the yield 3. 6 -fold (yield 486 mg of vinyldithiins from 100 g <b>of</b> fresh <b>garlic).</b> This study may also contribute to the development <b>of</b> new <b>garlic</b> derived high value products by enhancing the comprehension of their formation.

5000|$|Alliin [...] is a {{sulfoxide}} that is {{a natural}} constituent <b>of</b> fresh <b>garlic.</b> It is a derivative of the amino acid cysteine.

25|$|The phytochemicals {{responsible}} for the sharp flavor <b>of</b> <b>garlic</b> are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken by chopping, chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol). The resultant compounds are {{responsible for}} the sharp or hot taste and strong smell <b>of</b> <b>garlic.</b> Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time. Among the members of the onion family, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or leeks. Although many humans enjoy the taste <b>of</b> <b>garlic,</b> these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant. Because of this, people throughout history have used garlic to keep away insects such as mosquitoes and slugs.|$|E
