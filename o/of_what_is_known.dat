5|$|Notes - Simon bar Kokhba was the Jewish leader <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as the Bar Kokhba {{revolt against}} the Roman Empire in 132 CE, {{establishing}} an independent Jewish state which he ruled for three years as Nasi ("Prince").

5|$|The bulk <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> of Caligula {{comes from}} Suetonius and Cassius Dio. Suetonius wrote his history on Caligula 80 {{years after his}} death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 180 years after Caligula's death. Cassius Dio's work is {{invaluable}} because it alone gives a loose chronology of Caligula's reign.|$|E
5|$|Berenice {{was born}} in 28 to Herod Agrippa and Cypros, as granddaughter to Aristobulus IV and {{great-granddaughter}} to Herod the Great. Her elder brother was Agrippa II (b. 27), and her younger sisters were Mariamne (b. 34) and Drusilla (b. 38). According to Josephus, {{there was also a}} younger brother called Drusus, who died before his teens. Her family constituted part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> as the Herodian Dynasty, who ruled the Judaea Province between 39 BC and 92.|$|E

Du Fu was born in 712; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province (Gong county is a favourite candidate). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family.|$|E
5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> about Barbauld's life {{comes from}} two memoirs, the first {{published}} in 1825 and written by her niece Lucy Aikin, the second published in 1874 and written by her great-niece Anna Letitia Le Breton. Some letters from Barbauld to others also exist, however, a great many Barbauld family documents were lost in a fire that {{was the result of}} the London blitz in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> of Euler's {{religious}} beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work, Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister (Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily {{an argument for}} the divine inspiration of scripture.|$|E

Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony there and at the coroner's inquest, but only the reporter from The Daily Nugget knew shorthand. The testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two newspapers varied greatly.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Doctrine of Unstable Alliances {{is a rare}} {{example of}} a policy {{endorsement}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> in international relations as renversement des alliances ("reversal of alliances"): a state abandons an ally for an alliance with a recent enemy, possibly {{in opposition to the}} former ally. The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany has been cited as an example.|$|E
5|$|The assassins, the {{key members}} of the clandestine network, and the key Serbian {{military}} conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.|$|E

5|$|The first written {{records of}} native {{life in the}} Hebrides begin in the 6th century AD with the {{founding}} of the kingdom of Dál Riata. Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> of these times is the product of the monastic sites such as Iona, Lismore, Eigg and Tiree but north of Dál Riata, where the Inner and Outer Hebrides were nominally under Pictish control, the historical record is sparse.|$|E
5|$|The most {{comprehensive}} primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence {{between him and}} his younger brother, Theo. Their lifelong friendship, and most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890. Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support, and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{not alone}} in {{suffering}} from lead's effects; plants and animals are also affected by lead toxicity to varying degrees depending on species. Animals experience many of the same effects of lead exposure as humans do, such as abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and behavioral changes such as increased aggression. Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{the best}} ecologically studied {{seamount}} {{in the world}} is Davidson Seamount, with six major expeditions recording over 60,000 species observations. The contrast between the seamount and the surrounding area was well-marked. One of the primary ecological havens on the seamount is its deep sea coral garden, and many of the specimens noted were over a century old. Following the expansion of knowledge on the seamount there was extensive support to make it a marine sanctuary, a motion that was granted in 2008 as part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> about seamounts ecologically is based on observations from Davidson. Another such seamount is Bowie Seamount, which has also been declared a marine protected area by Canada for its ecological richness.|$|E
5|$|Péron did {{not report}} seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he {{described}} them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point questionnaire {{that he used to}} interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{account of the}} life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor Hadrian (117–138). His De Vita Caesarum is the source of much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror. The biography is problematic however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent libertine.|$|E
