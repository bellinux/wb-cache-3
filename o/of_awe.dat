5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E

40|$|Assay {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} proposed as a criterion for including psychiatric clinical outcome studies in meta-analyses. The authors assess the performance of assay sensitivity as a method for determining study appropriateness for meta-analysis by calculating expected standard drug vs placebo eect sizes for various combinations of high quality and awed studies. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>awed</b> studies, expected eect sizes are close to unbiased only when sample sizes are very large. In the presence <b>of</b> <b>awed</b> studies, expected eect sizes tend to be substantially biased except under simultaneous conditions of high power, a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>awed</b> studies, and a population standard vs placebo eect size <b>of</b> <b>awed</b> studies considerably {{lower than that of}} high quality studies. The authors conclude that this method is not robust and can lead to serious bias. Unless it can be shown that specic conditions hold, assay sensitivity should not be used to make quality judgments of studies. Copyright? 2005 Joh...|$|R

25|$|When Fonteyn danced the lead, {{the ballet}} was {{about her and}} her performance; however good today's interpreters may be, none has the mystique to reduce {{everyone}} else to the background, and so the supporting roles are now much more visible {{and need to be}} much more strongly depicted. It is generally accepted that Tirrenio was originally the most completely worked out role, inherited from Alexander Grant's lack <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> for Fonteyn; however the role has become difficult to cast as it was created to showcase Grant's unique mixture of gifts – classical virtuosity and flair for characterisation.|$|E
25|$|Collins, {{the son of}} {{a cattle}} dealer, grew up in a middle class Irish family in Camlough, a small, staunchly Irish republican town in South Armagh. Despite the {{sentiment}} of the area, the Collins family had no association and little interest in Irish Nationalist politics. Collins' mother was devout Catholic, and he was brought up under her influence with a sense <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> for the martyrs of that religion in Irish history, in its conflicts with Protestantism.After completing his schooling, Collins worked for a time in the Ministry of Defence in a clerical capacity in London before studying Law at Queen's University, where he became influenced by Marxist political ideology.|$|E

25|$|One {{study has}} {{suggested}} that infrasound may cause feelings <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> or fear in humans. It has also been suggested that since it is not consciously perceived, it may make people feel vaguely that odd or supernatural events are taking place. Engineer Vic Tandy provided such an explanation in his investigations in the 1980s. Tandy, while working in his laboratory, started to feel uneasy and as if a supernatural presence was with him. Later, he could attribute these feelings to a broken metal fan that was causing noises of a frequency that triggered them. The noise could not be perceived by the human ear, but Tandy's body reacted to the 19Hz sounds.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Rashi {{was first}} brought to learn Torah {{by his father}} on Shavuot day {{at the age of}} five. His father was his main Torah teacher until his death when Rashi was still a youth. At the age of 17 he married and soon after went to learn in the yeshiva of Rabbi Yaakov ben Yakar in Worms, {{returning}} to his wife three times yearly, for the Days <b>of</b> <b>Awe,</b> Passover and Shavuot. When Rabbi Yaakov died in 1064, Rashi continued learning in Worms for another year in the yeshiva of his relative, Rabbi Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, who was also chief rabbi of Worms. Then he moved to Mainz, where he studied under another of his relatives, Rabbi Isaac ben Judah, the rabbinic head of Mainz and one of the leading sages of the Lorraine region straddling France and Germany.|$|E
25|$|Native American tribes whose territories {{overlapped}} {{with those}} of grizzly bears often viewed them with a mixture <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> and fear. North American brown bears were so feared by the Natives that they were rarely hunted, especially alone. When Natives hunted grizzlies, the act {{was done with the}} same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4 to 10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian Indians actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of Natives or voyagers with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies. Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately 1 per year during the 1930s through the 1950s, though it increased to 4 per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to 1 injury every 2 years (0.5/year) during the 1970s. Between 1980-2002, there were only 2 grizzly bear-caused human injuries in a developed area. However, although grizzly attacks were rare in the back-country before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately 1 per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.|$|E

500|$|The game is {{intended}} to make the player feel [...] "small" [...] and {{to give them a}} sense <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> about their surroundings. The basic idea for the game, as designed by Chen, was to create a game that moved beyond the [...] "typical defeat/kill/win mentality" [...] of most video games. The team initially created a prototype named Dragon that involved players trying to draw away a large monster from other players, but eventually discarded it after finding it was too easy for players to ignore each other in favor of their own objectives.|$|E

[...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give me a sense <b>of</b> <b>awe.</b> Stuff like, 'It's Alright, Ma,' just the alliteration in that blows me away." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were considered}} {{some of the}} best on the Nintendo 64 due to their rich textures, long drawing distance, and real-time shadow generation, but were criticised for their inconsistent frame rate during certain points in the game. Nevertheless, GameSpot noted that the action level of the game was normally low enough that it [...] "does not significantly distract from the experience". Game Revolution said that the game was [...] "beautiful", but it did not meet the same level <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> as its predecessor. The game was also praised for its humour, with Edge commenting that its characters are [...] "impossible to dislike." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Amazing Grace", {{with the}} words written by Newton and joined with [...] "New Britain", the melody most {{currently}} associated with it, appeared {{for the first time}} in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847. It was, according to author Steve Turner, a [...] "marriage made in heaven... The music behind 'amazing' had a sense <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded graceful. There was a rise at the point of confession, as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness." [...] Walker's collection was enormously popular, selling about 600,000 copies all over the U.S. when the total population was just over 20 million. Another shape note tunebook named The Sacred Harp (1844) by Georgia residents Benjamin Franklin White and Elisha J. King became widely influential and continues to be used.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: [...] "That's a song where we were listening {{to a lot of}} Kate Bush last summer, and we wanted a song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was kind of feeling in a sense <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> and wonderment, so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles." [...] The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song [...] "Running Up that Hill". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: [...] "We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords. Some bands are reluctant to admit that they take things from other artists and bands that they listen to and we're shameless in that respect, we don't mind telling." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilgrim at Tinker Creek won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-fiction in 1975, when Dillard was 29 years old.

[...] Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote: [...] "The result {{is a lot of}} laughs and a feeling <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> toward the craftsmanship involved.
