5|$|In 1623, Kepler at last {{completed}} the Rudolphine Tables, {{which at the}} time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension — the root of the ongoing Thirty Years' War — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the Catholic Counter-Reformation placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to Ulm, where he arranged for the printing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tables</b> at his own expense.|$|E
5|$|In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn {{installed}} the Pong prototype {{at a local}} bar, Andy Capp's Tavern. They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bar's manager, Bill Gaddis; Atari supplied pinball machines to Gaddis. Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> near the other entertainment machines: a jukebox, pinball machines, and Computer Space. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next {{one and a half}} weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate Pong to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing; he intended to use Pong to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game. A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters.|$|E
5000|$|Each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{is divided}} into three scoring {{sections}} by straight lines across <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> scoring sections extend from <b>the</b> very edge <b>of</b> either end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> towards <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> covering approximately one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> outer scoring section, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> is labeled with the number [...] "3" [...] in the middle (for [...] "3 points"). The next section is adjacent to this section, of equal length (6 inches), and is labeled with a [...] "2." [...] The final section, [...] "1", is adjacent to section [...] "2." [...] This section continues {{all the way to the}} foul line. The foul line measures 6 feet from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> center third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> is unmarked. <b>The</b> line that separates <b>the</b> center third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "1 point" [...] section is called the [...] "foul line" [...] (a weight which does not pass the foul line closest to the player is removed from <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for <b>the</b> round). <b>The</b> <b>table</b> is surrounded by a gutter, or [...] "alley"; pucks that accidentally fall, or are knocked, into a gutter are out <b>of</b> play for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> round.|$|R

5|$|In 1999, Christian and Edge parted {{ways with}} Gangrel, who {{associated}} himself with The Hardy Boyz (Jeff and Matt Hardy) to form The New Brood; as a result, they began feuding with The Hardy Boyz, {{and went on}} to compete in a ladder match at the No Mercy PPV event on October 17, 1999, for the managerial services of Terri Runnels and $100,000, which The Hardy Boyz won. At Survivor Series, Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz faced Too Cool and The Hollys in a Four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match where they lost. At Armageddon, Edge and Christian competed in a 8-team battle royal which was won by The Acolytes. At Royal Rumble, Christian competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Rikishi. At No Way Out, Edge and Christian defeated The Hardy Boyz in a tag team match to determine the number one contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship. On April 2, 2000, at WrestleMania 2000, Christian and Edge defeated The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) to win their first WWF Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat Ladder match, which ultimately led to the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tables,</b> Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC). At Backlash, Christian and Edge defeated D-Generation X to retain titles. At Judgment Day, Edge and Christian and Kurt Angle lost a Six-man tag team match to Rikishi and Too Cool. They lost the tag titles to Too Cool soon after, but won them back in a four corners elimination match at King of the Ring. At Fully Loaded they defended the titles against The Acolytes Protection Agency (Faarooq and Bradshaw) where they got disqualified but retained the titles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} seventeenth century {{relatively}} {{large numbers of}} Scots took service in foreign armies involved in the Thirty Years' War, with 20–30,000 in Swedish service, a Scots brigade in the Netherlands, and 5–6,000 raised for Danish service in the period 1626–27, 11,000 for France and large numbers in the armies of eastern Europe, including German states, Poland and Russia. As armed confrontation between Scotland and the Charles I looked increasingly likely from 1637, the Standing Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tables</b> began {{to function as a}} war council. It appointed two lairds in every parish to draw up lists of men suitable for military service, arms and the names of Scots serving abroad so that they could be recalled. Three commissioners were appointed in each shire, two residing in Edinburgh and another remaining in the locality, where presbyteries appointed commissioners to communicate instructions to the parishes. Hundreds of Scots mercenaries returned home from foreign service, including experienced leaders like Alexander and David Leslie. These veterans {{played an important role in}} training the parish recruits. Nobles were able to raise regiments, which usually bore their name as colonel, and they could appoint company commanders, but the lieutenant colonel and sergeant major of the regiment, and the lieutenant and sergeant of each company, were to be professional soldiers. The returning soldiers also brought expertise in fortification and trace italliene fortifications were added at Leith, Burntisland and Greenock. They would play a major role in the siege of Edinburgh in 1650.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{function}} of the cascade {{is related to the}} methods of extracting the final traces of gold from the crushed ore. There were probably washing tables between the two tanks so that a gentle stream of water could be used to wash the ore on the rough surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> the finer gold being caught in the rougher parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> and removed {{at the end of the}} process.

25|$|Over {{the last}} few years, British {{universities}} {{have been subjected to}} the increasing popularity of national university league tables, which rank universities based on criteria such as their student-staff ratio, drop-out rates and spending on services and facilities.

25|$|As a minor detail {{important}} {{more for}} its form than its content, {{the operations of}} an algebra are traditionally organized as a list.

25|$|In the 11th century Shahnameh, the Persian poet Ferdowsi credits Burzoe {{with the}} {{invention}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> game nard in the 6th century. He describes an encounter between Burzoe and a Raja visiting from India. The Raja introduces {{the game of}} chess, and Burzoe demonstrates nard, played with dice made from ivory and teak. Today, Nard is the name for the Persian version of backgammon, which has different initial positions and objectives. H. J. R. Murray details many versions of backgammon; modern Nard is noted there as being the same as backgammon and maybe dating back to 300–500 AD in the Babylonian Talmud, although others believe the Talmud references the Greek race game Kubeia.|$|E

25|$|The {{formidable}} undertaking {{of reducing}} the accumulated planetary observations made at Greenwich from 1750 to 1830 was already in progress under Airy's supervision when he became Astronomer Royal. Shortly afterwards he undertook the further laborious task {{of reducing the}} enormous mass of observations of the moon made at Greenwich {{during the same period}} under the direction, successively, of James Bradley, Nathaniel Bliss, Nevil Maskelyne and John Pond, to defray the expense of which a large sum of money was allotted by the Treasury. As a result, no fewer than 8,000 lunar observations were rescued from oblivion, and were, in 1846, placed at the disposal of astronomers in such a form that they could be used directly for comparison with the theory and for the improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> of the moon's motion.|$|E
25|$|The city authorities, {{led by the}} Lieutenant General of Police, {{made the}} first serious efforts to improve traffic {{circulation}} in the congested streets of the city, by removing stones and barriers {{put in front of}} houses and by restricting the placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> and carts of street merchants. They also tried to improve the bottleneck of traffic created on the ten existing bridges over the Seine. The houses which lined the Pont au Change were pulled down, and a project was launched in 1725 to build a new bridge to connect two of the city's most wealthy new neighborhoods, the Faubourg de rue Saint-Honoré on the right bank and the Faubourg Saint-Germain on the right bank. Construction on the new bridge did not begin until 1788; stones from the demolished Bastille were used to help finish the bridge, which was dedicated in 1791 as the Pont Louis XVI. It was renamed the pont de la Revolution in 1792; then, in 1795, Pont de la Concorde.|$|E
25|$|Casino (1995), like The Age of Innocence before it, {{focused on}} a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is {{disrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success, but the film received mixed notices from critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier Goodfellas, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|E
