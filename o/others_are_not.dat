5|$|The various {{sections}} {{into which}} the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse were divided by Euthalian Apparatus and <b>others,</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> indicated in this manuscript. A cross appears occasionally as a separation in the Book of Acts. A larger letter in the margin throughout the New Testament {{marks the beginning of}} a paragraph.|$|E
5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying {{adjacent}} territory form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> Adjacent dialects typically have relatively high degrees of mutual intelligibility, but the degree of mutual intelligibility between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} some glyphs are {{modified}} with the “guiding star” dependent glyph, while <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> supports the idea that rongorongo was used for calendrical purposes in addition to astronomy and navigation. This is further evidenced by a tentative reading {{which is consistent with}} known astronomy. In the month of March, Rigel, Arcturus, and Sirius can be seen together, and the Milky Way appears in the north to the right of Arcturus. If one were sailing north, they would first see Arcturus on the horizon, and then Polaris. The arrangement of glyphs in this example, and the presence of 'guide modifiers' on Arcturus and Polaris, are consistent with these facts.|$|E

5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E
5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E

25|$|Women in non-Orthodox (Reform, Conservative, Karaite, Reconstructionist and <b>others)</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{prohibited}} from wearing a tallit, and usually encouraged to do so, especially when {{called to the}} Torah or leading services from the bimah.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of a PAH influences whether and how the individual compound is carcinogenic. Some carcinogenic PAHs are genotoxic and induce mutations that initiate cancer; <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> genotoxic and instead affect cancer promotion or progression.|$|E
25|$|The {{economist}} Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize {{winner and}} advocate of laissez-faire capitalism, believed that unionization frequently produces higher wages {{at the expense}} of fewer jobs, and that, if some industries are unionized while <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> wages will decline in non-unionized industries.|$|E

25|$|Murine {{models are}} widely used to test {{hypotheses}} linking genetic components of various diseases with sensorimotor gating. While some of the hypotheses stand to the test, <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> as some mice models show unchanged or increased PPI contrary to the expectations, as in the tests of COMT-deficient mice.|$|E
25|$|With the {{retirement}} of the Tomahawk antiship missile variant, only the Arleigh Burke-class ships before Flight IIA versions are well-equipped for antisurface warfare with Harpoon launchers. <b>Others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> but are loaded with SM-2 missiles in their vertical launch cells capable of an antiship mode, though they have limited range and damage potential.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the established monasteries, some parishes also have among their members Benedictine oblates. Some are associated with Christminster Monastery, while <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> associated with any particular monastery and thus are not oblates in the traditional Roman Catholic sense. These latter oblates are individuals who follow the Rule of Saint Benedict to foster their spiritual development.|$|E

25|$|Harvestmen (Opiliones) are {{an order}} of arachnids often {{confused}} with spiders, though the two orders are not closely related. Research on harvestman phylogeny (that is, the phylogenetic tree) {{is in a state}} of flux. While some families are clearly monophyletic, that is share a common ancestor, <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> and the relationships between families are often not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Lipids {{comprises}} {{a diverse}} range of molecules {{and to some extent}} is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin, including waxes, fatty acids, fatty-acid derived phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, and terpenoids (e.g., retinoids and steroids). Some lipids are linear aliphatic molecules, while others have ring structures. Some are aromatic, while <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> Some are flexible, while others are rigid.|$|E
25|$|For example, many smokers {{believe that}} they are taking all {{necessary}} precautionary measures so that they won't get lung cancer, such as smoking only once a day, or using filtered cigarettes, and believe that <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> taking the same precautionary measures. However, it is likely that many other smokers are doing the same things and taking those same precautions.|$|E

25|$|Locationless/Reverse caches {{are similar}} to a {{scavenger}} hunt. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates {{an example of this}} object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object and his or her GPS receiver. Typically <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> allowed to log that same location as a find.|$|E
25|$|In psychology, trait theory (also called dispositional theory) is an {{approach}} {{to the study of}} human personality. Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. According to this perspective, traits are relatively stable over time, differ across individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not),</b> and influence behavior. Traits are in contrast to states which are more transitory dispositions.|$|E
25|$|Any object {{radiating}} sound, {{including a}} loudspeaker system, {{can be thought}} of as being composed of combinations of such simple point sources. The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources is not the same as for a single source, but depends on the distance and orientation between the sources, the position relative to them from which the listener hears the combination, and the frequency of the sound involved. Using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources are easily solved; <b>others</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
