2500|$|This rough {{classification}} can {{be quantified}} by various definitions to express the moneyness as a number, measuring how far the asset is in the money or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> {{with respect to the}} strike – or conversely how far a strike is in or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> with respect to the spot (or forward) price of the asset. This quantified notion of moneyness is most importantly used in defining the relative volatility surface: the implied volatility in terms of moneyness, rather than absolute price. The most basic of these measures is simple moneyness, which is the ratio of spot (or forward) to strike, or the reciprocal, depending on convention. A particularly important measure of moneyness is the likelihood that the derivative will expire in the money, in the risk-neutral measure. It can be measured in percentage probability of expiring in the money, which is the forward value of a binary call option with the given strike, ...|$|E

2500|$|In finance, moneyness is the {{relative}} {{position of the}} current price (or future price) of an underlying asset (e.g., a stock) {{with respect to the}} strike price of a derivative, most commonly a call option or a put option. Moneyness is firstly a three-fold classification: if the derivative would make money if it were to expire today, it is said to be in the money, while if it would not make money it is said to be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and if the current price and strike price are equal, it is said to be at the money. There are two slightly different definitions, according to whether one uses the current price (spot) or future price (forward), specified as [...] "at the money spot" [...] or [...] "at the money forward", etc.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last major}} feud {{involved}} eight men. Several weeks before WrestleMania 23, {{it was announced}} that the Money in the Bank ladder match would be held again, {{as it was in the}} last two years. This year, however, there would be eight men involved, rather than six the two previous years had. Throughout the weeks leading up to WrestleMania 23, qualifying matches took place on all three shows. On an edition of Raw, Edge, the winner of the match held in 2005, defeated Rob Van Dam, the winner of the match held in 2006, to earn the first spot in the match. The next night on ECW, another cross-brand match took place, with CM Punk defeating Johnny Nitro to qualify. On that week's SmackDown!, King Booker became the third man to qualify, defeating Kane in a Falls Count Anywhere match after The Great Khali interfered. On the next edition of Raw, Jeff Hardy pinned Shelton Benjamin in a match to become the fourth man to qualify. The next night on ECW, Mr. Kennedy defeated Sabu in an Extreme Rules match to earn the fifth spot. On the next SmackDown!, two qualifying matches took place, with Matt Hardy and Finlay winning their respective match to qualify when Matt Hardy defeated Joey Mercury and Finlay defeated WWE US Champion, Chris Benoit & Montel Vontavious Porter in the Triple threat qualification match. The final qualifying match took place on Raw between Carlito and Ric Flair. The match was deemed a no contest after The Great Khali interfered and attacked both men. The following week, on Raw, Randy Orton defeated Flair and Carlito in an elimination match to become the final man to qualify. After Edge and Orton had split as a team, the two attempted to get the other taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> in the Bank ladder match. Both men failed, however, as Edge won a [...] "last chance" [...] battle royal to retain his spot and Orton won a match on ECW to retain his.|$|E
