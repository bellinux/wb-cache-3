5|$|Chiswick was {{historically}} {{the ancient}} parish of St Nicholas {{in the county}} of Middlesex, with an agrarian and fishing economy beside the river centred on Church Street. Having good communications with London from an early time, Chiswick became a popular country retreat, and as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> growth of London in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the population significantly expanded. It became the Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick in 1932 and has formed part of Greater London since 1965, when it was merged into the London Borough of Hounslow. Sublocalities include Bedford Park, Grove Park, the Glebe Estate, Strand-on-the-Green and those with named tube stations, Turnham Green and Gunnersbury, within its three full-sized wards of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|I-75/US23 {{enters the}} {{southern}} reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> Tri-Cities at Bridgeport and proceeds northward through the area. The freeway passes {{to the east}} of downtown Saginaw. I-675 splits off to run westward into downtown, and I-75 curves around to the northwest to cross the Saginaw River on the Zilwaukee Bridge in the suburb of Zilwaukee. North of the river, I-675 reconnects to I-75, which continues northward into Bay County. The freeway passes to the west of Bay City, encountering the eastern end of the US10 freeway. From there, I-75/US23 curves northwesterly to bypass Kawkawlin before continuing north to the Standish area through farmlands inland from the Saginaw Bay. West of Standish, US23 splits to follow the Lake Huron shoreline, and I-75 turns northwesterly to run inland.|$|E

5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> light rail Holmenkollen Line {{to the city}} center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on {{the location of the}} terminal station. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire of London {{was a major}} {{conflagration}} {{that swept}} through the central parts of the English city of London from Sunday, 2 September to Wednesday, 5 September 1666. The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall. It threatened but did not reach the aristocratic district of Westminster, Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> slums. It consumed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, {{and most of the}} buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> lines tempted KES {{to extend}} their {{streetcar}} service west from Skøyen as a suburban line; the Lilleaker Line opened to Lilleaker in 1919, to Avløs in 1924 and to Kolsås in 1930. A new section from Jar to Sørbyhaugen opened in 1942, connecting the line from Jar to Kolsås to Nationaltheatret, and making it a rapid transit and the replacement of stock with wide suburban standard. This service remained part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier, that had bought all the streetcar companies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Metro, known colloquially as Metro and branded Metrorail, is {{the heavy}} rail rapid transit system serving the Washington {{metropolitan}} {{area in the}} United States. It {{is administered by the}} Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which also operates Metrobus service under the Metro name. Besides the District of Columbia, Metro serves several jurisdictions in the states of Maryland and Virginia. In Maryland, Metro provides service to Montgomery and Prince George's counties; in Virginia, to Arlington and Fairfax counties and the independent city of Alexandria. Combined with its ridership in the independent Virginia cities of Falls Church and Fairfax, the Metro service area is largely coextensive with the inner ring of the Washington metropolitan area. The system is currently being expanded to reach Dulles International Airport and Loudoun County, Virginia. It operates mostly as a subway in the District itself, while most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> tracks are at surface level or elevated.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was to be}} {{built as}} a two-lane {{alternative}} to Route31 defining the border <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> and rural portions of Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local street network was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would be provided to maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds {{to put together the}} survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the survey were originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of inner London (then the County of London) {{had been in}} decline as more residents moved into the outer suburbs since its creation in 1889, and this continued after the Second World War. In contrast, the {{population of}} Middlesex had increased steadily during that period. From 1951 to 1961 {{the population of the}} inner districts of the county started to fall, and the population grew only in eight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> outer districts. According to the 1961 census, Ealing, Enfield, Harrow, Hendon, Heston & Isleworth, Tottenham, Wembley, Willesden and Twickenham had each reached a population greater than 100,000, which would normally have entitled each of them to seek county borough status. If this status were to be granted to all those boroughs it would mean that the population of the administrative county of Middlesex would be reduced by over half, to just under one million.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s {{a number}} of rail lines were {{decommissioned}} as government funds were geared towards the provision of better roads, {{but by the end}} of that decade it was clear that public transport also needed to be upgraded. A report delivered in 1970 recommended the electrification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> railway network, the construction of the Merivale Street Bridge and a range of operational improvements, including the creation of a separate public transport authority. By 8 May 1979 the overhead lines between Corinda and Roma Street were switched on as part of the electrification project between Darra and Ferny Grove, which was the first section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suburban</b> network to be completed.|$|E
