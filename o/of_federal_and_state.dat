In March 1972, the entire cost of the section between 34th Street and 126th Street, according to the project's Draft Environmental Study, {{was estimated to be}} $381 million. In June 1972, it was announced that the UMTA would grant $25 million for the construction of this section of the line. The MTA had requested $254 million in federal funds for {{the northern part of the}} line. Preliminary estimates of the cost of the southern portion of the line came to $450 million.|$|E
5|$|The New York State Department of Transportation has {{scheduled}} for NY28N to undergo construction in spring 2013, to rehabilitate the {{bridge over the}} Upper Hudson River Railroad. The $5.9million project is projected to be complete in fall of 2015, and is to be supported by state and federal funds. New York State Department of Transportation has also planned for NY28N's bridge over Stillwater Brook in Minerva to be replaced with a stronger structure. The development of the project {{is expected to take}} place 2014, with bids and construction starting in 2016. The project has been set to end in 2017, and is predicted to cost $1.1million <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> funds.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>State</b> {{funding was}} obtained, {{and despite the}} controversy over the number of stops and route, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 27, 1972 at Second Avenue and 103rd Street. Construction began shortly thereafter on what was to be the 99th–105th Streets segment, which was projected to cost $17.48 million (worth about $ today). However, the city soon experienced its most dire fiscal crisis yet, due to the stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs, and in September 1975 construction on the line stopped, and the tunnels were sealed. Over the next few decades, the MTA regularly inspected and maintained the tunnel segments (spending $20,000 a year by the early 1990s), to maintain the structural integrity of the streets above, and in case construction would ever resume. Trespassers would often camp in the tunnels until the MTA increased security.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

25|$|United States {{antitrust}} {{law is a}} collection <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> government laws that regulates the conduct and organization of business corporations, generally to promote fair competition {{for the benefit of}} consumers. (The concept is called competition law in other English-speaking countries.) The main statutes are the Sherman Act 1890, the Clayton Act 1914 and the Federal Trade Commission Act 1914. These Acts, first, restrict the formation of cartels and prohibit other collusive practices regarded as being in restraint of trade. Second, they restrict the mergers and acquisitions of organizations that could substantially lessen competition. Third, they prohibit the creation of a monopoly and the abuse of monopoly power.|$|E
25|$|The head {{of state}} is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as {{representative}} of the nation. Examples include the President of Germany (appointed by members <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> legislatures), the Queen of the United Kingdom (an hereditary office), and the President of Austria (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the presidential system, found in the United States and in Brazil. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both {{head of state}} and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature {{to which it is}} not accountable.|$|E

25|$|The {{household}} income Gini index for the United States was 0.468 in 2009, {{according to the}} US Census Bureau, though it varied significantly between states. The states of Utah, Alaska and Wyoming have a pre-tax income inequality Gini coefficient that is 10% lower than the average, while Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico 10% higher. After including the effects <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> taxes, the U.S. Federal Reserve estimates 34 states in the USA have a Gini coefficient between 0.30 and 0.35, {{with the state of}} Maine the lowest. At the county and municipality levels, the pre-tax Gini index ranged from 0.21 to 0.65 in 2010 across the United States, according to Census Bureau estimates.|$|E

25|$|Under Brown, San Francisco's {{city hall}} was {{restored}} from damages sustained during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Brown insisted on restoring the light courts {{and having the}} dome gilded with more than US$400,000 in real gold. The Embarcadero was redeveloped and the Mission Bay Development project began. Brown also oversaw {{the approval of the}} Catellus Development Corp., US$100 million restoration of the century-old Ferry Building, the new Asian Art Museum, the new M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center and San Francisco International Airport's new international terminal. Brown worked to restructure the Housing Authority. Brown helped established an AFL-CIO housing trust to build affordable housing and he worked to increase the city’s share <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> grants. He oversaw declining crime rates and improvements in the city’s economy, finances, and credit ratings during his first term.|$|E

U.S. Route 422, the major east-west artery, circles {{the western edge}} of the city and is known locally as The West Shore Bypass. PA Route 12 is known as the Warren Street Bypass, as it bypasses the city to the north. U.S. Route 222 bypasses the city to the west. PA Route 10 is known as Morgantown Road. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, the section of current U.S. Route 222 from Spring Blvd to 5th Street Highway was known locally as the 'Road to Nowhere'.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, he was {{appointed}} Assistant Attorney General {{in charge of the}} Office of Legal Counsel. In this capacity, Rankin may best be remembered for arguing in favor of the African-American plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), advocating that the doctrine of “separate-but-equal” facilities for blacks and whites was unconstitutional. After the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown, Rankin argued in a presentation before the Court that the effort to desegregate schools should take place gradually in an effort to avoid any violence that might arise from the decision. Accordingly, he suggested the plan by which local school districts submitted desegregation plans to federal judges in their states. In addition, Rankin argued a great range of other important cases before the Supreme Court. He was instrumental in resolving conflicting claims among Western states to the Colorado River, and in establishing a balance <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> jurisdictions in offshore oil drilling.|$|E

25|$|The {{plaintiff}} in that suit, Robert Blankenship, charged that DeLay {{and a third}} partner in Albo Pest Control had breached the partnership agreement by trying to force {{him out of the}} business without buying him out. Blankenship filed suit, charging DeLay and the other partner with breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, wrongful termination, and loss of corporate expectancy. While being deposed in that suit, DeLay claimed that he did not think that he was an officer or director of Albo and that he believed that he had resigned two or three years previously. However, his congressional disclosure forms, including one filed subsequent to the deposition, stated that he was either president or chairman of the company between 1985 and 1994. Blankenship also alleged that Albo money had been spent on DeLay's congressional campaigns, in violation <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> law. DeLay and Blankenship settled for an undisclosed sum. Blankenship's attorney said that had he known about the congressional disclosure forms, he would have referred the case to the Harris County district attorney's office for a perjury prosecution.|$|E
500|$|If Article 73(a) was {{intended}} to be an empowering provision, its exclusion would have disempowered the Parliament from legislating within Singapore, an absurd result which could not have been intended. Instead, the Court held that the provision was a provision regulating the [...] "relations between the Federation and the States", as the title of Part VI of the Malaysian Constitution states. This was supported by the text found in the marginal note ("extent <b>of</b> <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>state</b> laws") and the relevant chapter ("distribution of legislative powers"). Additionally, the opening words to Article 73(a) – [...] "In exercising the legislative powers conferred on it by this Constitution ..." [...] – already indicated that it was presupposed that extraterritorial powers had been conferred. As Article 73(a) was not an empowering provision, it had been excluded merely because it was irrelevant to the RSIA and it did not disempower the Parliament of its extraterritorial legislative powers.|$|E
