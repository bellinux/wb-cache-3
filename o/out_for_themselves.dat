5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, the Quebec Agreement subsumed the British Tube Alloys project {{into the}} Manhattan Project, and {{established}} the Combined Policy Committee {{to control the}} Manhattan Project. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May 1944. Under it, the Americans would assist {{with the construction of}} a heavy water-moderated nuclear reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium chemistry or metallurgy, although irradiated uranium slugs were made available for the British to work it <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> A sticking point was the director of the Montreal Laboratory, Hans von Halban, who was a poor administrator, did not work well with the Canadians, and was regarded as a security risk by the Americans. In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Montreal Laboratory scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft would become the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|While {{some aspects}} of {{cooperation}} resumed quickly, it took longer to finalize the details {{with respect to the}} Montreal Laboratory. Brigadier General Leslie Groves (the director of the Manhattan Project), Chadwick (now the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project), and Mackenzie negotiated recommendations, which were approved by the Combined Policy Committee on 13 April 1944. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May. Under it, the Americans would assist with the construction of a heavy water reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium or plutonium chemistry, although irradiated uranium slugs would be made available for the British to work it <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> The Americans had already built their own heavy water reactor, Chicago Pile-3, which went critical in May 1944. The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.|$|E

25|$|Mediation is {{a process}} during which abductors and the left behind family, {{assisted}} by mediator(s), attempt to resolve conflicts independent of the judicial system. Mediators create a constructive atmosphere for discussions and ensure fair dealings between parents. The mediators do not make decisions; instead, they confine themselves to assisting the parties in working <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> a fair and sensible solution to their problems. More specifically, the mediation can address not only the child’s primary residence, but also the child’s contact with both parents, visitation arrangements, agreements concerning the child’s maintenance, schooling, further education, bi-cultural and bi-lingual upbringing, necessary arrangements for financial support etc.|$|E

500|$|Writer Diane Hamer attests that Bannon's {{books and}} {{characters}} represent {{a part of}} identity where women are unsure if they are gay or straight, man or woman, ashamed or accepting of who they are. In receiving no clear answers from Bannon herself, women were left {{to try to figure}} these questions <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> Hamer writes, [...] "What Bannon did was to provide a range of possible trajectories to lesbianism... Bannon, by constructing fictional biographies for her lesbian characters, produced a new knowledge about how one arrives at a lesbian identity." ...|$|E

500|$|Spin {{magazine}} {{awarded the}} album a [...] "B−" [...] rating, describing it as [...] "heavy on nuts and bolts, light on bolts from the blue". The reviewer {{felt that the}} group's lineup suggested a greater potential than the resultant album offered, but called it [...] "solid" [...] nonetheless. Matt Rhodes, writing for Consequence of Sound, reviewed the album positively, stating that [...] "frankly, this album sounds like dark, kinky sex". Rhodes compared it to the works of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, and felt that Denison's guitar parts served to specifically compliment Patton's vocals, rather than attempting to stand <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> Tom Mallon of CMJ New Music Monthly felt that the album presented a more cohesive group than was present on Tomahawk, allowing the band to [...] " [...] out of the shadows" [...] of their previous careers.

2500|$|A counter {{argument}} {{would be}} that the Berbers merely imitated the success of the Arab Muslims; the better historical choice would be more uniquely ethnic and authentic, i.e., to articulate their own inner character and fate.

[...] "From the first century B.C. to the eighth century A.D. the will of the Berbers to be themselves is revealed by the continuity of their efforts to reconstitute the kingdoms of the Carthaginian period, and in this sense the movement was crowned with success."

2500|$|Criminal defense {{attorney}} Angelyn Gates of Chase Criminal Defense Attorneys raises concern that citizen groups {{are not subject}} to the same standards as trained law enforcement officials. She notes that laws are designed to keep police officers from violating citizens' rights, and that the same rules don't apply to citizens who may be violating other citizens' rights. [...] "Police officers are trained in theory," [...] Gates said. [...] " [...] are not watching <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> by trying to pretend they're a child on the Internet," [...] she said.

[...] Detective Mike Burns of Darke County asserts that Perverted-Justice sets stricter criteria than many law enforcement agencies do for arrest. He contends that Perverted-Justice subscribes to protocols well within those followed by law enforcement. He does however concede, [...] "Sometimes it was a fine line, but they provided us with 140 people they were chatting with after 10 days with possibilities of showing up for a meeting.

2500|$|A counter {{argument}} {{would be}} that the Berbers at first merely participated in the martial success of the Arab Muslims; the better historical choice for the Berbers would be more uniquely ethnic and thus more authentic, i.e., to articulate their own inner character and fate, and follow that. Prof. Abdallah Laroui, however, interprets the North African panorama as indicating that the Berbers did in fact carve <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> an independent role. [...] "From the first century B.C. to the eighth century A.D. the will of the Berbers to be themselves is revealed by the continuity of their efforts to reconstitute their kingdoms of the Carthaginian period, and in this sense the movement was crowned with success." [...] Here Laroui apparently favorably compares the ancient Berber King Masinissa and his regime, e.g., to the Rustamid kingdom, and later to the medieval Islamic Almoravids and Almohads, and to the Zirid and the Hafsid dynasties, all Berber creations. By choosing to ally not with nearby Europe, familiar in memory by the Roman past, but rather with the newcomers from distant Arabia, the Berbers knowingly decided their future and historical path.

2500|$|Eventually, the Organization seizes {{physical}} {{control of}} Southern California, including {{the nuclear weapons}} at Vandenberg Air Force Base which serve as a deterrent. While in control of California, the Organization ethnically cleanses the area of all non-whites by forcing them to leave the immediate area and flee to the Eastern states, where they begin to take out their anger against ordinary whites. The resulting racial conflict in the east causes many whites to [...] "wake up" [...] and begin fleeing to California which now becomes a white sanctuary. Deliberately fomenting racial conflict {{is referred to as}} [...] "demographic warfare" [...] which begins bringing in new recruits to both the Organization and the Order. All Jews and mixed-race individuals are summarily executed. During this time, the Organization raids a black sanctuary and discovers a cannibalism operation where blacks kidnap whites, butcher them, and then eat them. The Organization raids the houses of all individuals reported to be [...] "race traitors" [...] in some way (such as judges, professors, lawyers, politicians, journalists, entertainers, race-mixers, etc.), drags them from their homes, and publicly hangs them in the streets in an event which comes {{to be known as the}} [...] "Day of the Rope". Most of these public executions are filmed for propaganda purposes. The Organization has little use for most white [...] "mainstream" [...] Americans. Those on the left are seen as dupes or willing agents of the Jews, while conservatives and libertarians are regarded as mere businessmen <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> or misguided fools, because, the Organization states, the Jews [...] "took over according to the Constitution, fair and square."
