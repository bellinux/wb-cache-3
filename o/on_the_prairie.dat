5|$|The Tower of Babble: Sins, Secrets and Successes {{inside the}} CBC is a Canadian non-fiction book written by Richard Stursberg. The {{book is a}} memoir {{detailing}} Stursberg's experience as the vice-president in charge of English services at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) between October 2004 and August 2010. Stursberg was recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch who understood and supported Stursberg's intention to move the CBC's focus more towards producing popular content with success and failure defined {{by the number of}} people who watch, rather than awards or critical praise. The book covers a range of topics relating to CBC, including acquiring popular shows, like Little Mosque <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prairie</b> and Heartland, for CBC Television, modernizing news coverage at CBC News, adjustments to CBC Radio, and CBC Sports losing broadcasting rights to its competitors.|$|E
5|$|The rigors {{and rewards}} of pioneer life <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>prairie</b> {{are the subject}} of Giants in the Earth by Ole Rolvaag and the Little House series of children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Small-town life is portrayed grimly by Sinclair Lewis in the novel Main Street, and more gently and affectionately by Garrison Keillor in his tales of Lake Wobegon. St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald writes of the social insecurities and {{aspirations}} of the young city in stories such as Winter Dreams and The Ice Palace (published in Flappers and Philosophers). Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha was inspired by Minnesota and names many of the state's places and bodies of water. Minnesota native Robert Zimmerman (Bob Dylan) won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into ten subject-related chapters. The first chapter {{provides}} an introduction to how Stursberg entered the CBC scene, how he viewed his role replacing the retiring Harold Redekopp as the executive {{vice president in charge}} of English services, and previews what challenges he would encounter. The second chapter covers his experience entering CBC senior management amid contract negotiations with its union, the resulting lock out during summer 2005, and the relations between what he labeled the Gang of Four (senior management) and the Central Committee (union representatives). In the third chapter, Entertainment, he explains his plan for re-orienting CBC television towards entertainment which would use audience numbers to gauge success. He cancelled critically acclaimed shows (Da Vinci's City Hall, This Is Wonderland, and Opening Night) which had low ratings and ordered what he expected would be more audience-friendly shows. Beginning in summer 2006, the first new show under Stursberg's strategy, , received very low ratings and was quickly cancelled. That Autumn's schedule, though, was successful, introducing Little Mosque <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prairie,</b> The Tudors, Heartland. The nest year's schedule introduced the successful The Border and Being Erica but also the unsuccessful MVP and jPod. Strusberg's move of Marketplace to Friday nights resulted in higher ratings but his plan to move The National to 11pm was denied by the CBC board of directors. In the fourth chapter, The French, he details his relationship with his French counterpart, the style differences between English and French television shows, the disproportionate funding given to the French services, and the lack of CBC Board members who can understand French. As a means of trying to bridge the two cultures, he ordered English versions of the popular Quebec shows Rumours and Sophie but both received low ratings in English Canada.|$|E
