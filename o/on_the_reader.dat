25|$|Octopus card fares are {{calculated}} {{based on the}} minimum number of stops travelled (from origin to destination stops), rather {{than the number of}} fare zones travelled through. All stops have Octopus entry and exit processors at the entrances to and exits from platforms. Passengers may enter the system after placing their Octopus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> of an orange-coloured 'Entry Processor' reader. This action is known as validation. At this point, The maximum fare is deducted from the Octopus. On completion of a journey, the card previously read by an 'Entry Processor' must be placed on a dark-green coloured 'Exit Processor', where the maximum fare less the fare incurred is refunded. Failure to do so within the time limit would cause the fare difference to be forfeited. As a side note, if a person exits the same platform with the same Octopus card with 5 minutes, the fare deducted will be fully refunded.|$|E
25|$|However, Amaryll Beatrice Chanady distinguishes magical realist {{literature}} from fantasy literature ("the fantastic") based on differences between three shared dimensions: {{the use of}} antinomy (the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes), the inclusion of events that cannot be integrated into a logical framework, {{and the use of}} authorial reticence. In fantasy, the presence of the supernatural code is perceived as problematic, something that draws special attentionwhere in magical realism, the presence of the supernatural is accepted. In fantasy, while authorial reticence creates a disturbing effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> it works to integrate the supernatural into the natural framework in magical realism. This integration is made possible in magical realism as the author presents the supernatural as being equally valid to the natural. There is no hierarchy between the two codes. The ghost of Melquíades in Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude or the baby ghost in Toni Morrison's Beloved who visit or haunt the inhabitants of their previous residence are both presented by the narrator as ordinary occurrences; the reader, therefore, accepts the marvelous as normal and common.|$|E

500|$|In Chekhov's lifetime, British and Irish critics {{generally}} did {{not find}} his work pleasing; E. J. Dillon thought [...] "the effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> of Chekhov's tales was repulsion at the gallery of human waste represented by his fickle, spineless, drifting people" [...] and R. E. C. Long said [...] "Chekhov's characters were repugnant, and that Chekhov reveled in stripping the last rags of dignity from the human soul". After his death, Chekhov was reappraised. Constance Garnett's translations won him an English-language readership and the admiration of writers such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Katherine Mansfield, whose story [...] "The Child Who Was Tired" [...] is similar to Chekhov's [...] "Sleepy". The Russian critic D. S. Mirsky, who lived in England, explained Chekhov's popularity in that country by his [...] "unusually complete rejection of what we may call the heroic values." [...] In Russia itself, Chekhov's drama fell out of fashion after the revolution, but it was later incorporated into the Soviet canon. The character of Lopakhin, for example, was reinvented as a hero of the new order, rising from a modest background so as eventually to possess the gentry's estates.|$|E
500|$|Sequels, prequels and adaptations {{based on}} Austen's work range from {{attempts}} to enlarge on {{the stories in}} Austen's own style to the soft-core pornographic novel Virtues and Vices (1981) and fantasy novel Resolve and Resistance (1996). Beginning {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels. By 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations of Austen's works. According to Lynch, [...] "her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist". Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A. Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to [...] "the world of Jane Austen". The texts that continue the story are [...] "generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest" [...] and [...] "often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque". Those that emphasise nostalgia are [...] "defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of postmodern playfulness and predilection for insider joking", relying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> to see the web of Austenian allusions.|$|E
