5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone out <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's {{original}} arguments received powerful restatement {{and expansion}} from Sir Ronald Syme, who devoted three books {{to the subject}} and was prepared to date {{the writing of the}} work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395. Although it was believed that the History Augusta did not reference any material from Ammianus Marcellinus' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period, this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the Historia Augusta does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.|$|E
5|$|The singers of {{the second}} era of the concerto delle donne were officially ladies-in-waiting of Duchess Margherita Gonzaga d'Este, but were hired {{primarily}} as singers. Peverara's musical abilities prompted the Duke to specifically ask his wife Margherita to bring Peverara from Mantua {{as part of her}} retinue. The new singers played instruments, including the lute, harp, and viol, but focused their energies on developing vocal virtuosity. This skill became highly prized in the mid-sixteenth century, beginning with basses like Brancaccio, {{but by the end of}} the century virtuosic bass singing went out <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> higher voices came into vogue. The ladies' musical duties included performing with the duchess' balletto delle donne, a group of female dancers who frequently crossdressed. Despite their upper-class background, the singers would not have been welcomed into the court's inner circle had they not been such skilled performers. D'Arco belonged to the nobility, but a minor family only. Peverara was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Molza came from a prominent family of artists.|$|E

5|$|The statehouse {{was built}} of blue limestone, two stories high. The {{governor}} and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor, and the legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building {{was the site of}} many great events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out <b>of</b> <b>style,</b> <b>and</b> the building was beginning to become decrepit. The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to be condemned. It was finally demolished in 1877.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{received}} general critical acclaim, with critics praising Gaga's singing abilities, the theatricality of the show, and {{her sense}} <b>of</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> fashion. The Monster Ball was a commercial success, with sold-out shows {{and demand for}} tickets prompting organizers to add more dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed an estimated US$227.4million from 200reported shows and an audience of 2.5million. At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, {{as well as the}} Concert Marketing & Promotion Award, the latter being an acknowledgment of her partnership with sponsor Virgin Mobile. HBO filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Documenting the whole concert with intersperses of backstage footage, , aired in May and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 21, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, Edward Gibbon had {{observed}} {{that there was}} something wrong with the numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject. A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who was meant to be writing his biographies in 305-6. Then in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve at least some of the six Scriptores as distinct persons and in favor of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the Scriptores work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter (editor of the Augustan History and of the Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae) proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis <b>of</b> <b>style</b> <b>and</b> language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate (useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda).|$|E

25|$|Philologists have {{generally}} held the legendary sagas in less esteem, {{in terms of}} their literary value, than the Icelanders' sagas.
