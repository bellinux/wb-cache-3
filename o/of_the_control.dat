5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes the time-delayed cubic {{velocity}} feedback control strategy to improve <b>the</b> isolation performance <b>of</b> High-Static-Low-Dynamic-Stiffness (HSLDS) vibration isolator. Firstly, <b>the</b> primary resonance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> HSLDS vibration isolator is obtained by using multiple scales method. The equivalent damping ratio and equivalent resonance frequency are defined to study <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> feedback gain and time delay on the primary resonance. The jump phenomenon analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> system without and with time delay is investigated by using Sylvester resultant method and optimization method, respectively. <b>The</b> stability analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> system is also considered. Then, the 1 / 3 subharmonic resonance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> system is studied by using multiple scales method. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> feedback gain and time delay on the 1 / 3 subharmonic resonance are also presented. Finally, force transmissibility is proposed to evaluate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> system and {{compared with an}} equivalent linear passive vibration isolator. The results show that <b>the</b> vibration amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controlled</b> system around <b>the</b> resonance frequency region decreases and the isolation frequency band is larger compared to the equivalent one. A better isolation performance in the high frequency band can be achieved compared to the passive HSLDS vibration isolator...|$|R

5|$|Sam Mendes {{directed}} a 1993 RSC production in which Simon Russell Beale's Ariel was openly resentful <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> exercised by Alec McCowen's Prospero. Controversially, {{in the early}} performances of the run, Ariel spat at Prospero, once granted his freedom. An entirely different effect was achieved by George C. Wolfe in the outdoor New York Shakespeare Festival production of 1995, where the casting of Aunjanue Ellis as Ariel opposite Patrick Stewart's Prospero charged the production with erotic tensions. Productions in the late 20th-century have gradually increased the focus placed on sexual tensions between the characters, including Prospero/Miranda, Prospero/Ariel, Miranda/Caliban, Miranda/Ferdinand and Caliban/Trinculo.|$|E

The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.|$|E
