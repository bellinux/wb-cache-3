5|$|To improve Britain's {{cultural}} influence abroad, Wheeler {{had been}} urging the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>British</b> Institute of History and Archaeology in East Africa, touring East Africa itself in August 1955. In 1956 the Academy requested £6,000 from the Treasury to fund this new institution, {{to which they}} eventually agreed in 1959. The Institute was initially established in Dar es Salaam in 1961, although later relocated to Nairobi. Meanwhile, Wheeler had also been campaigning for the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>British</b> Institute of Persian Studies, a project which {{was supported by the}} British Embassy in Tehran; they hoped that it would rival the successful French Institute in the city. In 1960, the Treasury agreed, with the new institution being housed on the premises of the University of Tehran. He further campaigned for the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>British</b> Institute in Japan, although these ideas were scrapped amid the British financial crisis of 1967.|$|E
