25|$|An {{even more}} {{sophisticated}} group of tone mapping algorithms is based <b>on</b> <b>contrast</b> or gradient domain methods, which are 'local'. Such operators concentrate on preserving contrast between neighboring regions rather than absolute value, an approach {{motivated by the}} fact that the human perception is most sensitive to contrast in images rather than absolute intensities. Those tone mapping methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall image contrast, and may as a side effect produce halo-like glows around dark objects. Examples of such tone mapping methods include: gradient domain high dynamic range compression and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of High Dynamic Range Images (a tone mapping is one of the applications of this framework).|$|E

Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography may also be used, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography {{may be useful in}} some cases. [...] Abdominal ultrasound is less sensitive and will miss small tumors, but can identify cancers that have spread to the liver and build-up of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites). [...] It may be used for a quick and cheap first examination before other techniques.|$|E

In 1995, Pryor, Suptic, and friend Kevin Zelko saved money to self-release [...] "Shorty/The Breathing Method", their first 7-inch. However, due to an unwillingness to tour, Shay was replaced by Robert's younger brother Ryan in April 1996. The band became increasingly popular in the burgeoning underground Midwestern music scene, forming strong relationships with bands such as Rocket Fuel Is The Key, Coalesce and Braid. After the [...] "Shorty" [...] 7-inch, the band released [...] "A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts" [...] <b>on</b> <b>Contrast</b> Records.

500|$|No single {{camouflage}} {{pattern is}} effective in all terrains. The effectiveness of a pattern depends <b>on</b> <b>contrast</b> as well as colour tones. Strong contrasts which disrupt outlines are better suited for environments such as forests where the play of light and shade is prominent, while low contrasts are better suited to open terrain with little shading structure. Terrain-specific camouflage patterns, made to match the local terrain, {{may be more effective}} in that terrain than more general patterns. However, unlike an animal or a civilian hunter, military units may need to cross several terrain types like woodland, farmland and built up areas in a single day. While civilian hunting clothing may have almost photo-realistic depictions of tree bark or leaves (indeed, some such patterns are based on photographs), military camouflage is designed to work in a range of environments. With the cost of uniforms in particular being substantial, most armies operating globally have two separate full uniforms, one for woodland/jungle and one for desert and other dry terrain. An American attempt at a global camouflage pattern for all environments (the 2004 UCP) was however withdrawn after a few years of service. On {{the other end of the}} scale are terrain specific patterns like the [...] "Berlin camo", applied to British vehicles operating in Berlin during the Cold War, where square fields of various gray shades was designed to hide vehicles against the mostly concrete architecture of post-war Berlin.|$|E

[...] However, with the introduction of focal-plane phase detect autofocusing in mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras by Sony, Fuji, Olympus and Panasonic, cameras can now employ both phase detect and contrast detect AF points.|$|E
