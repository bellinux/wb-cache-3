40|$|We report {{comprehensive}} {{measurements of}} <b>optical</b> <b>activities,</b> polarization shift and circular dichroism, in the visible range for double-layered structures {{consisting of a}} thin top air-hole on a metal layer and a bottom complementary metal layer of six-armed gammadion arrays. Large polarization shift and normalized circular dichroism are observed for gammadions with arms jointed together at gammadion centres. The activities are smaller for disjointed-arm gammadions. In contrast, no activities are observed for single-layered gammadions obtained from the double-layered structures by a lift-off process, indicating that the three-dimensional nature of the complementary gammadion structures is essential in producing large <b>optical</b> <b>activities.</b> Furthermore, the double-layered complementary gammadion structures obey the reciprocal property despite the asymmetric nature of the complementary samples...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the <b>optical</b> <b>activities</b> of left- and {{right-handed}} micro-spirals fabricated in dichromate gelatin emulsions using a holographic interference technique involving six linearly polarized side beams and one circularly polarized central beam. Photonic bandgaps in the visible range are observed. More importantly, opposite optical activities-a polarization rotation of a few degrees and a circular dichroism (CD) of about 20 % at the photonic band edges-are observed for the left-and right-handed spirals. Furthermore, the transmittance of circularly polarized light obeys the Lorentz reciprocity lemma for forward and backward incidence. However neither polarization rotation nor CD is observed for achiral split rings and hollow rods fabricated using all linearly polarized beams and six side beams without the central beam, respectively; this indicates that the chiral nature of the spirals {{is essential for the}} observed <b>optical</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R
25|$|If adamantane {{molecules}} {{have four}} different substituents at every nodal carbon site, {{then they are}} chiral and optically active.

25|$|Pasteur {{noticed that}} {{crystals}} of tartrates had small faces. Then he observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, {{half of the}} crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In solution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and the left-handed one was levorotatory. Pasteur determined that <b>optical</b> <b>activity</b> related {{to the shape of}} the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light. The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and also the first explanation of isomerism.|$|E
25|$|If two {{polarizer}}s {{are placed}} {{one after another}} (the second polarizer is generally called an analyzer), the mutual angle between their polarizing axes gives the value of θ in Malus's law. If the two axes are orthogonal, the polarizers are crossed and in theory no light is transmitted, though again practically speaking no polarizer is perfect and the transmission is not exactly zero (for example, crossed Polaroid sheets appear slightly blue in colour). If a transparent object is placed between the crossed polarizers, any polarization effects present in the sample (such as birefringence) will be shown as an increase in transmission. This effect is used in polarimetry to measure the <b>optical</b> <b>activity</b> of a sample.|$|E

40|$|Helical {{polyaniline}} (PANI) nanofibers were facilely synthesized via {{a direct}} electrochemical method without using any template {{in the presence}} of (1 S) -(+) -camphor- 10 -sulfonic acid (D-CSA) or (1 R) -(-) -camphor- 10 -sulfonic acid (L-CSA) as the dopant. The helical morphologies of the PANI nanofibers prepared from potentiostatic deposition were confirmed with SEM and TEM. The helical PANI nanofibers induced by D-CSA and L-CSA exhibited mirror-imaged circular dichroism spectra in the UV-vis range, indicating the stereochemical selectivity of the electrochemical polymerization.

25|$|We {{have seen}} (above) that the {{birefringence}} {{of a type}} of crystal is useful in identifying it, and thus detection of linear birefringence is especially useful in geology and mineralogy. Linearly polarized light generally has its polarization state altered upon transmission through such a crystal, making it stand out when viewed in between two crossed polarizers, {{as seen in the}} photograph, above. Likewise, in chemistry, rotation of polarization axes in a liquid solution can be a useful measurement. In a liquid, linear birefringence is impossible, however there may be circular birefringence when a chiral molecule is in solution. When the right and left handed enantiomers of such a molecule are present in equal numbers (a so-called racemic mixture) then their effects cancel out. However, when there is only one (or a preponderance of one), as is more often the case for organic molecules, a net circular birefringence (or <b>optical</b> <b>activity)</b> is observed, revealing the magnitude of that imbalance (or the concentration of the molecule itself, when it can be assumed that only one enantiomer is present). This is measured using a polarimeter in which polarized light is passed through a tube of the liquid, {{at the end of which}} is another polarizer which is rotated in order to null the transmission of light through it.|$|E

500|$|The alpha {{amino acids}} {{are the most}} common form found in nature, but only when {{occurring}} in the L-isomer. The alpha carbon is a chiral carbon atom, with the exception of glycine which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon. [...] Therefore, all alpha amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two enantiomers, called L or D amino acids, which are mirror images of each other (see also Chirality). While L-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome, D-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as cone snails. They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria, and D-serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain. D-amino acids are used in racemic crystallography to create centrosymmetric crystals, which (depending on the protein) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination. The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the <b>optical</b> <b>activity</b> of the amino acid itself but rather to the <b>optical</b> <b>activity</b> of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory; L-glyceraldehyde is levorotatory).|$|E
50|$|Conformational isomers {{are thus}} {{distinct}} from the other classes of stereoisomers (i. e. configurational isomers) where interconversion necessarily involves breaking and reforming of chemical bonds. For example, L/D- and R/S- configurations of organic molecules have different handedness and <b>optical</b> <b>activities,</b> and can only be interconverted by breaking one or more bonds connected to the chiral atom and reforming a similar bond {{in a different direction}} or spatial orientation.|$|R

500|$|Though Gibbs's {{research}} on physical optics is {{less well known}} today than his other work, it made {{a significant contribution to}} classical electromagnetism by applying Maxwell's equations to the theory of optical processes such as birefringence, dispersion, and <b>optical</b> <b>activity.</b> [...] In that work, Gibbs showed that those processes could be accounted for by Maxwell's equations without any special assumptions about the microscopic structure of matter or {{about the nature of the}} medium in which electromagnetic waves were supposed to propagate (the so-called luminiferous ether). [...] Gibbs also stressed that the absence of a longitudinal electromagnetic wave, which is needed to account for the observed properties of light, is automatically guaranteed by Maxwell's equations (by virtue of what is now called their [...] "gauge invariance"), whereas in mechanical theories of light, such as Lord Kelvin's, it must be imposed as an ad hoc condition on the properties of the aether.|$|E
2500|$|Circular {{birefringence}} is also termed <b>optical</b> <b>activity</b> {{especially in}} chiral fluids, or Faraday rotation when {{due to the}} presence of a magnetic field along the direction of propagation.
