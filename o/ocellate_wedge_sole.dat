40|$|The <b>wedge</b> <b>sole</b> Dicologoglossa cuneata (Moreau, 1881) is {{a typical}} coastal soleid which is con-sidered {{as one of the}} main target species in the {{demersal}} fishery of Spain’s southern Atlantic region. This paper presents a study on the growth pattern of <b>wedge</b> <b>sole</b> in the Gulf of Cadiz. Age was determined by observing and analysing whole otoliths (sagittae), thereby obtaining the mean lengths at age for males and females in the year 1993 (from 15 - 20. 9 cm TL and 1 - 4 years for males; from 15. 9 - 23. 6 cm TL and 1 - 6 years for females). In addition, the growth parameters for both sexes were obtained according to the Von Bertalanffy equation: L ∞ = 24 cm, K = 0. 343 and t 0 = − 1. 384 for males; L ∞ = 27 cm, K = 0. 296 and t 0 = − 1. 520 for females (showing growth differ-ences growth between the sexes). These were compared with results reported by other authors for other areas of the species’s distribution range. Through the interpretation of the otolith and its edge, a sequence of annual rapid- and slow-growth rings was observed; otoliths with an opaque edge (rapid growth) showed the highest percentages in the period from May to October. Mean otolith diameters for each of the estimated ages were calculated, as well as the body length/otolith diameter relationship: a = − 12. 631 and b = 61. 033 (r 2 = 0. 70) ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wedge</b> <b>sole</b> Dicologlossa cuneata (Moreau, 1881) is {{a coastal}} species that lives along the inner shelf {{waters of the}} Gulf of Cadiz down {{to a depth of}} 115 m. Its ®shery, the size {{composition}} of the exploited popu- lation, and its reproduction have been studied on the basis of data acquired from commercial statistics from 1984 to 1994 and from sampling carried out during 1993 and 1994. The relative abundance of the species and its geographic and bathymetric distribution have been ex- amined by analysis of four trawl surveys carried out from 1992 to 1994. D. cuneata is captured mainly by the trawl ¯eet, {{and to a lesser extent}} by gillnet gears. <b>Wedge</b> <b>sole</b> ®shery has a marked seasonality. Size-frequency distributions from commercial samples and from bot- tom-trawl surveys are very similar, ranging from 12 to 26 cm total body length (TL). D. cuneata is a ``repeat- spawner''. Peak spawning is from January to May. Fe- males attain sexual maturity at 18 cm TL, while sexually mature males have been observed at 15 cm TL. The ¯exibility of the spawning strategy of D. cuneata throughout its distribution range is discussed. The scarcity of small specimens in the monthly samples and sequential spawning throughout the year prevented the estimation of growth parameters by means of length- frequency analysis. D. cuneata is present in greatest abundances in the sandy±muddy bottoms of the Gua- dalquivir River mouth at 15 to 30 m depth. Its optimum habitat coincides with the principal commercial ®shing grounds. The possibility of reproductive vertical migra- tion is discussed, but more precise data are needed be- fore a viable hypothesis can be made. Postprin...|$|R
40|$|From {{the website}} of the London Transport Museum: During Word War II {{rationing}} {{and later the}} government's utility scheme meant everyone had to tighten their belts. Fashion and design historian, Emmanuelle Dirix will explain that, far from being put on the back burner, beauty and fashion practices became much more inventive and were encouraged through the government's make-do-and-mend campaign. Despite strict regulations and 'fashion rations' people still maintained style. New austerity fashion items such as trousers and <b>wedge</b> <b>sole</b> shoes, along with hats - which were unrationed, provided an opportunity to update looks, whilst old blankets and curtains took on new roles as coats and dresses. This illustrated talk, will include archive propaganda film footage of the make-do-and-mend campaign, and will show how the Second World War and the utility style made fashion more accessible to the masses, and explain how New York {{became one of the}} world's leading style centres {{as a result of the}} occupation of Paris...|$|R
40|$|Vibrio tapetis is {{primarily}} {{known as the}} causative agent for brown ring disease in bivalves, {{although it has been}} isolated from cultivated fish during mortalities on farms. Here we describe the first isolation of V. tapetis from wild-caught and subsequently captive-held Dover sole Solea solea. Pathological features consisted of multifocal circular greyish-white skin discolourations evolving into vesicular lesions and subsequent ulcerations on the pigmented side. On the non-pigmented side, multiple circular lesions-white at the center and red at the edges-were evident. Histological examination of the vesicular lesions revealed dermal fluid-filled spaces, collagen tissue necrosis and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, with large numbers of small rod-shaped bacteria. In the deep skin lesions, loss of scales and dermal connective tissue, with degeneration and fragmentation of the myofibres bordering the ulceration, were noted. Serotyping, DNA-DNA hybridization and REP- and ERIC-PCR techniques showed that the retrieved isolates displayed a profile similar to the representative strain of genotype/serotype O 2 which originally was isolated from carpet-shell clam Venerupis decussata and to which isolates obtained from <b>wedge</b> <b>sole</b> Dicologoglossa cuneata were also closely related...|$|R
40|$|Ichthyoplankton {{samples and}} {{hydrological}} {{data were obtained}} in an inshore area, between the mouths of the Rivers Guadalquivir and Guadiana (Gulf of Cádiz, SW Spain) during monthly surveys carried out from March 2002 to March 2003. Horizontal and temporal distributions of <b>wedge</b> <b>sole</b> (Dicologlossa cuneata) egg and larval abundances were analysed during this annual cycle in relation to environmental parameters. This area {{proved to be an}} important spawning and nursery ground for the species, which showed a winter-spring reproductive strategy with a long reproductive period lasting from autumn until early summer. Spawning areas were located in the shallowest waters (above 30 m depth) between the mouths of the Rives Guadiana and Tinto-Odiel, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the coastal zone between the mouths of the Rivers Tinto- Odiel and Guadalquivir. The spawning habitat was mainly determined by the distribution of the adults, the bathymetry and the temperature, and a preference for shallow and colder waters was observed. The inshore zone between the mouths of the Rivers Tinto-Odiel and Guadalquivir is the main nursery ground, with the greatest larval concentration and productivity in the area, due to the influence of the River Guadalquivir. The presence of recruits in this area may be linked to these favourable conditions for larval growth and survival. Postprin...|$|R
50|$|In golf, bounce or bounce {{angle is}} the angle inscribed by {{the leading edge}} of a golfing iron (particularly a <b>wedge),</b> the <b>sole</b> of the club, and the ground. In plainer terms, bounce angle is an {{indication}} of how much the sole, or bottom-most part, of the club head lifts the leading edge. A high bounce angle (angles of 12-15° are not uncommon) indicates a sole which lifts the leading edge significantly, whereas a club with little or no bounce allows the leading edge to contact the ground without interference.|$|R
40|$|Several {{works have}} {{demonstrated}} {{trends in the}} distribution of fish species relative to global warming. This study investigated whether similar trends have occurred for selected flatfish species on the continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay. These species were used as indicators and changes in their populations were studied in a coastal nursery ground where flatfish juveniles are concentrated {{as well as on the}} entire shelf. Previous studies analysing changes in sea surface temperature for the continental shelf indicate that winter warming occurred in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Sixteen autumn cruises conducted since 1981 in the Bay of Vilaine nursery area and 11 autumn cruises since 1987 over the entire shelf provided data on a nearly annual basis for the abundance of benthic fish. The four most common flatfish species were selected and their occurrence and yearly abundance were analysed with regard to specific biogeographic ranges and climate change. Similar results were obtained for juveniles on a nursery scale and for all age groups on the entire shelf. Although sole (Solea solea) showed irregular yearly variations, northern winter spawners such as plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and dab (Limanda limanda) exhibited significantly high abundance during the 1980 s, followed by a continuing low level and ultimately zero catches. On the other hand, the <b>wedge</b> <b>sole</b> (Dicologoglossa cuneata), a southern summer spawner, showed an increasing trend in the late 1990 s...|$|R
40|$|Monthly cruises {{were carried}} out during an annual cycle in a coastal fringe located at the northeastern shelf of the Gulf of Ca´ diz, characterised by its {{important}} and diverse fishery activity, in order to study the ichthyoplankton abundance, composition and seasonality. From March 2002 to March 2003, the abundance of fish eggs and larvae was estimated monthly at 26 sampling stations in the area. The mean abundance through the analysed period was 955 eggs/ 100 m 3 and 326 larvae/ 100 m 3 of the total species of fish caught. Higher mean densities occurred during the warmest months. Three commercially important species in the area (anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardina pilchardus and wegde sole Dicologlossa cuneata) represented 57 % and 50 % of mean fish eggs and larval concentrations, respectively. Anchovy eggs and larvae were the most abundant in the area, each representing 33 % of the total mean fish egg and larval concentrations. Temporal variations in the abundance of eggs and larvae showed different reproduction patterns for the analysed species: while anchovy reproduction mainly occurred during the spring–summer period, sardine reproduced during autumn–winter whereas <b>wedge</b> <b>sole</b> was mainly winter–spring spawner in the area. Furthermore, the spatial distribution was different for {{the early stages of}} these three species. Cluster analysis of the sampling stations (based on Bray–Curtis similarities derived from the annual mean concentrations of eggs and larvae of the three species) revealed four well-defined areas: a coastal western sector, a coastal eastern sector, an offshore sector and a single sampling station, close to the Guadalquivir River mouth, which showed a high degree of accordance with the oceanographic characterisation of the area. r 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Marine {{populations are}} {{distributed}} heterogeneously {{in space and}} time because of the diversity of habitats and the requirements of species life cycles. Human exploitation of these resources also varies as a function of space, time and the type of fishing activities performed. These three factors determine fishing strategy at different levels of integration. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe and analyse, with respect to different time scales, the relations between the modalities of resource exploitation and the biological or demographic characteristics of the species involved. These investigations relate to the more general task of acquiring the basic knowledge needed for spatialised management of fishing effort. A fleet of trawlers from La Rochelle, operating in the Bay of Biscay, was studied over a 15 -year period (1979 – 1993), which led to the development of a reference resource exploitation scheme for these vessels. The degree of stability of this scheme over time was determined from landing profiles of the 18 most important species fished (94 % of landings). An annual cycle for the species composition of landings was determined by multiple factor analysis. Two factors account for more than 55 % of the inertia of the data. The first, of biological origin, is closely related to the breeding activity of species and associated migrations between the coast and the open sea. The second is spatial in nature, corresponding to the distribution and availability of resources according to a bathymetric gradient. This organisational scheme persisted over the first 13 years, but showed signs of change toward the end of the study period. Analysis of multi-year trends indicated four periods marked by sustained levels of landings per unit of effort for some species (decreasing for <b>sole</b> and <b>wedge</b> <b>sole,</b> or increasing for Norway lobster, striped red mullet, rays and the smallspotted catshark). These changes ar...|$|R
5000|$|The Dunlop KT26 {{became a}} lasting favourite. In 2003, Dunlop Footwear {{calculated}} it had {{sold more than}} 5 million pairs since release.

Dunlop Footwear later made a [...] "safety" [...] version with a steel toe cap. Its sole tread pattern made it a choice for bushwalking, canoeing, rafting and rock fishing where it was also valued for its low saturated weight and quick drying. A version, the Dunlop KT Centurion, was made for the Australian Defence Forces. Dunlop KT Walker shoes, in leather or canvas uppers, used the same <b>wedge</b> and <b>sole</b> design. Dunlop KT26 Osaka was a specialty line. The Dunlop KT XLC is a cheaper, lighter and fully synthetic variation.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is {{a common}} and disabling condition. Abnormalities in knee loading {{play an important role}} in disease pathogenesis, yet there are few non-surgical treatments for knee OA capable of reducing knee load. This two-arm randomised controlled trial is investigating the efficacy of specially-designed unloading shoes for the treatment of symptoms in people with knee OA. METHODS/DESIGN: 164 people with symptomatic medial tibiofemoral joint OA will be recruited from the community and randomly allocated to receive either unloading shoes or control shoes. Unloading shoes have a specially-designed triple-density midsole where the medial side is softer than normal and the lateral side harder as well as a lateral <b>wedge</b> between the <b>sole</b> and sock-liner. Control shoes are standard athletic shoes and do not contain these features. Participants will be blinded to shoe allocation and will be instructed to wear the shoes as much as possible every day for 6 months, for a minimum of 4 hours per day. The primary outcomes are knee pain (numerical rating scale) and self-reported physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) measured at baseline and 6 months. Secondary outcomes include additional measures of knee pain, knee stiffness, participant global ratings of change in symptoms, quality-of-life and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study will help determine whether specially-designed unloading shoes are efficacious in the management of knee OA.
