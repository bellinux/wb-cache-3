5|$|After the Austrian {{invasion}} of the Duchy of Warsaw, Russia, bound by the treaty of alliance with France, reluctantly entered the war against Austria. The Russian army {{under the command of}} General Sergei Golitsyn crossed into Galicia on 3 June 1809. Golitsyin advanced as slowly as possible, with instructions to avoid any major confrontation with the Austrians. There were only minor skirmishes between the Russian and Austrian troops, with minimal losses. The Austrian and Russian commanders were in frequent correspondence and, in fact, shared some <b>operational</b> <b>intelligence.</b> A courteous letter sent by a Russian divisional commander, General Andrey Gorchakov, to Archduke Ferdinand was intercepted by the Poles, who sent an original to Emperor Napoleon and a copy to Tsar Alexander. As a result, Alexander had to remove Gorchakov from command. Furthermore, there were constant disagreements between Golitsyn and Poniatowski, with whom the Russians were supposed to cooperate in Galicia. As a result of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, Russia received the Galician district of Tarnopol.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{then moved}} to eastern Afghanistan where it {{played a key role}} in Operation Anaconda in March 2002. During the {{operation}} SASR teams were to provide on-location, in-depth <b>operational</b> <b>intelligence</b> and reconnaissance after they infiltrated the Shahi-Kot Valley ten days prior to the operation, and also saved the lives of 24 soldiers of the US 75th Ranger Regiment after their helicopter was shot down, by providing sniper overwatch and guiding in precise air strikes to end the enemy advance as they attempted to overrun the isolated Americans. Up to 300 al Qaeda fighters were later estimated to have been killed as a result of the airstrikes they called-in. Two SASR advisory and liaison officers were attached with the US 10th Mountain Division to help plan the division's air assault operations, and were subsequently involved in heavy fighting after the unit they were with became pinned down and took a number of casualties. Supported by heavy close air support they were evacuated by helicopter that evening.|$|E

40|$|A key {{component}} of a company’s IT framework is a business intelligence (BI) system. BI enables business users to report on, analyze and optimize business operations to reduce costs and increase revenues. Organizations use BI for strategic and tactical decision making where the decision-making cycle may span a time period of several weeks (e. g., campaign management) or months (e. g., improving customer satisfaction). Competitive pressures coming from a very dynamic business environment are forcing companies to react faster to changing business conditions and customer requirements. As a result, {{there is now a}} need to use BI to help drive and optimize business operations on a daily basis, and, in some cases, even for intraday decision making. This type of BI is usually called <b>operational</b> business <b>intelligence</b> and real-time business <b>intelligence.</b> <b>Operational</b> Business <b>Intelligence,</b> Real Time Business <b>Intelligence,</b> strategic, tactical, <b>operational,</b> real-time. ...|$|R

25|$|As well as {{military}} intelligence gathering, MID was also tasked with preventing sabotage and subversion by enemy agents or German sympathizers on US soil. Short of manpower, Van Deman relied on private groups which he organized into the American Protective League. He also provided security to government offices, defense plants, seaports, and other sensitive installations. He created a field organization in eight US cities which employed mobilized civilian policemen to perform security investigations. In France, MID provided <b>operational</b> <b>intelligence</b> to the American Expeditionary Force, and Van Deman created the Corps of Intelligence Police (forerunner of the Counter Intelligence Corps), recruiting fifty French-speaking Sergeants with police training.

The decision to attack the Bodø area was {{made on the basis}} of Ultra intelligence obtained by decoding German radio signals, from which the Allies learned that the ships in the region included the large oil tanker , which was carrying fuel for the German battle group at Altafjord. In addition, at the time of Operation Leader two groups of Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) agents operated radio transmitters on the coast of Helgeland: [...] "Crux III" [...] on the island of Renga and [...] "Pisces" [...] on Lurøy. Both groups provided reports to the Allies on the weather and shipping movements in the target area in the lead-up to the attack.

500|$|Malley was {{recalled}} to Australia in July 1940, departing China {{with a note}} {{of thanks}} from May-Ling for his [...] "loyal service" [...] before rejoining the RAAF on active service as a squadron leader in October. He became the Air Force representative at the Combined <b>Operational</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Centre (COIC), Melbourne, a tri-service organisation responsible for intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination. Drawing on his knowledge of Japanese raids on Chinese airfields in the 1930s, Malley visited several RAAF stations in northern Australia to advise on protective measures; it became evident {{in the wake of}} the attack on Darwin in February 1942 that none of his recommendations had been implemented. COIC primarily handled naval intelligence, so Army and Air Force participation was part-time initially. By April 1941, Malley had been assigned a full-time role, and the RAAF was maintaining a round-the-clock presence. He was promoted to honorary wing commander in October 1941, and two months later succeeded Commander Rupert Long as Director of COIC. Malley was raised to acting group captain on 1July 1942, but ill health forced him to relinquish his post on 3October. He was discharged from the Air Force as medically unfit on 9June 1943. General Douglas MacArthur praised Malley for his [...] "foresight, planning, and organizational ability". The former aviator went on to work as officer-in-charge of the Chinese section at the Commonwealth Security Service in Canberra from January 1944 to March 1947 as an honorary group captain.|$|E

2500|$|The success against Pinguin {{and other}} raiders {{was due to}} the navy <b>Operational</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Centre (OIC) of the Naval Intelligence Division, at the Admiralty. The OIC tracked raiders, based on the {{position}} of the sinking of Allied merchant ships and by collating rare sightings and distress signals. German commerce-raiders kept radio silence, avoided common shipping routes, searching for independently routed vessels and tried to prevent their victims from transmitting wireless messages. From May to November 1941, the Germans lost Pinguin and two more commerce-raiders but Enigma decrypts by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) was only involved in one sinking. German commerce-raiders used the [...] (Home Waters) Enigma settings, known as Dolphin to the British, before departing and when returning to Germany. The seven raiders at sea in May 1941 had sailed in 1940, before Enigma intelligence became available to the British. When at sea, Enigma-equipped raiders used the [...] settings if they broke radio silence, which Hut 4 at Bletchley Park never managed to penetrate. Atlantis, the third raider lost in 1941, was sunk by [...] on 22 November after the British read U-boat signals in the [...] setting, introduced in October 1941, to arrange a re-fuelling rendezvous.|$|E
