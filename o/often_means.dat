5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most <b>often</b> <b>means</b> {{that it is}} visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics maintain that the pixellated look {{is a question of}} fashion rather than function.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this <b>often</b> <b>means</b> that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices <b>often</b> <b>means</b> that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E

25|$|To {{this day}} only 90 {{visitors}} are allowed at a time, which <b>often</b> <b>means</b> a queue outside. Labels and lighting are discreet; {{there is no}} information desk or café. In 2010, the museum attracted 110,000 visitors.|$|E
25|$|In academia, {{the term}} queer {{and the related}} verb queering broadly {{indicate}} the study of literature, discourse, academic fields, and other social and cultural areas from a non-heteronormative perspective. It <b>often</b> <b>means</b> studying a subject against the grain {{from the perspective of}} gender studies.|$|E
25|$|In {{food science}} {{and in many}} {{informal}} contexts, the term carbohydrate <b>often</b> <b>means</b> any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate starch (such as cereals, bread and pasta) or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, jams, and desserts).|$|E

25|$|Similarly, most {{academic}} related {{software development}} projects are short lived experimental projects. This <b>often</b> <b>means</b> {{that they are}} never intended to be long lived, only to prove or disprove the applicability of an approach. Some people therefore question the value of academically developed software.|$|E
25|$|The nature {{reserves}} in Stockholm involves regulations affecting both landowners {{and the general}} public by regulating usage of insecticides and fertilizers, construction of bridges, lighting of fires, camping, anchoring, and keeping unleashed dogs. A plan for the care and development of a nature reserve <b>often</b> <b>means</b> the city as well as private landowners are obliged to guarantee the maintenance of the area.|$|E
25|$|Territorial {{behaviour}} {{is generally}} necessary for guarders, and the embryos {{are almost always}} guarded by males (apart from cichlids). There {{is a need to}} be territorial because looking after embryos usually includes defending the site where they are being looked after. It also <b>often</b> <b>means</b> there is competition for the best egg-laying sites. Elaborate courtship behaviour is usual among guarders.|$|E
5000|$|Girori - A {{blackbird}} who is <b>often</b> <b>mean</b> to Kyoro-chan and his friends. His {{parents are}} the richest birds on Angel Island, {{so he is}} rather stuck up. He has a crush on Kurin's big sister.|$|R

25|$|After death, {{the body}} {{typically}} shows marks of suspension: bruising and rope {{marks on the}} neck. Sphincters will relax spontaneously and urine and faeces will be evacuated. Forensic experts may often {{be able to tell}} if hanging is suicide or homicide, as each leaves a distinctive ligature mark. One of the hints they use is the hyoid bone. If broken, it <b>often</b> <b>means</b> the person has been murdered by manual choking.|$|E
25|$|High {{turnover}} <b>often</b> <b>means</b> {{that employees}} are {{dissatisfied with their}} jobs, especially when it {{is relatively easy to}} find a new one. It can also indicate unsafe or unhealthy conditions, or that too few employees give satisfactory performance (due to unrealistic expectations, inappropriate processes or tools, or poor candidate screening). The lack of career opportunities and challenges, dissatisfaction with the job-scope or conflict with the management have been cited as predictors of high turnover.|$|E
25|$|Leading juniors {{are allowed}} to {{participate}} for their nation in the Junior Fed Cup and Davis Cup competitions. To succeed in tennis <b>often</b> <b>means</b> having to begin playing at a young age. To facilitate and nurture a junior's growth in tennis, almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system. Juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces, accommodating all different standards of play. Talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A red card is used {{in several}} sports and most {{commonly}} indicates a serious offence and can <b>often</b> <b>mean</b> that a player has been expelled from the game. In bandy, it indicates this, which is called a match penalty.|$|R

50|$|It {{is widely}} naturalised in eastern North America and elsewhere, {{where it is}} often {{considered}} to be an invasive species. However, its attractive appearance, edibility and readiness to grow in many climates <b>often</b> <b>mean</b> it is permitted to grow when other 'weeds' are not.|$|R
25|$|Over the years, UK {{universities}} {{have been hit}} by considerable funding cuts as part of government austerity measures. This, in part, {{has led to an}} increase in the rental of student accommodation during the winter, spring, and summer vacation periods to house conference delegates and tourists, often at rates similar to those charged by upmarket hotels. Unfortunately, this <b>often</b> <b>means</b> that students are forced to vacate their rooms up to three times per year. As a result, several student-focussed personal storage and shipping companies have come into existence that cater to this need.|$|E
25|$|Brunswick {{itself is}} {{relatively}} flat and {{is ideal for}} cycling. Brunswick East is bounded by the Merri Creek Trail, and Brunswick West by the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail, though neither of these {{can be described as}} flat. The Upfield Bike Path follows the Upfield railway line from Fawkner, through Coburg and Brunswick, joining the Capital City Trail at Park Street. Streets in Brunswick vary, from too narrow for two cars to pass, to reasonably wide. Not all of the wider streets have cycle lanes, though even riding in lanes in the narrower street <b>often</b> <b>means</b> riding close to parked cars, presenting a significant hazard to cyclists from opening car doors.|$|E
25|$|Captains of House are {{slightly}} different though {{in that they}} play a more personal role for pupils who want to voice problems with conditions within the house and this <b>often</b> <b>means</b> that House Captains {{have a lot more}} pupils to be responsible for. This difference is more evident in their original title of 'Helper'. They tend to be in close contact with the housemaster so that any issues requiring immediate attention can be sorted out as well as being able to relay any general ideas or concerns in the House Captains' Council which meet once every two weeks. At the meeting a teacher is present and minutes are taken {{so that they can be}} passed onto the Colour Bearers (CBs).|$|E

50|$|The lower {{production}} costs of short films <b>often</b> <b>mean</b> that short films can cover alternative subject matter {{as compared to}} higher budget feature films. Similarly unconventional filmmaking techniques such as Pixilation or narratives that are told without dialogue, are more often seen in short films than features.|$|R

25|$|The term Scandinavia always {{includes}} the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The remote Norwegian islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen {{are usually not}} seen {{as a part of}} Scandinavia, nor is Greenland, a constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark. However, the Faroe Islands, also a Danish constituent country, are sometimes included, as sometimes are Iceland, Finland, and the Finnish autonomous region of the Åland Islands, because of their historical association with the Scandinavian countries and the Scandinavian peoples and languages. This looser definition almost equates to that of the Nordic countries. In the local languages, Skandinavia/Skandinavien <b>often</b> <b>means</b> the European parts of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, whereas the name Norden is more commonly used for the extended region that includes Finland, Iceland, and overseas parts of Denmark and Norway.|$|E
25|$|Bucket : This {{pattern is}} similar to the bowl except that one of the planets is in the {{opposite}} hemisphere to all the others. This lone planet, or Singleton, serves as a handle, thus creating a 'bucket' form. The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong. However, what this <b>often</b> <b>means</b> is that the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them trying to fit in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. The person will probably behave according {{to the nature of the}} Singleton planet that forms the handle of the pattern. This planet will exercise a greater influence than normal in the chart, and will be an important part of the dynamic of the person's activities and basic energy.|$|E
25|$|Sudden death also {{occurs in}} {{computer}} gaming when both teams {{have the same}} score and a method of breaking a tie is needed. For example, in a Capture the Flag area for Quake III Arena, when neither team has scored, or if no team leads, a sudden death match will decide {{who will be the}} victor. All the teams have to do is get the flag and deliver it to the base one time only in order to win automatically. Sometimes, players share a handicap in order to end the game faster; for example, in a Super Smash Bros. sudden death match, players fight beginning at 300% damage, amplifying how much they are knocked back to the extent that most attacks will KO them in a single blow. In games where the players normally would respawn, like Team Fortress 2, sudden death <b>often</b> <b>means</b> that respawning is disabled and the last team standing wins.|$|E
5000|$|David Wertime of Foreign Policy {{argued that}} the {{narrative}} where a large army of paid Internet commentators are behind China's poor public dialogue with its critics is [...] "Orwellian, yet strangely comforting". Rather, many of the Chinese netizens spreading nationalist sentiment online aren't paid, but <b>often</b> <b>mean</b> what they say.|$|R

3000|$|... {{propaganda}} {{terrorist attacks}} are often carefully choreographed {{to attract the}} attention of the electronic media and the international press. Taking and holding hostages increases the drama. The hostages themselves <b>often</b> <b>mean</b> nothing to the terrorists. Terrorism is aimed at the people watching, not at the actual victims. Terrorism is a theater (p. 4).|$|R
