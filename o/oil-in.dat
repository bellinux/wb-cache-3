40|$|Emulsion is {{a mixture}} of two {{immiscible}} substances. For the emulsion, we have two types which are <b>Oil-in</b> water emulsions (O/W) and Water –in-oil emulsions (W/O). Diesel fuel emulsions are blended mixtures of diesel fuel, water, emulsifying agents and other additives, that reduce particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions, {{as a result of the}} added water. Addition of water to the emulsified fuel also reduces the energy content of the fuel, with corresponding reductions in fuel economy and engine power.

The syntheses {{were carried out}} using three types of systems: aqueous surfactant solutions, <b>oil-in</b> water (O/W), and water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsions. The influence of the surfactant and the precipitating agent used for synthesis was also investigated. For this purpose, cobalt nanostructures were prepared using different non-ionic surfactants, namely Synperonic® 10 / 6, Pluronic® P 123 and a mixture of SPAN 20 –TWEEN 80.

The FC analysis demonstrated that as the size of individual microspheres within a batch increased, so the protein loading tended to increase. For example, the protein loading of microspheres increased from 2. 7 to 8. 9 wt. % as the size of microspheres increased from 0. 42 to 1. 45 μm, respectively.

Malaysian heavy crude oil samples namely Miri were used to produce heavy crude oil- in-water emulsions. Historically, demand for heavy and additional-heavy oil has been marginal because of their high viscosity and composition complexity that make them hard and expensive to produce, transport and refine. Presently, there are three general approaches for transportation of heavy and extra heavy oil which are viscosity reduction, drag minimization and in-situ oil enhancement. This 3 conventional method required high cost. Hence, our scope of study approached is to convert the 95 % of w/o in pipeline to o/w technique by using the advantage of water to carry the oil. This method is promising cost effective and shorten {{the time of the}} transportation. Results show that the stability of the oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by span 83 increases as the surfactant concentration increases, with a consecutive decrease in the crude oil–water interfacial tension (IFT).

RESULTS: Experiment 1 aimed a pork back-fat reduction and allowed to obtain sausages with 84 g kg- 1 of fat and 1334 kcal kg- 1, without significant negative effects on sensory quality. Carrageenan was used as fat replacer. Experiment 2 aimed improving the lipid profile of the “energy-reduced” sausages previously developed, by a partial substitution of the pork back-fat with a linseed <b>oil-in</b> water emulsion (substitution levels: 25 % to 100 %).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} chemically functionalized nanoparticles and their behavior at interfaces and in conjunction with polymers. Solid-liquid, liquid-liquid, and air-liquid interfaces are useful platforms for studying nanoparticle assembly, especially when nanoparticles are functionalized to enable their segregation to the interface. At the liquid-liquid interface, double emulsions droplets, both oil-in-water-in-oil and water-in-oil-in-water, stabilized with nanoparticles were prepared. This involved gold nanoparticles stabilizing oil-in-water droplets, and CdSe quantum dots stabilizing water-in-oil droplets. These double emulsion droplets were by simply shaking to give polydisperse droplets, or in a well-defined fashion by microcapillary flow focusing. When nanoparticle-stabilized double emulsions were sized using glass microcapillary devices, they formed a variety of interesting structures that demonstrated {{the importance of having}} nanoparticles in the emulsion. Ligand-functionalized nanoparticles proved emenable to triggered disruption and inversion processes. Two different tetrahydropyranyl protecting groups were employed in the ligand shell of gold nanoparticles enabling an ‘in situ’ droplet inversion, in the presence of acid using either added H+ or photogenerated acid to trigger the desired inversion. Considering the liquid-solid interface, amphiphilic phosphorylcholine substituted polyolefins stabilized droplets were used to pick up various types of nanoparticles from substrates, and transport the nanoparticles in a fluid driven system. Specifically, decoration of <b>oil-in</b> water droplets with pentafluorophenyl ester groups enabled efficient removal of amine functionalized silica nanoparticles adsorbed on a substrate.

The Sustained delivery of HS to the localized wound site over the period of healing which can last for over 1 month may prove advantageous for its therapeutic use. In this study we investigated the encapsulation of HS by the water-in <b>oil-in</b> water (W- 1 /O/W- 2) technique in polycaprolactone (PCL) microcapsules as a prolonged delivery device. Encapsulation efficiencies of 70 % could be achieved by using a 1 : 1 mixture of dichloromethane (DCM) and acetone as the solvent in the organic phase, while DCM alone gave poor encapsulation. Although addition of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to the drug phase {{did not affect the}} size or drug loading of the microcapsules, it did however produce a large change in the morphology and drug distribution, which resulted in different release rates. Release from capsules made with PVA in the drug phase reached 60 % after 40 days, while those made with water in the drug phase completed rciease after 20 days. In vitro biocompatibility studies were performed and detected no increase in cell death in human mesenchymal stern cells (hMSC) or induction of an inflammatory response in macrophages after exposure to release products from HS-loaded microcapsules. The released HS retained its ability to increase the proliferation of hMSC after the encapsulation process. These results indicate that encapsulation of HS by the W- 1 /O/W- 2, method creates a promising device for the repair of bone tissue. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Vaccines have profoundly {{impacted}} {{global health}} although concerns persist about their potential role in autoimmune or other adverse reactions. To address these concerns, vaccine components like immunogens and adjuvants require critical evaluation {{not only in}} healthy subjects but also in those genetically averse to vaccine constituents. Evaluation in autoimmune-prone animal models of adjuvants is therefore important in vaccine development. The objective here {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of experimental adjuvants: two phytol-derived immunostimulants PHIS- 01 (phytanol) and PHIS- 03 (phytanyl mannose), and a new commercial adjuvant from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS-H), relative to a standard adjuvant alum. Phytol derivatives are hydrophobic, <b>oil-in</b> water diterpenoids, while alum is hydrophilic, and SIS is essentially a biodegradable and collagenous protein cocktail derived from extracellular matrices. Results We studied phthalate -specific and cross-reactive anti-DNA antibody responses, and parameters associated with the onset of autoimmune disorders. We determined antibody isotype and cytokine/chemokine milieu induced by the above experimental adjuvants relative to alum. Our results indicated that the phytol-derived adjuvant PHIS- 01 exceeded alum in enhancing anti-phthalate antibody without much cross reactivity with ds-DNA. Relatively, SIS and PHIS- 03 proved less robust, but they were also less inflammatory. Interestingly, these adjuvants facilitated isotype switching of anti-hapten, but not of anti-DNA response. The current study reaffirms our earlier reports on adjuvanticity of phytol compounds and SIS-H in non autoimmune-prone BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice. These adjuvants are as effective as alum also in autoimmune-prone NZB/WF 1 mice, and they have little deleterious effects. Conclusion Although all adjuvants tested impacted cytokine/chemokine milieu in favor of Th 1 /Th 2 balance, the phytol compounds fared better in reducing the onset of autoimmune syndromes. However, SIS is least inflammatory among the adjuvants evaluated. </p...|$|E
40|$|Within the Ionian zone, which {{belongs to}} the {{external}} Albanide fold and thrust belt, a surface reservoir analogue was studied {{with the aim of}} unravelling the processes which exert an effect on the dual porosity network. Matrix porosity preservation in the Cretaceous to Eocene carbonate turbidite beds relates to early cementation, where the presence of a mixture of micritic and mono-crystalline bioclasts (crinoids and rudists) controls the framework-stabilising development of cements. The presence of these cements explains why these lithologies have not been entirely compacted las happened for the overlying micrite-dominated lithologies). The underlying bioclast-rich layers also do not possess any porosity since they were entirely cemented. Present-day oil production is mainly fracture-related. Several vein generations have been recognised as well as other tectonic features such as conjugate high-angle or tension joints and stylolites. With respect to the latter, bed parallel (i,e. compactional) and bed perpendicular (i. e. layer parallel shortening or tectonic) stylolites have been differentiated. The spatial relationships between these stylolites and the veins allow differentiation of pre-, syn- and post-kinematic fluid fluxes, which have been characterised based on their petrographical (i. e. cathodoluminescence), geochemical (trace and stable isotope) and fluid inclusion features. This exercise shows that the fluid flow system was rock buffered until the folding and thrusting period. From then onwards the fluid flow system reflects the interaction with fluids which reacted with evaporites which occur as decollement horizons as well as fluid flow systems in relation to the maturation of hydrocarbons. Finally after folding and faulting, the studied anticlinal structure was temporarily emergent during the Miocene. During this period sediment infilled karst cavities formed. Since the latter sediment infill is not compacted but porous, they contribute to the total <b>oil-in</b> place. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

A dynamic tracking of an evolving droplet size distribution (DSD) in a dilute <b>oil-in</b> water (O/W) emulsion has been developed with the implementation of an in situ video probe dipped in a stirred vessel and coupled with an image analysis treatment. The optical probe allows real time recording 01 20 images of the droplets. Recent image analysis software developed originally for an application in micromechanics was adapted and applied in delayed time on the video sequences regularly recorded. It automatically provided a measurement of the diameter of several thousands of droplets in the range of 10 - 100 mu m. The relative accuracy on the droplet number average diameter was 10 %. This measurement technique was then used to investigate at lab scale in a stirred vessel and in warm conditions the influence of several process parameters on {{the evolution}} with time of a dispersed melted cosmetic ingredient in a water solution containing a surfactant. The specific power input of stirring was the main parameter acting on the reduction of the mean droplet diameter and of the width of the DSD owing to its action on the droplet break-up mechanism. The surfactant concentration was a parameter of secondary relevance on the DSD probably due to the reduction of the coalescence rate and to a faster stabilization of the O/W interface. The use of a flat blade propeller instead of a Rushton turbine was preferable for the production of a narrower DSD.

40|$|The {{processing}} of oil sands {{results in the}} production and storage of significant amounts of waste materials, including: large volumes affine tailings from the separation of bitumen from oil sands and petroleum coke produced during the bitumen upgrading process. In several previous investigations we explored the production of potentially marketable products from these wastes. This paper is a review of work from the authors' laboratory. Several case studies illustrate the potential uses for coke and value added products separated from fine tailings. Delayed and fluid coke from bitumen upgrading are effective sorbents for both bitumen and naphtha. They are also excellent collectors for heavy metals. Based on these properties and a plentiful supply at relatively low cost, these materials provide an excellent medium for treating <b>oil-in</b> water emulsions, for adsorbing oil spills. for heavy metal trapping in the purification of industrial effluents, {{for the treatment of}} oily waters, for extracting hydrocarbons from ground water and/or the removal of odors. Our work relating to the incorporation, or coating, of coke particles with lime or limestone is beneficial in the use of this material as an ancillary fuel with much reduced sulphur dioxide emissions. The ash from the combustion of coke can be leached to separate heavy metals. The leached residue could have potential applications as a flocculant for the treatment of fine tailings and possibly for the remediation of acid mine drainage. The fine tailings are separable into several potentially valuable by-products such as: bitumen for production of synthetic crude oil or as an ancillary fuel, clean kaolin for fine paper coating, a gelling agent, emulsifying solids for surfactant replacement and a mineral fraction rich in heavy metals.

40|$|The polar paradox {{states that}} polar {{antioxidants}} are {{more active in}} bulk lipids than their nonpolar counterparts, whereas nonpolar antioxidants are more effective in oil-in-water emulsion than their polar homologs. However, recent results, showing that not all antioxidants behave in a manner proposed by this hypothesis in oil and emulsion, lead us to revisit the polar paradox and to put forward new concepts, hypotheses, and theories. In bulk oil, new evidences {{have been brought to}} demonstrate that the crucial site of oxidation is not the air-oil interface, as postulated by the polar paradox, but association colloids formed with traces of water and surface activemolecules such as phospholipids. The role of these association colloids on lipid oxidation and its inhibition by antioxidant is also addressed as well as the complex influence of the hydrophobicity on the ability of antioxidants to protect lipids from oxidation. In <b>oil-in</b> water emulsion, we have covered the recently discovered non linear (or cut-off) influence of the hydrophobicity on antioxidant capacity. For the first time, different mechanisms of action are formulated in details to try to account for this nonlinear effect. As suggested by the great amount of biological studies showing a cut-off effect, this phenomenon could be widespread in dispersed lipid systems including emulsions and liposomes as well as in living systems such as cultured cells. Works on the cut-off effect paves the way for the determination of the critical chain length which corresponds to the threshold beyond which antioxidant capacity suddenly collapses. The systematic search for this new physico-chemical parameter will allow designing novel phenolipids and other amphiphilic antioxidants in a rational fashion. Finally, in both bulk oils and emulsions, we feel that it is now time for a paradigm shift from the polar paradox to the next theories. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

In phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4), microspheres showed an initial burst release of 22 % in 1 hour with an additional 28 % release in the next 5 hours. The smaller the volumes of internal and external aqueous phase, the lower the initial burst release. The release of drug from microspheres followed Higuchi kinetics. Scanning electron microscopy of PVA-stabilized microspheres demonstrated spherical particles with smooth surface, and laser diffractometry revealed a mena particle size of 32. 51 ± 20 μm. Oral administration of PVA stabilized microspheres in normal albino rabbits (equivalent to 6. 6 IU insulin/kg of animal weight) demonstrated a 24 % reduction in blood glucose level, with maximum plasma glucose reduction of 76 ± 3. 0 % in 2 hours and effect continuing up to 6 hours. The area under the percentage glucose reduction-time curve was 93. 75 %. Thus, our results indicate that Eudragit S 100 microspheres on oral administration can protect insulin from proteolytic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and produce hypoglycemic effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of antioxidants compounds in emulsified systems has been intensely studied {{over the past}} years; some phenolic molecules, because of their chemical structure, were proven to possess surface activity and thus, besides their antioxidant protective properties, {{it is also expected}} that they can affect both the dispersion degree and the physical and chemical stability of the dispersed phase. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of some olive oil phenolic antioxidants, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein on the colloidal properties and oxidative stability of olive <b>oil-in</b> water emulsions stabilized with β-lactoglobulin (BLG). Emulsions were also modulated for their viscosity and water activity by adding, respectively, maltodextrins (MD 7. 5 - 9. 9) and NaCl. Emulsions were characterized for their droplet size distribution, microstructure, interfacial protein coverage, physical stability (flocculation and creaming behavior). The oxidative stability was monitored by means of HPSEC of polar compounds and RP-HPLC-DAD analysis of the different oxidized triglyceride species. At the olive oil/water interface, the phenolic compounds did not have significant effects on the ability of BLG to stabilize the interface itself, neither in binary BLG-polyphenol solutions, nor in ternary systems when sodium chloride and maltodextrins were added, individually, to modulate both water activity and viscosity. The addition of the phenolic compounds in emulsions did not affect the colloidal properties, as well as the physical stability. From an antioxidant viewpoint, oleuropein, tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol were proven to slow down the formation of secondary oxidation products, thus improving the chemical stability. The presence of NaCl and maltodextrin showed a significant destabilizing effect on emulsions both on the physical and chemical stability. This research project was funded within the national research project FIRB 2010 - "Futuro in Ricerca" (MIUR, Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca) aimed at applying a multifunctional and multifactorial approach to study the physical, chemical and sensory properties and stability of olive oil-in-water emulsion...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} work compares {{the effect of}} microsphere preparation technique on micromeritics and release behaviors of theophylline microspheres. Microspheres were prepared by <b>oil-in</b> oil (O 1 /O 2) emulsion solvent evaporation method (ESE) using different ratios of anhydrous theophylline to cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB). Cyclohexane was used as non-solvent to modify the ESE technique (MESE method) {{and the effect of}} non-solvent volume on properties of microspheres was investigated. The obtained microspheres were analyzed in terms of drug content, particle size and encapsulation efficiency. The morphology of microsphere was studied using scanning electron microscope. The solid state of microspheres, theophylline and CAB were investigated using X-ray, FT-IR and DSC. The drug content of microspheres prepared by MESE method was significantly lower (15. 54 % ± 0. 46) than microspheres prepared by ESE method (41. 08 ± 0. 40 %). The results showed that as the amount of cyclohexane was increased from 2 mL to 6 mL the drug content of microspheres was increased from 15. 54 % to 28. 71 %. Higher encapsulation efficiencies were obtained for microspheres prepared by ESE method (95. 87 %) in comparison with MESE method (64. 71 %). Mean particle size of microsphere prepared by ESE method was not remarkably affected by drug to polymer ratio, whereas in MSES method when the volume of cyclohexane was increased the mean particle size of microsphere was significantly decreased. The ratio of drug to polymer significantly changed the rate of drug release from microspheres and the highest drug release was obtained for the microsphere with high drug to polymer ratio. The amount of cyclohexane did not significantly change the drug release. Although, x-ray showed a small change in crystallinity of theophylline in microspheres, DSC results proved that theophylline in microspheres is in amorphous state. No major chemical interaction between the drug and polymer was reported during the encapsulation process. © 2009 The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the entrapment of 3 different model proteins (tetanus toxoid, lysozyme, and insulin) into poly(D,L-lactic acid) and poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles and to address process-related stability issues. For that purpose, a modified nanoprecipitation method as well as 2 emulsion-based encapsulation techniques (ie, a solid-in <b>oil-in</b> water (s/o/w) and a double emulsion (w 1 /o/w 2) method) were used. The main modification of nanoprecipitation involved the use of a wide range of miscible organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide and ethanol instead of the common acetone and water. The results obtained showed that tetanus toxoid and lysozyme were efficiently incorporated by the double emulsion procedure when ethyl acetate was used as solvent (> 80 % entrapment efficiency), whereas it was necessary to use methylene chloride to achieve high insulin entrapment efficiencies. The use of the s/o/w method or the formation of a more hydrophobic protein-surfactant ion pair did not improve protein loading. The nanoprecipitation method led to a homogenous population of small nanoparticles (with size ranging from ≈ 130 to 560 nm) and in some cases also improved experimental drug loadings, especially for lysozyme (entrapment efficiency > 90 %). With respect to drug content determination, a simple and quick matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) method provided results very close to those obtained by reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography. With respect to protein stability, the duration and intensity of sonication were not a concern for tetanus toxoid, which retained more than 95 % of its antigenicity after treatment for 1 minute. Only a high methylene chloride:water ratio was shown to slightly decrease toxoid antigenicity. Finally, no more than 3. 3 % of A 21 desamido insulin and only traces of covalent insulin dimer were detected in nanoparticles. In conclusion, both the double emulsion and nanoprecipitation methods allowed efficient protein encapsulation. MALDI-TOF MS allowed accurate drug content determination. The manufacturing processes evaluated did not damage the primary structure of insulin...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of novel non-viral delivery vehicles {{is essential in}} the search of more efficient strategies for retina and brain diseases. Herein, optimized niosome formulations prepared by <b>oil-in</b> water (o/w) and film-hydration techniques were characterized in terms of size, PDI, zeta potential, morphology and stability. Three ionizable glycerol-based cationic lipids containing a primary amine group (lipid 1), a triglycine group (lipid 2) and a dimethylamino ethyl pendent group (lipid 3) as polar head-groups were part of such niosomes. Upon the addition of pCMS-EGFP plasmid, nioplexes were obtained at different cationic lipid/DNA ratios (w/w). The resultant nioplexes were further physicochemically characterized and evaluated to condense, release and protect the DNA against enzymatic digestion. In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate transfection efficiency and cell viability in HEK- 293, ARPE- 19 and PECC cells. Interestingly, niosome formulations based on lipid 3 showed better transfection efficiencies in ARPE- 19 and PECC cells {{than the rest of}} cationic lipids showed in this study. In vivo experiments in rat retina after intravitreal and subretinal injections together with in rat brain after cerebral cortex administration showed promising transfection efficiencies when niosome formulations based on lipid 3 were used. These results provide new insights for the {{development of}} non-viral vectors based on cationic lipids and their applications for efficient delivery of genetic material to the retina and brain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The main {{challenge}} in disease treatment {{is no more}} the discovery of new therapeutic drugs, but to provide targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs to specific sites without incurring systemic toxicity effects. An efficient way of reducing the toxicity is by encapsulating the drug with a biodegradable matrix that can provide controlled release of the drug along with local heating of the drug. Local heating {{can be obtained by}} incorporating magnetic iron oxide particles that heat upon exposure to AC electromagnetic fields. The magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are also gaining much attention as MRI contrast agents. Thus it would be of potential benefit if a drug delivery system is designed to encapsulate the drug as well as the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles within a biodegradable matrix, thereby providing a dual modal imaging and therapeutic delivery system. The key step in the design of a dual modal drug delivery system is the encapsulation of the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with polymer of choice. The magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were encapsulated into a robust poly (styrene-co-vinylbenzylchloride-co-divinylbenzene) (PSVBDVB) to study these synthetic variations upon encapsulation with a polymer. The next step to the design of drug delivery system was to replace the PSVBDVB polymer by a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer- Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). The PLGA composites containing the Fe@FeOx core shell nanoparticles and the drug analog [Ru(bpy) dye] was prepared by <b>oil-in</b> water emulsion solvent evaporation technique. The local heating of the PLGA composites was also achieved by irradiating the Fe@FeOx nanoparticles with 2. 45 GHz microwave radiations. Higher Ru(bpy) dye release from the composites by locally heating the sample with 2. 45 GHz microwave pulse compared to externally heating the composite sample was achieved. 	The final step was the design of controlled release drug delivery system with dual modal imaging and therapeutic capabilities. To obtain narrow sized PLGA composites the Fe@FeOx nanoparticles were replaced by chloroform based ferrofluid. The ferrofluid was synthesized by novel thermolysis technique. The release of the dye from the PLGA composites when placed in the Rf induction coil was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy and a linear increase in the fluorescent intensity was observed with time. Also, the controlled release of the dye from the composites was achieved by a pulsed Rf treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging was also performed using the PLGA composites which showed enhancement in the T 2 -weighted image contrast and thus negligible reduction in the contrast capabilities of the iron oxide particles (R 2 = 58. 7 s- 1 mM- 1). The PLGA composites containing the drug analog and the iron oxide nanoparticles thus constitute a controlled release drug delivery system with dual modal imaging and therapeutic capabilities...|$|E
