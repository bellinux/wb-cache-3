5|$|When Lisa {{succeeds in}} making {{friends with a}} group of local children, Bart becomes jealous and plots revenge against Lisa. He decides to teach Lisa a lesson by showing her friends her yearbook, {{revealing}} that she is a nerd. Lisa is furious at Bart, thinking that his disclosure has turned her friends away. Eventually, at a carnival, Bart realises how depressed Lisa has become, and how he cost her the only friends she has ever had. However, when Lisa returns to the beach house from the carnival she finds her friends in the act <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> the Simpsons' car with sea shells in her honor, and they explain that they like her for who she is. To make up with Lisa, Bart has them sign her yearbook.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth I, {{influenced}} by her royal favourite Robert Dudley, appointed Sir Henry Sidney as President of the Council in 1560, {{and he took}} up residence at Ludlow Castle. Henry was a keen antiquarian {{with an interest in}} chivalry, and used his post to restore much of the castle in a late-perpendicular style. He extended the castle by building family apartments between the Great Hall and Mortimer's Tower, and used the former royal apartments as a guest wing, starting a tradition <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> the Great Hall with the coats of arms of council officers. The larger windows in the castle were glazed, a clock installed and water piped into the castle. The judicial facilities were improved with a new courthouse converted out of the 14th-century chapel, facilities for prisoners and storage facilities for the court records, Mortimer's Tower in the outer bailey being turned into a record depository. The restoration was generally sympathetic and, although it included a fountain, a real tennis court, walks and viewing platform, it was less ephemeral a make-over than seen in other castle restorations of the period.|$|E

25|$|Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and {{traditional}} Protestant communities frame worship around the liturgical year. The liturgical cycle divides the year {{into a series}} of seasons, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> churches, colours of paraments and vestments for clergy, scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.|$|E
40|$|Parabolic Higgs bundles can be {{described}} in terms <b>of</b> <b>decorated</b> swamps, which we studied in a recent paper. This description induces a notion of stability of parabolic Higgs bundles depending on a parameter, and we construct their moduli space inside the moduli space <b>of</b> <b>decorated</b> swamps. We then introduce asymptotic stability <b>of</b> <b>decorated</b> swamps in order to study the behavior of the stability condition as one parameter approaches infinity. The main result is the existence of a constant, such that stability with respect to parameters greater than this constant is equivalent to asymptotic stability. This implies boundedness <b>of</b> all <b>decorated</b> swamps which are semistable with respect to some parameter. Finally, we recover the usual stability condition of parabolic Higgs bundles as asymptotic stability. Comment: 14 page...|$|R

25|$|Stunt Night is a {{competition}} {{among the four}} classes that builds a bond between members and creates class spirit. It began in 1909 when George Rosborough, the physical education instructor, initiated Stunt Night to give the campus residents, who could not go home, an activity during the Christmas holidays. The Stunt Night committee selects a theme for the event, allowing the class directors time to prepare a skit and an original song. The winning class has the honor <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> the Stunt Night blanket which is then displayed in the Musick Alumni Center and Museum for a year.|$|E

500|$|The verso of the folio {{containing}} the Arrest of Christ contains a full page <b>of</b> <b>decorated</b> text which begins [...] "". Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another full page <b>of</b> <b>decorated</b> text (folio 203r [...] "Iesus autem plenus"). In {{addition to this}} page, five other full pages also receive elaborate treatment. In Matthew, {{there is one other}} full-page treatment ( [...] , [...] "Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones"). In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages <b>of</b> <b>decorated</b> text ( [...] , [...] "Erat autem hora tercia", and folio 187v, [...] " [...] quidem [...] postquam"). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages <b>of</b> fully <b>decorated</b> text (folio 188v, [...] "Fuit in diebus Herodis [...] ", and , [...] "Una autem sabbati valde"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. There is no surviving full page of text in the Gospel of John other than the Incipit. However, in the other three Gospels, all the full pages <b>of</b> <b>decorated</b> text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained full pages <b>of</b> <b>decorated</b> text that have been lost.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, there was a {{stagnation}} in the production of decorative tiles, owing first to the incursion of the Napoleonic army and later to social and economic changes. When around 1840 immigrant Brazilians started an industrialized production in Porto, the Portuguese took over the Brazilian fashion <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> the façades of their houses with azulejos. While these factories produces high-relief tiles in one or two colours, the Lisbon factories started using another method: the transfer-print method on blue-and-white or polychrome azulejos. In the last decades of the 19th century, the Lisbon factories started to use another type of transfer-printing: using creamware blanks.|$|E
25|$|The Kolonna Eterna was {{the first}} local {{monument}} by Paul Vella Critien to be installed in a public space and officiated on 27 February 2003. Behind the project was the San Gwann Local Council which pushed the idea <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> public gardens with the inclusion of well established local artists' art. Paul Vella Critien has received art education in Italy and had already experience as an artist career when he lived in Australia. Since its erection the monument had already {{caught the attention of}} the public because of its phallic appearance however it is intended to represent an Egyptian obelisk pointing to the open skies as a symbol to eternity.|$|E
25|$|Mosaic {{is the art}} <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> solid {{surfaces}} {{with pieces}} of multi-coloured stone or glass set in mortar. Golden mosaic can be created by applying gold leaf to a single surface of a transparent glass tile, and placing the gilt inwards towards the mortar {{so that it is}} visible but cannot be scraped. The gilt tiles are often used as a background to figures, giving a glowing and sumptuous effect. Mosaic can be applied equally well to flat or curved surfaces and is often used to decorate vaults and domes. In churches where mosaic is applied extensively, it gives an impression that the interior of the church has been spread with a blanket of pictures and patterns.|$|E

25|$|The {{geometric}} or floral, interlaced forms, taken together, {{constitute an}} infinitely repeated pattern that {{extends beyond the}} visible material world. To many in the Islamic world, they symbolize the concept of infinite proves of existence of one eternal God. The repetitiveness, simplicity contrasted with complexity and percision suggests that our complex universe {{is only one of}} the many manifestations of the infinitely obvious and present Allah, the one God. Furthermore, the Islamic artist conveys a definite spirituality without the iconography of Christian art. Non-figural ornaments are used in mosques and buildings around the Muslim world, and it is a way <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> using beautiful, embellishing and repetitive Islamic art instead of using pictures of humans and animals (which some Muslims believe is forbidden (Haram) in Islam).|$|E
25|$|The Biblioteca Central (Central Library) {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} prism in {{the center}} of the campus. It was built by Gustavo Saavedra, Juan Martínez and Juan O'Gorman. O’Gorman was in charge <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> the four sides with multicolored mosaics of stone pieces brought from all parts of Mexico. The murals relate to the history of Mexico. The north side reflects the pre-Hispanic period; the south reflects the colonial period and the east is from the modern period. The west side is meant to represent Mexico today with the coat of arms of the university in the center with José Vasconcelos’ motto of “Por mi raza hablará mi espíritu” (For my race, speaks my spirit.). These mosaics are the largest of their type in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Great Parlour was {{the most}} {{important}} room in the early 17th century. According to the inventory of 1611 it had the best furniture, and contained the Batts' collection of maps. In the 1630s the Batts added a magnificent plaster ceiling and painted the oak panelling including a landscape scene above the fireplace. Most of the original panels have survived. The painting technique known as scumbling was a way <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> to create an air of warmth and grandeur. Few examples of this decorative work survive today. In the late 17th century, dining rooms and parlours were the preferred rooms for eating and entertaining guests in private. The great parlour is furnished with pieces intended to show it as a fashionable and comfortable room of the 1690s.|$|E

25|$|Renaissance figure work {{calls for}} little comment. During the 16th century many good {{examples}} were produced those priestly statues {{in the museum}} of Sens for example. But the figure work used in the decoration of cabinets, etc., seldom rose above the ordinary level. In the 18th century cherubs heads were fashionable and statuettes were sometimes carved in boxwood as ornaments, but as a means <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> houses wood sculpture ceased to be. The Swiss, however, have kept up their reputation for animal sculpture to the present day, and still turn out cleverly carved chamois and bears, etc.; as a rule the more sketchily cut the better the merit. Their more ambitious works, their groups of cows, etc., sometimes reach {{a high level of}} excellence.|$|E
25|$|Siqueiros was {{eventually}} arrested in 1960 for openly criticizing the President of Mexico, Adolfo López Mateos, and leading {{protests against the}} arrests of striking workers and teachers, though the charges were commonly known to be false. Numerous protests ensued, even including an appeal by well-known artists and writers in The New York Times ad in 1961. Unjustly imprisoned, Siqueiros continued to paint, and his works continued to sell. During that stay, he would make numerous sketches for the project <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> the Hotel Casino de la Selva, owned by Manuel Suarez y Suarez. After international pressure {{was put on the}} Mexican authorities, Siqueiros was finally pardoned and released in the spring of 1964. He immediately resumed working on his suspended murals in the Actors' Union and Chapultepec Castle.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} {{influence from}} the East is strangely {{shown in the}} fashion <b>of</b> <b>decorating</b> external brick walls of churches built about the 12th century, in which bricks roughly carved into form are set up {{so as to make}} bands of ornamentation which it is quite clear are imitated from Cufic writing. This fashion was associated with the disposition of the exterior brick and stone work generally into many varieties of pattern, zig-zags, key-patterns etc.; and, as similar decoration is found in many Persian buildings, it is probable that this custom also was derived from the East. The domes and vaults to the exterior were covered with lead or with tiling of the Roman variety. The window and door frames were of marble. The interior surfaces were adorned all over by mosaics or frescoes in the higher parts of the edifice, and below with incrustations of marble slabs, which were frequently of very beautiful varieties, and disposed so that, although in one surface, the coloring formed a series of large panels. The better marbles were opened out so that the two surfaces produced by the division formed a symmetrical pattern resembling somewhat the marking of skins of beasts.|$|E
