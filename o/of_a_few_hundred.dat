5|$|After {{the fall}} of Belgrade on 20 October 1944, Mihailović and a force <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> of his Chetniks withdrew from Serbian territory, crossed the Drina and based {{themselves}} in the Majevica mountain area north of Tuzla in north-eastern Bosnia. Ostojić, who was commanding Herzegovinian Chetniks, was joined by Đurišić and his Montenegrin Chetniks and together they withdrew towards Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|The team {{received}} {{a number of}} Western Electric Type 316A large acorn vacuum tubes in early 1937. These were suitable for building transmitter units of about 20W continual power for wavelengths of 1 to 10m (300 to 30MHz). Percy Hibberd built a prototype transmitter with pulses <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> watts and fitted it to the Heyford in March 1937.|$|E
5|$|A French {{garrison}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> {{men took}} over the fort on 12 June. During the subsequent Maltese uprising and insurrection against the French, Maltese insurgents built Għargħar and Sqaq Cappara batteries to bombard Fort Manoel. The Maltese attacked the fort {{on a number of}} occasions, and the French retaliated with their own bombardment at least once. On 12 September 1799, a company of French troops from Fort Manoel attempted to silence an insurgent gun position in San Ġwann, but were repelled by the Maltese insurgents.|$|E

5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E
5|$|At 8:24a.m. MDT, Reid's {{aircraft}} {{began its}} takeoff from Runway 30 to the northwest, in rain, strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence. According to witnesses, the plane lifted off and climbed slowly, with its nose high and its wings wobbling. It began a gradual right turn, and after reaching an altitude <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> feet, the plane {{rolled out of}} its turn, then descended rapidly, crashing at a near-vertical angle into Kornegay Court, a street in a residential neighborhood. Dubroff, her father, and Reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces. Reid, who was legally the pilot in command for all of Dubroff's flights, was allegedly manipulating the controls during this particular flight segment.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{in a series}} of slits usually cut by the mother's {{ovipositor}} in live branches or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred,</b> are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a day or two of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions. Oviposition has been observed {{on a wide range of}} native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.|$|E

5|$|The Rhodesian African Rifles {{were based}} at Borrowdale in {{north-east}} Salisbury between 1940 and 1943. Apart from a contingent sent south to Durban to guard Italian prisoners {{on their way}} to Rhodesia, the regiment's main role was garrison duties within the colony. The Rhodesian Air Askari Corps, a unit of black volunteer troops under white command, guarded the air bases and also provided manpower for non-armed labour. The perceived possibility that Japan might attempt an invasion of southern Africa via Madagascar led to the consolidation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> rural whites into the Southern Rhodesia Commando, a part-time cadre intended as the basis for a guerrilla-style resistance movement, from 1942.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species of}} {{woodpeckers}} in the Americas, the ivory-billed woodpecker and the imperial woodpecker, {{have been considered}} extinct since the mid-to-late 20th century, though there have been possible but disputed sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers in the United States since 2004, and a small population may survive in Cuba. Another critically endangered species is the Okinawa woodpecker from Japan, with a single declining population <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> birds. It is threatened by deforestation, golf course, dam and helipad construction, road building and agricultural development.|$|E
5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> feet. Because the ice over the valleys would be thicker than the ice over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in {{the removal of the}} easily quarried slates of the valleys. The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Nuckols, laser-driven inertial fusion confinement {{was expected to}} require lasers <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> kilojoules and use fuel droplets created by a perfume mister arrangement. LLNLs research since that time has demonstrated that such an arrangement cannot work, and requires machined assemblies for each shot. To be economically useful, an IFE machine would need to use fuel assemblies that cost pennies. Although LLNL does not release prices for their own targets, the similar system at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester makes targets for about $1 million each. It is suggested that NIF's targets cost more than $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element of}} the Commonwealth army {{consisted}} of various private armies fielded by the most powerful magnates. In time of peace these consisted of usually small regiments <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> men, but at their extreme they could number up to 10,000, including cavalry and artillery. In some instances the magnate contribution could surpass that of the main Commonwealth army on the frontlines, although often the magnates preferred to save their troops, as they were not compensated for the state for their contributions. The troops were paid for and equipped by the richest of the noble families, such as the Opaliński, Lubomirski, Potocki, Ossoliński, Zamoyski, Koniecpolski, Sieniawski, Żółkiewski, Sapieha, Chodkiewicz, Pac and Radziwiłł families. This {{was one of the}} reasons why the magnates played a major role in Polish politics, and on occasion, allowed them to engage in bloody civil wars (such as the Lithuanian Civil War in 1700) amongst themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the {{government}} of New York City installed Wi-Fi routers at 10 payphones in the city (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, and one in Queens) {{as part of a}} pilot project. The Wi-Fi was free of charge and available for use at all times. The Wi-Fi signal was detectable from a radius <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> feet (about 100m). Two of New York City's largest advertising companies—Van Wagner and Titan, who collectively owned more than 9,000 of New York City's 12,000 payphones at the time—paid $2,000 per router, with no monetary input from either the city or taxpayers. While the payphones participating in the Wi-Fi pilot project were poorly marked, the Wi-Fi offered at these payphones was significantly faster than some of the other free public Wi-Fi networks offered elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|ARGO-YBJ is a “full {{coverage}} ” {{air shower}} detector currently under construction at the Yangbajing Laboratory (4300 m a. s. l., Tibet, China). First data obtained with <b>a</b> subset <b>of</b> the apparatus {{will be available}} in summer 2003 while the full detector operation is expected in 2005.

5|$|With the {{invasion}} imminent, Henry mobilised his forces and fleet outside Pevensey, close to Robert's anticipated landing site, training {{some of them}} personally in how to counter cavalry charges. Despite English levies and knights owing military service to the Church arriving in considerable numbers, many of his barons did not appear. Anselm intervened {{with some of the}} doubters, emphasising the religious importance of their loyalty to Henry. Robert unexpectedly landed further up the coast at Portsmouth on 20 July with a modest force <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> men, but these were quickly joined by many of the barons in England. However, instead of marching into nearby Winchester and seizing Henry's treasury, Robert paused, giving Henry time to march west and intercept {{the invasion}} force.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Alexander the Great, the only Macedonian cavalry units attested in battle were the {{companion}} cavalry. However, during his campaign in Asia against the Persian Empire he formed a hipparchia (i.e. unit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hundred</b> horsemen) of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic Persians. When marching his forces into Asia, Alexander brought 1,800 cavalrymen from Macedonia, 1,800 cavalrymen from Thessaly, 600 cavalrymen {{from the rest of}} Greece, and 900 prodromoi cavalry from Thrace. Antipater was able to quickly levy 600 native Macedonian cavalry to fight in the Lamian War when it began in 323 BC. For his infantry, the most elite members of his hypaspistai were designated as the agema, yet a new term for hypaspistai emerged after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC: the argyraspides ('silver shields'). The latter continued to serve after {{the reign of}} Alexander the Great and may have been of Asian origin. Overall, his pike-wielding infantry numbered some 12,000 men, 3,000 of which were elite hypaspistai and 9,000 of which were pezhetairoi. Alexander continued the use of Cretan archers, yet around this time a clear reference to the use of native Macedonian archers was made. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace and were organized into chiliarchs.|$|E
