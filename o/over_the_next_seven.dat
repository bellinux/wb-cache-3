5|$|Johnson {{moved back}} into the lead on lap 80, after {{receiving}} assistance from Earnhardt, before losing it to Stewart around the inside two laps later after Stewart was helped by Mike Wallace. On the 81st lap, Mike Wallace's right-rear tire blew causing a fifth caution to be displayed; Wallace regained control of his car but his tire struck Michael Waltrip's car forcing him to pit for repairs. Most of the field, including Stewart, elected to make pit stops for tires and fuel. Kyle Busch gained the lead after the pit stops, and led the field back up to speed at the lap-86 restart, followed by Earnhardt. On lap 89, Labonte led the outside lane after he was helped by Earnhardt. Hamlin, Earnhardt and Kenseth traded the first position <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> laps. Hamlin's right-front tire exploded in turn two on lap 98 and crashed heavily into the turn two outside wall, triggering a sixth caution. The leaders, including Kyle Busch, who took the lead before the caution, made pit stops for tires and fuel.|$|E
5|$|Smith became Deputy Prime Minister {{following}} the Rhodesian Front's December 1962 election victory, and {{stepped up to}} the premiership after Field resigned in April 1964. With the UK government refusing to grant independence while Rhodesia did not devise a set timetable for the introduction of majority rule, talks with the UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson repeatedly broke down, leading Smith and his Cabinet to declare independence on 11 November 1965. His government endured in the face of United Nations economic sanctions with the assistance of South Africa and, until 1974, Portugal. Talks with the UK in 1966, 1968 and 1971 came to nothing. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970 and led the RF to three more decisive election victories <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> years. After the Bush War began in earnest in 1972, he negotiated with the non-militant nationalist leader Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the rival guerrilla movements headed by Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe.|$|E
5|$|With {{the energy}} and impetuosity noted by Lang, Henson worked {{continually}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> years to improve the parish, restoring {{the fabric of the}} church, opening clubs for his parishioners, and holding popular open-air services in the vicarage grounds. At Barking his high-church leanings were welcomed, and he was invited to preach from time to time at St Alban's Holborn, a central London bastion of Anglo-Catholicism. He was never physically strong, and his relentless work at Barking put a strain on his physique. In 1895 he accepted an offer from Lord Salisbury of a less arduous post, the chaplaincy of St Mary's Hospital, Ilford, which he held until 1900. In 1895 and 1896, Henson was select preacher at Oxford, and from 1897 he served as chaplain to John Festing, Bishop of St Albans. He had time for writing; between 1897 and 1900 he published four books, ranging from purely theological studies to analyses of Church politics. His beliefs had changed from his early high-churchmanship to a broad-church latitudinarianism; his 1899 Cui bono? set out his concerns about the strict ritualists in the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, the {{treatments}} are relatively inexpensive. For example, {{the treatment for}} schistosomiasis is US$0.20 per child per year. Nevertheless, control of neglected diseases is estimated to require funding of between US$2 billion to US$3 billion <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five to <b>seven</b> years. Some pharmaceutical companies have committed to donating all the drug therapies required, and mass drug administration (for example mass deworming) has been successfully accomplished in several countries. However, preventative measures are often more accessible in the developed world, but not universally available in poorer areas.|$|R
50|$|He {{believes}} in enhancing the market structures by building better competition structures, with base load, mid-term and peaking plans. He is {{a proponent of}} optimal pricing strategy to encourage the construction of more base-load generating capacity, and encourages the development of our indigenous resources further. The Philippines, as the second-leading geothermal generating country in the world, {{second only to the}} United States, he said, should explore more geothermal opportunities. He aimed to develop 1,200 megawatts of hydropower <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> five to <b>seven</b> years. On the renewable side, the mini-hydros and the micro-hydro initiatives, and the bio-mass were also put in place.|$|R
50|$|In 1860 the U.S. military, Mexican-Americans, Zunis, and Utes all raided Navajo land. The Navajo {{killed four}} {{soldiers}} from Fort Defiance in January. On August 30, Manuelito, Barboncito and 1,000 Navajo attacked the US {{army in the}} Second Battle of Fort Defiance. Meanwhile, others raided sheep near Santa Fe. 400 New Mexicans under Manuel Antonio Chaves formed a militia and raided Navajo land, followed by independent raids by citizens to take captives. In retaliation for the attack on Fort Defiance, Canby's Campaign set out in early October. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> several months <b>seven</b> army expeditions killed 23 Navajo and destroyed Navajo stock and crops.|$|R
5|$|In January 1891, Morris began {{renting a}} cottage near to Kelmscott House, No. 16 Upper Mall in Hammersmith, which {{would serve as}} the first {{premises}} of the Kelmscott Press, before relocating to the neighbouring No. 14 in May, that same month in which the company was founded. Devoted {{to the production of}} books which he deemed beautiful, Morris was artistically influenced by the illustrated manuscripts and early printed books of Medieval and Early Modern Europe. Before publishing its first work, Morris ensured that he had mastered the techniques of printing and secured supplies of hand-made paper and vellum which would be necessary for production. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>seven</b> years, they would publish 66 volumes. The first of these would be one of Morris' own novels, The Story of the Glittering Plain, which was published in May 1891 and soon sold out. The Kelmscott Press would go on to publish 23 of Morris' books, more than those of any other author. The press also published editions of works by Keats, Shelley, Ruskin, and Swinburne, as well as copies of various Medieval texts. A number of the Press' books contained illustrations provided by Burne-Jones. The Press' magnum opus would be the Kelmscott Chaucer, which had taken years to complete and included 87 illustrations from Burne-Jones. Morris still remained firmly in an employer relation with those working at the Press, although organised outings for them and paid them above average wages.|$|E

When the buffalo hunting declined, Garrett left Texas and rode to the New Mexico Territory.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, a Water Resources Development Promotion Law was passed. On its basis <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade <b>seven</b> river basins {{with high}} growth in water needs were {{designated}} for water resources development and investments in dams, weirs and inter-basin transfers was undertaken {{on the basis}} of comprehensive development plans for each basin. During the 1970s and 80s numerous dams were thus built to provide storage to avoid future water scarcity and to supply the growing cities with sufficient water. However, the construction of some dams was substantially delayed. For example, construction of the dam forming what is today Lake Miyagase was begun in 1971, but {{for a number of reasons}} including the need to resettle 300 households, the dam was only completed in 2000. Beginning in the 1960s investment in waste water treatment was initiated. In 1993 the Environmental Law was passed and subsequently legislation was passed to protect the headwaters of rivers, thus gradually shifting from a curative approach to a preventative approach of water quality management.|$|R
50|$|In March 1940, after {{training}} at Tidworth, the 1st Regiment joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France {{as part of}} the 1st Armoured Reconnaissance Brigade, initially the Corps Cavalry to III Corps. However, in May, the Regiment passed under the command of 48th (South Midland) Division, 44th (Home Counties) Division, Macforce, and finally back to 48th (South Midland) Division. The Regiment was first involved in fighting near Ath, south of Brussels, and then <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> fortnight fought <b>seven</b> rearguard actions before being finally surrounded at Cassel on the night of 29/30 May in the company of 145th Infantry Brigade.

50|$|The lull in English {{operations}} following Salisbury's {{injury and}} death gave {{the citizens of}} Orléans time to knock out the remaining arches of the bridge on their end, disabling {{the possibility of a}} quick repair and direct assault. The new siege commander appointed by Bedford in mid-November, William de la Pole (Earl of Suffolk) resolved on surrounding the city and starving it into submission. He did not have enough men to invest the city with continuous trenchlines, so he set up a series of outworks, (bastides). <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few months, <b>seven</b> strongholds were set up on the north bank, and four on the south bank, with the small riverine isle of Charlemagne (west of Orléans) commanding the bridges connecting the two banks.|$|R
