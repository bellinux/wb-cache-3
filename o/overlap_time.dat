50|$|The {{high level}} of {{resource}} uncertainty, late weaning, and potential <b>overlap</b> <b>time</b> of suckling young all lead to violent sibling rivalry and provide a good environment for studying parent-offspring conflict. From an offspring’s point of view, it would be most beneficial to continue suckling and receive more than {{its fair share of}} milk, but to the mother seal, it would pay to wean the older, more independent offspring in order to invest in the next pup. Thus, studies show that 75% of mothers intervened, often aggressively, when the older sibling harassed the newborn pups. Mothers would bite or lift the older offspring roughly by its skin, which sometimes caused open wounds. Maternal aggression towards the older sibling diminishes with time after the second sibling’s birth. Even without direct aggression, older siblings may still indirectly harm their younger siblings by outcompeting them for milk. The older offspring usually suckles first and allows their younger sibling access to the mother only after it is satiated, resulting in very little milk left over for the younger pup. Thus, the younger siblings often die from starvation.|$|E

5000|$|In her book, Shadowboxing: Representations of Black Feminist Politics, Joy James {{characterized}} {{the work of}} black militant feminists such as Ida B. Wells-Barnett {{as a kind of}} [...] "limbo" [...] dance. This analogy is an embodied characterization of political work and brings movement into the realm of the political and the performative. Often, militant political activist work is not positioned in relation to an embodied practice such as dance, but if one looks closely at all of the feats of [...] "bending backward" [...] that activists such as Wells-Barnett had to engage in, there would be no doubt that these women were the political acrobats of their time. Joy James describes her theorization of [...] "limbo" [...] in the following passage: [...] Limbos are ideal spaces for witnessing and generating movements to address the inadequacies of linear liberation theories that offer little resistance to the complexity of dominance that manifests over time in multiple, intersecting layers and sites. In the limbos of social movements, the past, present, and future coexist and <b>overlap.</b> <b>Time</b> is nonlinear. Space and community are expansive. In their progressive forward movement, contemporary black feminisms often bend backward toward historical protofeminist ancestors like abolitionist Maria W. Stewart, Ida B. Wells, and Ella Baker. In so doing these feminisms routinely retrieve from the sidelines of conventional political memory important ancestral leaders for current considerations and political struggles. Political amnesia, the gray area surrounding political agency, partly stems from the erasure of historical figures—particularly those female ancestors who militantly fought as racial and gender outsiders for democracy, only to be marginalized later from 'respectable' political community. [...] While researching Wells-Barnett's life, this [...] "bending backward" [...] or [...] "limbo" [...] dancing that James theorizes manifests through a larger vision to build a black feminist movement that included black men, white women and white men. Wells-Barnett's anti-lynching campaign superseded the suffragists and racial uplift movements of her time due to her ability to call everyone to the proverbial table and ask for their accountability. Although not a feminist writer herself, Wells-Barnett tried to explain that the defense of white woman’s honor allowed Southern white men to get away with murder by projecting their own dark history of sexual violence onto black men. Her call for all races and genders to be accountable for their actions showed African American women that they can speak out and fight for their rights. By portraying the horrors of lynching, she worked to show that racial and gender discrimination are linked, furthering the black feminist cause.|$|E
40|$|The two-fractal overlap {{model of}} {{earthquake}} {{shows that the}} contact area distribution of two fractal surfaces follows power law decay in many cases and this agrees with the Guttenberg-Richter power law. Here, we attempt to predict the large events (earthquakes) in this model through the overlap time-series analysis. Taking only the Cantor sets, the overlap sizes (contact areas) are noted when one Cantor set moves over the other with uniform velocity. This gives a time series containing different overlap sizes. Our numerical study here shows that the cumulative overlap size grows almost linearly with time and when the overlap sizes are added up to a pre-assigned large event (earthquake) and then reset to ‘zero ’ level, the corresponding cumulative overlap sizes grows upto some discrete (quantised) levels.

40|$|In {{this study}} a new hybrid voltage source {{converter}} based topology is modeled, simulated and controlled. This new topology is usually known as alternate arm converter. For the simulation developing MATLAB/Simulink software is used. With the MATLAB/Simulink software {{the model of}} alternate arm converter is developed from the scratch. Firstly the simple one-phase average mathematical model is developed and implemented in the simulation. Then the balancing control between the arms voltages is implemented in the one-phase model. The simple one-phase with a simplified control model is evaluated. Then the three-phase model is created in the same MATLAB/Simulink software. Firstly the three-phase model is evaluated as working in the island mode, which means that it is working alone, not connected to the grid. The improved control is implemented in this 3 -phase model {{in order to increase}} the performance of the converter. The 3 -phase model with improved control model is connected to the grid by using MATLAB/Simulink software. The grid connection is simulated with the voltage sources and phase locked loop control. The phase locked loop constantly adjust the voltage in order to lock onto the phase and frequency. Furthermore it is extract a voltage angle for the used dq 0 transformation, which simplifies control. The grid connected model is simulated and evaluated. After this evaluation the MATLAB/Simulink simulation model of the alternate arm converter, together with control is connected in the point to point scheme. The point to point scheme represents the energy transmission from the one point to another or in the different case it can also transmit the energy in the other side. The point to point system is represented in the MATLAB/Simulink model, together with additional droop control, which controls the DC voltage accordingly to the active power. If the active power reaches the maximum value the DC voltage decreases accordingly to the drop value and the way around. The six study cases are simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink software, with the point to point connection. In the first case the operation points are evaluated of the system and the behaviour of the AC voltages, AC currents, DC voltage, arm voltages, arm currents and circulating currents are observed in the terminal 1 and terminal 2, which is AC/DC and DC/AC converters, respectively. The second study case is aimed to inspect the DC side capacitance effect to the DC voltage. In this study case is evaluated that by increasing the DC side capacitance the DC voltage ripple reduces, therefore the AC currents with less harmonic distortions are presented. The third case shows the droop control behaviour for the different drop values. When the drop value is increasing the gain value of the droop control decreases and the smaller deviation of the active power is presented. The forth, fifth and sixth cases arise, because of the problem confronted during the operating point case simulations. The voltages between the upper and lower arms in some of the operating points are not balanced. This issue creates an arm voltage balancing problem, which in the forth study case is solving by increasing <b>overlap</b> <b>time.</b> The observation is made, that by increasing <b>overlap</b> <b>time</b> the balance between the arm voltages becomes better, but the alternate arm converter are forced to approach and change the topology to modular multilevel converter, when the 10 ms is reached in this case. The fifth study case investigates the cell capacitance effect for the arm voltage balance. In this case was found that increasing or decreasing the cell capacitance in the submodules, do not fix the arm voltage balancing problem. This approach makes voltage balance between the arms even worse. The last study case introduces the case of the arm voltage balance technique by using third harmonic current flow together with 1 ms <b>overlap</b> <b>time.</b> This study case requires a minor changes in the point to point system. The results of this technique are evaluated and it shows that this type of the balancing technique is the best technique of the voltage balancing between the arms in this system of the point to point connection.
