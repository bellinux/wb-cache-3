50|$|The {{impartial}} spectator sympathizes with the <b>offended</b> {{person in a}} manner, as emphasized previously, such that the greatest sympathy occurs when the <b>offended</b> person expresses anger or resentment in a temperate manner. Specifically, if the <b>offended</b> person seems just and temperate in coping with the offense, then this magnifies the misdeed done to the <b>offended</b> {{in the mind of}} the spectator, increasing sympathy. Although excess anger does not beget sympathy, neither does too little anger, as this may signal fear or uncaring on the part of the <b>offended.</b> This lack of response is just as despicable to the {{impartial spectator}} as is the excesses of anger.|$|R

30|$|Although the {{explicit}} purpose of euphemisms {{is to avoid}} offense, some euphemisms cause offense. Doctors can be <b>offended</b> when they are called providers (Sergel, 2015).

Patients can be <b>offended</b> when their experience with cancer is euphemized as a journey (Appleton & Flynn, 2014), and workers can be <b>offended</b> when their employment termination is conveyed as downsizing (Vickers, 2002). The very words intended to sugar coat can be more distasteful than the words the euphemisms displace.|$|R

5|$|A general {{mobilisation}} was {{not called}} until 3 April 1941, {{out of fear}} of <b>offending</b> Adolf Hitler. By the time the invasion commenced, the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation. According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić, on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty, and the poor provision of animals and vehicles. A large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army, Detachment Ormozki.|$|E
5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the <b>offending</b> judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals and replacing it with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E
5|$|After unrelenting {{political}} pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941.

A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of <b>offending</b> Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E

40|$|The aim of my Bachelor´s Degrese {{dissertation}} is {{to clarify}} {{the notion of the}} <b>offended</b> party in criminal proceedings, to summarise its process rights and to point out some facts related to int and to propose supplements or amendments to the legal regulativ in order to strengthen the <b>offended</b> party´s position. The introductory part of the work defines the term sof criminal proceedings, subjects, the parties in the proceedings and the <b>offended</b> party. The following section of the work deals with the <b>offended</b> party being represented by the solicitor and details the institute of joint solicitor. I devote a separate section to the victim of a crime act and his or her compensation as per the current legal regulation. The main part of the work deals with the <b>offended</b> party´s process rights in the criminal proceedings and divides them into rights pertaining to all <b>offended</b> parties and to the rights pertaining to those <b>offended</b> parties who are entitled to claim compensation for damage. I also focus on the institute of criminal prosecution with the <b>offended</b> party´s consent. The concluding section of the theoretical part deals with hne adhesion proceedings. The following part of the work presents my research whose purpose was to find whether the <b>offended</b> parties´ rights are sufficiently described in the legal order. I selected a qualitative research method, namely semi-structured interview. I asked selected experts six questions aubot the <b>offended</b> parties´process rights and thein application in practice. The conclusion of this part contains my proposals for modifications or amendments of certain process rights, which, as I believe, are missing in the current legal regulation. The work also features appendices: speciments of forms which bodls active in the criminal proceedings use in thein everyday practice...|$|R

The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}.

As sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded East German Navy in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the <b>offending</b> publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.|$|E

50|$|Moreover, {{problems}} of weakened states and transnational crime create an unholy confluence that is uniquely challenging. When a criminal operates outside {{the territory of}} an <b>offended</b> state, the <b>offended</b> state might ordinarily appeal to the state from which the criminal is operating to take some sort of action, such as to prosecute the offender domestically or extradite the offender so {{that he or she}} may face punishment in the <b>offended</b> state. Nonetheless, in situations in which a government is unable (or unwilling) to cooperate in the arrest or prosecution of a criminal, the <b>offended</b> state has few options for recourse.|$|R

Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 was seen by the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the <b>offending</b> justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority. The vote was 2312.|$|E
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid <b>offending</b> Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} pedophilia has {{traditionally}} {{been used as a}} homogeneous mental disorder by most authors and therapists.

Some of this difference in the possibility of being sexually <b>offended</b> is explained by the differences in the age structures of the groups.|$|R
