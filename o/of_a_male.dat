5|$|M. l. lamberti is the {{nominate}} subspecies from coastal eastern Australia and {{the original}} form described by Vigors and Horsfield in 1827.

It also has a blue rather than purple back.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{practice}} internal fertilization. The posterior part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> shark's pelvic fins are modified {{into a pair}} of intromittent organs called claspers, {{analogous to}} a mammalian penis, of which one is used to deliver sperm into the female.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of the}} rainy season, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> and multiple females.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{was born}} at Windsor Castle on 13 November 1312, and was often {{referred}} to as Edward of Windsor in his early years. The reign of his father, EdwardII, was a particularly problematic period of English history. One source of contention was the king's inactivity, and repeated failure, in the ongoing war with Scotland. Another controversial issue was the king's exclusive patronage {{of a small group of}} royal favourites. The birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> heir in 1312 temporarily improved EdwardII's position in relation to the baronial opposition. To bolster further the independent prestige of the young prince, the king had him created Earl of Chester at only twelve days of age.|$|E
5|$|Like most cats, the jaguar is solitary outside mother–cub groups. Adults {{generally}} meet only {{to court}} and mate (though limited noncourting socialization has been observed anecdotally) and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, which range from 25 to 40km2 in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> can contain those of several females. The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E

5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial apophysis which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} nilgai is Boselaphus tragocamelus. The nilgai is the sole member of the genus Boselaphus {{and placed in the}} family Bovidae. The species was described and given its binomial name by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766. He based his description on a 1745 account <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> nilgai by British physician James Parsons in the 43rd volume of Philosophical Transactions (now known as the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society). The nilgai has one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the four-horned antelope (the sole member of Tetracerus).|$|E

5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrous in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when in the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male.</b> Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into estrus again {{within a few days}} after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E
5|$|Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, {{as part of}} the {{preparations}} for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised. On 9 July, {{a few weeks before the}} Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner, Steve Cram MBE. This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes. Reaching thirty feet high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled The Runner, this unique larger-than-life bronze statue <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom's largest sporting sculpture. It depicts the very moment the runner leaves the blocks once the starter's gun has fired.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava's {{headgear}} has a ruff on the back, a {{skull and}} cobra over the forehead, and the crescent {{high on the}} right. His facial expression is of anger, conviction of something he must do, {{and one in the}} middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted in his right hand is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.|$|E
