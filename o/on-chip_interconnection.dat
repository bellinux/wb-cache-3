40|$|Due to the ever-shrinking {{feature size}} in CMOS process technology, it is {{expected}} that future chip multiprocessors (CMPs) will have hundreds or thousands of processing cores. To support a massively large number of cores, packet-switched <b>on-chip</b> <b>interconnection</b> networks have become a de facto communication paradigm in CMPs. However, the on-chip networks have several drawbacks, such as limited on-chip resources, increasing communication latency, and insufficient communication bandwidth. In this dissertation, several schemes are proposed to accelerate communication in <b>on-chip</b> <b>interconnection</b> networks within area and cost budgets to overcome the problems. First, an early transition scheme for fully adaptive routing algorithms is proposed to improve network throughput. Within a limited number of resources, previously proposed fully adaptive routing algorithms have low utilization in escape channels. To increase utilization of escape channels, it transfers packets earlier before the normal channels are full. Second, a pseudo-circuit scheme is proposed to reduce network latency using communication temporal locality. Reducing per-hop router delay becomes more important for communication latency reduction in larger <b>on-chip</b> <b>interconnection</b> networks. To improve communication latency, the previous arbitration information is reused to bypass switch arbitration. For further acceleration, we also propose two aggressive schemes, pseudo-circuit speculation and buffer bypassing. Third, two handshake schemes are proposed to improve network throughput for nanophotonic interconnects. Nanophotonic interconnects have been proposed to replace metal wires with optical links in <b>on-chip</b> <b>interconnection</b> networks for low latency and power consumptions as well as high bandwidth. To minimize the average token waiting time of the nanophotonic interconnects, the traditional credit-based flow control is removed. Thus, the handshake schemes increase link utilization and enhance network throughput...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{the last}} years high {{performance}} processor designs have evolved toward Chip-Multiprocessor (CMP) architectures that implement multiple processing cores on a single die. As the number of cores inside a CMP increases, the <b>on-chip</b> <b>interconnection</b> network will have significant impact on both overall performance and power consumption as previous studies have shown. On the other hand, CMP designs {{are likely to be}} equipped with latency hiding techniques like hardware prefetching {{in order to reduce the}} negative impact on performance that, otherwise, high cache miss rates would lead to. Unfortunately, the extra number of network messages that prefetching entails can drastically increase the amount of power consumed in the interconnect. In this work, we show how to reduce the impact of prefetching techniques in terms of power (and energy) consumption in the context of tiled CMPs. Our proposal is based on the fact that the wires used in the <b>on-chip</b> <b>interconnection</b> network can be designed with varying latency, bandwidth and power characteristics. By using a heterogeneous interconnect, where low-power wires are used for dealing with prefetched lines, significant energy savings can be obtained. Detailed simulations of a 16 -core CMP show that our proposal obtains improvements of up to 30 % in the power consumed by the interconnect (15 - 23 % on average) with almost negligible cost in terms of execution time (average degradation of 2 %).

Thermal characterization shows the thermal resistance decreased by increasing copper loading into the CNT films. The electroplated copper fills the voids between the neighboring nanotubes.
