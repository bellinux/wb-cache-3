40|$|Introduction: Nursing {{clinical}} credibility, a complex, abstract {{concept is}} rarely {{mentioned in the}} clinical setting, but is implicitly understood by nurses and physicians. The concept has neither been defined nor explored, despite its repeated use in literature. A review of the extant literature {{formed the basis for}} a concept analysis <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility, which is currently under review for publication. ^ Methods: Using taxonomic analysis, findings of a descriptive qualitative research study in which registered nurses and physicians identified attributes <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility as it applied to nurses in direct care roles in a hospital setting, formed the basis for development of taxonomies <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility. A secondary review of literature was undertaken to verify congruence of the taxonomic domains with the work of previous researchers who studied credibility and source credibility. ^ Results: Three taxonomies <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility emerged from the taxonomic analysis. Using an inductive approach, two separate taxonomies <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility emerged; one was developed from the descriptions <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility by registered nurses, and the other from physicians 2 ̆ 7 descriptions <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility. A third and final taxonomy reflects commonalities within both taxonomies. Three domains were consistent for both nurses and physicians: trustworthiness, expertise, and caring. The two disciplines differed in categories and emphases within the domains; however, both disciplines focused on the attributes of trustworthiness and caring, although physicians and nurses differed on components of expertise. ^ Discussion: Findings from this study <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility concur with the work of previous researchers who identified trustworthiness and expertise as attributes of credibility and source credibility. Findings suggest however, that trustworthiness and expertise alone are not sufficient attributes <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility. Caring emerged as an essential domain <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility according to both nurses and physicians. ^ Products: Products of this research include a concept analysis, two discipline-specific taxonomies <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility, a third final taxonomy, and a monograph that describes the development of the final taxonomy <b>of</b> nursing <b>clinical</b> credibility. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the patterns of multimorbidities <b>of</b> oral <b>clinical</b> conditions in children. The association between social position and number <b>of</b> oral <b>clinical</b> conditions, and the relationship of social position and number <b>of</b> oral <b>clinical</b> conditions with oral health-related quality of life [OHRQoL, measured using the Brazilian Child-Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (Child-OIDP) ] were also investigated. The study analysed data on 7, 208 children, 12 yr of age, from the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil Project). Cluster analysis based on the observed/expected (O/E) ratios identified six significant clusters <b>of</b> oral <b>clinical</b> conditions: (i) dental caries and missing teeth; (ii) dental caries and dental trauma; (iii) dental trauma and gingivitis; (iv) dental caries, missing teeth, and dental trauma; (v) dental caries, dental trauma, and gingivitis; and (vi) all oral clinical conditions. Ordinal regression showed that poor social position was associated with a large number <b>of</b> oral <b>clinical</b> conditions. Poisson regression demonstrated that low social position and greater number <b>of</b> oral <b>clinical</b> conditions increased the likelihood of poor OHRQoL (Child-OIDP extent). The four oral clinical conditions clustered into six distinct clusters among Brazilian children. Multimorbidity <b>of</b> oral <b>clinical</b> conditions predicted poor OHRQoL. Social position was of high relevance to multimorbidity <b>of</b> oral <b>clinical</b> conditions and children's OHRQoL...|$|R
