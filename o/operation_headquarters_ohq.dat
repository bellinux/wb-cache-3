50|$|With {{effect from}} 1 January 2007, the EU {{will have a}} third option for commanding, from Brussels, {{missions}} and operations of limited size (that is, {{like that of a}} battlegroup: some 2,000 troops). On that date, the new EU Operations Centre (EUOC) within the EU Military Staff (EUMS) will be ready for action. Using some EUMS core staff, as well as some extra “double-hatted” EUMS officers and so-called “augmentees” from the Member States, the EU will have an increased capacity to respond to crisis management situations. So far, the EU has had two options as to how to run a military operation at the <b>Operation</b> <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>OHQ)</b> level. One option is, in a so-called “autonomous” operation, to make use of facilities provided by any of the five Operation Headquarters (OHQs) currently available in European Member States. A second option is, through recourse to NATO capabilities and common assets (under the so-called “Berlin plus” arrangements), to make use of command and control options such as Operation Headquarters located at Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium and D-SACEUR as the Operation Commander. This is the option used in the conduct of Operation ALTHEA, where EUFOR BiH operates in Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) {{military}} <b>Operation</b> <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>OHQ)</b> construct {{has been}} described as a slow starter due to familiarization issues and an arena for parallel chains of command. Similarly, a recent study of a live OHQ showed national perspectives to be common, particularly with staff members from nations prominent in the operation. However, the nature of these flaws remains unclear while scholars debate if the EU OHQ can and should move towards civil-military integration. This paper investigates individual's national perspectives in an experimental setting with 180 civilian and military professionals related to crisis management. Manipulations include parent-nation prominence, familiarity with response units, and participants' ties to the parent-nation. The results show that national units are significantly favoured when more familiar to the participant compared with foreign units and when representing a minority in the multinational context. This partly mirrors previous findings. Importantly, no significant difference appears between military and civilian participants. It is concluded that the OHQ construct may be flawed by design by requiring a familiarization process, but that OHQ cohesion in terms of receptiveness to national influences would not necessarily change with civil-military integration...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} by an increasing degree of unfamiliarity and prominence of national dimensions in multinational crisis management. The research rationale rests on the argument that trust is important but may erode when roles conflict, which in turn may result when stakeholder interests diverge. The thesis describes trust and national perspectives in terms of role conflict in an EU <b>Operations</b> <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>OHQ)</b> {{as part of the}} developing EU crisis management apparatus. The results show that trust is generally important and relies primarily on a shared history. A starting capital of trust for unfamiliar others may be derived from depersonalised sources, mainly in terms of the trustee’s organisational affiliation and role occupancy. When situational interpretations diverge a trustor may employ coping strategies, which include efforts {{to make sense of the}} trustee’s behaviour. National perspectives are likely to be evident in an OHQ. However, national perspectives do not necessarily lead to role conflicts and detrimental effects on trust. National perspectives may be motivated by operational concerns as well as by patriotism or self-serving interests...|$|R
5000|$|The EUMS {{does not}} {{directly}} control the EU military missions. In order to conduct an EU military crisis management <b>operation,</b> an Operational <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>OHQ)</b> is nominated by the appropriate Council of the European Union decision. The OHQ directs the Force Headquarters or FHQ, also provided by a member country, which carries out the operation on the ground. If an EU operation is planned and conducted with recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, the OHQ is automatically the NATO HQ Allied Command Operations (ACO), formerly known as SHAPE, located in Mons, Belgium.|$|R
50|$|The CJEF CCT {{provides}} strategic {{military direction}} to the CJEF Operational <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>OHQ)</b> which, depending on circumstances, {{is to be}} based either in the UK at PJHQ Northwood or in France at Fort Mont-Valérien.|$|R
50|$|EUFOR's {{commander}} {{is currently}} Major General Anton Waldner (Austria), since March 2017. For this mission, the European Union Military Staff is using NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) as the EU's Operational <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>OHQ)</b> {{and is working}} through the Deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, a European officer.|$|R
50|$|Currently, one of {{the most}} {{important}} tasks for the Swedish Armed Forces has been to form a Swedish-led EU Battle Group to which Norway, Finland, Ireland and Estonia will also contribute. The Nordic Battle Group (NBG) had a 10-day deployment readiness during the first half of 2008 and, although Swedish-led, had its Operational <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>OHQ)</b> in Northwood, outside London.|$|R
50|$|Participation in EU NAVFOR {{goes beyond}} EU member states. Norway {{was the first}} non-EU country to {{contribute}} to the Operation, with a warship in 2009. Thereafter, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine have provided staff officers to the Operational <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>OHQ)</b> and Force <b>Headquarters</b> (FHQ). Ukraine contributed a warship early in 2014, and New Zealand contributed an MPRA asset later the same year.|$|R
