5|$|A Love Surreal is {{the third}} studio album by American neo soul singer Bilal, {{released}} on February 26, 2013, by eOne. He recorded the album for five months at various studios with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> crew from his 2010 album Airtight's Revenge, including producer Shafiq Husayn, drummer Steve McKie, and pianist Robert Glasper. Bilal wrote and produced most of the album, which he titled in reference to his unreleased album Love for Sale and John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|E
5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of the Chili Peppers' recording procedures. He wondered why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> was completed within the next month.|$|E

5|$|Although a low-quality version leaked on December 31, 2014, a full version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> was {{not made}} {{available}} for the public.

The single was included in the list of 79 contenders for the award, but it did not receive a nomination.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{pressing}} of 1,000 {{copies of}} the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A.'s record label. The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo {{to ask for the}} remaining copies to be returned so that he could distribute them at shows and in clubs, which he felt was a more appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape. He stated that around 2,000 copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> were produced in total.|$|E
5|$|Despite their success, {{the band}} has had several feuds with the {{corporate}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> industry. The first was their notable conflict with TVT Records regarding the band's first album, Pretty Hate Machine, which led Reznor to record his follow-up album in secrecy {{to avoid the}} label's influence. NIN signed to Interscope Records afterward, but {{after the release of}} their fifth studio album Year Zero in 2007, Reznor announced that the band would release future material independently. The band signed with Columbia Records for the release of their eighth album Hesitation Marks (2013) but returned to self-releasing material with the second Nine Inch Nails EP, Not the Actual Events (2016).|$|E

50|$|The Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A. {{was first}} {{released}} on a LP record, with five tracks on <b>the</b> first side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> and five tracks on <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record.</b> <b>The</b> album {{has not been}} reisussed on a compact disc since its initial release in 1972.|$|R

5|$|End of the Century is {{the fifth}} studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} on February 4, 1980, through Sire Records. The album was the band's first produced by Phil Spector, though he had offered the band his assistance earlier in their career. With Spector fully producing the album, {{it was the first}} release that excluded original member Tommy Ramone, who in 1978 left the band but produced their previous album Road to Ruin. Spector used more advanced standards of engineering, such as high-quality overdubbing and echo chambers. These methods caused conflict between the band and Spector since much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> used techniques that opposed those the Ramones had previously used. Spector emphasized the production value as well, working with a budget of around $200,000.|$|E
5|$|Extra Texture (Read All About It) is {{the sixth}} studio album by English {{musician}} George Harrison, released in September 1975. It was Harrison's final album under {{his contract with}} Apple Records and EMI, and the last studio album issued by Apple. The release came nine months after his troubled 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar and the poorly received Dark Horse album. The melancholic mood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> reflects Harrison's depressed state at the criticism generated by these projects.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> cover art <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} vinyl LP {{was designed}} to give the illusion that no certain side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> was <b>the</b> front, back, up or down <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record.</b> This was achieved by placing a barcode on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> and by printing <b>the</b> band and <b>record</b> name on all four sides of every edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> sleeve. Instead <b>of</b> an ordered track listing the tracks were listed haphazardly between both sides with each song title printed in a different contradictory direction. Finally, each side showed three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six band members also oriented at opposite angles from each other. When someone handling <b>the</b> <b>record</b> saw where <b>the</b> <b>record</b> jacket opened they may have realized the two most likely correct orientations for the album cover. However the illusion was impaired by the inclusion a parental advisory sticker on only one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> and <b>the</b> artwork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CD version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album which used the side with singer Angelo Moore on the cover and placed the entire track list on the opposite side.|$|R
50|$|Albert Grossman, {{owner of}} Bearsville <b>Records,</b> stopped release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> after a dispute, {{possibly}} over <b>the</b> marketability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record,</b> or, according to Sidran, Pena's refusal {{to relocate to}} the East Coast to work more closely with Grossman.|$|R
25|$|In {{the upper}} {{left-hand}} corner is a drawing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phonograph <b>record</b> and <b>the</b> stylus carried with it. The stylus {{is in the}} correct position to play <b>the</b> <b>record</b> from <b>the</b> beginning. Written around it in binary arithmetic is <b>the</b> correct time <b>of</b> one rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record,</b> 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths <b>of</b> a second, <b>the</b> time period associated with a fundamental transition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen atom. The drawing indicates that <b>the</b> <b>record</b> should be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> and stylus, with a binary number giving the time to play one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>record</b> – about an hour.|$|R
5|$|For the {{duration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> period, producer Bob Rock played bass {{on the album}} and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time. Once the record was completed in early 2003, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyseamong othersauditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, {{was chosen as the}} new bassist. As Metallica moved on, Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002, and was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, and at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording</b> process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
5|$|M.I.A. {{named the}} album after her mother, in {{contrast}} to her first album Arular, which was named after her father, and stated that her mother's struggles in life are a major theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recording.</b> She began recording the album in early 2006 and worked on the tracks in various locations around the world, including India, Jamaica, Australia, Liberia and Trinidad. Planned sessions in the United States failed to occur, after M.I.A. was refused a long-term work visa to enter the country.|$|E
