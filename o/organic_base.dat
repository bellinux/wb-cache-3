5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is an <b>organic</b> <b>base.</b> As a base, it {{is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of this approach}} is the need to dispose of the ammonium sulfate byproduct. This problem has led some manufacturers to develop energy-efficient methods of separating formic acid from the excess water used in direct hydrolysis. In one of these processes (used by BASF) the formic acid is removed from the water by liquid-liquid extraction with an <b>organic</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

40|$|Radioactive {{narcotic}} analgesics, including morphine, dihydromorphine, nalorphine, codeine, levorphan, dextrorphan, and l-methorphan were accumulated {{against an}} apparent concentration gradient in pieces of rabbit and dog choroid plexus and in slices of dog renal cortex by a metabolically dependent mechanism. The uptake of dihydromorphine by these tissues in vitro was a saturable process depressed by low temperatures, a nitrogen atmosphere, and certain metabolic inhibitors. It also was competitively inhibited by nalorphine and by {{any one of}} several <b>organic</b> <b>bases</b> which previously have been demonstrated to be actively transported by these tissues. Under certain conditions, stimulation of dihydromorphine uptake by choroid plexus was produced by <b>organic</b> <b>bases.</b> The transport in choroid plexus {{of one of these}} <b>organic</b> <b>bases,</b> hexamethonium, was competitively inhibited by dihydromorphine. Studies with levorphan and dextrophan indicated an element of stereospecificity in their accumulation by choroid plexus. Thus it is concluded that the narcotic analgesics share the same active transport mechanisms described for a variety of <b>organic</b> <b>bases</b> that are accumulated in choroid plexus and renal tissue in vitro. Suggestions are made relative to the significance of these observations for the intact animal...|$|R
25|$|Wurtz {{measured}} {{the boiling point}} of ethylene oxide as 13.5°C, slightly higher than the present value, and discovered the ability of ethylene oxide to react with acids and salts of metals. Wurtz mistakenly assumed that ethylene oxide has the properties of an <b>organic</b> <b>base.</b> This misconception persisted until 1896 when Georg Bredig found that ethylene oxide is not an electrolyte. That it differed from other ethers — particularly by its propensity to engage in addition reactions, which are typical of unsaturated compounds — had long {{been a matter of}} debate. The heterocyclic triangular structure of ethylene oxide was proposed by 1868 or earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Melamine [...] is an <b>organic</b> <b>base</b> and a trimer of cyanamide, with a 1,3,5-triazine skeleton.

40|$|Creatine and {{trimethylamine}} oxide (TMAO) are the chief nitrogenous constituents of normal Lophius urine, {{and both of}} these <b>organic</b> <b>bases</b> characteristically have high urine/plasma concentration ratios. Competition studies involving various <b>organic</b> <b>bases</b> indicate that creatine and TMAO are excreted independently by separate transport mechanisms. TMAO excretion is inhibited competitively by tetraethylammonium ion (TEA) and by cyanine dye No. 863 [...] compounds previously shown to be transferred actively by an organic base-secreting mechanism of general occurrence among vertebrates. TEA does not inhibit competitively the active tubular reabsorpfion of TMAO in Squalus with doses which markedly depress its tubular excretion in Lophius. Glycine, which inhibits creatine reabsorption in the dog, does not interfere competitively with its secretion in Lophius. The ability of various vertebrate renal tubules to transport actively such <b>organic</b> <b>bases</b> as Nrmethyinicotinamide (1, 2), tetraethylammonium ion (3 - 5), and cyanine dyes (6, 7) against concentration gradients has recently received considerable attention. The transfer mechanism seems to be of general occurrence among vertebrates, having its counterpart in another tubular process which involves the tubular excretion of such organic acids as the phenolsulfonphthaleins, p-aminohippuric acid, and the penicillins (for review, see Smith 8)). Transport of both acids and bases is energy-dependent and subject to competitive inhibition...|$|R
