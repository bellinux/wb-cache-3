25|$|It {{appears that}} Ragnarök is {{depicted}} on the Ledberg stone in Östergötland. On {{one of its}} sides it shows a large warrior with a helmet, and who is bitten at his feet by a beast. This beast is, it is presumed, Fenrir, {{the brother of the}} Midgard Serpent, and who is attacking Odin. On the bottom of the illustration, there is a prostrate man who is holding <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and who has no legs. There is a close parallel from an illustration at Kirk Douglas on the Isle of Man. The Manx illustration shows Odin with a spear and with one of his ravens on his shoulders, and Odin is attacked {{in the same way as}} he is on the Ledberg stone. Adding to the stone's spiritual content is a magic formula that was known all across the world of the pagan Norsemen.|$|E
2500|$|When Wyatt {{and his men}} approached, the two men ran. Stilwell {{may have}} {{stumbled}} or been wounded, allowing Wyatt to reach him. Wyatt later said he shot Stilwell as Stilwell attempted to push the barrel of Earp's shotgun away. Wyatt, quoted in the Denver Republican, said [...] "I ran straight for Stilwell. It was he who killed my brother. What a coward he was! He couldn't shoot when I came near him. He stood there helpless and trembling for his life. As I rushed upon him he put <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and clutched at my shotgun. I let go both barrels, and he tumbled down dead and mangled at my feet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The pseudepigraphic Epistle of Barnabas, which {{scholars}} suggest {{may have}} been {{before the end of}} the 1st century, and certainly earlier than 135, whether the writer was an orthodox Christian or not, described the shape people at the time attributed to the device on which Jesus died: the comparisons it draws with Old Testament figures would have had no validity for its readers if they pictured Jesus as dying on a simple stake. Referring to what he saw as Old Testament intimations of Jesus and his cross, he likened the cross to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), thus describing it as having a crossbeam. He also wrote, with regard to : [...] "The Spirit saith to the heart of Moses, that he should make a type of the cross and of Him that was to suffer, that unless, saith He, they shall set their hope on Him, war shall be waged against them for ever. Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any he stretched <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and so Israel was again victorious." ...|$|E
