In this paper, we show that conventional monetary conditions indices are potentially mis-specified. Under a regime of strict inflation targeting, conventional MCIs are unreliable indicator variables or <b>operating</b> <b>targets</b> {{if there is a}} direct exchange rate effect on the rate of inflation in the Phillips Curve. We also point to the limitations of a standard MCI under strict inflation targeting. The policymaker can circumvent these limitations by redefining the inflation target. Nevertheless, from a general perspective the usefulness of MCIs in the conduct of monetary policy is doubtful in view of their model-specific nature.

50|$|The {{interest}} rate channel of monetary policy {{refers to the}} effect of monetary policy actions on {{interest rate}}s that influence the investment and consumption decisions of households and businesses. Along this channel, the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy relies on linkages between central bank instruments, operating targets, and policy goals. For example, when the Federal Reserve conducts open market operations in the federal funds market, the instrument it is manipulating is its holdings of government securities. The Fed's <b>operating</b> <b>target</b> is the overnight federal funds rate and its policy goals are maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. For the interest rate channel of monetary policy to work, open market operations must affect the overnight federal funds rate which must influence the interest rates on loans extended to households and businesses.|$|E
5000|$|An MCI {{may also}} serve as a day-to-day <b>operating</b> <b>target</b> for the conduct of {{monetary}} policy, especially in small open economies. Central banks compute MCIs, with the Bank of Canada being the first to do so, beginning in the early 1990s. [...] The MCI begins with a simple model of the determinants of aggregate demand in an open economy, which include variables such as the real exchange rate as well as the real interest rate. Moreover, monetary policy is assumed to {{have a significant effect on}} these variables, especially in the short run. Hence a linear combination of these variables can measure the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand. Since the MCI is a function of the real exchange rate, the MCI is influenced by events such as terms of trade shocks, and changes in business and consumer confidence, which do not necessarily affect interest rates.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there seems}} to be a broad {{consensus}} among economists that purely floating or completely fixed exchange rates (the so-called corner solutions) are the only viable alternatives of exchange rate management, many countries do not behave according to this paradigm and adopt a strategy within the broad spectrum of exchange rate regimes that is limited by the two corner solutions. Many of these intermediate regimes are characterized by significant foreign exchange market interventions and a certain degree of exchange rate flexibility with non-preannounced exchange rate targets. While academic research in this area usually concentrates on some specific aspects of intermediate regimes (such as the effectiveness of interventions or institutional aspects), managed floating has rarely been analyzed as a comprehensive monetary policy strategy. In this paper, we present a monetary policy framework in which central banks simultaneously use the exchange rate and the interest rate as <b>operating</b> <b>targets</b> of monetary policy. We explain the mechanics of foreign exchange market interventions and sterilization and we explain why a central bank has an interest of controlling simultaneously the two <b>operating</b> <b>targets.</b> We derive the monetary policy rules for the two <b>operating</b> <b>targets</b> from a simple open economy macro model in which the uncovered interest parity condition and the monetary conditions index play a central role.

50|$|When the Nixon shock {{happened}} in August 1971, BOJ should have appreciated the currency {{in order to}} avoid inflation. However, they still kept the fixed exchange rate as 360Yen/$ for two weeks, so it caused excess liquidity. In addition, they persisted with the Smithsonian rate (308Yen/$), and continued monetary easing until 1973. This created a greater than 10% inflation rate at that time. In order to control the stagflation, they raised the official bank rate from 7% to 9% and gradually skyrocketing prices ended in 1978. In 1979, when the energy crisis happened, they raised the official bank rate rapidly. BOJ succeeded in a quick economic recovery. After overcoming the crisis, they reduced the official bank rate. In 1980, BOJ reduced the official bank rate from 9.0% to 8.25% in August, to 7.25% in November, and to 5.5% in December in 1981. Reaganomics was set in America, and USD became strong. However, Japan tried to make fiscal reconstruction at that time, so they did not stop their financial regulation. In 1985, the agreement of G5 nations, known as the Plaza agreement, USD slipped down and Yen/USD changed from 240yen/$ to 200yen/$ at the end of 1985. Even in 1986, USD continued to fall and reached 160yen/$. In order to escape deflation, BOJ cut the official bank rate from 5% to 4.5% in January, to 4.0% in March, to 3.5% in April, 3.0% in November. At the same time, the government tried to raise the demand in Japan in 1985, and did economy policy in 1986. However, the market was confused about the rapid fall of USD. After Louvre Accord in February 1987, BOJ decreased the official bank rate from 3% to 2.5%, but JPN/USD was 140yen/$ at that time and reached 125yen/$ in the end of 1987. BOJ kept the official bank rate at 2.5% until May in 1989. The financial and fiscal regulation led to a widespread over-valuing of real estate and investments and Japan faced a bubble at that time.After 1990, the stock market and real asset market fell, at that time BOJ regulated markets until 1991 in order to end the bubble. In 1994, a terrible earthquake happened and Japanese yen became weaker and weaker. JPM/USD reached 80yen/$, so BOJ had to reduce the office bank rate to 0.5% and Japanese yen recovered. The long deflation for 20 years started at that time. In 1999, BOJ started zero-interest-rate policy, but they ended it despite government opposition when the IT bubble {{happened in}} 2000. However, Japan faced economic bubble burst in 2001, BOJ adopted the balance of current account as the main <b>operating</b> <b>target</b> for the adjustment of the financial market in March 2001 (quantitative relaxation policy), shifting from the zero-interest-rate policy. From 2003 to 2004, Japanese government did exchange intervention operation in huge amount, and the economy recovered a lot. In March 2006, BOJ finished qualitative easing, and finished the zero-interest-rate policy in June and raised to 0.25%. In 2008, the financial crisis happened, and Japanese economy turned to bad again. BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate to 0.3% and adopted the supplemental balance of current account policy. In December 2008, BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate again to 0.1% and they started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB).|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} optimal {{monetary policy}} rules for several variants {{of a simple}} optimizing model of the monetary transmission mechanism with sticky prices and/or wages. We show that robustly optimal rules can be represented by interest-rate feedback rules that generalize the celebrated proposal of Taylor (1993). Optimal rules, however, require that the current interest-rate <b>operating</b> <b>target</b> depend positively on the recent past level of the <b>operating</b> <b>target,</b> and its recent rate of increase, {{in a way that}} is characteristic of estimated central-bank reaction functions, but not of Taylor’s proposal. We furthermore find that a robustly optimal policy rule is almost inevitably an implicit rule, that requires the central bank to use a structural model to project the economy’s evolution under the contemplated policy action. However, calibrated examples suggest that optimal rules do not place nearly as much weight on projections of inflation or output many quarters in the future as in rules often discussed in the literaure on inflation targeting, or in the current practice of inflation-forecast targeting central banks.

40|$|Increased {{interest}} in alternative intermediate or <b>operating</b> <b>targets</b> has encouraged {{the development and}} estimation of the monetary conditions index (MCI). MCIs were developed {{in response to a}} need to identify alternative variables that function as intermediate or <b>operating</b> <b>targets</b> and information variables in the conduct of monetary policy. The development of MCI’s has been propelled by two policy issues faced by monetary policy makers.

MCIs are applicable to the Jamaican economy especially since deregulation and liberalization of the financial sector in 1991.
