5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|Although the Inaccessible Island rail {{may have}} been known to the Tristan Islanders who visited the island {{annually}} to hunt seals, the species first came to the attention <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876. When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson learned of the species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to collect a specimen, much to his regret.|$|E

5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, Carson found a sizable community <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> who were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 6 {{looks at}} {{solutions}} to the problem.

5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> and {{philosophers}} to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies were implemented by land management agencies throughout the United States, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines {{for the management of}} natural fires.|$|E
5|$|Deep Blue Sea is a 1999 American {{science fiction}} horror film {{directed}} by Renny Harlin. It stars Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, and rapper LL Cool J. Set {{in an isolated}} underwater facility, the film follows a team <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> and their research on mako sharks to help fight Alzheimer's disease. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on rampage and flood the facility.|$|E
5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number <b>of</b> <b>scientists</b> include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.|$|E
