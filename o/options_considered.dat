5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One of the <b>options</b> <b>considered</b> was to stage the bombers through {{a base in}} the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E
5|$|Welensky {{considered}} a federal unilateral {{declaration of independence}} when the new Northern Rhodesian constitution appeared likely to grant an African majority in its parliament. Determined at one point to prevent changes, Welensky was convinced that if he refused, the British would use military force to remove his government. Believing that preparations were being made for an invasion from Kenya, he discussed the federation's ability to repel an attack with his defence chiefs and plans were set in motion. In the end, {{the idea of a}} British invasion was one of many <b>options</b> <b>considered,</b> and did not make it past cabinet discussion.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1936 {{elections}} Bau {{advocated the}} strategy of a broad Right-wing alliance, an option which has never materialized; himself he competed {{on the list of}} Front Català d’Ordre and was elected from Tarragona. Shortly after the Frente Popular triumph was declared Bau and Calvo visited the prime minister Portela Valladares urging him to call the military and rule by decree; this was probably the most charged moment in his entire career. Once Lorenzo Maria Alier resigned as Carlist Catalan jefe in February 1936 one of the <b>options</b> <b>considered</b> was a triumvirate including Bau, but eventually it was Tomàs Caylà appointed the new regional leader.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} at Central VPA, the St. Louis Board of Education heard several proposals on moving Central VPA to another building. Among the <b>options</b> <b>considered</b> {{at a meeting in}} November 2002 was to renovate the Kiel Opera House as an academic facility and performing arts venue; although the proposal to move to Kiel was not adopted, the Board committed to replacing the high school's building in the near term. In the summer of 2004, the Board announced that Central VPA would move into the former Southwest High School building at the corner of Kingshighway and Arsenal. , the Garrison Avenue building, home to Yeatman High School from 1904 to 1927 and to Central from 1927 to 2004, is for sale for $250,000.|$|E
25|$|In {{the discussions}} {{leading up to}} the French {{adoption}} of the metric system in 1791, the leading candidate for the definition of the new unit of length, the metre, was the seconds pendulum at 45° North latitude. It was advocated by a group led by French politician Talleyrand and mathematician Antoine Nicolas Caritat de Condorcet. This was one of the three final <b>options</b> <b>considered</b> by the French Academy of Sciences committee. However, on March 19, 1791 the committee instead chose to base the metre on the length of the meridian through Paris. A pendulum definition was rejected because of its variability at different locations, and because it defined length by a unit of time. (However, since 1983 the metre has been officially defined in terms of the length of the second and the speed of light.) A possible additional reason is that the radical French Academy didn't want to base their new system on the second, a traditional and nondecimal unit from the ancien regime.|$|E
50|$|One design <b>option</b> <b>considered</b> {{during the}} {{planning}} stages for the lake included an alternate damsite near the current I-20 bridge over the Trinity River, 3.7 feet (1.1 m) downstream from the final, chosen location.|$|R

500|$|A road to {{the summit}} of Brockway Mountain was first {{proposed}} in the 1920s by Warren H. Manning, a renowned landscape architect. Manning was in the Keweenaw {{at the time to}} design Agassiz Park in Calumet and suggested the road while visiting the area. The road was designed in 1932 with three different <b>options</b> <b>considered.</b> The first involved the construction of the current road from near the Silver River on the west to the summit. It followed a route used by the previous Military Road that connected Fort Wilkins to Fort Howard; traffic would have to turn around to descend Brockway Mountain. Another option included a route from the summit southwest across the Upson Creek Valley to a second summit on the nearby Mount Lookout, a total of about [...] The third option was that of the current route down the mountain to the west.|$|E
500|$|Stenhouse first {{attempted}} to anchor the ship {{on the north}} side of Glacier Tongue itself. Disaster was only narrowly avoided when a change in the wind direction threatened to imprison Aurora between the Tongue and the advancing pack ice. With other <b>options</b> <b>considered</b> and rejected, Stenhouse finally decided to anchor at Cape Evans, site of Captain Scott's 1911 Terra Nova headquarters, some six nautical miles (11km) north of Glacier Tongue. On 14 March, after numerous failed attempts, Stenhouse manoeuvred Aurora into position, stern-first towards the shore at Cape Evans, where two large anchors had been sunk and cemented into the ground. Cables and hawsers, together with a heavy chain, attached these to the ship's stern. Two bower anchors were also dropped. By 14 March the ship was settling into the shore ice with, according to second officer Leslie Thompson, [...] "enough hawsers and anchors to hold a battleship".|$|E
500|$|In early 2002, Portland Aerial Transportation, Inc. (PATI) {{was formed}} as a {{non-profit}} board. One of its first public actions was to request the Portland Bureau of Transportation (at the time known as the Portland Office of Transportation, and abbreviated as PDOTsic) to undertake an independent analysis of the connectivity <b>options</b> <b>considered</b> earlier by the university and its development supporters. In May 2002, the city council accepted PDOT's process proposal and also accepted PATI as the project sponsor. PDOT's assessment led {{to the same conclusion}} OHSU had reached earlier: an aerial tram was the preferred approach. PDOT also recommended a second tram linking the Marquam Hill area with a nearby transit center on SW Barbur Boulevard. [...] In July 2002, the city council accepted PDOT's recommendations and asked PDOT and PATI to proceed to the design phase, including a design competition. Both were also asked to work with residents of the affected neighborhoods to identify ways to mitigate the tram's impact and identify other desired neighborhood improvements which should accompany the project. One of the results of that process was the Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge, which was completed mid-2012.|$|E
