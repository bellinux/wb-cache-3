[...] Jon C. Mirsalis notes in his website that the film [...] "almost certainly [...] Chaney, although it was directed by Allan Dwan.

[...] \Michael Blake, a Lon Chaney historian and author <b>of</b> <b>several</b> <b>books</b> <b>on</b> Lon Chaney's life and work, notes that the possibility exists that Chaney performed in a role {{during a period of}} unemployment in 1912.

Furthermore, the Encyclopedia of Early Cinema states that the American Film Manufacturing Company had moved to its Santa Barbara, California location in the summer of 1912 and that Dwan, who would later work with Chaney, left the company after a dispute with J.
