5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E

I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

I answered in the negative, telling him that I had never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
500|$|Lonnie Thompson, Earth Science {{professor}} at Ohio State University, whose work on retreating glaciers {{was featured in}} the film, was pleased with how his research was presented. [...] "It's so hard given the breadth of this topic to be factually correct, {{and make sure you}} don't lose your audience," [...] Thompson said. [...] "As scientists, we publish our papers in Science and Nature, but very few people read those. Here's another way to get this message <b>out.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> it's an excellent overview for an introductory class at a university. What are the issues and what are the possible consequences of not doing anything about those changes? To me, it has tremendous value. It will reach people that scientists will never reach." ...|$|E

Many years later Jacques Monod pointed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, who directed Beyoncé's videos, [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy". The video is inspired by the dancing of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in the 1953 musical comedy film, The Band Wagon and has a Studio 54 style. Paired with Usher, Beyoncé dances seductively and flirts with him to portray a naughty girl. She {{felt that they were}} a [...] "perfect match" [...] for the dancing scenes in the video. According to Usher, the video is a homage to classic [...] "ultimate entertainers"; including dancers, singers and actors. He further talked about the collaboration on the video, saying, [...] "Beyoncé and me have been talking about doing a record together. She reached <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said she had an idea and really wanted me to be the lead in her video... I was like, 'Well let me hear the idea.'

In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created {{for the beginning of}} the episode, titled [...] "Light of the Seven", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, [...] "The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is not really {{in the language of the}} Game of Thrones score." ...|$|E

[...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist.

500|$|Beyond Star Treks fictional innovations, its {{contributions}} to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While {{more common in}} subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one. In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told {{there was a big}} fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big grin on his face. He reached <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that Star Trek was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [...] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.' When she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
500|$|After McCoy led the Longhorns to {{a victory}} over rival, unranked Texas A (a team he had lost to twice in the past), Sports Illustrated analyst Stewart Mandel said the quarterback took a big step towards {{claiming}} the Heisman Trophy. Mandel wrote, [...] "From the Longhorns' opening touchdown drive, in which he accounted for 67 of Texas' 80 yards, McCoy was very much the one-man wrecking crew he's been all season long...His final numbers in just over three quarters of work Thursday night: 23-of-28 passing for 311 {{yards and two touchdowns}} and 11 rushes for 49 yards, with touchdown runs of 16 and 14 yards. For the season, McCoy now has a 77.6 completion percentage (soon to be a new NCAA record) for 3,445 yards, 32 touchdowns and seven interceptions, plus 476 yards and 13 touchdowns running" [...] Comparing McCoy to fellow Big 12 South quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Graham Harrell, Mandel said, [...] "But here's where McCoy stands <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Bradford, as talented as he is, is helped by the fact he has a trio of explosive receivers and two potential 1,000-yard rushers behind him. Harrell has Michael Crabtree. Daniel has Jeremy Maclin. With all due respect to Jordan Shipley and Quan Cosby, McCoy is Texas' offense. Much like Tim Tebow last season, he's both his team's leading passer and rusher. Also like Tebow—you have to wonder sometimes how he's still standing. McCoy was sacked three times Thursday night and endured several brutal hits. Following his third-quarter touchdown run, trainers attended to his shoulder on the sideline. But he was right back in there the next series." [...] Bradford and Harrell each had one regular-season game left, against Oklahoma State and Baylor, respectively. Tebow had games remaining against Florida State and Alabama.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 2014 NBA draft, Frazier {{worked out}} for several NBA teams, {{including}} the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards. Philadelphia worked him out two times, and head coach Brett Brown invited him to play for them at the 2014 Las Vegas Summer League within an hour after he was not selected in the draft. The situation was {{compared to that of}} Khalif Wyatt, who played for the 76ers through the 2013 edition of the summer league, and attended Temple University in the Philadelphia area. Frazier said, [...] "When [...] reached <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and said they wanted me for the summer league, I was ready to go for it. I just want to go out, have fun, play my hardest and show Philly and other teams what they can get from me.". According to the 76ers assistant coach, Chad Iske, he impressed the team's staff by his [...] "poise" [...] and experience at the higher level. At Las Vegas, Frazier averaged 3.4 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 steals in five games. On September 29, 2014, the Boston Celtics signed Frazier to a non-guaranteed training camp deal with the likely notion of auditioning with the Maine Red Claws in the future. On October 27, 2014, he was waived by the Celtics after appearing in four preseason games where he went 1-for-2 from the field and recorded two rebounds, four assists and four steals. As expected, four days later, he was acquired by the Maine Red Claws as an affiliate player. Frazier opened his season in the D-League by contributing 18 points, 9 assists, and 4 rebounds against the Oklahoma City Blue. He also shot 12-of-12 on free throws, helping the team win their first game.|$|E

On November 8, 2005, Horton was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He was activated on December 1 and scored in his first game back against the Washington Capitals to help the Panthers win 32. Horton added 2 goals against the Chicago Blackhawks in the Panthers' next game to bring his season total to 10 in 17 games. Against the Nashville Predators on December 13, Horton recorded his first career hat trick and stated after the game that, [...] "It's a pretty nice feeling. I felt like there was no one on me. I just tried to get it to the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It was a long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career. Also against the Lightning, Horton scored the Panthers' only goal with his 27th goal of the season. Horton completed the season playing 71 games, scoring 28 goals and adding 19 assists.|$|E
