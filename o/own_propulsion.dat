5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference {{compared to the}} TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> system and would therefore {{not be limited to}} simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.|$|E
5|$|Several {{setbacks}} {{plagued the}} design process. The mine {{in particular was}} delayed several times from its expected completion from 1771 to 1776. Piloting Turtle, moreover, required great physical stamina and coordination. The operator would have to adjust the bilge {{in order to keep}} from sinking while providing his <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> by use of a crank, which worked a propeller located {{on the front of the}} submarine, and direction by use of a lever that would operate and direct a rudder in the back. The cabin also reportedly held air for only thirty minutes of use. Thereafter, the operator would have to surface and replenish the air through a ventilator. Obviously, training would be needed in order to ensure the project's success due to the complex nature of the machine. “The boat was moved from Ezra’s farm on the Westbrook Road to what is now Ayer’s Point in Old Saybrook on the Connecticut River,” writes historian Lincoln Diamant. Bushnell had a Yale connection here that allowed him to run trials in secrecy. Bushnell did the initial testing of his submarine here, choosing his brother, Ezra, as the pilot. Despite Bushnell's insistence on secrecy surrounding his work, news of it quickly made its way to the British, abetted by a Loyalist spy working for New York Congressman James Duane.|$|E
25|$|The MH-1A was {{designed}} as a towed craft because it was expected to stay anchored for most of its life, making it uneconomical to keep the ship's <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Trevithick {{visited the}} Newcastle area in 1804 {{and had a}} ready {{audience}} of colliery (coal mine) owners and engineers. The visit was so successful that the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation {{and development of the}} steam locomotive. Trevithick continued his <b>own</b> steam <b>propulsion</b> experiments through another trio of locomotives, concluding with the Catch Me Who Can in 1808.|$|R
2500|$|Three {{different}} shipyards {{were used}} to construct the ships. Kitty Hawk was built at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Constellation at New York Naval Shipyard, America and John F. Kennedy at Newport News Shipbuilding. John F. Kennedy {{is similar to the}} earlier units in flightdeck arrangement and propulsion, but has enough differences that she is placed in her <b>own</b> class. <b>Propulsion</b> consisted of four Westinghouse geared turbines, , four shafts with eight [...] Foster Wheeler boilers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operating}} environment {{is not simply}} black space, but one with solar radiation and diffuse radiation reflected and emitted from the sun (stars), earth, other objects, and or the ship's <b>own</b> antimatter <b>propulsion.</b> It is possible to [...] "orient" [...] the droplet sheet edge towards an external heat source but the sheet area would still be subject to radiation from other sources. Most of the presented solutions of the equation of radiative transfer are practical simplifications by introducing assumptions.|$|R
25|$|SpaceX's {{reusable}} launcher {{program was}} publicly announced in 2011 {{and the design}} phase was completed in February 2012. The system returns {{the first stage of}} a Falcon 9 rocket to its launchpad using only its <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|The Bell X-1 was {{depicted}} {{early in}} the film The Right Stuff. The film showed the historic flight of the X-1 becoming the first aircraft to break the sound barrier in level flight under its <b>own</b> <b>propulsion.</b> This achievement helped usher in the U.S. space program that {{was the subject of}} the rest of the film. A mock-up built for the film is now displayed at the Planes of Fame Museum, Chino, California.|$|E
25|$|When Rolls-Royce became involved, Ray Dorey, {{the manager}} of the company's Flight Centre at Hucknall {{airfield}} {{on the north side of}} Nottingham, had a Whittle engine installed in the rear of a Vickers Wellington bomber. The installation was done by Vickers at Weybridge. A flying test-bed enables testing to be done in flight without the aircraft depending on an untried engine for its <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> and safety. This was the first flying test-bed used to test a jet engine.|$|E
50|$|The Ascent stage {{contained}} the crew cabin with instrument panels and flight controls. It contained its <b>own</b> Ascent <b>Propulsion</b> System (APS) engine and two hypergolic propellant tanks for return to lunar orbit and rendezvous with the Apollo Command/Service Module. It also contained a Reaction Control System (RCS) for attitude and translation control, {{which consisted of}} sixteen hypergolic thrusters {{similar to those used}} on the Service Module, mounted in four quads, with their own propellant supply. A forward EVA hatch provided access to and from the lunar surface, while an overhead hatch and docking port provided access to and from the Command Module.|$|R
50|$|Some {{warships}} specialized for anti-submarine warfare use {{a specifically}} shaped bulb as a hydrodynamic housing for a sonar transducer, which resembles a bulbous bow but the hydrodynamic effects are only incidental. The transducer {{is a large}} cylinder or sphere composed of a phased array of acoustic transducers. The entire compartment is flooded with water and the acoustic window of the bulb is made of fiber-reinforced plastic or another material (such as rubber) transparent to underwater sounds as they are transmitted and received. The transducer bulb places the sonar equipment at the greatest possible distance from the ship's <b>own</b> noise-generating <b>propulsion</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Spheres {{stands for}} Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites. These {{satellites}} {{are about the}} size of a bowling ball and are in the experimental phase at Nasa. Each Sphere is self-contained with its <b>own</b> power, <b>propulsion,</b> computers, and navigation equipment. The Spheres are designed to be used inside a space station to test how well the spheres can follow a set of detailed flight instructions. While inside a space station three spheres will be given a set of instructions such as an autonomous rendezvous and docking maneuver. The results from the sphere testing will be applied to satellite servicing, vehicle assembly, and future space craft that will be designed to fly in a formation.|$|R
25|$|The Uzlovoy Module (UM), or Node Module is a 4-metric-ton ball-shaped module {{that will}} allow docking of two {{scientific}} and power modules during {{the final stage of}} the station assembly, and provide the Russian segment additional docking ports to receive Soyuz MS and Progress MS spacecraft. UM is due to be launched in late 2018. It will be integrated with a special version of the Progress cargo ship and launched by a standard Soyuz rocket. Progress would use its <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> and flight control system to deliver and dock the Node Module to the nadir (Earth-facing) docking port of the Nauka MLM/FGB-2 module. One port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port, which enables docking with the MLM module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, enabling docking of Soyuz and Progress vehicles, as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems. The node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of the future Russian successor to the ISS, OPSEK. Equipped with six docking ports, the Node Module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required. This would be a progression beyond the ISS and Russia's modular Mir space station, which are in turn more advanced than early monolithic first generation stations such as Skylab, and early Salyut and Almaz stations.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{completed}} high-speed rotorcraft {{design studies}} for NASA {{provide the basis}} to assess technology needs {{for the development of}} these aircraft. Preliminary analysis of several concepts possessing helicopter-like hover characteristics and cruise capabilities in the 450 knot regime, led to the selection of two concepts for further study. The concepts selected included the Rotor/Wing and the Tilt Wing. The two unique concepts use turbofan and turboshaft engines respectively. Designs, based on current technology for each, established a baseline configuration from which technology trade studies could be conducted. Propulsion technology goals from the IHPTET program established the advanced technolgy year. Due to high-speed requirements, each concept possesses its <b>own</b> unique <b>propulsion</b> challenges. Trade studies indicate that achieving th IHPTET Phase III goals significantly improves the effectiveness of both concepts. Increased engine efficiency is particularly important to VTOL aircraft by reducing gross weight...|$|R
50|$|The {{engineer}} of {{the line}} {{was intended to be}} John Rennie, but the project’s City financiers favoured Robert Stephenson, believing that they would also benefit from the knowledge and wisdom of his respected father George. Although, because of the Act, Robert Stephenson had to follow Rennie’s route and use the obscure track gauge of , he was free to choose his <b>own</b> method of <b>propulsion.</b> Drawing on his experience with the Camden Incline on the London and Birmingham Railway he decided upon cable haulage from stationary steam engines.|$|R
25|$|The cruise stage {{carried the}} MSL {{spacecraft}} through the void {{of space and}} delivered it to Mars. The interplanetary trip covered the distance of 352 million miles in 253 days. The cruise stage has its <b>own</b> miniature <b>propulsion</b> system, consisting of eight thrusters using hydrazine fuel in two titanium tanks. It also has its own electric power system, consisting of a solar array and battery for providing continuous power. Upon reaching Mars, the spacecraft stopped spinning and a cable cutter separated the cruise stage from the aeroshell. Then the cruise stage was diverted into a separate trajectory into the atmosphere. In December 2012, the debris field from the cruise stage was located by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Since the initial size, velocity, density and impact angle of the hardware are known, it will provide information on impact processes on the Mars surface and atmospheric properties.|$|R
50|$|Fireworks are {{generally}} classified {{as to where}} they perform, either as a ground or aerial firework. In the latter case they may provide their <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> (skyrocket) or be shot into the air by a mortar (aerial shell).|$|E

50|$|SES-9 had {{a mass of}} {{approximately}} 5271 kg at launch, the largest Falcon 9 payload yet to a highly-energetic geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). SES S.A. used the spacecraft's <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> capabilities to circularize the trajectory to a geostationary orbit.|$|E
40|$|Since photons have momentum, {{a useful}} force can be {{obtained}} by reflecting sunlight off of a large, low mass surface (most likely a very thin metal-coated plastic film) and robbing the light of some of its momentum. A solar sail Engineering Development Mission (EDM) is currently being planned by the World Space Foundation for the purpose of demonstrating and evaluating solar sailing technology and to gain experience in the design and operation of a spacecraft propelled by sunlight. The present plan is for the EDM spacecraft to be launched (sail stowed) in a spin-stabilized configuration into an initial elliptical orbit with an apogee of 36, 000 km and a perigee of a few hundred kilometers. The spacecraft will then use its <b>own</b> chemical <b>propulsion</b> system to raise the perigee to at least 1, 200 km. The deployed sail will have an area of 880 sq m and generate a solar force of about 0. 007 N...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept of}} an aero-assisted pre-stage is proposed, which enables launch of both {{ballistic}} and aero-assisted launch vehicles from conventional runways. The pre-stage can be implemented as a delta-wing with a suitable undercarriage, which is mated with the launch vehicle, so that their flight directions are coaligned. The ample wing area of the pre-stage combined with {{the thrust of the}} launch vehicle ensure prompt roll-out and take-off of the stack at airspeeds typical for a conventional jet airliner. The launch vehicle is separated from the pre-stage as soon as safe altitude is achieved, and the desired ascent trajectory is reached. Nominally, the pre-stage is non-powered. As an option, to save the propellant of the launch vehicle, the pre-stage may have its <b>own</b> short-burn <b>propulsion</b> system, whereas the propulsion system of the launch vehicle is activated at the separation point. A general non-dimensional analysis of performance of the pre-stage from roll-out to separation is carried out and applications to existing ballistic launch vehicle and hypothetical aero-assisted vehicles (spaceplanes) are considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{closed form}} {{solution}} is presented for the coplanar transfer between nearby circular orbits for spacecraft using their <b>own</b> blow down <b>propulsion</b> system. The decaying thrust is applied along the local horizontal and the linearized {{equation of motion}} in the orbital elements formulation are {{used to describe the}} transfer which consists of a thrust-coast-relight program. Sensitivity partials are also presented analytically in order to study the effect of maneuver execution errors and various other parameters affecting the blow down propulsion system characteristics on the transfer. This strategy is applied to study the transfer of the TOPEX spacecraft from the Shuttle parking orbit to its final operational orbit...|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{proposed}} TiME mission {{consider a}} lander that would splash {{down in a}} lake in Titan's northern hemisphere and float {{on the surface of}} the lake for few months.

50|$|The first {{development}} flight of GSLV Mk.I (GSLV-D1) was launched on 18 April 2001. The flight carrying GSAT-1 {{failed to reach}} the correct orbit. Attempts to save GSAT-1 by using its <b>own</b> <b>propulsion</b> system to maneuver it into the correct orbit were unsuccessful as it ran out of fuel several thousand kilometres below geosynchronous orbit.|$|E
50|$|The earlier Apollo {{system had}} various abort modes {{depending}} on altitude, velocity, and other circumstances. Likewise the Orion will have similar {{modes of operation}} for its launch performance aborts.

40|$|The Chandra X-Ray Observatory was {{launched}} {{early in the}} morning of 1999, July 23 by the Space Shuttle Columbia. The Shuttle launch was only the first step in placing NASA's latest great observatory into orbit. After release from the cargo bay, the Inertial Upper Stage performed two firings and separated from the observatory as planned. Finally, after five firings of Chandra's <b>own</b> Integral <b>Propulsion</b> System - the last of which took place 15 days after the initial launch - the observatory was placed in its highly elliptical orbit of 140, 000 km apogee and 10, 000 km perigee. After Observatory activation, the first x-rays focussed by the telescope were observed on 1999, August 12. Beginning with this initial observation one could conclude that the telescope had survived the launch environment and was operating as expected. The month following the opening of the sunshade door was spent adjusting the focus for each set of instrument configurations, determining the optical axis, calibrating the star camera, establishing the relative response functions, determining the energy scale(s), and performing a series of "publicity" images.
