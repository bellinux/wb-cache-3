Construction on the extension started in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Grove Church Cemetery {{is located}} at 1132 46th Street in North Bergen, New Jersey. The {{cemetery}} also fronts Kennedy Boulevard which in the 19thcentury was known as Dallytown Road, or Bergenwood Road. Overlooking into the Secaucus, it starts {{at the top and}} extends onto the middle of the western face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Palisades. Grove Church Cemetery is one of several burial sites on the western slope, along with Machpelah Cemetery, Hoboken Cemetery and Weehawken Cemetery, which is only a few blocks away from Grove Church along with Palisades Cemetery. These grounds constitute a string of green open spaces in North Hudson County. The gated entrance is across the street, east of the Bergenline Avenue station <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Bergen Light Rail in Union City, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|On July 12, the British ships Phoenix and Rose sailed up {{the harbor}} toward the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson.</b> The American {{batteries}} opened fire at Fort George, Red Hook, and Governors Island, and the British returned fire into the city. The ships sailed along the New Jersey shore and continued up the Hudson, sailing past Fort Washington and arriving by nightfall at Tarrytown, the widest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson.</b> The {{goals of the}} British ships were to cut off American supplies and to encourage Loyalist support. The only casualties of the day were six Americans who were killed when their own cannon blew up.|$|E
5|$|The Mayflower first {{anchored}} in {{what became the}} harbor of Provincetown, Massachusetts on November 11, 1620. The ship was headed for the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River near Manhattan, {{which was part of}} the Colony of Virginia at the time, but it eventually reached New England.|$|E

They {{attempted}} to sail south to the designated landing site at the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> but ran into trouble in the region of Pollack Rip, a shallow area of shoals between Cape Cod and Nantucket Island. With winter approaching and provisions running dangerously low, the passengers decided to return north to Cape Cod Bay and abandon their original landing plans.|$|E
5|$|Arnold's command at West Point {{also gave}} him {{authority}} over the entire American-controlled Hudson River, from Albany down to the British lines outside New York City. While en route to West Point, Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith, who had spied for both sides and who owned a house near the western bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> about 15 miles south of West Point.|$|E
5|$|Farther east, {{the road}} {{passes through the}} hamlets of Gardiner and Clintondale, and meets US9W in the hamlet of Highland. Just inside of Gardiner, the highway passes through Minnewaska State Park, a large state park in the Hudson Valley. US44 and NY55 join US9W for roughly a half-mile southward along the western bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River before {{separating}} at a trumpet interchange south of Highland. One mile east of US9W, US44 and NY55 cross the Hudson on the Mid-Hudson Bridge.|$|E
40|$|The sediments {{and water}} in <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River are {{contaminated}} with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from discharges originating from two General Electric Company (GE) capacitor manufacturing plants. <b>The</b> <b>Hudson</b> River PCBs Superfund Site extends nearly 200 river miles from <b>Hudson</b> Falls to <b>the</b> Battery in New York City. Many PCBs remain concentrated in hot spots in <b>the</b> sediments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper <b>Hudson</b> River portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site, an approximately 40 -mile reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river from <b>Hudson</b> Falls to Troy that traverses Washington, Saratoga, Albany, and Rensselaer Counties. The selected remedy involves sediment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper <b>Hudson</b> River and this portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river is <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> this assessment. Both federal and state freshwater wetlands exist throughout <b>the</b> Upper <b>Hudson</b> region. Areas adjacent to <b>the</b> Upper <b>Hudson</b> River include forested shoreline wetlands, transitional uplands, and vegetated backwaters (emergent marsh and scrub-shrub wetlands). The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) maps and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) freshwater wetlands maps delimit the wetlands along <b>the</b> Upper <b>Hudson</b> River.

5|$|Further north {{along the}} Continental Divide, a short portion of the {{combined}} Continental and Laurentian divides separate the Columbia watershed from the MacKenzie-Slave-Athabasca watershed, which empties into the Arctic Ocean. The Nelson and Mackenzie watersheds are separated by a divide between streams flowing to the Arctic Ocean and those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Bay watershed. This divide meets the Continental Divide at Snow Dome (also known as Dome), near the northernmost bend of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route {{through the town}} of Cairo. It comes close to the hamlet of Cairo, but {{bypasses}} it on a four-lane divided highway that takes it around the northern fringe of the community. As it runs around Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the route was {{truncated}} to consist {{only of the}} portion east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> River. NY43's former routing west to Schoharie was redesignated NY443 as a result. NY43 was realigned slightly in the late 1990s to serve the new exit8 on I-90. Its former routing into Rensselaer on 3rd Avenue is now partly NY151 and unsigned NY915E.|$|E
5|$|NY32 {{begins at}} NY17 on the {{outskirts}} of the New York metropolitan area in Woodbury just outside Harriman, and ends at NY196 east of Hudson Falls just south of the Adirondacks. In between, the road passes through the cities of Newburgh, Kingston, Albany, Cohoes, and Glens Falls. Outside of the cities, it offers views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> Highlands, Shawangunk Ridge, Catskill Mountains, and, during an overlap with US4 north of Albany, the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|On the Rensselaer side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hudson</b> is the Albany Yacht Club.
