40|$|This paper {{presents}} a leg reconfigurable technique {{to optimize the}} multi-legged robot operation and walking performances. A hexapod-to-quadruped (Hexa-Quad) transformation technique is proposed to optimize hexapod legs on certain situation that need some legs to be disabled as a leg to do other tasks/operations. By separating two legs from the others, hexapod robot is able to be configured as quadruped robot configuration. Quadruped robot configuration is stand within dynamically and statically stable criteria if compare to the hexapod robot that has only statically stable criteria. Thus, it is very crucial to have a stable transformation technique during walking and <b>operation</b> <b>session.</b> Therefore Hexa-Quad is proposed {{with reference to the}} defined support polygon that based on its body area.

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, active {{seismology}} studies in Russia have made use of powerful (40 - and 100 -ton) low-frequency vibrators. These sources create a force amplitude of up to 100 tons and function in the 1. 5 - 3, 3 - 6 and 5 - 10 Hz frequency bands. The mobile versions of the vibrator have a force amplitude of 40 tons and a 6 - 12 Hz frequency band. Registration distances for the 100 ton vibrator are as large as 350 km, enabling the refracted waves to penetrate down to 50 km depths. Vibrator <b>operation</b> <b>sessions</b> are highly repeatable, having distinct "summer" or "winter" spectral patterns. A long profile of seismic records allows estimating of fault zone depths using changes in recorded spectra.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a combination of}} transverse and trot walking pattern technique for hexa-quad robot after transformation to optimize the multi-legged robot operation and walking performances. Due to the limitation on the stability of hexapod robot, the combination of hexa-quad walking sequence is proposed to stabilize the quadruped configuration and walking modes. Quadruped robot configuration is stand within dynamically and statically stable criteria if compare to the hexapod robot that has only statically stable criteria.

Respirable particulate (RP) fraction can be defined as the fraction of inhaled airborne particles that can penetrate beyond the terminal bronchioles into the gas-exchange region of the lungs (WHO, 2006). As a preliminary study, this research conducted the monitoring of RP at two selected area which are production line and packaging line. A personnel monitoring was applied to calculate the Time Weighted Average (TWA) of RP among workers. An area monitoring was also used to measure the concentration of RP in ambient air. The personnel monitoring depicts most of the workers were exposed to the higher TWA. The recorded TWAs are not complied to Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) standard, respectively. The area monitoring indicates that the concentrations of RP are higher during noon <b>operation</b> <b>session.</b> It concludes that the workers may have respiratory impairment due to the exposure of excessive RP. The environmental physical parameters indicate that the temperature is higher and the relative humidity and air velocity are slightly lower at production station. This study {{can be used as a}} platform for proposing some preventive measures to control the excessive RP in paper based industry. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Treatment of {{hydrocephalus}} in posterior fossa {{tumors in}} children {{is still a}} matter of controversy and different centers have their own routines. In this regard, hospital records of all children with posterior fossa tumors treated in our center during the interval of 1985 - 1995 were reviewed. Patients ’ demographic and diagnostic data were analyzed and the frequencies of shunting procedures were determined. Fisher exact test was employed to compare the frequency of postoperative complications in different groups. A total of 108 patients with age ranging from 3 months to 18 years and a male to female ratio of 1. 5 comprised the study population. Ninety-nine cases had hydrocephalus {{at the time of}} diagnosis and 81 patients underwent preoperative shunting. Of the remaining 18 patients, 13 underwent external ventricular drainage at tumor <b>operation</b> <b>session</b> plus preoperative corticosteroid therapy. The rest of the patients got no primary treatment for hydrocephalus. Three of these 5 patients had postoperative shunting after tumor removal, but the other 2 remained shunt free. The rate of postoperative complications including cerebrospinal fluid leakage and septic meningitis were significantly lower in patients with preoperative shunting. The results of this study are in favor of those that approve the effect of preoperative shunting in decreasing postoperative complications. This is well established when the tumor size is big or when the diagnosis of posterior fossa tumor is made in later stages or when hydrocephalus is severe. It could be concluded that preoperative shunting can decrease the rate of postoperative complications...|$|E

40|$|PREFACE The Twentieth Workshop on Geothermal Reservoir Engineering, {{dedicated}} {{to the memory of}} Professor Hank Ramey, was held at Stanford University on January 24 - 26, 1995. There were ninety-five registered participants. Participants came from six foreign countries: Japan, Mexico, England, Italy, New Zealand and Iceland. The performance of many geothermal reservoirs outside the United States was described in several of the papers. Professor Roland N. Horne opened the meeting and welcomed visitors to the campus. The key note speaker was Marshall Reed, who gave a brief overview of the Department of Energy's current plan. Thirty-two papers were presented in the technical sessions of the workshop. Technical papers were organized into eleven sessions concerning: field development, modeling, well tesubore, injection, geoscience, geochemistry and field <b>operations.</b> <b>Session</b> chairmen were major contributors to the workshop, and we thank: Ben Barker, Bob Fournier, Mark Walters, John Counsil, Marcelo Lippmann, Keshav Goyal, Joel Renner and Mike Shook. In addition to the technical sessions, a panel discussion was held on ''What have we learned in 20 years?'' Panel speakers included Patrick Muffler, George Frye, Alfred Truesdell and John Pritchett. The subject was further discussed by Subir Sanyal, who gave the post-dinner speech at the banquet. The Workshop was organized by the Stanford Geothermal Program faculty, staff, and graduate students.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{acoustical}} and electromagnetic (EM) noise sources on the electrophysiological recordings related to brain functions have been investigated. As a seperate issue, {{the effect of}} EM noise during operation which influence the patient, anesthesia and surgery teams was also targeted. The results indicate (16 <b>operation</b> <b>sessions)</b> the presence of between 49. 85 - 79. 94 dB, (mean 63. 10 ± 5. 37) ongoing acoustical noise throughout the surgery. Among the different EM noises sources, electrocautery {{was found to be}} the highest one that effected the electrophysiological recording (248. 0 mGauss). During the operation of this device, the EM effect resulted in some 400 times larger amplitude scale magnitude than the normal range, contaminating the recordings. Vacuum pumps (52. 0 mGauss), surgical lamps (0. 1 mGauss), monitors (1. 0 mGauss) each displayed a different degree of EM noise. The vacuum pump and the movement related artefacts caused large scale slow oscillations. The abovementioned noise sources have been investigated in relation to electrophysiological quality as well as operation room health conditions. By means of assuring a certain quality for the performance of these very sensitive EEG like devices (BIS etc.), {{it would be possible to}} assess the functioning of the nervous system through high resolution data recordings. The overall results can serve to highlight the brain functioning and to establish a platform as research model to clinical studies...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} a single-center experience with endovascular treatment of cranial dural arterievenous fistulae (CDAVF). The clinical and radiological records of 170 consecutive patients harboring a CDAVF and treated endovascularly in a 16 -year period were reviewed. A variety of data related to demographics, features of the lesion, treatment, outcome, and follow-up were analyzed with emphasis to the results and complications. Half of the lesions had cortical venous drainage (CVD) in the initial angiographic investigation, whereas 26  % had exclusively CVD. Sixty-seven percent of our patients presented with benign symptoms and 33  % with aggressive symptoms. In 60. 5  % of the patients with benign lesion (without CVD), an anatomic cure in the immediate postinterventional angiogram without complication or permanent morbidity was achieved, whereas 69  % of the patients with aggressive lesions (with CVD) had an anatomic cure in the postinterventional final angiogram with all permanent-morbidity cases belonging to this group. The average of endovascular <b>operation</b> <b>sessions</b> per patient was 1. 2. In a mean follow-up period of 2. 8  years, the overall complete occlusion rate was 85. 5  % (78  % for the benign group and 89. 5  % for the aggressive group) and clinical cure and/or improvement rate of 93  %. The operative mortality was zero, and permanent neurologic morbidity was 2. 3  %. In 73  % of our cases, N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) {{was used as the}} only or main embolic material. Endovascular embolization is the treatment of choice for CDAVF. High rates of good anatomical and clinical results, associated with very low operative complication rate can be achieved with few embolization sessions.

40|$|Abstract — Supporting user {{interactivity}} in peer-to-peer streaming {{systems is}} challenging. VCR-like operations, such as random seek, pause, fast forward and rewind, require timely P 2 P overlay topology adjustment and appropriate bandwidth resource re-allocation. If not handled properly, the dynamics caused by user interactivity may severely deteriorate users’ perceived video quality, e. g., longer start-up delay, frequent playback freezing, or blackout altogether. In this paper, we propose a derivative tree-based overlay management scheme to support user interactivity in P 2 P streaming system. Derivative tree {{takes advantage of}} well organized buffer overlapping to support asynchronous user requests while brings high resilience {{to the impact of}} VCR-like <b>operations.</b> A <b>session</b> discovery service is introduced to quickly locate parent peer.

40|$|A multiparty session forms {{a unit of}} {{structured}} {{interactions among}} many participants which follow a prescribed scenario specified as a global type signature. When a distributed protocol is engaged in two or more specifications simultaneously, each session following a distinct global type can be interleaved and can interfere at runtime (through the channel delegation <b>operation).</b> High-level <b>session</b> processes equipped with global signatures can be easily translated into low-level processes extracting the local communication details from the global specifications. Previous work on multiparty session types has ignored session interaction, providing only a limited progress property ensured only within a single session, by assuming non-interference among different sessions and by forbidding delegation. This paper develops, besides a more traditional, compositional communication type system, a novel static interaction type system for global progress in dynamically merged and interfered multiparty sessions. This avoids a global linearity-check without sacrificing the original expressivity. The interaction type system infers causalities of channels for the low level processes, ensuring the entire protocol, starting from the high-level processes which consist of multiple sessions, does not get stuck at intermediate sessions also in presence of delegation...|$|R
