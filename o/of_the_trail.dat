5|$|On October 7, 1923, {{the first}} section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> from Bear Mountain west through Harriman State Park to Arden, New York, was opened.

5|$|On {{the other}} side of the notch, the Wildcat Range is a popular objective. The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail; the first two miles are {{extremely}} difficult, and require skill on short, yet exposed, rock scrambles.

5|$|Prior to the American Revolution, {{the path}} of modern NY21 north of Canandaigua {{was part of an}} old Native American trail {{connecting}} Seneca Lake to Lake Ontario by way of Canandaigua Lake. The trail began in the vicinity of Geneva and went west to Canandaigua on a path now occupied by US20 and NY5. It continued north from Canandaigua, passing through the village of Palmyra and the hamlet of Marion before reaching the Lake Ontario shoreline at Pultneyville. Construction to convert the Canandaigua–Marion section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> into a road was completed in 1794. The remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> north to Pultneyville was converted into a road approximately three years later.|$|E

[...] While <b>the</b> official number <b>of</b> <b>trails</b> is stated as 10, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> are actually dirt roads for park ranger vehicles. Also, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "trails" [...] require the hiker to walk a segment on a paved Commonwealth road or county road. Trails are generally quite wide, but being a forest in mountains with high humidity and rain precipitation, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> are muddy in at least some areas. Hikers are often seen with walking sticks, which help maintain balance when walking on slippery surfaces, particularly the algae-covered ground rocks present on some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b> Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> lead to or run near charcos. Charcos are natural swimming pools (swimming holes). [...] The Toro Negro State Forest office is the starting point for several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b> However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> are not well marked, nor are they well kept, so they can be hard to locate and to follow in the dense forest.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trails</b> are {{designed}} to cover many different landscapes, including farmland, urban areas, and forests. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> follow railroads. Some of these trails are paved over abandoned railways, while others follow alongside active railroads. Because <b>of</b> road obstacles, <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> themselves sometimes cut off before large cities and highways, and signs are placed throughout the open cities or areas, leading the followers to <b>the</b> next segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails,</b> which, in some cases, can be slightly hazardous.|$|R
5|$|Purchasing {{the section}} allowed Gardiner {{to fix the}} {{drainage}} problems that had deteriorated the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> and to ban the use of motor vehicles, something the Wallkill Valley Land Trust had not done. Though the section was worth $307,300, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust sold it to Gardiner for $70,000.|$|E
5|$|The highway runs mostly {{parallel}} to the Mundaring to Kalgoorlie water pipeline, which supplies the Goldfields with water from Mundaring Weir {{in the eastern part}} of Perth.

Due to increasing PAVN anti-aircraft artillery defences encountered in southeastern Laos, delivery in high-risk areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> system was handed over from the Neptunes to Air Force F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers that had been specially equipped for the missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{various types}} of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express {{included}} Morgans and thoroughbreds which were often used on the eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Mustangs were often used on the western (more rugged) end of the mail route.|$|E
5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition.|$|E

The landscape in this area is dominated by forest land as the trunkline crosses the Hart-Montague Trail State Park, a linear state park that follows a bike trail in the area. North <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> crossing, US31 has a business spur for Hart that runs east into that town; north of this interchange, the freeway crosses the Pentwater River near the community of Pentwater which also has its own business loop.|$|E
5|$|Canopy Development, a green {{development}} company from Northampton, Massachusetts, owns {{a portion of}} the former rail bed in Rosendale. It has agreed to establish a right-of-way, rerouting the trail to allow public access. Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be bypassed. The Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a $20,000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> by Kingston. By the end of summer 2013, the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale-Kingston extension was opened to the public, completing the entire 23.7 mile rail trail.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay {{fiber optic cable}} paid the town {{to pass through the}} former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While the trail originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 U.S. {{intelligence}} analysts estimated that 5,843 enemy infiltrators (actually 4,000) had moved {{south on the}} trail; in 1962, 12,675 (actually 5,300); in 1963, 7,693 (actually 4,700); and in 1964, 12,424. The supply capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> reached 20 to 30 tonnes per day in 1964 and it was estimated by the U.S. that 12,000 (actually 9,000) North Vietnamese regulars had reached South Vietnam that year.
