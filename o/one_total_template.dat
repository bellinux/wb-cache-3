40|$|A {{theory of}} evidential {{probability}} is developed from two assumptions: (1) the evidential {{probability of a}} proposition is its probability conditional on the <b>total</b> evidence; (2) <b>one's</b> <b>total</b> evidence is <b>one's</b> <b>total</b> knowledge. Evidential probability is distinguished from both subjective and objective probability. Loss as well as gain of evidence is permitted. Evidential probability is embedded within epistemic logic by means of possible worlds semantics for modal logic; this allows a natural theory of higher-order probability to be developed. In particular, it is emphasized that it is sometimes uncertain which propositions are part of <b>one's</b> <b>total</b> evidence; some surprising implications of this fact are drawn out. 1 Evidential probabilit...|$|R

40|$|Metallic copper {{nanowires}} {{have been}} grown into the pores of alumina membranes by electrodeposition from an aqueous solution containing CuSO 4. and H 3 BO 3 at pH 3. In order {{to study the}} influence of the electrical parameters on growth and structure of nanowires, different deposition potentials (both in the region where hydrogen evolution reaction is allowed or not) and voltage perturbation modes (constant potential or unipolar pulsed depositions) were applied. In all cases, pure polycrystalline Cu nanowires were fabricated into template pores, having lengths increasing with the total deposition time. These nanowires were self-standing, because they retain their vertical orientation and parallel geometry even after <b>total</b> <b>template</b> dissolution. However, the electrical parameters influence the growth rate, length uniformity and crystal size of the nanowires. Continuous electrodeposition resulted in higher growth rates but less uniform lengths of nanowires grown inside different membrane pores, whilst a square pulse deposition produced a slower growth but quite uniform lengths. Also the grain size, of the order of 50 nm, was slightly influenced by the potential perturbation mode...|$|R
40|$|Both polysomes and polysomal RNA, {{isolated}} from cotyledons of ripening pea (Pisum sativum) seeds and supplemented respectively with wheat germ S- 100 and S- 30 fractions, {{were used to}} program the cell-free synthesis of polypeptides. The relationship of these polypeptide products to seed storage proteins has been investigated. When fractionated on sucrose density gradients the translation products did not coincide with native storage proteins, nor were they exactly coincident with the subunits of storage proteins on dissociating gels. Treatment with antiserum prepared against storage proteins precipitated {{only a very small}} proportion of these products. Nonetheless, tryptic peptide mapping showed that a significant proportion (up to 65 %) of the in vitro products from cell-free systems were related to the storage proteins. Alternative interpretations of these results are that either the translatable mRNAs for storage proteins make up a small proportion of the <b>total</b> <b>template</b> {{isolated from}} pea cotyledon polysomes, or that storage protein polypeptides are made in significant amounts in vitro but lack major antigenic determinants which in vivo may be acquired during chain completion or post-translational modification...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the finite satisfiability problem for two-variable logic over {{structures}} with <b>one</b> <b>total</b> preorder relation, its induced successor relation, one linear order relation and some further unary relations is EXPSPACE-complete. Actually, EXPSPACE-completeness already holds for structures that {{do not include the}} induced successor relation. As a special case, the EXPSPACE upper bound applies to two-variable logic over structures with two linear orders. A further consequence is that satisfiability of two-variable logic over data words with a linear order on positions and a linear order and successor relation on the data is decidable in EXPSPACE. As a complementing result, it is shown that over structures with two total preorder relations as well as over structures with <b>one</b> <b>total</b> preorder and two linear order relations, the finite satisfiability problem for two-variable logic is undecidable...|$|R
40|$|The finite satisfiability {{problem for}} two-variable logic over {{structures}} with unary relations and two order relations is investigated. Firstly, de-cidability is shown for structures with <b>one</b> <b>total</b> preorder relation and one linear order relation. More specifically, {{we show that}} this problem is com-plete for EXPSPACE. As a consequence, the same upper bound applies {{to the case of}} two linear orders. Secondly, we prove undecidability for structures with two total preorder relations as well as for structures with <b>one</b> <b>total</b> preorder and two linear order relations. Further, we point out connections to other logics. Decidability is shown for two-variable logic on data words with orders on both positions and data values, but with-out a successor relation. We also study “partial models ” of compass and interval temporal logic and prove decidability for some of their fragments. ...|$|R
