40|$|The {{rates and}} amounts of <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> by samples of {{powdered}} zir-conium dioxide have been measured {{as a function}} of temperature (400 ~ 900 ~ oxygen pressure (10 - 5 to 760 mm Hg), and particle size. Many ex-periments, performed to correlate <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> with the mass of oxide and with the oxide surface, indicate that <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> is pr imari ly a surface phenomenon. After complete reduction of the ZrO 2 adsorbed surface oxygen, approximately one atomic monolayer of oxygen will adsorb irreversibly, and about 5 % of the total adsorbed oxygen can be reversibly adsorbed and de-sorbed as molecules. The apparent activation energy for the adsorption of molecular oxygen is about 35 kcal /mole and for desorption about 53 kcal/mole, as compared to about 58 kcal /mole for adsorption of atomic oxygen. From theoretical calculations it was concluded that electron transfer must occur (e. g., oxygen adsorbs as O 2 -), and this molecular oxygen anion adsorbs as a mobile layer, The mechanism of the interact ion of a gas with a solid surface is important o the unders tand ing of the oxidation of metals and many catalyt ic proc-esses. A study of the reaction of oxygen with zir-conium dioxide powder was in i t iated in the hopes of discovering something about the reactions at the gas-oxide interface dur ing the oxidat ion of z ir-conium. Of part icu lar interest is the oxygen species (O, O-, O =, 02, O 2 -, or O 2 =) that adsorbs on the surface. The effect of oxygen adsorption on the electrical properties of semiconductors (1) suggests that electron transfer occurs and that oxygen is adsorbed as a negat ive ion. Judging from the elec-tronegativ it ies of the above species in the gas phase, the most probable adsorbed oxygen species would be O- and 02 -. It is shown in this paper that elec-tron transfer probably does occur and that oxygen molecules are adsorbed as 02 -. Part I is concerned with the pr imary adsorption of molecular oxygen on z i rconium dioxide and the thermodynamic and kinetic evidence re lat ing ad-sorption to the semiconduct ing propert ies of the oxide. Part II wil l t reat the secondary adsorption of atomic oxygen which is fed by the pr imary ad-sorption...|$|E
40|$|A reoxidation {{inclusion}} {{model is}} described that simulates the entire {{life cycle of}} inclusions during the filling of steel castings and predicts their final location in the casting. Inclusions can be released into the mold at the inlet and/or nucleate on the metal free surface, where contact with oxygen from the atmosphere creates them. Inclusion motion is calculated by solving an equation of motion for each inclusion at each time step. The growth of reoxidation inclusions is modeled both by oxide growth due to <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> at the liquid metal free surface {{as well as by}} inclusion agglomeration (combination) when inclusions come close enough together to merge. All of these pieces of the inclusion model have been implemented in commercial casting simulation software, and an application is provided to qualitatively compare the simulation results to experimental results. Also, a series of simulations are performed to examine the effect of various parameters specified in the model...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{was added}} at 820 and 990 C at an oxygen {{pressure}} of about. 0003 torr. The technique permitted predetermined and reproducible oxygen doping of the tantalum alloy (T- 111). Based on the temperature dependency of the doping reaction, {{it was concluded}} that the initial rates of <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> are probably controlled by solution of oxygen into the T- 111 lattice. Although hafnium oxides are more stable than those of tantalum or tungsten, analyses of extracted residues indicate that the tantalum and tungsten oxides predominate in the as-doped specimens, presumably because of the higher concentrations of tantalum and tungsten in the alloy. However, high-temperature annealing promotes gettering of dissolved oxygen and oxygen from other oxides to form hafnium oxides. Small amounts of tantalum and tungsten oxides were still present after high temperature annealing. Tungsten oxide (WO 3) volatilizes slightly from the surface of T- 111 at 990 C but not at 820 C. The vaporization of WO 3 has no apparent effect on the doping reaction...|$|E

40|$|The caging {{effect of}} the host {{environment}} on photochemical reactions of molecular oxygen is investigated using monochromatic synchrotron radiation and spectrally resolved fluorescence. Oxygen doped clusters are formed by coexpansion of argon and <b>oxygen,</b> by <b>pickup</b> of molecular <b>oxygen</b> or by multiple pickup of argon and oxygen by neon clusters. Sequential pickup provides radially ordered core-shell structures in which a central oxygen molecule is surrounded by argon layers of variable thickness inside large neon clusters. Pure argon and core-shell argon-neon clusters excited with ~ 12 eV monochromatic synchrotron radiation show strong fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet (vuv) spectral range. When the clusters are doped with O 2, fluorescence in the visible (vis) spectral range is observed and the vuv radiation {{is found to be}} quenched. Energy-resolved vis fluorescence spectra show the 2 ¹Σ+→ 1 ¹Σ+(ArO(¹S) →ArO(¹D)) transition from argon oxide as well as the vibrational progression Α'³Δu(ν'= 0) →X³Σ-g(ν'') of O 2 indicating that molecular oxygen dissociates and occasionally recombines depending on the experimental conditions. Both the emission from ArO and O 2 as well the vuv quenching by oxygen are found to depend on the excitation energy, providing evidence that the energy transfer from the photoexcited cluster to the embedded oxygen proceeds via the O+ 2 ground state. The O+ 2 decays via dissociative recombination and either reacts with Ar resulting in electronically excited ArO or it recombines to O 2 within the Ar cage. Variation of the Ar layer thickness in O 2 –Ar–Ne core-shell clusters shows that a stable cage is formed by two solvation layers...|$|R
40|$|Powder compact {{extrusion}} (PCE) is {{an innovative}} way of processing titanium and titanium alloys to produce good-quality material {{with a wide}} range of compositions, microstructures and mechanical properties. This paper explores PCE processing of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy prepared from a blended powder mixture, containing elemental hydride-dehydride (HDH) titanium powder and master alloy (60 Al- 40 V) powder. The warm pressed compacts of blended powders were sintered using a vacuum sintering furnace prior to β extrusion. The resulting material was used to measure the performance under high strain rate and tri-axial stress state using Charpy v-notch testing. A comparison was made of the microstructure after vacuum sintering and hot extrusion in addition to oxygen measurements to determine the degree of <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> during each processing stage. A comprehensive study of fracture surfaces in selected samples was carried out using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Based on the results, it is clear that certain samples picked up varying amounts of interstitial impurities during processing and as a consequence a significant number of micro-cracks were observed in lamellar type microstructures. The oxygen content of all as-extruded samples was between 0. 34 - 0. 44 wt. % with resultant impact toughness in the range of 10 - 14 J. The best impact toughness attained for the lowest oxygen as-extruded rods was 20 % lower than the literature values for wrought material. In terms of fracture behaviour, ductile dimples, cleavage facets and cracks passing through lamellar structures were observed in all samples. However, the quantity of these fracture features varied significantly in each sample...|$|E
40|$|On the dayside of Venus, the hot oxygen corona {{extending}} {{above the}} ionopause {{is the principal}} source of pickup oxygen ions. The ions are born here and {{picked up by the}} ionosheath plasma as it is deflected around the planet. These pickup ions have been observed by the Orbiter Plasma Analyzer (OPA) throughout the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) mission. They were observed over a region extending from their dayside source to great distances downstream (about 10 Venus radii), in the solar wind wake, as PVO passed through apoapsis. Finite gyroradius effects in the velocity distribution of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> ions are expected in the source region because the gyroradius is several times larger than the scale height of the hot oxygen source. Such effects are also expected in those regions of the ionosheath where the scale lengths of the magnetic field and the ambient plasma velocity field are less than the pickup ion gyroradius. While explicitly accounting for the spatial distribution of the hot oxygen source, an analytic expression for the pickup oxygen ion velocity distribution is developed to study how it is affected by finite gyroradii. The analysis demonstrates that as the gyroradius increases by factors of three to six above the hot oxygen scale height, the peak of the pickup oxygen ion flux distribution decreases 25 to 50 % below the maximum allowed speed, which is twice the speed of the ambient plasma times the sine of the angle between the magnetic field and the flow velocity. The pickup oxygen ion flux distribution observed by OPA is shown to follow this behavior in the source region. It is also shown that this result is consistent with the pickup ion distributions observed in the wake, downstream of the source, where the flux peaks are usually well below the maximum allowed speed...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the subsystems of a novel mediated oxycombustion system and determine the expected final conditions of the integrated subsystems. The subsystems included a cerium based oxygen transport membrane, transport membrane coatings {{to assist in the}} pickup and release of oxygen, and a molten intermediary oxygen carrier. Various doping levels of yttrium and zirconium were investigated, both as singular dopants and in a co-doped scheme. Regression analysis was performed to quantitatively evaluate how each dopant affected the material properties. Zirconium was not found to have statistically significant effects, although an effect was clearly noted on pure ceria. Functions of the doping level of yttrium were found for relative density, hardness, and the contributing factors of electrical conductivity. Chemical looping combustion experiments were performed to determine viable candidates for <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> and release coatings. It was discovered that a release coating was not necessary due to the use of a reactive fluid, and iron showed promise as a pickup coating but short of showing statistical significance. The ability of antimony oxide to react with hydrocarbon fuels and be regenerated by oxygen was investigated to determine the reaction rates. It was discovered that a co-doping scheme of yttrium and zirconium at a level of 8. 33 % (1 / 12 th) each achieved the highest oxygen flux with a value of 3. 671 x 10 - 7 mol O/s/cm 2. All of the subsystems were we analyzed and a complete, theoretical system was described. It is recommended that the shape of the oxygen transport membrane be of a single-closed-end cylinder. This allows the increase of oxygen permeation with a smaller device footprint. It was found that the system would be capable of combusting 6. 699 grams of carbon based fuel per minute per square meter of footprint. This equates to a heat rate of 3. 6 kilowatts per square meter when utilizing a medium volatile bituminous coal. This value will continue to be improved as further research is conducted into the components of the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the formation and evolution of non-metallic inclusions during ingot casting. Emphasize have been on understanding the types of inclusions formed and developed through the casting process and {{on the development of}} already existing inclusions carried over from the ladle during casting. Industrial experiments carried on at Uddeholm Tooling together with laboratory work and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Ingots of 5. 8 tons have been sampled and the types of inclusions together with their distribution within the ingot have been characterized. Two new types of inclusions have been found. Type C 1 is found originated from casting powder and in the size from a few μm to 30 μm. Type C 2 is of macro inclusion type sizing up to 70 μm. The presence of C 2 inclusions are few but very detrimental for the quality of the steel. Both types, C 1 and C 2 consist of alumina, indicating that reoxidation is the main reason for their existence. The protecting argon shroud has been studied by the use of a 1 : 1 scaled 2 D model. Both flow pattern and oxygen measurement have been carried out. CFD has also been used as an auxiliary tool. It has been found that the <b>oxygen</b> <b>pickup</b> through argon gas shroud depends mostly on the distance between the ladle and the collar placed on top of runner. Further increase of gas flow rate above 2. 5 m 3. h- 1 had very little effect on the oxygen distribution since both the flushing effect and the entraining effect with respect to oxygen are enhanced by further increase of inert gas flow rate. In the case of dual gas inlet, the flow in the shroud was found much less diffused compared with either vertical or horizontal injection system. The oxygen content in this arrangement was also greatly reduced. Studies of the runner after casting revealed a sparse non-metallic network structure around the periphery of the steel rod remained in the runner. The surface of the refractory had been severely attacked by the mechanical force from the streaming steel. The erosions of the centre stone and the end stone were on the other hand negligible. CFD calculations showed that the flow at those locations is almost stagnant. The surface of the refractory in contact with the steel was found to have an increased content of alumina. The source for the alumina could come from either exchange reaction of dissolved aluminium replaces the silica or reoxidation products origin from oxygen pick up during the transfer from the ladle to the vertical runner. Inclusions were also found entrapped in the steel refractory interface. It was also found that a formation of a liquid slag film as early as possible during casting would increase the possibility to remove inclusions and especially inclusions generated by the casting powder.
