5000|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>casting,</b> {{also known}} as <b>sand</b> molded <b>casting,</b> is a metal casting process {{characterized}} by using sand as the mold material. The term [...] "sand casting" [...] can also refer to an object produced via the <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> process. <b>Sand</b> castings are produced in specialized factories called foundries. Over 70% of all metal castings are produced via <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> process.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss {{research}} into bronze casting techniques as practiced during the XIXth and early XXth century. Both natural <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> (fonte au sable naturel) and {{lost wax casting}} (fonte à la cire perdue) were employed during this period and sometimes rivalled for commissions. Before the XIXth century {{the vast majority of}} sculpures were cast by the lost wax casting method. Innovations in <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> around 1800 changed this situation. The next decades would see a gradual shift away from lost wax <b>casting</b> towards <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> and by the second quarter of the XIXth century <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> becomes the preferred casting method for the founding of sculture in France, Germany and Britain. This process of <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> was highly skilled and used piece moulds made from compacted natural clayey sand. Eventually innovations in lost wax casting {{during the first half of}} the XXth century shifted the balance from <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> to lost wax <b>casting</b> and natural <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> was gradually replaced between the 1950 s and 1970 s...|$|R
50|$|Patterns {{continue}} to be needed for <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> of metals. For the production of gray iron, ductile iron and steel castings, <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> remains {{the most widely used}} process. For aluminum castings, <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> represents about 12% of the total tonnage by weight (surpassed only by die casting at 57%, and semi-permanent and permanent mold at 19%; based on 2006 shipments). The exact process and pattern equipment is always determined by the order quantities and the <b>casting</b> design. <b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> can produce as little as one part, or as many as a million copies.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{simplest}} types of casting, and has been used for centuries. <b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> allows for smaller batches than permanent mold casting and at a very reasonable cost. Not only does this method allow manufacturers to create products at a low cost, but there are other benefits to <b>sand</b> <b>casting,</b> such as very small-size operations. The process allows for castings small enough fit in the palm of one's hand to those large enough only for train beds (one casting can create the entire bed for one rail car). <b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> also allows most metals to be cast depending on the type of sand used for the molds.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the {{sculpture}} (16 feet 8½ inches) the lost-wax casting method was not used. Instead, the statue was divided into ten sections. A mold {{for each of these}} segments was produced using the <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> method (<b>sand</b> mixed with epoxy forms to the outer shape of the statue and then hardens creating the mold). Graphite was dusted over the foam to prevent it from adhering to the <b>sand</b> <b>cast.</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>casting</b> requires less welding and repairing {{at the end of the}} process.|$|R
25|$|Full-mold casting is an evaporative-pattern {{casting process}} {{which is a}} {{combination}} of <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> and lost-foam casting. It uses an expanded polystyrene foam pattern which is then surrounded by sand, much like <b>sand</b> <b>casting.</b> The metal is then poured directly into the mold, which vaporizes the foam upon contact.|$|R

5000|$|Shell molding {{is similar}} to <b>sand</b> <b>casting,</b> but the molding cavity is formed by a {{hardened}} [...] "shell" [...] of sand instead of a flask filled with sand. The sand used is finer than <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> <b>sand</b> and is mixed with a resin {{so that it can}} be heated by the pattern and hardened into a shell around the pattern. Because of the resin and finer sand, it gives a much finer surface finish. The process is easily automated and more precise than <b>sand</b> <b>casting.</b> Common metals that are cast include cast iron, aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. This process is ideal for complex items that are small to medium-sized.|$|R

50|$|The {{inside of}} each <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> mold was layered with {{plasticine}} (¼ inch thick). The application of graphite to the <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> and the plasticine prevented the materials from bonding. A second <b>sand</b> <b>cast</b> was {{made over the}} plasticine. This process created a void, which would be filled with melted bronze. To avoid the formation of air pockets air vents were installed before pouring the bronze. The bronze sections were welded together and sandblasted (using a wire brush) to clean the sculpture and produce a uniform texture. Lastly, the bronze was coated with a patina {{to protect it from}} the elements of the outdoors.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{aluminium}} blank green <b>sand</b> (green) <b>casting</b> {{process was}} optimized by using Taguchi's robust design approach. An {{attempt was made}} to obtain optimal settings of two groups of aluminium blank <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> processes. Single aluminium blank <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> and double aluminium blanks <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> for process robustness comparison. The casting process involves a number of parameters affecting various casting quality features of the product. In order to optimize the process seven control factors viz., grain size, clay content, moisture content, ramming, sprue size, riser size, and diameter to thickness (D/t) ratio of the blank were selected. Each factor was considered at three levels. For this study three uncontrollable (or noise) factors viz. metal flow rate, pouring temperature and humidity were identified. To capture the effect of noise factors casting yield, surface defects, and casting density for single and double castings were measured. An orthogonal array was constructed for the seven factors undertaken, and performing eighteen sets of experiments with their replicates generated the data. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio s were calculated based on the design of experiments. The average values of S/N ratios for each factor at three levels were calculated and were plotted on the graph. Considering the maximum S/N ratios from the graph, the optimum levels of process factors for both single and double castings were obtained. A statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to see which process parameters are statistically significant. A verification experiment was performed using the identified optimum conditions. The results have shown that single aluminium blanks and casting process is more robust than double aluminium blank <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> process. This proved that single aluminium blank <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> process had shown better insensitivity to noise factors. The experimental results confirmed the validity of used Taguchi robust design method for enhancing <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> process and optimizing the <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> parameters in aluminium blank casting process...|$|R

This study is carried out to investigate effect of temperature on dimensional accuracy (mm) of the finish product using <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> and to find the optimum melting temperature of aluminum for <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> process. Different setting of melting temperature is applied for <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> process which is 660 °C, 720 °C and 780 °C. These temperatures are taken using infra red (IR) thermometer. Final products are measured using vernier caliper with tolerance (± 0. 03 mm) respectively. The data obtained are analyzed using standard analysis method and graph is plotted for graphical analysis purpose. The result showed that melting temperature 720 °C has better dimensional accuracy rather than melting temperature 660 °C and 720 °C.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Resin bonded <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> {{is widely}} used for {{manufacturing}} automotive parts especially those made of Aluminium Alloys. In general, resin bonded <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> use alkaline resin as binding agent. Typically, they are from non-biodegradable materials that have issues on reclamation and disposal of the sand as well as cause hazard to the environment. Therefore, this became a motivation to propose a biodegradable resin as the binding for the resin bonded <b>sand</b> <b>casting</b> mould. Review {{of this study is}} reported in this article. From the review, biocure starch resin with water or methyl ester made from plants was selected as binder. Feasibility to make resin bonded sand mould out of this resin need to be established. Further, the <b>sand</b> and <b>cast</b> material should be characterized and analysed for their microstructural and mechanical properties. Indeed, the review has given insight to the gap of this field of knowledge and aid in the development of aim and objectives of the research...|$|R
