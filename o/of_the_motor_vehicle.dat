5|$|The {{current state}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{industry}} in Ohio is mixed and dotted. In 2002, the Ohio motor vehicle industry produced about $16 billion of items. This is about 14% {{of the automobile}} production of the United States, and Ohio outputs every state in production of motor vehicles except for Michigan. These $16 billion account for approximately 4.1% of Ohio's gross state product; however, the motor vehicle industry only accounts for 1.1% of the United States' output. In 2003, Ohio was able to produce about 1,885,000 motor vehicles, accounting for 15.6% of the United States' production, and, again, more than any state except for Michigan, in which 928,000 of these were automobiles.|$|E
5|$|The rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> era in {{the early}} 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more, and by 1939 the whole road had been sealed. Congestion at the Perth {{end of the road}} in the 1930s led to parallel roads Berwick Street and Shepparton Road being upgraded to provide bypasses. The entire Perth−Albany road was renamed Albany Highway on 2 October 1940, in recognition of its importance as an arterial traffic route. From the late 1970s, $49 million over ten years was spent on repairing Albany Highway, and the experience saw Main Roads develop a program of interventions to prevent costly road reconstruction. Since the 1990s Main Roads has been upgrading various portions along the length of Albany Highway, including widening sections to dual carriageways in Perth, and the construction of the Kenwick Link bypass.|$|E

This has not abated: arterial roads and motorways have become both defining and geographically dividing features of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of urban areas such as the North Shore (especially after the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in the late 1950s), and Manukau City in the south.|$|E

25|$|Since the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> many Hospital Boards ran {{their own}} services. From 1957 to 1990 the Hospital Act stipulated that Hospital Boards had {{to provide an}} {{ambulance}} service. Many contracted that out to St John or had ad hoc arrangements with them, often for after hours staffing. When the Hospital Act was replaced by Health Boards, many of these Boards saw this {{as a chance to}} avoid being responsible and subsequently St John took over from many Boards (e.g. Thames, Bay of Plenty, Wanganui, Palmerston North, Waipawa, Dannevirke, Nelson, West Coast, Ashburton, Southland). Marlborough stayed a Hospital-based service until 2007 and Taranaki until 2011. Wairarapa was the last region with a hospital-based service, ceasing in March 2012 and being taken over by Wellington Free Ambulance.|$|E
500|$|Incorporating a roadway only [...] wide, {{and with}} serious {{structural}} weaknesses, {{the bridge was}} ill-equipped {{to cope with the}} advent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> during the 20th century. Despite the many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation, the Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence, other than for brief spells during repairs, and is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced. The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the Greater London Council did not prevent further deterioration of the bridge's structure. A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life, making it the least busy Thames road bridge in London, except for the little-used Southwark Bridge. The bridge's condition is continuing to degrade as the result of traffic load and severe rotting of the timber deck structure caused by the urine of the many dogs using it as a route to nearby Battersea Park.|$|E

500|$|The rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> era in {{the early}} 20th century saw the road gain {{prominence}} once more. The newly formed Main Roads Board took over control and maintenance of the Perth–Albany road and twenty-one other important roads between 1926 and 1928, which were declared [...] "main roads". At this stage the Perth–Albany road was not much more developed than a bush track. To increase the usability of the overall main road network, the Board's work schedule prioritised upgrading the worst individual segments, rather than any one road. In 1928/29, twenty-two separate sections of the Perth–Albany road were improved, but many were short, and drivers would experience quite varied conditions, from new sealed road to gravel road, and then a boggy dirt {{in just a few}} miles. By 1932, the improved conditions allowed an average speed of [...] to be reached, for a total trip of eight to nine hours instead of two days. In 1938, a total of [...] had been sealed, and the following year the whole route had been completed.|$|E
500|$|Things did improve for Churchill-Redman and {{the sales}} rose {{dramatically}} from £200,000 in 1946 to £1M by 1955. This {{was in part}} because of innovative product development at the Halifax site which ultimately produced the CR P5 and P6 profiling lathes: the conclusion of this development is described by Jeremy as being a range of [...] "fully automatic, multi-tool and profiling lathes. A lathe with an automatic feed and delivery heralded an automatic machine tool production line." [...] The expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> industry once again was a significant factor, driving demand for machine tools much as the bicycling boom of the 1890s had done. In 1957 the Scotswood operation moved across the River Tyne to Blaydon, where a factory was built especially for the manufacturing purpose intended. Among other products from that site was the Vertimax lathe, which used a vertical spindle and was of interest to motor vehicle manufacturers. This particular design originated from James Anderson, a garage owner in Glasgow, during the war and whose business was brought into the Churchill group of companies. Churchill Gear Machines Ltd was part of the group, having been established in Blaydon since 1956: the cause of its origin and the nature of its products is uncertain.|$|E
2500|$|Technology {{has long}} since left the horse-drawn King Road Drag far behind. The King Road Drag made {{possible}} the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> and, ironically, the motor vehicle doomed the King Road Drag, at least in its horse-drawn form. The motor-powered road grader quickly rendered its horse-drawn predecessor obsolete. However, without the road improvements {{brought about by the}} King Road Drag in its day and the subsequent advent of the automobile, American life would be different today in ways that cannot be easily imagined. For instance, how many people living today never would have been born, if bad roads and poor transportation had prevented so much as one set of their ancestors from meeting or even meeting later than they did? With that thought in mind, how many people living in America and elsewhere unsuspectingly owe their very existence to David Ward King and his King Road Drag? ...|$|E
