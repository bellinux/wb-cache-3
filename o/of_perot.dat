5|$|Perot's {{performance}} {{satisfied the}} 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar Walter Dean Burnham. The legitimacy of this {{success has been}} questioned by scholars who dismiss the label <b>of</b> <b>Perot</b> as a typical third party candidate, {{largely due to the}} availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts. Others dispute these claims and point out that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign. Exit polls revealed that 35% of voters would have voted for Perot if they believed he could win. Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset.|$|E
25|$|Between the two {{assessment}} periods, {{the views}} of many supporters changed dramatically as Perot re-entered the race in October and received nearly {{a fifth of the}} popular vote. The results showed that supporters recalled their past emotions as having been more consistent with their current appraisals <b>of</b> <b>Perot</b> than they actually were.|$|E
25|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot's support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described liberals, 27% from self-described conservatives, and 53% coming from self-described moderates. Economically, however, the majority <b>of</b> <b>Perot</b> voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with {{the bulk of the}} remainder drawing from the upper middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually). Exit polls also showed that Ross Perot drew 38% of his vote from Bush, and 38% of his vote from Clinton, though it's generally considered that he aided Clinton in defeating Bush.|$|E

500|$|As 1999 {{drew to a}} close, the {{conflict}} within the Reform Party escalated. [...] To the chagrin of the Perot faction, chairman-elect Jack Gargan pushed through a motion to move headquarters from Perot's home in Dallas to Florida. [...] Shortly thereafter, the Perot faction incorporated the Reform Leadership Council as an entity separate from the main party to preserve the vision <b>of</b> <b>Perot.</b> [...] They also moved the National Convention from Ventura's home in Minneapolis to Long Beach. The Ventura faction filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the Perot faction and threatened to bolt the party, prompting chairman Verney to instruct, [...] "don't let the door hit them when they leave." [...] As {{the conflict}} unfolded, Ventura publicly expressed that he could never support Buchanan as the party's nominee, describing him as [...] "very shallow." [...] Ventura said that in a head-to-head against Buchanan, he favored Trump. [...] Ventura and Trump planned a campaign event together in Minnesota to begin the new year.|$|E
500|$|... "Draft Perot" [...] {{organizations}} opened {{throughout the}} nation, and petition drives were coordinated largely by Perot's friend Tom Luce, {{and the real}} estate arm <b>of</b> <b>Perot</b> Systems, to help secure {{a place for the}} candidate on every state ballot. At the height of the efforts, 18,000 simultaneous calls came into Perot's telephone banks after he appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. At one point, 30,000 telephone calls were received in one hour. MCI Communications Corporation reported that over a million calls came in during the first ten days that the phone banks were active. At the time, presidential polls showed Perot with 21% support from the electorate, 14 points behind likely Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton and 16 points behind President Bush. Despite this, only one third of potential voters knew enough about Perot to form an opinion of him. A large segment of his support came from Reagan Democrats, entrepreneurs and suburban conservatives deemed [...] "Perot Republicans", who agreed with the central theme of his campaign, though they disagreed with his pro-choice stance on abortion. Political newcomers were also involved in the volunteer efforts.|$|E
50|$|Joe Klein mocked one <b>of</b> <b>Perot's</b> {{campaign}} gaffes {{and said}} he was not a sufficiently substantial figure. Miller characterizes Perot as a rich, self-financed lone wolf. By contrast, what most radical centrists say they want in political action terms is the building of a grounded political movement.|$|R
25|$|Perot {{was born}} in Texarkana, Texas, the son <b>of</b> Lula May <b>Perot</b> (née Ray) and Gabriel Ross Perot, a {{commodity}} broker specializing in cotton contracts. His patrilineal line traces back to an immigrant to Louisiana, in the 1740s. He attended a private school called Patty Hill. He graduated from Texas High School in Texarkana in 1947. One <b>of</b> <b>Perot's</b> boyhood friends was Hayes McClerkin, later Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and a prominent Texarkana, Arkansas, lawyer.|$|R
5000|$|The effect <b>of</b> Ross <b>Perot's</b> {{candidacy}} {{has been}} a contentious point of debate for many years. In the ensuing months and years after the election, various Republicans asserted that Perot had acted as a spoiler, enough {{to the detriment of}} Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for Ross Perot to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination <b>of</b> the <b>Perot</b> vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but of the voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important," [...] two thirds voted for Bill Clinton. A mathematical look at the voting numbers reveals that Bush would have had to win 12.2% <b>of</b> <b>Perot's</b> 18.8% <b>of</b> the vote, 65% <b>of</b> <b>Perot's</b> support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot's best results were in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, or carried few electoral votes, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. NAFTA played a role in Perot's support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues.|$|R
500|$|Early {{supporters}} fell largely {{into three}} types: committed Eurosceptics, disaffected Conservatives, and those who—though not necessarily being Eurosceptic—strongly {{believed that the}} British population deserved a referendum on EU membership. At the time the new party was largely seen {{as a threat to}} the governing Conservative Party, which was experiencing high levels of mid-term unpopularity. In September 1995, the party began recruiting candidates to contest the next general election. Goldsmith was also able to obtain celebrity endorsements. Despite Goldsmith's longstanding criticism of the mainstream media—he had previously stated that [...] "reporting in England is a load of filth"—the party used its finances to promote its message in the media. It hired Ian Beaumont, who had formerly been the press officer to Thatcher's government, to work for it. The party paid for many full-page and some double-page advertisement in the UK's national newspapers, as well as two cinema advertisements. This generated criticism from those who accused it of [...] "cheque-book politics" [...] in the manner <b>of</b> <b>Perot</b> in the US. This financial backing and infrastructure contrasted with that of another single-issue Eurosceptic Party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which was operating with little finances and a skeleton organisation at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In June, Perot led a Gallup poll with 39% of the vote. By mid-July, the Washington Post {{reported}} that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness {{to follow their}} advice {{to be more specific}} on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins would later claim that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the CIA. Amid the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained {{that he did not want}} the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. Perot eventually stated the reason was that he received threats that digitally altered photographs would be released by the Bush campaign to sabotage his daughter's wedding. Whatever his reasons for withdrawing, his reputation was badly damaged. Many of his supporters felt betrayed and public opinion polls [...] subsequently showed a large negative view <b>of</b> <b>Perot</b> that was absent prior to his decision to end the campaign.|$|E

5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% <b>of</b> <b>Perot's</b> 18.91% <b>of</b> the vote, 66.36% <b>of</b> <b>Perot's</b> support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|R
