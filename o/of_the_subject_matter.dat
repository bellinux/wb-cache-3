5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, {{who was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, {{but it can be}} criticized for diminishing the potential richness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the preface, {{the author}} {{claims to have}} stated 20,000 facts {{gathered}} from some 2,000 books and from 100 select authors. The extant lists of his authorities cover more than 400, including 146 Roman and 327 Greek and other sources of information. The lists generally follow the order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> of each book. This {{has been shown in}} Heinrich Brunn's Disputatio (Bonn, 1856).|$|E
5|$|A free {{jazz and}} {{contemporary}} classical work, Ten Freedom Summers comprises 19 pieces that are mostly fully developed suites. They eschew conventional themes for abstract expressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> {{which focuses on}} the Civil Rights Movement and other interrelated topics. Smith cites the segregation of his native Mississippi and playwright August Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle as inspirations behind the work. Ten Freedom Summers received widespread critical acclaim and was named {{a finalist for the}} Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2013.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{weaknesses}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book do not {{undermine the}} contributions the book makes if {{teachers and students}} apply the approach FLA in their disciplinary literacy practices.

25|$|Comparametric equations, 1993: Mann was {{the first}} to propose and {{implement}} an algorithm to estimate a camera's response function from a plurality of differently exposed images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> He was also the first to propose and implement an algorithm to automatically extend dynamic range in an image by combining multiple differently exposed pictures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|R
5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> of the play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the greatest risk of being trafficked. Several human trafficking survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with human trafficking. Quandt said that he encountered many audience members who, because of watching the play, became determined to do something to combat human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe learning, {{teaching}} and management are three crucial processes for instructional activities. As the current era moves toward student-centered instruction, the focus deeply {{shift to the}} students’ learning processes. In that sense, more research studies must be performed on understanding how our students think or behave while they study. Therefore, this study aims {{to understand how the}} participants perceive their studying process. The study participants were the “Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CEIT) ” students from a university in Turkey (n= 91; 40 male and 51 female). The study showed that 62 students are Deep Approach oriented learners whereas 29 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students are Surface Approach oriented learners. It seems that one third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study participants regrettably pay attention to the framework or key points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matters</b> without going deeper in their understanding.

5|$|In December 1943, Groves sent Furman to Britain {{to discuss}} the {{establishment}} of a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project with the British government, and to confer over coordinating the intelligence effort. Lieutenant Commander Eric Welsh, the head of the Norwegian Section of MI6, was unimpressed with Furman's grasp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> Groves selected the head of the Manhattan District's security activities, Captain Horace K. Calvert, as head of the London Liaison Office, with the title of Assistant Military Attaché. Working in cooperation with Welsh and Michael Perrin from Tube Alloys, the London Liaison Office consisted of Calvert, Captain George C. Davis, two Women's Army Corps clerks and three CIC agents.|$|E
5|$|Salant later {{pulled the}} episode from the {{schedule}} and assigned producer Harry Morgan to re-edit it. According to Wallace, Salant found the piece sensationalistic; however, C. A. Tripp, {{a psychologist who}} had put CBS {{in touch with his}} patient Larson, claimed that Salant felt the piece was pro-homosexuality. Morgan scrapped all but about 10 minutes of Peters' final cut. CBS felt that the self-accepting gay men made too favorable of an impression, so Morgan edited two of the interviews to make the men seem unhappier. According to Wallace, no sponsor would buy time during the episode because of the taboo nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> Commercial spots were filled by public service announcements for the Peace Corps and the Internal Revenue Service.|$|E
5|$|The work {{commenced}} {{at the end}} of {{the building}} furthest from the altar, with the latest of the narrative scenes, and progressed towards the altar with the scenes of the Creation. The first three scenes, from the story of Noah, contain a much larger number of small figures than the later panels. This is partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> which deals with the fate of Humanity, but also because all the figures at that end of the ceiling, including the prophets and Ignudi, are smaller than in the central section. As the scale got larger, Michelangelo's style became broader, the final narrative scene of God in the act of Creation was painted in a single day.|$|E

25|$|The early {{issues of}} the {{magazine}} seemed caught between two opposing views of its audience.

25|$|The {{public is}} {{outraged by the}} {{apparent}} obscurity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> and the predominance of the elementary geometrical shapes, which give rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although the term 'cube' has been used before {{with respect to the}} works of Metzinger (1906), Delaunay and Metzinger (1907), and Georges Braque (1908), {{this is the first time}} the word 'Cubism' is used. The designation becomes widespread as an artistic movement.|$|E
25|$|Over the Summer of 1911, Gleizes, {{living and}} working in Courbevoie, is in close contact with Metzinger, who has {{recently}} moved to Meudon. Gleizes paints Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon. The two have extensive conversations about the nature of form and perception. Both are discontent with classical perspective, which they feel give only a partial idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> as experienced in life, seen in movement and from many different angles.|$|E
25|$|In his Daybooks he {{provided}} an unusually detailed {{record of his}} evolution as an artist. Although he initially denied that his images reflect his own interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> by 1932 his writings revealed {{that he had come}} to accept the importance of artistic impression in his work. When combined with his photographs, his writings provide an extraordinarily vivid series of insights into his development as an artist and his impact of future generations of photographers.|$|E

40|$|Feminine prose {{is a kind}} of {{relative}} existence which is derived from <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> Feminine literature.

25|$|According to Gleizes, {{the public}} is outraged by the {{representation}} of subject matter as cones, cubes and spheres, resulting in the obscurity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting {{and the fact that}} a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although this and similar terms have been used before in artistic circles (usually in relation to the works of Metzinger, Delaunay and Braque), {{this is the first time}} the use of the term becomes widespread.|$|E
25|$|Contact {{linguistics}} {{examines the}} linguistic results of {{contact between the}} speakers of different languages, particularly as evidenced in loan words. An empirical study of loans is by definition historical in focus and therefore forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> of historical linguistics. One {{of the goals of}} etymology is to establish which items in a language's vocabulary result from linguistic contact. This is also an important issue both for the comparative method and for the lexical comparison methods, since failure to recognize a loan may distort the findings.|$|E
25|$|Although Renoir {{displayed}} {{a talent for}} his work, he frequently tired <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and sought refuge in the galleries of the Louvre. The owner of the factory recognized his apprentice’s talent and communicated this to Renoir’s family. Following this, Renoir started taking lessons to prepare for entry into Ecole des Beaux Arts. When the porcelain factory adopted mechanical reproduction processes in 1858, Renoir was forced to find other means to support his learning. Before he enrolled in art school, he also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans.|$|E
