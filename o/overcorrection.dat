2500|$|Labial {{reduction}} {{by means}} of a central wedge-resection involves cutting and removing a partial-thickness wedge of tissue from the thickest portion of the labium minus. Unlike the edge-resection technique, the resection pattern of the central wedge technique preserves the natural rugosity ("wrinkled" [...] edge) of the labia minora. If performed as a full-thickness resection, there exists the potential risk of damaging the pertinent labial nerves, which can result in painful neuromas, and numbness. A partial thickness removal of mucosa and skin, leaving the submucosa intact, decreases the risk of this complication. F. Giraldo et al. procedurally refined the central wedge resection technique with an additional 90-degree Z-plasty technique, which produces a refined surgical scar that is less tethered, and diminishes the physical tensions exerted upon the surgical-incision wound, and, therefore, reduces the likelihood of a notched (scalloped-edge) scar. The central wedge-resection technique is a demanding surgical procedure, and difficulty can arise with judging the correct amount of labial skin to resect, which might result in either undercorrection (persistent tissue-redundancy), or the <b>overcorrection</b> (excessive tension to the surgical wound), and an increased probability of surgical-wound separation. The benefit of this technique is that an extended wedge can be brought upwards towards the prepuce to treat a prominent clitoral hood without a separate incision. This leads to a natural contour for the finished result, and avoids direct incisions near the highly-sensitive clitoris.|$|E

40|$|To date {{there is}} no single shared {{property}} of the various physical and chemical agents that elicit the β-curve to account for its form, leading to the proposition that hormesis is a consequence of the nonspecificity of adaptive responses.

Four kinds of examples are reviewed (enzyme activity, sequestration and repair, and reproductive and homeostatic responses) that corroborate this proposition. The homeostasis example (incorporating homeorhesis) is considered in more detail, using the author’s published hydroid experimental growth data, to show that both the α- and β-curves are satisfactorily explained in this way. Many consider that hormesis is merely due to regulatory <b>overcorrections,</b> but it is proposed that it is a consequence of adaptations of the rate-sensitive growth control mechanism (homeorhesis) to sustained levels of inhibition to which the growth control mechanism adapts.

40|$|BACKGROUND Surgical {{management}} of large-angle infantile esotropia and decompensated microtropia has been controversially debated. There {{seems to be}} a relative bias against surgery on more than two horizontal muscles to avoid <b>overcorrections.</b> In our study we report on the sensory and motor outcomes after three horizontal muscle surgery. Furthermore we aim to suggest a table to guide surgery amounts. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study was a retrospective interventional cohort of 27 patients (16 female, 11 male; mean age 7. 9 [years], ranging from 1 to 27 [years]) with infantile esotropia and decompensated microtropia who underwent three horizontal muscle surgery (bilateral medial rectus muscle recession and lateral rectus muscle plication) between 2005 and 2013. RESULTS Preoperative deviation in primary position measured 30. 2 [°] (mean; range 21. 9 to 48. 0). Postoperatively esotropia was significantly reduced to 2. 6 [°] (mean; range - 16. 7 to 16. 7). After six months deviation measured 5. 5 [°] (mean, range - 14. 1 to 21. 9). An effect of 1. 63 °/mm was calculated for the combined three muscle surgery. CONCLUSIONS For the correction of large-angle infantile esotropia and decompensated microtropia three horizontal muscle surgery is associated with a high success rate.

30|$|Substantial {{variation}} in the investigated clinical outcomes was noted among studies. The majority of them focused on the accuracy of Invisalign® or its comparison to conventional fixed appliances. The first was found sufficient when certain malocclusion features, such as overjet or anterior arch length discrepancy, were tested [35, 36] or for maxillary molar distalization [34]. The efficacy on maxillary molar distalization (≤[*]½ cusp) was also supported by another clinical study [31]. However, important limitations were reported for bodily expansion of the maxillary posterior teeth [21, 30], canine [5, 24] and premolar [34] rotational movements, extrusion of maxillary incisors 5, and in overbite control [35, 36]. All of these referred studies scored as moderate according to Bondemark scoring system [17]. Based on these findings, the use of additional attachments or <b>overcorrections</b> was commonly suggested in the literature for these types of movement. As for the comparison to fixed appliances, from studies with moderate [23, 28] to low [18] risk of bias, it seems that Invisalign performs well in mild to moderate non-extraction cases [18, 23, 28], but it cannot equally succeed in more difficult cases, including extraction cases [19, 27, 28, 33, 38]. Teeth inclinations and occlusal contacts seem {{to be among the}} major limitations of Invisalign [19, 33, 38], most of them judged as moderate [23, 33, 38] risk of bias and only two with low [18, 19]. The results from studies that included only different Invisalign groups are in agreement with the abovementioned findings [20, 25, 29, 32].|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This paper reports {{an outcome}} study of 52 {{consecutive}} children treated by bilateral lateral rectus recession for intermittent exotropia over a 9 year period (1981 - 90) {{with a minimum}} follow up of 6 months. METHODS: Successful alignment {{was defined as the}} absence of any postoperative intermittent or constant tropia in any position of gaze. The study examined the variables that might be predictive of successful alignment. The charts were abstracted for age at initial surgery, quantity of initial deviation, initial refraction, motor alignment at 1 week and 6 months, final alignment, secondary surgery results and the incidence of a monofixation syndrome result. RESULTS: Motor tests demonstrated that 32 (62 %) of the patients were successfully aligned by the initial procedure performed for a mean of 25 prism diopters of preoperative deviation while viewing distant targets at a mean age of 4 years 8 months, followed for a mean of 4 years, 4 months. The incidence of undercorrections and <b>overcorrections</b> were approximately equal in quantity suggesting that the current surgical dosage was adequate, but the age at initial surgery, initial deviation, initial refraction and 1 week postoperative alignment results were not predictive of success. Alignment at 6 months, however, was highly correlated with successful alignment {{by the end of the}} study (p = 0. 002). Secondary surgery was performed for 11 patients and 5 patients were found to have a monofixation syndrome result. CONCLUSION: Successful alignment was achieved in the majority of children treated for intermittent exotropia by an initial bilateral lateral rectus recession. However, 20 % of the patients received secondary surgery for a residual deviation, and the study confirmed a previously reported 10 % incidence of monofixation syndrome result in children surgically treated for this type of strabismus...|$|R

Der Langzeitverlauf nach Augenmuskelchirurgie bei Exodeviationen wurde untersucht und die erzielte Wirkung durch den bestehenden Dosierungsansatz überprüft. PATIENTEN UND METHODEN: Bei 53 konsekutiven Patienten mit divergenten Schielformen wurden die Operationsresultate nach einem Jahr nach streng definierten Kriterien analysiert. Bei 18 der 53 Patienten konnten Langzeitverläufe von durchschnittlich 13 Jahren verfolgt werden. Die Subgruppe der 41 einseitig operierten Patienten (Rücklagerung M. Rectus lateralis, Resektion M. rectus medialis) wurde gesondert ausgewertet. Von dieser Subgruppe konnte bei 13 Patienten ein Langzeitverlauf erhoben werden. Für Patienten mit intermittierendem Strabismus divergens und dekompensierender Exophorie galten folgende Kriterien für die Operationsresultate nach einem Jahr und im Langzeitverlauf: sehr gut: Orthophorie oder Orthotropie mit Exo- oder Esophorie bis 5 Prismendioptrien (PD); gut: Orthotropie mit Exo- oder Esophorie bis 10 PD; zufriedenstellend: Orthotropie mit Exo- oder Esophorie > 10 PD, 10 PD oder Exo- oder Esotropie > 10 PD, 10 PD {{but less}} than the {{preoperative}} angle; bad: constant eso- or exotropia or > preoperative angle. For patients with a constant divergent strabismus the following criteria were determined: very good: orthophoria or orthotropia with exo- or esophoria less than 5 PD; good: exo- or esophoria less than 10 PD or tropia of 5 ° (microstrabismus); satisfactory: exo- or esophoria > 10 PD or exo- or esotropia > 10 PD but < preoperative angle; bad: same as preoperative or more. A subgroup analysis of 41 patients who underwent monolateral combined rectus muscle surgery was performed regarding their long-term follow-up (average: 13 years) as well. Concurrently the patients completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: One year postoperatively 6 outcomes were very good, 14 good, 31 satisfactory and 2 were poor.

40|$|Introduction: To improve gait in {{children}} with spastic diplegia, the semitendinosus muscle (ST) is frequently lengthened amongst other medial hamstring muscles by surgery. Side effects on gait due to weakening of the hamstring muscles and <b>overcorrections</b> have been reported [1]. How these side effects relate to ST morphology is unknown. Research question: Howdo ST morphology and gait kinematics change after medial hamstring lengthening {{in children}} with spastic diplegia? Methods: ST morphology and gait kinematics were determined in five children with spastic diplegia (2 boys; age at surgery: 14. 4 2. 4 years; GMFCS II&III) selected for medial hamstring lengthening to counteract limited knee range of motion and improve gait, before and 8 – 20 months after surgery. Muscle belly length, tendon length, muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length as well as muscle volume of ST at the knee angle corresponding to 4 N m knee moment in an imposed hip position of 708 flexion were assessed by freehand 3 D ultrasound [2]. 3 Dgait analysis was performed using an optoelectronic marker tracking system. For each participant, pelvic, hip and knee angles of the right leg were determined in the sagittal plane at midstance (MSt (30 % gait cycle (GC))) and late swing (LSw (99 % GC)) over three successful strides. Results: The knee angle corresponding to 4 N m knee moment was 57. 2 14. 98 (pre) and 35. 2 12. 28 (post) (p = 0. 068). After surgery, muscle belly length normalized for femur length was 34 5 % lower (p = 0. 001), tendon length was 83 34 % higher (p = 0. 003) and MTU length was 10 7 % higher (p = 0. 044) (Fig. 1). Muscle volume was 39. 6 17. 6 cm 2 before surgery and 21. 3 17. 2 cm 2 after (p = 0. 054). Kinematic results showed significantly improved knee extension but also increased pelvic anterior tilt, and no differences in hip angle (Table 1). Discussion: Our results show that medial hamstring lengthening leads to a longer ST MTU with a longer tendon, but a reduced muscle belly length. Differences in gait kinematics indicate that the longer ST MTU after surgery mainly leads to more knee extension during gait, while {{we did not find}} an increase in hip flexion. The increased pelvic tilt seems to be an effect of the changed knee kinematics through the femur kinematics during gait. Preoperative pelvic tilt needs to be considered when medial hamstring lengthening is indicated. References [1] Dreher J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2012; 94 : 121 – 30. [2] Haberfehlner H. J.
