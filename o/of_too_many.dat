5|$|The Joint Chiefs and CINCPAC {{turned down}} the concept, believing that it would consume the efforts <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> troops and create a {{logistical}} nightmare. McNamara, however, was intrigued. Ignoring the military chiefs, he approached the Institute for Defense Analyses and requested that it fund {{a study of the}} concept. The project was then handed over to the Jason Division (also referred to as the Jason Group or Jason Committee), a group of 67 scientists who were to study and develop the technology necessary to make the physical/electronic barrier feasible. The group concentrated its efforts in three key areas: communications; data processing and display; and sensor development. On 15 September 1966, McNamara made Army General Alfred D. Starbird the head of the newly formed Defense Communications Planning Group (DCPG), which was to oversee the implementation of the program. The barrier concept was then given the designation Practice Nine. The DCPG's original mission profile, as of September 1966, was simply to implement the anti-infiltration system devised by the Jason Division. The original plan foresaw the deployment of both a physical barrier in addition to an air-supported barrier using various electronic sensors.|$|E

25|$|By 1978, NBC aired Saturday {{afternoon}} {{college basketball}} games, while CBS aired NBA doubleheaders on Sunday afternoons, and most independent stations aired local professional and college games.

25|$|In Israel, {{a debate}} {{continues}} over the Law of Return. Some people wish to retain {{it as it}} stands, others want to modify it, and some to abolish the Law completely. Those who would abolish the Law object to it because it grants Jews rights that members of other groups governed by the State of Israel do not have. Others argue that the law permits the entry <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> non-Jews, thereby undermining its purpose.|$|E
25|$|Transactions {{continued}} steadily {{through the}} turn of the century and into the 1820s. In the late 1820s and early 1830s, a movement to reform the Royal Society rose. The reformers felt that the scientific character of the Society had been undermined by the admission <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> gentleman dilettantes under Banks. In proposing a more limited membership, to protect the Society's reputation, they also argued for systematic, expert evaluation of papers for Transactions by named referees.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposing}} {{hypothesis that}} has been offered by Michael Witzel and Steve Farmer, is that these symbols are nonlinguistic signs which symbolise families, clans, gods, and religious concepts—similar to components of coats of arms or totem poles. In a 2004 article, Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel presented a number of arguments stating that the Indus script is nonlinguistic, principal among them being the extreme brevity of the inscriptions, the existence <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> rare signs (increasing over the 700-year period of the Mature Harappan civilization), {{and the lack of}} the random-looking sign repetition typical of language.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, the North American {{industry}} crashed due to {{the production}} <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting {{in the fall of}} the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System, which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as Ocean Software. The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the Game Boy handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against Blockbuster Entertainment, which enabled games rentals {{in the same way as}} movies.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{fashionable to}} blame all of Asia's present {{problems}} on corruption {{and the failure}} of Asian values, it is at bottom a case of a bubble bursting, <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> imprudent lenders chasing too many incautious borrowers. But the greed of Mr. Suharto's children ensured that their father would take the lion's share of the blame for Indonesia's financial collapse. The Suharto children's favored position became a major obstacle to the measures needed to restore economic confidence. Worst of all, they ensured that the economic crisis would be a political crisis as well. That he allowed this, and that he amassed such wealth himself, is all the more mysterious since he lived a relatively modest life.|$|E
25|$|In the Slaughterhouse cases Carpenter {{represented}} the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughterhouse Company, {{which had been}} granted a monopoly on all slaughterhouse business in New Orleans by the carpetbag state legislature of Louisiana in 1869. Butchers and cattle dealers thrown out of work by the law obtained an injunction from a district court, claiming they had been denied equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and deprived of property under the due process clause. Making a plea for states' rights, Carpenter contended that the amendment had been intended solely to elevate African Americans and had no bearing on economic statutes passed by a state. He also warned <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> powers being centralized in the federal government. The court concurred in Carpenter's narrowing {{of the scope of}} the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E

25|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} {{for the preservation of}} the French Quarter, but it was hardly the only challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of the French Quarter. The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré's charm might be compromised by the introduction <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district's boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of timeshare condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout the French Quarter or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World's Fair.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{classical}} Western music, Carnatic {{music is}} notated {{almost exclusively in}} tonic sol-fa notation using either a Roman or Indic script to represent the solfa names. Past attempts to use the staff notation have mostly failed. Indian music makes use of hundreds of ragas, many more than the church modes in Western music. It becomes difficult to write Carnatic music using the staff notation without the use <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> accidentals. Furthermore, the staff notation requires that the song be played in a certain key. The notions of key and absolute pitch are deeply rooted in Western music, whereas the Carnatic notation does not specify the key and prefers to use scale degrees (relative pitch) to denote notes. The singer is free to choose the actual pitch of the tonic note. In the more precise forms of Carnatic notation, there are symbols placed above the notes indicating how the notes should be played or sung; however, informally this practice is not followed.|$|E
25|$|A varying {{number of}} marines (epibatai), usually 10–20, were carried aboard for {{boarding}} actions. At the Battle of Salamis, each Athenian ship was recorded to have 14 hoplites and 4 archers (usually Scythian mercenaries) on board, but Herodotus narrates that the Chiots had 40 hoplites on board at Lade {{and that the}} Persian ships carried a similar number. This reflects the different practices between the Athenians and other, less professional navies. Whereas the Athenians relied on speed and maneuverability, where their highly trained crews had the advantage, other states favored boarding, {{in a situation that}} closely mirrored the one that developed during the First Punic War. Grappling hooks would be used both as a weapon and for towing damaged ships (ally or enemy) back to shore. When the triremes were alongside each other, marines would either spear the enemy or hop across and cut the enemy down with their swords. As the presence <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> heavily armed hoplites on deck tended to destabilize the ship, the epibatai were normally seated, only rising to carry out any boarding action. The hoplites belonged to the middle social classes, so that they came immediately next to the trierarch in status aboard the ship.|$|E

25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E
25|$|The Ca.331 O.A. won {{widespread}} {{praise from}} both the Italian and German pilots—including German fighter ace Werner Mölders (1913–1941) -- who tested it, and {{the chief of the}} German Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring (1893–1946), was given a demonstration of its capabilities at Guidonia Montecelio in January 1942. The reasons for the lack of a production order by either Italy or Germany remain obscure and a matter of debate. Reasons given by various sources include a supposed overreliance on the use of materials in the Ca.331s construction that may have been in scarce supply (although this itself is controversial) in wartime Italy and Germany; the use <b>of</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> parts in the Ca.331, uncommon with other Italian aircraft (although {{it is not clear what}} specifically these may have been); political problems that Caproni company founder Gianni Caproni (1886–1957) may have had with the Italian Fascist government (which have not been identified clearly); an unwillingness of the Italian military to cooperate too closely with their German counterparts for fear of being dominated by Germany in the event of a German victory in World War II; or simply that the Ca.331 was under development for so long that the requirement for it disappeared before it could enter production, a common problem in the Italian aircraft industry during the World War II years.|$|E
