50|$|In 1982 a {{broadband}} {{radio system}} was in service {{as far as}} Coen, at which time the open-wire route to the south was abandoned as a trunk route, and the installation of an automatic exchange at Coen was made possible. Broadband was extended to Thursday Island in 1987, at which time the <b>open-wire</b> <b>line</b> north of Coen was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|When the ATU must {{be located}} near the radio for {{convenient}} adjustment, any significant SWR will increase the loss in the feedline. For that reason, when using an ATU at the transmitter, low-loss, high-impedance feedline is a great advantage (<b>open-wire</b> <b>line,</b> for example). A short length of low-loss coaxial line is acceptable, but with longer lossy lines the additional loss due to SWR becomes very high.|$|E
5000|$|Historically {{the first}} section was often an aerial <b>open-wire</b> <b>line,</b> with several {{conductors}} attached to porcelain insulators on cross-arms on [...] "telegraph" [...] poles. Hence party line service was often given to residential customers to minimise the number of local loops required. Usually all these circuits went into aerial or buried cables with a twisted pair for each local loop nearer the exchange, see outside plant.|$|E

5000|$|... 111 was {{specifically}} {{chosen to be}} similar to Britain's 999 service. With pulse dialling, New Zealand telephones pulse in reverse to the UK - dialling 0 sent ten pulses, 1 sent nine, 2 sent eight, 3 sent seven, etc. in New Zealand, while in the UK, dialling 1 sent one pulse, 2 sent two, etc. In the early years of 111, the telephone equipment was based on British Post Office equipment, except for this unusual orientation. Therefore, dialling 111 on a New Zealand telephone sent three sets of nine pulses to the exchange, exactly the same as UK's 999. Number [...] "9" [...] in New Zealand (or [...] "1" [...] in Britain) was not used for the start of telephone numbers because of the likelihood of accidental false calls from <b>open-wire</b> <b>lines</b> tapping together etc.|$|R
25|$|In wire transposition, {{the wires}} {{exchange}} position once every several poles. In this way, the two wires would receive similar EMI from power lines. This represented an early implementation of twisting, {{with a twist}} rate of about four twists per kilometre, or six per mile. Such <b>open-wire</b> balanced <b>lines</b> with periodic transpositions still survive today in some rural areas.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{presence}} of components capable of withstanding only moderate excess voltage stress, in particular semiconductor components (transistors, etc.) in telecommunication equipment, necessitates protective measures against overvoltages which may {{occur at the}} terminals. This is so even if the overvoltages only slightly exceed the service voltages, as they are still capable of disturbing the functioning of these components and even of destroying them. In addition, the functioning of circuits provided with repeaters may be disturbed by electromotive forces induced by power lines, {{depending on how the}} lines are operated; disturbance may be caused even when there is no fault on the lines. Components, in particular the semiconductor components of apparatus which is directly connected to the conductors of telecommunication lines, may be damaged since these conductors, whether in cable or in <b>open-wire</b> <b>lines,</b> are exposed to overvoltages due to external sources such as the mag...|$|R

5000|$|DC {{filters are}} {{required}} only for HVDC transmission systems involving overhead lines. Voltage distortion {{is not a}} problem in its own right, since consumers do not connect directly to the DC terminals of the system, so the main design criterion for the DC filters is to ensure that the harmonic currents flowing in the DC lines do not induce interference in nearby <b>open-wire</b> telephone <b>lines.</b> [...] With the rise in digital mobile telecommunication systems, which are much less susceptible to interference, DC filters are becoming less important for HVDC systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{present day}} {{necessity}} of installing multi-tower antenna arrays for many transmitters {{in the broadcast}} band (540 kc. to 1600 kc.) in order to prescribe the pattern of their radiated fields, brings with it the need for longer transmission lines. The transmission efficiency of a line should, of course, be a maximum compatible with economical installation and good engineering practice, since {{this portion of the}} system carries the most expensive energy of a transmitter plant. Furthermore, in Canada and the U. S. at least, government regulations limit the amount of power that can be lost in the external circuits i. e. power-dividing network, transmission line, and antenna-matching networks. Therefore, where two or more antennas are used requiring an equal number of antenna-matching circuits and a considerable length of transmission line, the losses in both of these components must be kept small in order to satisfy the regulations. These conditions draw attention to the relative merits of the two common types of line, the concentric tube and the open-wire. The characteristics, performance, and cost of concentric lines are well known, since they have been used for many years, and their various sizes have been standardized. In recent years, however, multi-conductor <b>open-wire</b> <b>lines</b> have been gaining favour. There are two factors which make it possible to approach the transmission efficiency of a concentric <b>line,</b> with an <b>open-wire</b> type. [ [...] . ...|$|R
