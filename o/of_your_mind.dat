Streep lived with actor John Cazale for three years until his death from lung cancer in March 1978. Streep said of his death, [...] "I didn't get over it. I don't want to get over it.

500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking about knowing where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question!

Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope in the back <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity.

Lauren Down of The Guardian expressed that [...] "Wrapped up {{in the aftermath of}} a relationship, 'Out Of Mind' [...] allows the pain of an ending love affair to breath". Mark Savage of BBC wrote that an indifferent person tells the singer that [...] "time will heal her broken heart". According to Andrew Hampp of Billboard, the singer [...] "tells off" [...] a former boyfriend for expecting her to get over quickly their former relationship. Sam Lansky of Idolator felt that the artist shows [...] "frustrated resignation" [...] while she sings the line [...] "I'll forget you, seriously". In the pre-chorus, the music vanishes and she sings [...] "Are you kidding me?". Lansky felt that the [...] "emotion" [...] on the pre-chorus was [...] "chill-inducing", while Savage wrote that [...] "it's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious.

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E
