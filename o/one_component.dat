5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes.

5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. <b>One</b> <b>component</b> {{is a red}} dwarf star of {{spectral}} type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E

The determining of the correlation parameter preferably takes place through experimental tests that comprise the steps of providing a sample wheel having a rim substantially {{the same as that of}} said wheel and determining at least one correlation coefficient between at least <b>one</b> force <b>component</b> acting upon said sample wheel at the hub along at least one predetermined direction and at least <b>one</b> respective deformation <b>component</b> of the rim of said wheel...|$|R
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case <b>one</b> <b>component</b> should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E

A reduced model, called the the zero Mach-number limit, {{is derived from}} the Euler equations of compressible fluid flow through elimination of time scales associated with sound waves. The well-posedness of the resulting partial differentialalgebraic equation (PDAE) is investigated by analysis of a frozen coefficient linearisation as well as by numerical experiments. The linear stability analysis is done through transformation to a canonical form with <b>one</b> hyperbolic <b>component,</b> <b>one</b> parabolic <b>component</b> and <b>one</b> algebraic <b>component.</b> Using this canonical form it is seen how to prescribe boundary and initial data and an energy estimate is derived. Numerical experiments on the nonlinear PDAE using a finite difference spatial discretisation support the linear stability analysis. ...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{proteasome}} normally produces {{very short}} peptide fragments, {{in some cases}} these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules. Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes, including <b>one</b> <b>component</b> of the mammalian complex NF-κB, are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form. Such activity requires the proteasome to cleave the substrate protein internally, rather than processively degrading it from one terminus. It {{has been suggested that}} long loops on these proteins' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity, while the majority of the protein remains outside. Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin/proteasome dependent processing (RUP).|$|E
5|$|Zeta Persei is the third-brightest {{star in the}} {{constellation}} at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a moving group of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, {{that may or may}} not be gravitationally bound to the other two. X Persei is a double system in this association; <b>one</b> <b>component</b> is a hot, bright star and the other is a neutron star. With an apparent magnitude of 6.72, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye even in perfectly dark conditions. The system is an X-ray source and the primary star appears to be undergoing substantial mass loss. Once thought to be a member of the Perseus OB2 Association, Omicron Persei is a multiple star system with a combined visual magnitude of 3.85. It is composed of two blue-white starsa giant of spectral class B1.5 and main sequence star of B3which orbit each other every 4.5 days and are distorted into ovoids due to their small separation. The system has a third star about which little is known. At an estimated distance of 1475 light-years from Earth, the system is now thought to lie too far from the center of the Zeta Persei group to belong to it.|$|E
