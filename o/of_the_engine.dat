5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was on the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> the mixture went into a passage through the engine block to the intake manifold on the left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor {{at the end of the}} generator/starter unit.|$|E

5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive from the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{problem with}} the power {{installation}} was that the original intention had been to fit two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> with variable-pitch propellers {{in order to provide}} reverse thrust for manoeuvring during docking. The attempt to develop these was unsuccessful, and as a short term measure one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> was fitted with a fixed-pitch reverse propeller, consequently becoming dead weight under normal flight conditions. [...] For the airship's final flight two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> were adapted to be capable of running in reverse by a simple modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camshaft.|$|R
5|$|CFMI {{tested both}} a mixed and unmixed exhaust design at the {{beginning}} of development; most variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> have an unmixed exhaust nozzle. Only the high-power CFM56-5C, designed for the Airbus A340, has a mixed-flow exhaust nozzle.|$|E

5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and two are near the rear, hot end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E

50|$|Because {{pressure}} and temperature are strongly linked, knock {{can also be}} attenuated by controlling peak combustion chamber temperatures by compression ratio reduction, exhaust gas recirculation, appropriate calibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> ignition timing schedule, and careful design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> combustion chambers and cooling system as well as controlling the initial air intake temperature.|$|R

5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses the core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning {{that there are two}} rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E
5|$|The GR1A and GR4A were {{equipped}} with TIRRS (Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System), consisting of one SLIR (Sideways Looking Infra Red) sensor {{on each side}} of the fuselage forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> intakes to capture oblique images, and a single IRLS (InfrarRed LineScan) sensor mounted on the fuselage's underside to provide vertical images. TIRRS recorded images on six S-VHS video tapes. The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod has replaced the built-in TIRRS system.|$|E

5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives to the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several engine {{failures}} in the early service of the CFM56 family which were serious enough to either ground the fleet or require aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to be redesigned. The engines have also suffered, periodically, from thrust instability events tentatively traced to Honeywell's hydromechanical unit.|$|E

Nollette wants to push testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to break mach 15, but Surnow is unwilling to risk damaging the prototype. After Keats and Nollette angrily leave, Surnow enters the facility's wind tunnel to make adjustments. However, Roland activates the tunnel's turbines, sending Surnow flying to his death.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> control units.|$|E
