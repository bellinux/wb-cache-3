I was caught out {{like a lot of}} artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Here {{is a most}} {{remarkable}} bird which is called a Nightingale!' said the Emperor. 'They say {{it is the most}} glorious thing in my kingdom. Why has no <b>one</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to me about it?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Sugihara himself {{wondered}} about official {{reaction to the}} thousands of visas he issued. Many years later, he recalled, [...] "No <b>one</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about it. I remember thinking that they probably didn't realize how many I actually issued." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in June 2017, Mali stated: [...] "no <b>one</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> bad about the way I governed the city, no one ever told me {{that some of the}} tendering were rigged or that there were some wrong investments", adding that he is not behind the demolition in Savamala. He also said that he lives of his salary (102.000 dinars or 830 euros monthly) and the money he saved „in his previous life“.|$|R
6000|$|No <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> {{and after}} a pause she went on. [...] "Edmund remarked a sort of indistinctness about the pupil, which he said {{was not a good}} sign." ...|$|E
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to this. When the factotum had {{disappeared}} {{round the corner}} of the house, Mrs. Alger turned her head' aside, and glanced downward with an air of fatigue. In this manner Barlow was dismissed from the ladies' minds.|$|E
60|$|Everybody grinned, for Blacky {{has played}} so many sharp tricks {{that no one}} is really his friend unless it is that other mischief-maker, Sammy Jay, who, you know, is Blacky's cousin. But no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> and Blacky went on.|$|E
60|$|The great {{silence of}} the forest flowed in over us, as it were; {{for quite a while}} no <b>one</b> did or <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> Then from somewhere down amidst the mosses I heard a thin voice, the sound of which {{reminded}} me of air being squeezed out of an indiarubber cushion.|$|R
60|$|A day or {{two later}} Lisle stood on Gladwyne's lawn. Gladwyne entertained freely, and though his neighbors did not approve of all of his friends, the man had the gift of pleasing, and his mother unconsciously exerted a charm on every <b>one.</b> She rarely <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> witty, but she never <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> unkind and she would listen with a ready sympathy that {{sometimes}} concealed a lack of comprehension.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2013, however, Gould {{stated in}} a new {{interview}} released {{the day of the}} premiere of the show's third season that he had [...] "come full circle" [...] and had made peace with the experience. He noted that he still hears from fans of the show on Facebook, that in nine years, no <b>one</b> has ever <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> negative to him about it, and that the fear he felt about what people would think of him was [...] "...something I drummed up in my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Brer Possum, it isn't," [...] replied Ol' Mistah Buzzard. Everybody looked surprised. You see, no {{one ever}} had heard him called {{anything}} but Buzzard. But no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> and {{after a minute or}} two Ol' Mistah Buzzard explained.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is the matter?' cried Tom. 'Have I said {{anything}} to hurt you? Has any <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to hurt you? Don't cry. Pray {{tell me what it}} is. I cannot bear to see you so distressed. Mercy on us, I never was so surprised and grieved in all my life!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it was wrong, but I {{tried to}} do right. I wasn't sure, no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought so then." ...|$|E
40|$|I’m just dumb. I had {{no doubts}} about that statement, and {{everybody}} else knew it too. Although no <b>one</b> spe-cifically <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to me about my being Black, I think my poor record reinforced my general impres-sion that Black kids just were not as smart as White ones. I shrugged, accepting the reality—that’s just {{the way things were}} supposed to be [...] I could easily have decided that life was cruel, that being Black meant everything was stacked against me. And I might have gone that way except for two things that hap-pened during fifth grade to change my perception of the whole world. (Carson & Murphey, 1990, pp. 29 - 31) It is almost impossible to conceive that these were the initial internalized beliefs of a 10 -year-old child who would grow u...|$|R
2500|$|Immanuel Kant {{connected}} {{the motif of}} Isis's veil with his concept of the sublime, saying, [...] "Perhaps no <b>one</b> has <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> more sublime, or expressed a thought more sublimely, than in that inscription on the temple of Isis (Mother Nature)." [...] According to Kant, the sublime evoked both wonder and terror, and these emotions appeared frequently {{in the works of}} late 18th and early 19th-century authors using the motif of the veil. The ecstatic nature of ancient mystery rites themselves contributed to the focus on emotions. Friedrich Schiller, for instance, wrote an essay on Egyptian and Jewish religion that mostly copied Reinhold's work, but he emphasized the emotional buildup that surrounded the mysteries. He said it prepared the initiate to confront the awe-inspiring power of nature at the climax of the rite. Similarly, a frontispiece by Henry Fuseli, made for Erasmus Darwin's poem The Temple of Nature in 1803, explicitly shows the unveiling of a statue of Isis as the climax of the initiation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{overthrow}} of the Shah of Iran in 1979 was a major setback for the policy. The Islamic regime of Iran severed relations with Israel, and its leaders such as Ruhollah Khomeini, Ali Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have repeatedly called it an [...] "illegal entity" [...] and even advocate its destruction. Even so, according to author Trita Parsi, the doctrine led to questionable attempts by Israel to establish {{good relations with the}} avowidly anti-zionist Islamic Republic of Iran after the Islamic Revolution. Parsi quotes professor David Menashri of Tel Aviv University, [...] "Israel's foremost expert on Iran," [...] as saying, [...] "Throughout the 1980s, no <b>one</b> in Israel <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about an Iranian threat—the word wasn't even uttered." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Shaw's {{other arm}} went round the child, {{and for a}} minute no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> for Polly had slipped behind his chair, that nothing should disturb the three, who were {{learning}} from misfortune how much they loved one another. Presently Mr. Shaw steadied himself and asked, [...] "Where is my other daughter, where 's my Polly?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry, {{when this}} {{paragraph}} was read--this paragraph from which {{his own name}} was carefully excluded--dashed his fist down upon the table, so that the ink leaped {{up out of the}} inkstand that stood before the lawyer, and fell in sundry blots upon the document. But no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> There was blotting-paper at hand, and Mr. Stickatit soon proceeded.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Hagar {{sat down}} upon the deck and covered {{his face with his}} hands. No <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to him,--there was nothing to say. The first to speak was Mrs. Cliff. [...] "Captain Horn," [...] said she, her voice so shaken by her emotion that she {{scarcely}} spoke above a whisper, [...] "we did everything we could, and this is what has come of it!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{hatchway}} was not open, but {{smoke was}} coming up thick and fast all around it. A half-dozen men were around a donkey-engine that stood a little forward of the hatch, and others were pulling at hose. The captain was rushing here and there, giving orders. I did not hear anything he said. No <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to us. Rectus {{asked one of the}} men something, as he ran past him, but the man did not stop to answer.|$|E
6000|$|No <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> {{more of the}} musicales, and the {{afternoon}} and evening wore away without general talk. Each seemed willing to keep apart from the rest. Dunham suffered Lydia to come on deck alone after tea, and Staniford found her there, in her usual place, when he went up some time later. He approached her at once, and said, smiling down into her face, to which the moonlight gave a pale mystery, [...] "Miss Blood, did you think I was very wicked to-day at dinner?" ...|$|E
60|$|And so the old crowd--Harvey {{felt like}} the most ancient of mariners--dropped into the old {{schooner}} among the battered dories, while Harvey slipped the stern-fast from the pier-head, and they slid her along the wharf-side with their hands. Every one wanted to say so much that no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> in particular. Harvey bade Dan take care of Uncle Salters's sea-boots and Penn's dory-anchor, and Long Jack entreated Harvey to remember his lessons in seamanship; but the jokes fell flat {{in the presence of}} the two women, and it is hard to be funny with green harbour-water widening between good friends.|$|E

60|$|Everybody {{cleared up}} after that, and said {{something}} brilliant, or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light. There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee {{were found to be}} to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried round. No <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.|$|E
60|$|It was so {{hot that}} they {{scarcely}} moved, except now to change a foot, or, again, to strike a match. Their eyes, concentrated upon the bank, were full of the same green reflections, and their lips were slightly pressed together as though the sights they were passing gave rise to thoughts, save that Hirst's lips moved intermittently as half consciously he sought rhymes for God. Whatever the thoughts of the others, no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> for a considerable space. They had grown so accustomed {{to the wall of}} trees on either side that they looked up with a start when the light suddenly widened out and the trees came to an end.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Jimmy shook himself till his quills rattled, {{and looked}} {{around to see if}} any members of the Fur section were going to call him to account for what he had said; but I noticed that he was all ready to roll himself into a ball at the first move that might be made toward him. Of course, it mixed us all up to have such talk as that right in meeting; but there wasn't any use in making a row with a fellow you couldn't hit on account of his quills, so no <b>one</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> though I noticed that Mr. Crow hopped about mighty lively, which showed how angry he was.|$|E
