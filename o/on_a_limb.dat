Hugh Paddick starred in the Joyce Rayburn farce Out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Limb</b> at the theatre in 1976, Noël Coward's Present Laughter with Donald Sinden in the lead was revived in 1981 and Patrick Cargill and Moira Lister co-starred in the farce Key for Two in 1982. Noël Coward's Blithe Spirit was revived at the theatre in 1986, and Willy Russell's play Shirley Valentine played in 1988, starring Pauline Collins. In 1990, Simon Gray's play Hidden Laughter was produced at the theatre, followed by Kander and Ebb's 1991 musical, 70, Girls, 70, starring Dora Bryan.|$|E

This is a cause of big disappointment for the 4 GR pensioners in Bakloh. Many older officers, Junior Commissioned Officers(JCOs), and men, especially those who started their regimental careers in Bakloh, are unaffected by those who grumble about Bakloh, and remain fond and attachment to Bakloh; and committed to the idea that Bakloh should have a Battalion from the Regiment to sustain the Bakloh legacy and take care of the regimental properties, remains, and the sizeable population of regiment's pensioners, and widows.|$|E
25|$|North of Dollywaggon Pike {{the ridge}} narrows and then steps up over High Crag to the plateau top of Nethermost Pike. In the other {{direction}} the high ground curves south-east around Cock Cove before a long slope falls to Grisedale Tarn at around 1,770ft (539 m). This sizeable tarn has a depth of around 110ft (34 m) and holds brown trout, perch and eels. The outflow is to Ullswater to the north east, picking {{up all of the}} rainfall from the eastern face of Dollywaggon Pike. To the west of the tarn is the unnamed col between Dollywaggon Pike and Seat Sandal and immediately to the south is Grisedale Hause, the depression between Seat Sandal and Fairfield. Thus Seat Sandal stands topographically on the ridge between the two higher fells, but so out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> that many walkers proceed directly from Dollywaggon Pike to Fairfield.|$|E

40|$|With {{the loss}} of <b>a</b> lower <b>limb,</b> amputees lack the active muscle {{empowered}} control of the ankle that is important for balance control. We examined single-leg stance on prosthesis vs. sound limb balancing on narrow ridges in transtibial amputees. When balancing on the prosthetic limb, the lateral displacement {{of the center of}} pressure was reduced and was compensated by an increase in counter-rotation. We show that single-leg stance <b>on</b> <b>a</b> prosthetic <b>limb</b> can be compared to balancing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> narrow ridge. Standing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> prosthetic <b>limb</b> involves the same balance mechanisms as balancing on narrow ridges of 40 -mm to 20 -mm width. Yet, the ability to balance <b>on</b> <b>a</b> narrow ridge with the sound <b>limb</b> was only <b>a</b> weak predictor for an amputee's ability to stand on the prosthetic limb. Balancing in single-leg stance <b>on</b> <b>a</b> prosthetic <b>limb</b> is not <b>a</b> common activity. The ability to compensate with the sound limb may therefore be functionally more important than the ability to stay in dynamic balance on the prosthetic limb. (C) 2016 IPEM.

500|$|With {{the help}} of ghostwriter Pamela Cockerill, Mills {{wrote a book about}} her {{experience}} titled Out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Limb</b> (1995), which was republished in the United States as A Single Step (2002).

Mills handed all the proceeds from the book to Adopt-A-Minefield, and stated {{that it was one of}} [...] "the few charities that 100% of their donations goes to clear minefields and survivor assistance". In 1995, Mills got engaged to British media executive Marcus Stapleton, after being together for 16 days, and was then engaged to respected documentary filmmaker Chris Terrill in 1999, after 12 days in Cambodia, where they were making a film about landmines. Mills ended their relationship five days before their planned wedding day, later telling friends in the media that she had called the wedding off because Terrill was gay, an MI6 agent, and that his mission was to sabotage her anti-landmine work. Terrill had once told Mills that he had been interviewed by the intelligence services when he was thinking of a career with the Foreign Office, but later said, [...] "I soon realised that Heather [...] had a somewhat elastic relationship with the truth, which she was able to stretch impressively sometimes". Terrill also claims that although Mills said she was a vegetarian at the time, she often cooked her speciality dish, Lancashire hotpot, which contains lamb, for him; and her former sister-in-law, Dianna Karmal, claims that Mills became a vegetarian after meeting McCartney.|$|E

500|$|Starting in November 1966, {{the band}} adopted an {{experimental}} attitude during recording sessions for the album. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, [...] "the Beatles {{were looking to}} go out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb,</b> both musically and sonically... we were utilising a lot of tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniques... limiters and... effects like flanging and ADT." [...] Their recording of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting. The sessions produced the double A-side single [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever"/"Penny Lane" [...] in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. McCartney's [...] "She's Leaving Home" [...] was an orchestral pop song. MacDonald described the track as [...] " [...] the finest work on Sgt. Pepper—imperishable popular art of its time". Based on an ink drawing by McCartney, the LP's cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt.

One night, he encountered Keith Lawler, who played guitar in another band at the time, and Lawler began drumming with Ryan. In 2002, the duo released a split single with Mr. Creosote titled [...] "Darko Filopovic", a song which would later feature as the final track on their debut album. By 2003, they had supported several more established acts, including Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Rocket from the Crypt. In 2003, {{there were reports that}} the duo's debut album, titled Is it ok to be loud, Jesus?, would be released on a label called Larry Gogan Records but this later emerged to be a joke published by a fledgling Foggy Notions. The duo's debut album was in fact published on 3 July 2003 with that same title by the independent label Out <b>On</b> <b>A</b> <b>Limb</b> Records as the label's first release, with Giveamanakick having finished recording it in January that year. It received two out of five stars in a review by RTÉ's Tom Grealis who wrote, [...] "this is what happens when rawness comes without any real sense of purpose".

500|$|In March 1955, St. Laurent tabled {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Department of Defence Production permanent. This would also extend the extraordinary powers of the Minister. [...] Fearful of another damaging confrontation between Howe and the Opposition, the Cabinet agreed that St. Laurent would guide the bill through, but after {{the first day of}} debate St. Laurent, who was prone to depression, absented himself. Tory frontbencher Donald Fleming contended that the extension could make the minister [...] "the virtual dictator of the economy". [...] With St. Laurent absent (or when present, silent), Howe took charge of the bill, and according to his biographers, Robert Bothwell and William Kilbourn, [...] "utterly failed to perceive that the bill and his manner of defending it were a godsend to the opposition". When Howe alluded to the Avro Arrow project and that he [...] "was out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> for $30 million", which gave him [...] "the shudders", the Opposition met the statement with jeers and cries of [...] "What's a million?" [...] The Tories were supported by the Social Credit MPs, while the Government gained the support of the CCF on this issue. [...] Interrupted by a lengthy governmental trip by Howe to Australia and New Zealand, the debate stretched on until midyear. In early July, Howe left town for a long weekend, after asking St. Laurent and Minister of Finance Walter Harris to maintain his stand while he was gone, although he gave Harris the authority to do as he saw fit. Without informing Howe, St. Laurent contacted Drew, and the two men agreed that the minister's powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed. The amended bill passed the Commons in Howe's absence, and when he returned, he furiously accused Harris of making a deal behind his back. However, when Howe was told that it had been the Prime Minister's decision, he accepted it. [...] Howe had earlier turned down an Opposition offer to agree to a three-year extension of his ministerial powers, saying [...] "That would mean coming back to Parliament in three years, and I've more to do with my time than amusing Parliament." [...] The extension was allowed to expire in 1959, although by then, Howe had left office.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics and viewers. Reviewers generally disliked the episode's humor, but were {{positive about the}} more serious moments. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club believed that the show's concept, which allowed only two characters and a single scene, was [...] "ambitious" [...] but that the end result was [...] "flaccid." [...] He commented that with no cut-away gags or side plots, the episode was [...] "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" [...] but was deprived of Family Guys trademark fast pace and reduced to [...] "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches." [...] Television critic Ramsey Isler of IGN added that the gross-out humor [...] "didn't work for me" [...] and found the [...] "more serious stuff" [...] in the episode {{to be the most}} entertaining. Said Isler, [...] "the addition of more dramatic themes and the elimination of the cutaway gags really showed what this show could be if Seth [...] and team put more effort in." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as being [...] "surprisingly dramatic," [...] and, [...] "had {{it not been for the}} extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad was also [...] "more than a little disturbed" [...] by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper. However, he noted, [...] "I didn't laugh much at 'Brian & Stewie', but I found myself absolutely captured by their discussion throughout the episode." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "tedious, predictably vulgar, and, by the end, sentimental." [...] Adam Rosenberg of MTV wrote, [...] "Beneath all of the more disturbing elements there's actually some very thoughtful, mature discussion of suicide and what love means amidst it all." [...] Andrew Hanson of The Los Angeles Times found the soiled diaper gag [...] "too sick to watch" [...] and [...] "the grossest" [...] moment featured in Family Guy so far, but conceded that that may have been the producer's intention. Still, Hanson described Brian's suicidal confession as [...] "deep" [...] and stated, [...] "It’s nice to see that Family Guy is still trying new things and going out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> even at episode No. 150." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number seven on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and said he [...] "loved" [...] this episode due its feature of Brian and Stewie's relationship.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an improved mobile-based telemetric dual mode sensing system to monitor pressure and moisture levels in compression bandages and dressings used for chronic wound management. The system is fabricated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 0. 2 mm thick flexible printed circuit material, and is capable of sensing pressure and moisture at two locations simultaneously within a compression bandage and wound dressing. The sensors are calibrated to sense both parameters accurately, and the data are then transmitted wirelessly to a receiver connected to a mobile device. An error-correction algorithm is developed to compensate the degradation in measurement quality due to battery power drop over time. An Android application is also implemented to automatically receive, process, and display the sensed wound parameters. The performance of the sensing system is first validated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mannequin <b>limb</b> using <b>a</b> compression bandage and wound dressings, and then tested <b>on</b> <b>a</b> healthy volunteer to acquire real-time performance parameters.
