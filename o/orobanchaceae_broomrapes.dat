25|$|Species within <b>Orobanchaceae</b> (<b>broomrapes)</b> {{are some}} of the most {{economically}} destructive species on Earth. Species of Striga (witchweeds) are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop yield loss annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Striga infects both grasses and grains, including corn, rice and Sorghum, undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. Orobanche also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots, and varieties of the genus Brassica (cabbages). Yield loss from Orobanche can reach 100%; despite extensive research, no method of control has been entirely successful.|$|E
40|$|<b>Orobanchaceae</b> (<b>broomrapes)</b> is a morphologically diverse {{family of}} {{predominantly}} herbaceous, parasitic plants. The majority of species are facultative or obligate root parasites that subsist on broad-leaf plants, thereby depleting them of nutrients, minerals and water. The taxonomy {{status of the}} family Orobanchaceae among other flowering plants is often subject of debate. They possess only a few morphological features suitable for taxonomy purposes and yet even they are quite changeable. The variability within the species is too high and hampers the attempts to create proper determination keys. During last two decades several molecular markers were used for reevaluate taxonomy, biodiversity and phylogenetic relationships within the family. Recent investigations supported by molecular taxonomy analyses have resulted in re-definition of Orobanchaceae family. According to this classification Orobanchaceae consists of 89 genera, containing 2061 species. On the Balkans the family Orobanchaceae is represented by 3 genera: Orobanche includes 25 species; Phelipanche comprises of 9 species and some putative hybrids; Diphelypaea occurs with single species, Diphelypaea boissieri, in Macedonia and Greece. Only a few recent studies based on modern methods took place during last decade. Their findings confirmed differences between Phelipanche and Orobanche genera, but raised new question about their internal structure. Several broomrape species parasitize important crops. They are widely spread in Bulgaria, Southern Europe, Russia, Middle East and Northern Africa. They cause losses in crop productivity estimated at {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars annually than affect the livelihoods of 100 million farmers. A wide variety of approaches have been explored to control broomrapes, but none have been found to be sufficiently effective and affordable. The new findings about their life cycle and the recent genomic project focused on sequences of Ph. aegyptiaca genome open new perspectives for management of the harmful broomrape species and for understanding of their biology and evolution as well...|$|E

50|$|<b>Orobanchaceae,</b> the <b>broomrapes,</b> is {{a family}} of {{parasitic}} plants of the order Lamiales, with about 90 genera and more than 2000 species. Many of these genera were formerly included in the family Scrophulariaceae sensu lato. Together they are a monophyletic group, forming a distinct family.|$|R
40|$|Germination {{of seeds}} of root parasites like <b>broomrapes</b> (<b>Orobanchaceae)</b> is tightly {{regulated}} by chemical products exuded from {{the roots of}} the host plant, known as germination stimulants (GSs). Changes in the levels of synthesis and emission of GS can allow the development of practical measures for control of the crops-harming parasitic species. However, the genes encoding enzymes responsible for GS biosynthesis are still unknown. We performed a large-scale screening of 62, 000 Arabidopsis activation-tag mutants for alteration in susceptibility to Phelipanche ramosa and to identify lines with altered GS production among them. After five successive screenings we identified 36 lines with altered susceptibility to P. ramosa. Seven of them displayed altered levels of GS production. By using a combination of Southern blot and thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR), we pinpointed the location of activation-tag constructs in these lines. A combination of differential display and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) allowed us to identify several affected genes. Two of them are directly involved in isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in chloroplasts, and we believe that their activation led to increased levels of GS production. We believe that these genes are responsible for increased GS production in five of the Arabidopsis lines resistant to P. ramosa...|$|R
