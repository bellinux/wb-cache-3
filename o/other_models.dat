5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, there are <b>other</b> <b>models</b> as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem {{implies that the}} existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic.

This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E

5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by <b>other</b> <b>models,</b> its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. <b>Other</b> <b>models</b> mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on {{how and why the}} disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and <b>other</b> <b>models</b> to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E

That model considers production as a socially constructed human project and redefines wages as means to earning a living.

The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like <b>other</b> <b>models</b> of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E

Despite {{the small number of}} E85 pump stations available, limited to the Morrisons supermarket chain stations, most automakers offer the same models in the UK that are available in the European market. In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006. Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70. <b>Other</b> <b>models</b> available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel, and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 bioethanol.|$|E
5|$|The model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines {{which did}} not fit Balmer's formula. When {{challenged}} on this by Alfred Fowler, Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and Hendrik Lorentz, {{did not like the}} trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Max Born and Arnold Sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied <b>other</b> <b>models,</b> and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but is still the best known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{have worked}} to {{understand}} these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks, which can be simulated using computers. Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than {{the details of how}} they are implemented in the brain; <b>other</b> <b>models</b> attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons. No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.|$|E

In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, {{it may be a}} nonstandard model of PA.

5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} <b>other</b> <b>models.</b> One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the levels of government, and the states have little say in federal decision making.|$|E

By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in the first year after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992.
