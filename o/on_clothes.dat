5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Plato's Closet {{purchases}} and sells used brand name children's and teenagers' brand name clothes, shoes, and paraphernalia. It focuses <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> for people ages 12 to 24. Winmark purchased Plato's Closet from Dennis and Lynn Blum, {{the founders of}} Once Upon a Child, in 1998. The store's name {{was inspired by a}} Blum son's schoolwork about Plato who had been an early advocate of recycling, which paralleled the aim to recycle used clothes. In 2011, there were over 280 franchisees in the United States and Canada. In 2010, the complete cost to start a Plato's Closet was between $200,000 and $250,000 and the average yearly sales were $825,000.|$|E

5|$|The novella {{begins with}} 5-Liu Hsing, as a child, being taught about Earth {{through the use}} of virtual reality tapes, an {{experience}} which her younger self takes exception to. She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} land related taxes, there were other taxes, such as Garden tax from {{compounds}} where, among others, plantain, coconut and arecanut palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well. Tree tax on trees such as palmyrah, margosa and iluppai and Poll tax equivalent to a personal tax from each. Professional tax was collected from members of each caste or guild and commercial taxes consisting of, among others, stamp duty <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> (clothes could not be sold privately and had to have official stamp), Taraku or levy on items of food, and Port and customs duties. Columbuthurai, which connected the Peninsula with the mainland at Poonakari with its boat services, {{was one of the}} chief port, and there were customs check posts at the sand passes of Pachilaippalai. Elephants from the southern Sinhalese kingdoms and the Vanni region were brought to Jaffna to be sold to foreign buyers. They were shipped abroad from a bay called Urukathurai, which is now called Kayts—a shortened form of Portuguese Caes dos elephantess (Bay of Elephants). Perhaps a peculiarity of Jaffna was the levy of license fee for the cremation of the dead.|$|E

25|$|Vedanta's Alumina Refinery in Lanjigarh was criticised by the Orissa State Pollution Control Board (the {{statutory}} {{environmental regulation}} body) for {{air pollution and}} water pollution in the area. According to Amnesty International, local people reported dust from the plant settling <b>on</b> <b>clothes,</b> crops and food. Vedanta officials claimed there was no dust pollution from the plant at all.

25|$|The Baroque high altar {{was created}} by Antonio Galli Bibiena and his Bolognese {{workshop}} (construction) and Martino Altomonte (1657–1745) (altarpiece). The altarpiece portrays the Healing of the Lame by St. Peter and St. John in Jerusalem. The same artist also painted the altarpiece in the side chapel of the Holy Family. The small painting of the Immaculate Conception above the high altar is by the 19th century artist Kupelwieser. The shrines in the side chapels of the Holy Family and St. Michael contain martyrs from Roman catacombs, donated by Cardinal Kollonitz in 1733. They were put <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> from this period {{and placed in the}} glass coffins.|$|E
25|$|Paramus {{is known}} for its {{multitude}} of stores and malls. It has five major indoor shopping centers, serving residents in the areas of Bergen County and Passaic County in New Jersey and Rockland County in New York. New Jersey does not levy a sales tax <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> and shoes, which makes it an attractive shopping destination for people even further away in New York City, who pay sales tax on clothing items above $110 in price, in addition to the lower standard rate of 7% in New Jersey, compared to 8.875% in New York City. The spending levels generated by the malls have made Paramus one of the top retail ZIP codes in the country.|$|E

25|$|The first {{attempts}} at developing an odor-based form of crowd control began in Israel in 2004 by Rafael. The IDF reconsidered {{at the time}} a change in its open fire procedures, and adopting other crowd dispersal methods after an Israeli demonstrator, Gil Na'amati (21), was shot during a protest over the separation barrier, near the West Bank village of Mas-ha in late 2003. It reportedly does not wash off easily and may linger <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> for up to five years. The development of Skunk followed numerous accusations against Israeli forces that they often employ disproportionate force in clashes with Palestinian protestors (e.g. using rubber bullets or tear gas), which has led them to seek new, non-lethal but effective methods of crowd control.|$|E
25|$|As {{suggested}} by its specific epithet reclusa (recluse), the brown recluse spider is rarely aggressive, and bites from the species are uncommon. In 2001, more than 2,000 brown recluse spiders {{were removed from}} a heavily infested home in Kansas, yet the four residents who had lived there for years were never harmed by the spiders, despite many encounters with them. The spider usually bites only when pressed against the skin, such as when tangled within clothes, towels, bedding, inside work gloves, etc. Many human victims report having been bitten after putting <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> {{that had not been}} worn recently, or had been left for many days undisturbed on the floor. The fangs of the brown recluse are so tiny they are unable to penetrate most fabric.|$|E
25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying <b>on</b> <b>clothes,</b> filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{cochineal}} {{was used}} for colouring fabrics. During the colonial period, {{with the introduction of}} sheep to Latin America, the use of cochineal increased, as it provided the most intense colour and it set more firmly on woolen garments than <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> made of materials of pre-Hispanic origin such as cotton or agave and yucca fibers. In general, cochineal is more successful on protein-based animal fibres (including silk) than plant-based material. Once the European market discovered the qualities of this product, the demand for it increased dramatically. By the beginning of the 17th century, it was traded internationally. Carmine became strong competition for other colourants such as madder root, kermes, Polish cochineal, Armenian cochineal, brazilwood, and Tyrian purple, as they were used for dyeing the clothes of kings, nobles, and the clergy. For the past several centuries, it was the most important insect dye used in the production of hand-woven oriental rugs, almost completely displacing lac. It was also used for painting, handicrafts, and tapestries. Cochineal-coloured wool and cotton are important materials for Mexican folk art and crafts.|$|E

The scene pans out, and has Amuro exit her home (which is near a flower bouquet stand) with her friends surprising her on her birthday. After taking selfies, Amuro and two female bake-up dancers dance to the remaining part of the chorus. Amuro runs to a dressing room and picks out a pink mini-dress. Four back-up dancers than look at several other outfits <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> rackings, and dance to the song. Amuro {{walks out of the}} dressing room in the pink mini-dress, and receives an invitation to her birthday. Two small children (one boy and one girl) walk Amuro into a small room, whilst two back-up dancers hold curtains. The curtains are pulled, and Amuro is seen behind them with balloons. The dancers and extra actors celebrate Amuro's birthday with balloons and confetti as she sings the song. Amuro and the back-up dancers perform during the last chorus, with the camera zooming out; the final scene has everyone putting their hands up, as the locations Amuro visited are circulated around a circle stage.|$|E
