5|$|In early 2001, the Workshop {{conducted}} a summative study {{about the effects}} of war, natural disasters, and other events on young children.

As a result, the Workshop developed a series of materials it believed would help children (and their families) cope with events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms <b>of</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E

50|$|Another {{explanation}} often advanced is {{the idea}} that police officers will undergo some traumatic experience in their police work that they never recover from, leading to suicide, divorce, etc. However, since the effects <b>of</b> such <b>traumatic</b> stresses is readily recognized, there are usually proactive programs in place to help individual police officers deal with the psychological effects <b>of</b> a <b>traumatic</b> event. Unfortunately, {{there is some evidence that}} such programs are actually ineffective, especially group therapies, may re-traumatize the participant, weaken coping mechanisms, and contribute to the development <b>of</b> post <b>traumatic</b> stress disorder (PTSD).|$|R

5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type <b>of</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The film depicts Hitchcock's alleged {{obsession}} with Hedren, the American model and actress he brought from relative obscurity {{to star in}} his 1963 film The Birds. Hitchcock becomes infatuated with his leading lady; when she rebuffs his advances, he subjects her to a series <b>of</b> <b>traumatic</b> experiences during the filming of The Birds. Hitchcock's {{obsession with}} Hedren continues when she stars in his next production, Marnie. Hedren grows increasingly uncomfortable with his attentions, and decides {{that she needs to}} escape the situation. However, she cannot work elsewhere because of her exclusive contract with Hitchcock; this effectively ends her Hollywood career.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} Henry {{suffered}} from syphilis has been dismissed by most historians. Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to scurvy, {{which is caused}} by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome. According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have been the result <b>of</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity. This analysis identifies growth hormone deficiency (GHD) as the source for his increased adiposity but also significant behavioural changes noted in his later years, including his multiple marriages.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{secondary}} {{exposure to the}} traumatic events disclosed by clients, therapists who work with sexual violence survivors are at risk <b>of</b> experiencing secondary <b>traumatic</b> stress. We examined whether the negative effects <b>of</b> secondary <b>traumatic</b> stress on therapist adjustment would be buffered by posttraumatic growth. Sixty-one therapists who work with sexual violence survivors completed measures <b>of</b> secondary <b>traumatic</b> stress, posttraumatic growth {{and a range of}} adjustment indicators. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that posttraumatic growth moderated the negative impact <b>of</b> secondary <b>traumatic</b> stress on therapist depression, anxiety, personal meaning and satisfaction with life. Posttraumatic growth sustained positive affect through a direct effects model only. This study provides support for the protective role of posttraumatic growth in adjustment to secondary traumatic stress...|$|R

5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results <b>of</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of {{head trauma}} {{is thought to}} be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding. It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects <b>of</b> <b>traumatic</b> brain injury; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred. People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not. They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state, and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. However, more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome.|$|E
25|$|Injuries may {{be caused}} by any {{combination}} of external forces that act physically against the body.

40|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> early <b>traumatic</b> experiences {{has been}} associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders in adulthood. This means that in clinical practice the assessment of and approach to previous traumatic events is important in patients with different mental disorders. The main purpose of this paper is, firstly, to provide a brief description and approximation of the main measurement instruments for the assessment <b>of</b> early <b>traumatic</b> experiences; and secondly to present the new self-report for the assessment <b>of</b> early <b>traumatic</b> experiences in patients with severe mental illness. The results show that most of the existing tools for assessing early traumatic experiences have little or no psychometric support and a number of instruments are designed to measure only one type of trauma, which reduces their clinical applicability. Similarly, there are few instruments that have been adapted to and validated in the Spanish population. Future studies should continue to examine the psychometric properties of this group of self-reports with the aim of improving the evaluation <b>of</b> early <b>traumatic</b> experiences in adulthood...|$|R
