[...] The most common seasons for the disease to become apparent are spring and summer and appear to affect <b>outdoor</b> <b>cats</b> the most often. The reason that <b>outdoor</b> <b>cats</b> get infected more is due to the increased exposure to ticks. Ticks are also active in spring and summer.|$|R
40|$|In {{household}} cats infections with intestinal parasites {{are important}} because of both the cat’s health and the public health as {{there can be a}} zoonotic risk. It is important to know the lifestyle of the cat, which parasites are present in the cat and which deworming regimen is applied by the cat owner. An infection with intestinal parasites may depend on these factors. One of the parasites that infects cats {{in the northern part of}} Europe, but which is perhaps less well known to veterinarians in the Netherlands, is the hookworm, Ancylostoma tubaeforme. In this study, 354 fecal samples from household cats in the Netherlands have been analyzed, using the CSF and Baermann technique for an estimation of the prevalence of A. tubaeforme and other intestinal parasites. Strongyle type eggs were cultured for determination of A. tubaeforme larvae. Because information about larval determination is lacking, the larval morphology is restricted to the genus Ancylostoma sp. and based on the larval morphology of A. caninum. Association between patent infections and the lifestyle of <b>cats</b> (indoor versus <b>outdoor</b> <b>cats),</b> infection with intestinal parasites, infection with A. tubaeforme and deworming (0 - 4 times a year versus > 4 times a year) were analyzed, using the Chi-square test. 183 participants have sent their cat’s faeces to the laboratory of the Faculty of Vetrinary Medicine at Utrecht University. In total fecal samples of 354 individual cats were analyzed, of which 191 cats were indoor cats and 147 <b>cats</b> were <b>outdoor</b> <b>cats,</b> from 16 cats data was lacking. A total of 26 cats (7, 3 %) were found positive for intestinal parasites. 9 indoor cats (4, 7 %) were found positive for intestinal parasites and 15 <b>outdoor</b> <b>cats</b> (10, 2 %) were found positive for intestinal parasites, of which one cat was found positive for A. tubaeforme (0, 3 %). <b>Outdoor</b> <b>cats</b> have a significant higher prevalence of intestinal parasites than indoor cats. The questionnaire is answered by 177 participants for 338 individual cats. From the 338 cats, 325 cats were dewormed. From the 325 dewormed cats, 237 cats are dewormed at least once a year, 88 cats were dewormed without using a deworming schedule. Significantly more <b>outdoor</b> <b>cats</b> are dewormed more than four times a year than indoor cats. Furthermore, the association between deworming and intestinal parasites is statistical analyzed and dewormed cats have a significant higher prevalence of intestinal parasites than non-dewormed cats. However, 88 % of the participating cats are dewormed more than one month ago. The recent use of the anthelmintic and the most commenly used short-acting anthelmintic Milbemax could be an explanation for the significant difference. For further research, more cats need to be sampled for more reliability of the conclusions. Research of the morphology of the larvae of A. tubaeforme is necessary for a complete determination and microscopic diagnosis with more certainty...|$|R
40|$|Outdoor cats pose {{substantial}} {{threats to}} native biodiversity, especially on islands. However, cats also provide benefits to people, such as companionship and {{the killing of}} pests. Thus, management of outdoor cats is controversial {{and can lead to}} conflicts among stakeholders. Although previous studies have examined stakeholders' preferences for outdoor cats and their management, {{little is known about the}} differences in their attitudes toward cat occurrences and management across habitats. Identifying these attitudinal differences would provide useful knowledge for policy makers about zoning management. We conducted structured interviews with residents in Amami Oshima Island, Japan, to evaluate the residents' attitudes to outdoor cats' occurrence and their management across habitats (Forest, Rural, and Town areas). Furthermore, we compared the attitudes of cat- owners and non-owners. The results show that the Forest was least preferred as an <b>outdoor</b> <b>cat</b> habitat. Lethal options as a management strategy were unacceptable to the residents, whereas adoption was acceptable in all areas. Cat-owners showed a significantly higher acceptance toward outdoor cats in Town and Rural areas than did non-owners; they also showed a lower acceptance of lethal options and a higher acceptance toward Trap, Neuter and Return (TNR) than non-owners. These findings imply that it is difficult to achieve consensus regarding <b>outdoor</b> <b>cat</b> management, especially in town and rural areas; however, outdoor cats from these areas move to the forests and pose a threat to the endangered species. Communication efforts with both cat-owners and non-owners should fill these attitudinal gaps among stakeholders and lead to effective management. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|Case summary A 2 -year-old {{domestic}} shorthair female <b>outdoor</b> <b>cat</b> living in France {{was diagnosed with}} a lungworm infection due to Eucoleus aerophilus. The history and clinical signs, in association with bronchoscopic examination, suggested chronic upper respiratory disease. Cytological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was consistent with suppurative bronchitis. Direct microscopic examination of BALF enabled the identification of E aerophilus ova. Relevance and novel information The cat was positive for feline immunodeficiency virus and had been treated with steroids for a suspected allergic bronchitis, suggesting that immunodeficiency was probably a facilitating factor for E aerophilus infection, as described in previous cases. This case report emphasises the importance of considering eucoleosis (capillariosis) in the differential diagnosis of respiratory disease in cats.

We present the second report of histoplasmosis in a cat in Europe and, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, the first case of feline histoplasmosis infection apparently limited to the skin. CASE REPORT: A 6 -year-old male castrated <b>outdoor</b> <b>cat</b> was presented to the dermatology service with a history of skin lesions evolving over 1  month and consisting of multiple papules and nodules on the head and neck. General examination was unremarkable. Cytological examination of the ulcerated nodules revealed a pyogranulomatous infiltrate, with numerous macrophages containing oval yeast-like cells, 2 - 5  μm in size, with a central, lightly basophilic core surrounded by a clear halo. A tentative diagnosis of fungal infection was made, and skin biopsy specimens were taken. Histological examination confirmed the cytology findings, and Grocott staining showed numerous organisms suggestive of Histoplasma within macrophages. Thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound and routine laboratory testing were unremarkable. Fungal culture of a nodule was negative. PCR of total DNA extracted from the infected tissue and subsequent sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of H.  capsulatum var. capsulatum. Surgical excision of the other nodules was performed, and the cat was treated with oral itraconazole 5  mg/kg once daily; 12  weeks after initial consultation, no lesions were visible. No recurrence was observed during an 8  month follow-up period.

40|$|Identifying {{stakeholder}} {{beliefs and}} attitudes {{is critical for}} resolving management conflicts. Debate over <b>outdoor</b> <b>cat</b> management {{is often described as}} a conflict between two groups, environmental advocates and animal welfare advocates, but {{little is known about the}} variables predicting differences among these critical stakeholder groups. We administered a mail survey to randomly selected stakeholders representing both of these groups (n = 1, 596) in Florida, where contention over the management of outdoor cats has been widespread. We used a structural equation model to evaluate stakeholder intention to support non-lethal management. The cognitive hierarchy model predicted that values influenced beliefs, which predicted general and specific attitudes, which in turn, influenced behavioral intentions. We posited that specific attitudes would mediate the effect of general attitudes, beliefs, and values on management support. Model fit statistics suggested that the final model fit the data well (CFI = 0. 94, RMSEA = 0. 062). The final model explained 74 % of the variance in management support, and positive attitudes toward lethal management (humaneness) had the largest direct effect on management support. Specific attitudes toward lethal management and general attitudes toward outdoor cats mediated the relationship between positive (p, 0. 05) and negative cat-related impact beliefs (p, 0. 05) and support for management. These results supported the specificity hypothesis and the use of the cognitive hierarchy to assess stakeholder intention to support non-lethal cat management.

40|$|Arthropod-borne {{infectious}} {{agents in}} the cat include Bartonella (B.) henselae, Bartonella (B.) clarridgeiae, Bartonella (B.) quintana, Anaplasma (A.) phagocytophilum and Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi. Moreover infections with Mycoplasma (M.) haemofelis, Candidatus Mycoplasma (C. M.) turicensis and Candidatus Mycoplasma (C. M.) haemominutum occur in the cat. The cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) {{is supposed to be}} the main vector for Mycoplasma spp.; moreover, transmission via blood transfusion and saliva is possible. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of M. haemofelis, C. M. turicensis, C. M. haemominutum, B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae, B. quintana, A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi in healthy and ill cats in Northeast Germany in relation to housing conditions and flea/tick exposure. 265 cats, admitted to the Small Animal Clinic, FU Berlin between 11 / 2007 and 11 / 2008, were included in the study (150 indoor, 99 outdoor access, 16 stray cats). 49 of the cats were healthy (e. g. blood donors) and 216 cats suffered from various diseases. A questionnaire provided the following data: signalment, housing environment, and previous flea/tick exposure. Serum antibody titers against A. phagocytophilum, B. henselae (Houston I, Marseille type), and B. quintana were determined by an immunofluorescence test (IFT). Conventional or real time PCR tests (EDTA blood) were used to test for A. phagocytophilum, M. haemofelis, C. M. turicensis, C. M. haemominutum, B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. Blood and buffy coat smears were prepared for each sample. Cats tested positive (positive PCR analysis or antibody titers) were examined for co-infections with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In 19 cats (7. 2 %; 10 outdoor, 5 stray, 4 indoor cats) Mycoplasma spp. DNA was detected: C. M. haemominutum (14), M. haemofelis (4) and C. M. turicensis (3); 2 cats were co-infected with C. M. haemominutum and M. haemofelis. Three of the cats were tested positive for the feline immunodeficiency virus. Two of these cats (C. M. haemominutum/M. haemofelis-coinfection; C. M. turicensis) were presented as blood donors (n= 42), these cats were not used for donation. In 12 of 19 cats (10 outdoor/ 2 indoor) fleas and/or ticks had been noted. Older cats (≥ 1 year) tested significantly more often positive (p= 0. 02 (χ 2 -test)); outdoor access cats(p= 0. 021 (χ 2 -test)) or cats with known flea infestation (p 1 : 200 for B. henselae (Houston I, Marseille type) and 46 (18. 8 %) for B. quintana. In 32 cats (8 indoor/ 24 outdoor) fleas and in 39 cats (3 indoor/ 36 outdoor) ticks had been noted. Older cats (≥ 1 year) were tested more often positive (antibody titers ≥ 1 : 200) for B. henselae (p = 0. 02 (χ 2 -test)) and for B. quintana (p = 0. 017 (χ 2 -test)). Outdoor access cats had significantly more often positive titers against B. henselae (p= 0. 001 (χ 2 -test)). There was no correlation between B. henselae titers and anamnestic flea exposure (p= 0. 53 (χ 2 -test)). Antibody titers > 1 : 64 (1 : 64 - 1 : 1024) against A. phagocytophilum were detected in 24 cats (9. 1 %), 16 outdoor and 8 indoor cats; for the indoor cats vector contact seemed unlikely. In 15 of 24 cats, all of them had outdoor access, tick and/or flea infestation was reported. There was a correlation between positive antibody titers and anamnestic tick exposure (p= 0. 018 (χ 2 -test)) or outdoor access (p= 0. 007 (χ 2 -test)), respectively. The only PCR-positive cat (0. 4 %) was presented due to obstructive urinary tract disease. Tick and/or flea infestation were not reported in this <b>outdoor</b> <b>cat.</b> In 69 cats (26 %) antibody titers ≥ 1 : 128 against B. burgdorferi were detected (35 indoor, 30 outdoor, 4 stray cats). Tick infestation was reported in 23 cats, and flea infestation in 18 cats. Neither a correlation between antibody titers and housing conditions (p= 0. 24 (χ 2 -test)) nor an anamnestic tick infestation (p= 0. 59 (χ 2 -test)) was determined. 17 cats with a positive PCR test and 118 cats with positive antibody titers were examined for co-infections with FeLV or FIV. Six cats were tested positive for FIV. Ectoparasite prophylaxis was performed in 96 cats; only 21 cats (20 outdoor access, 1 indoor cat) were treated in regular intervals. Since infections with haemotropic Mycoplasma spp. and also with arthropod-borne organisms occur in cats from the area Berlin/Brandenburg (Germany) an appropriate arthropod-control is recommended. Especially blood donors should be regularly assessed for haemotropic Mycoplasma spp. since transmission of infectious agents via transfusion is possible.

40|$|<b>Outdoor</b> <b>cats</b> {{represent}} a global threat to terrestrial vertebrate conservation, but management has been rife with conflict due {{to differences in}} views of the problem and appropriate responses to it. To evaluate these differences we conducted a survey of opinions about <b>outdoor</b> <b>cats</b> and their management with two contrasting stakeholder groups, cat colony caretakers (CCCs) and bird conservation professionals (BCPs) across the United States. Group opinions were polarized, for both normative statements (CCCs supported treating feral cats as protected wildlife and using trap neuter and release [TNR] and BCPs supported treating feral cats as pests and using euthanasia) and empirical statements. Opinions also were related to gender, age, and education, with females and older respondents being less likely than their counterparts to support treating feral cats as pests, and females being less likely than males to support euthanasia. Most CCCs held false beliefs about the impacts of feral cats on wildlife and the impacts of TNR (e. g., 9 % believed feral cats harmed bird populations, 70 % believed TNR eliminates cat colonies, and 18 % disagreed with the statement that feral cats filled the role of native predators). Only 6 % of CCCs believed feral cats carried diseases. To the extent the beliefs held by CCCs are rooted in lack of knowledge and mistrust, rather than denial of directly observable phenomenon, the conservation community can manage these conflicts more productively by bringing CCCs into the process of defining data collection methods, defining study...|$|R

5000|$|One way to {{diagnose}} C. felis is by taking blood and performing a peripheral blood smear {{to look for}} the erythrocytic piroplasms. [...] The erythrocytic piroplasms are usually shaped like signet rings and are 1 to 1.5 µm.

Another method of diagnosing infection in sick cats is to take needle aspirates of affected organs and find the schizonts inside mononuclear cells in the tissues; examination of tissue is also useful for the diagnosis after cats have died. Blood samples can be sent away for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to confirm infection. Other diseases that might resemble cytauxzoonosis should be ruled out.
