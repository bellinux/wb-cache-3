We were able to achieve an rms {{sensitivity}} of 3 - 4 mJy in only 7 seconds. The ADBS covers substantially more volume than the Spitzak & Schneider (1998) and the Zwaan et al. (1997) surveys.

We will discuss the HI sample and our efforts to quantify the completeness and reliability. This is the first survey to use synthetic sources to establish {{the relation between the}} flux, line width, and completeness of the survey. An empirical understanding of these quantities is vital to the determination of the mass function.

In this context, generation of high purity waves carrying OAM is of great significance and challenge from low frequency band to <b>optical</b> <b>area.</b> Here, a novel strategy of mode combination method is proposed to generate twisted waves with arbitrary order of OAM index. The higher order mode of a circular horn antenna is used to generate the twisted waves with quite high purity. The proposed strategy is verified with theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experiments. A circular horn antenna operating at millimeter wave band is designed, fabricated, and measured. Two twisted waves with OAM index of l=+ 1 and l=- 1 with a mode purity as high as 87 % are obtained. Compared with the other OAM antennas, the antenna proposed here owns a high antenna gain (over 12 dBi) and wide operating bandwidth (over 15 %).

This thesis presents an <b>optical</b> <b>area</b> based surface characterization technique, which applies fractal geometry and basic light scattering principles, to correlate surface roughness and fractal dimension. The unique contribution of this work is that the theory of electromagnetic scattering observed in rough surfaces and the fractal nature of the machined surfaces, are used to implement an inprocess surface quality measurement. Fractal geometry is used to describe the surface topography of the machined surface. Fractal dimension is found to be a parameter {{that can be used to}} estimate the surface roughness of machined surfaces. The surface roughness of the machined surface is estimated by analyzing the image obtained from a CCD camera. An algorithm, which calculates the fractal dimension of the image, is incorporated within the image processing software to accomplish on-line monitoring of surface roughness.
