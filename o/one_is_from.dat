5|$|Of the {{fourteen}} current first ministers, two (Rachel Notley and Kathleen Wynne) are women. Two (Bob McLeod and Peter Taptuna) are indigenous. The longest-serving first minister is Brad Wall of Saskatchewan, who {{has held the}} position since November 21, 2007; the newest first minister is John Horgan of British Columbia, who assumed office on July 18, 2017. The oldest first minister, Bob McLeod of the Northwest Territories, was born in 1952, while the youngest, Brian Gallant of New Brunswick, was born in 1982.

25|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background is polarized {{at the level of}} a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to electrostatics, in which the electric field (E-field) has a vanishing curl and the magnetic field (B-field) has a vanishing divergence. The E-modes arise naturally from Thomson scattering in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes are not produced by standard scalar type perturbations. Instead they can be created by two mechanisms: the first one is by gravitational lensing of E-modes, which has been measured by the South Pole Telescope in 2013; the second <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>from</b> gravitational waves arising from cosmic inflation. Detecting the B-modes is extremely difficult, particularly as the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the weak gravitational lensing signal mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal.|$|E
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>from</b> Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E

500|$|Bach's large choral {{composition}} {{in two parts}} on German text, written to be performed in a Lutheran service on Good Friday, {{is based on the}} Passion, as told in two chapters from the Gospel of John ( [...] and [...] ) in the translation by Martin Luther, with two short interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew (in the earliest version, <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>from</b> the Gospel of Matthew and one from the Gospel of Mark). During the vespers service, the two parts of the work were performed before and after the sermon. Part I covers the events until Peter's denial of Jesus, Part II concludes with the burial of Jesus. The Bible text is reflected in contemporary poetry and in chorales that often end a [...] "scene" [...] of the narration, similar to the way a chorale ends most Bach cantatas.

2500|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{is enhanced}} reflexivity, {{both at the}} level of individuals and {{at the level of}} institutions.

2500|$|In welding, {{equivalent}} {{carbon content}} (C.E) {{is used to}} understand how the different alloying elements affect hardness of the steel being welded. This is then directly related to hydrogen-induced cold cracking, which is the most common weld defect for steel, thus it is most commonly used to determine weldability. Higher concentrations of carbon and other alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, silicon, molybdenum, vanadium, copper, and nickel tend to increase hardness and decrease weldability. Each of these elements tends to influence the hardness and weldability of the steel to different magnitudes, however, making a method of comparison necessary to judge the difference in hardness between two alloys made of different alloying elements. There are two commonly used formulas for calculating the equivalent carbon content. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>from</b> the American Welding Society (AWS) and recommended for structural steels and the other is the formula based on the International Institute of Welding (IIW).|$|E
