2500|$|A {{few days}} after the {{military}} invasion of Iraq, O'Brien sent March 25, 2003 an explicit letter to US Catholic military chaplains, writing [...] "Given the complexity of factors involved, many of which understandably remain confidential, it is altogether appropriate for members of <b>our</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> to presume the integrity of our leadership and its judgments, and therefore to carry out their military duties in good conscience (nota : [...] "our leadership" [...] is not referring to the Pope)... It is to be hoped that all factors which have led to our intervention will eventually be made public, and... will shed helpful light upon our President's decision". Knowing to be a target for Catholic war opponents as increasingly distancing himself from the Pope's sayings and from some statements expressed at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ("A preemptive war against Iraq is an unjust war"), O'Brien wrote this letter without endorsing the motives of the war. However, it is acknowledged that the proponents of the Iraqi war cause were comforted by his positions. Nevertheless, after the war has started, his spiritual direction proved to be efficient in helping calm the doubts of soldiers, advising them that they can safely leave the responsibility for moral decision-making to the Government. On several occasions, US Army chaplains including O'Brien were asked by Catholics [...] "to call on all Catholic soldiers to leave Iraq" [...] : O'Brien gave flat refusals for discussions. O'Brien thinks that, to make Just War, the role of chaplains becomes essential to help soldiers perform their fighting duties, to ease relationships with local populations and to avoid gross misconducts (such as torturing in the Abu Ghraib prison). In such a context, O'Brien is often complaining that the paucity of priests serving in active duty in the US Army is nearing disaster.|$|E
