5|$|In Bengal, Mahalaya (Bengali: মহালয়া) {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of Durga Puja festivities. Mahalaya is the day when the goddess Durga is believed to have descended to Earth. Bengali people traditionally wake up early in the morning on Mahalaya to recite hymns from the Devi Mahatmya (Chandi) scripture. <b>Offerings</b> <b>to</b> the ancestors are made in homes and at puja mandaps (temporary shrines).|$|E
5|$|More {{is known}} about the role of Athenian {{children}} in religion than about any other aspect of their lives, and they seem to have played a prominent role in religious ceremonies. Girls made <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> Artemis on the eve of their marriage, during pregnancy, and at childbirth. Although girls and boys appear on the wine jugs connected with the early-spring festival of the Anthesteria, depictions of boys are far more common.|$|E

5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived close {{together}} in ancient Japan; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> them as to a deity.|$|E
5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is described {{to survive on}} the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad {{and a plate of}} khichdi that is offered to the goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of the}} temple.|$|E

5|$|Hell money: Hell {{money is}} a form of joss paper printed to {{resemble}} fake legal tender bank notes. The notes are not an official form of recognized currency or legal tender since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors financial problems. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The four-headed god Brahma {{should be}} shown {{seated on the}} ground in the {{foreground}} officiating as the wedding priest and making <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> the homa (sacred fire) in the kunda (fire-altar). The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial ladle and spoon) in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) in his back arms. The presence of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where the bride and groom go around the fire seven times.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{causeway}} was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to {{the eastern side of the}} pyramid, which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black basalt sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.|$|E

5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|Qimei was a practising Buddhist, and {{encouraged}} her sons to follow Buddhist teachings; embracing this faith, Zedong often accompanied her on {{visits to the}} local Buddhist temple, influencing her hopes that he would become a monk. Conversely, Yichang was largely irreligious, although after surviving an encounter with a tiger, gave <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> the gods in thanks. According to Mao's account, Yichang was a staunch disciplinarian, and would beat his children as punishment for disobedience and a perceived lack of filial piety, with Mao describing the beating he received on one occasion when he humiliated his father in public. He added that his mother would often try to protect her children from these beatings.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptians also {{interacted with}} deities through the {{donation}} of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving {{portions of the}} temple <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, {{so many of these}} statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic goddess Nirriti is {{associated}} with death, decay, bad luck, anger, and need. Hymns emphasize <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> keep her away. Like Nirriti, Dhumavati {{is associated}} with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, also an early Hindu goddess, has similarities in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dark, ugly and {{is associated with}} the crow. Jyestha is described as being unable to tolerate any auspiciousness. Also like Dhumavati, Jyestha dwells in quarrels, inauspicious places, and has a bad temper. Lakshmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka-Tantra, identifies Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and antithesis of Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of wealth, luck and beauty, and Dhumavati are described as old, carrying a broom and having a crow banner. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, need, and poverty.|$|E
5|$|The axis of {{the pyramid}} complex may be {{associated}} with a series of monuments strung out along a kilometer of desert. Along this axis are several key structures: 1) a large pyramid dedicated to his grandmother Tetisheri which contained a stele depicting Ahmose providing <b>offerings</b> <b>to</b> her; 2) a rockcut underground complex which may either have served as a token representation of an Osirian underworld or as an actual royal tomb; and 3) a terraced temple built against the high cliffs, featuring massive stone and brick terraces. These elements reflect in general a similar plan undertaken for the cenotaph of Senwosret III and in general its construction contains elements which reflect the style of both Old and Middle Kingdom pyramid complexes.|$|E
