40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine relative iron absorption from reduced iron-fortified Corn Flakes and the role <b>of</b> <b>vitamins</b> A and C improving absorption. The protocol included 87 subjects who received 4 meals composed of cereal, milk and sugar. Iron and different concentrations and combinations <b>of</b> <b>vitamins</b> A and C were added. Iron absorption was measured calculating radioactive iron incorporation into the blood of subjects. There was a significant 3. 6 -times increase in iron absorption when both vitamins were administered together. In vitro solubility tests with ferric chloride, electrolytic and reduced irons showed an important role <b>of</b> <b>vitamins</b> A and C enhancing iron solubility at pH 6 to the values found at pH 2. Addition <b>of</b> <b>vitamins</b> A and C to a ready-to-eat cereal significantly improves iron absorption by a process at least partially due, to the solubilyzing effect <b>of</b> these <b>vitamins</b> on reduced iron. Addition <b>of</b> both <b>vitamins</b> in the same meal produced an increment in absorption corresponding to the additive factor <b>of</b> each <b>vitamin.</b> © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of the various forms <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested {{that the most important}} function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism.

5|$|The {{reason that}} the set <b>of</b> <b>vitamins</b> skips {{directly}} from E to K is that the vitamins corresponding to letters F–J were either reclassified over time, discarded as false leads, or renamed because of their relationship to vitaminB, which became a complex <b>of</b> <b>vitamins.</b>|$|R

5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body.

In addition, food that contains large quantities <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E

These chapters concern fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, D, E and K) and water-soluble vitamins (B-group vitamins and vitamin C) as well.
