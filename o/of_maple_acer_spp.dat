This article compares the modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), and compression strength <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> (<b>Acer</b> <b>spp.)</b> and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and the compression strength of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) branch wood with stem wood. The mechanical tests showed that the MOE and compression strength of maple branch wood were slightly lower than those of stem wood, maple MOR was slightly higher for branch wood, and beech compression strength was similar for branch and stem wood. However, the MOR and compression strength of Scots pine branch wood were approximately one-half of those of stem wood, whereas the MOE was approxi-mately one-third. Branch wood had a higher density than corresponding stem wood, except for Scots pine. No correlation was observed between branch density and mechanical strength except for MOR...|$|E
40|$|A rare sample <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> (<b>Acer</b> <b>spp.)</b> honey from Croatia was analysed. Ultrasonic solvent {{extraction}} (USE) using: 1) pentane, 2) diethyl ether, 3) {{a mixture of}} pentane and diethyl ether (1 : 2 v/v) and 4) dichloromethane as solvents was applied. All the extracts were analysed by GC and GC/MS. The most representative extracts were 3) and 4). Syringaldehyde was the most striking compound, being dominant in the extracts 2), 3) and 4) with percentages 34. 5 %, 33. 1 % and 35. 9 %, respectively. In comparison to USE results of other single Croatian tree honey samples (Robinia pseudoacacia L. nectar honey, Salix spp. nectar and honeydew honeys, Quercus frainetto Ten. honeydew as well as Abies alba Mill. and Picea abies L. honeydew) and literature data the presence of syringaldehyde, previously identified in maple sap and syrup, can be pointed out as a distinct characteristic of the Acer spp. honey sample. Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with GC and GC/MS identified benzaldehyde (16. 5 %), trans-linalool oxide (20. 5 %) and 2 -phenylethanol (14. 9 %) as the major compounds that are common in different honey headspace compositions...|$|E
40|$|Hypoglycin A (HGA) is {{the toxic}} {{principle}} in ackee (Blighia sapida Koenig), a nutritious and readily available fruit {{which is a}} staple of the Jamaican working-class and rural population. The aril of the unripe fruit has high concentrations of HGA, the cause of Jamaican vomiting sickness, which is very often fatal. HGA is also present in the samara of several species <b>of</b> <b>maple</b> (<b>Acer</b> <b>spp.)</b> which are suspected to cause seasonal pasture myopathy in North America and equine atypical myopathy in Europe, often fatal for horses. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a method for quantifying HGA in blood that would be sensitive enough to provide toxicological evidence of ackee or maple poisoning. Analysis was carried out using solid-phase extraction (HILIC cartridges), dansyl derivatization and UHPLC-HRMS/MS detection. The method was validated in whole blood with a detection limit of 0. 35 mug/L (range: 0. 8 - 500 mug/L). This is the first method applicable in forensic toxicology for quantifying HGA in whole blood. HGA was quantified in two serum samples from horses suffering from atypical myopathy. The concentrations were 446. 9 and 87. 8 mug/L. HGA was also quantified in dried arils of unripe ackee fruit (Suriname) and seeds of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) (France). The concentrations were 7. 2 and 0. 74 mg/g respectively.

30|$|The {{northern}} {{long-eared bat}} (Myotis septentrionalis Trovessart) is a cavity-roosting species that forages in cluttered upland and riparian forests throughout the oak-dominated Appalachian and Central Hardwoods regions. Common prior to white-nose syndrome, {{the population of}} this bat species has declined to functional extirpation in some regions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, including portions of the central Appalachians. Our long-term research in the central Appalachians has shown that maternity colonies of this species form non-random assorting networks in patches of suitable trees that result from long- and short-term forest disturbance processes, and that roost loss can occur with these disturbances. Following two consecutive prescribed burns on the Fernow Experimental Forest in the central Appalachians, West Virginia, USA, in 2007 to 2008, post-fire counts of suitable black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.; the most selected species for roosting) slightly decreased by 2012. Conversely, post-fire numbers <b>of</b> suitable <b>maple</b> (<b>Acer</b> <b>spp.</b> L.), primarily red <b>maple</b> (<b>Acer</b> rubrum L.), increased {{by a factor of}} three, thereby ameliorating black locust reduction. Maternity colony network metrics such as roost degree (use) and network density for two networks in the burned compartment were similar to the single network observed in unburned forest. However, roost clustering and degree of roost centralization was greater for the networks in the burned forest area. Accordingly, the short-term effects of prescribed fire are slightly or moderately positive in impact to day-roost habitat for the northern long-eared bat in the central Appalachians from a social dynamic perspective. Listing of northern long-eared bats as federally threatened will bring increased scrutiny of immediate fire impacts from direct take as well as indirect impacts from long-term changes to roosting and foraging habitat in stands being returned to historic fire-return conditions. Unfortunately, definitive impacts will remain speculative owing to the species’ current rarity and the paucity of forest stand data that considers tree condition or that adequately tracks snags spatially and temporally.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Eutypella parasitica, a plant {{pathogenic}} fungus attacking <b>maples</b> (<b>Acer</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{was detected}} {{for the first}} time in Croatia in 2007. From 2007 to 2014, it was found only in forests, on several trees in Hum na Sutli, near Slovenian border. In 2015, the presence of Eutypella parasitica was monitored {{for the first time}} in urban areas. Materials and Methods: Within the official survey programme, 23 visual surveys were conducted and 24 samples were collected and analysed for the presence of fungi.

50|$|Based on revised {{classification}} of Champion and Seth (1968), some 13 vegetation types are represented (Bacha,1986). In general, silver fir 'Abies pindrow' and spruce 'Picea wallichian', mixed with cedar Cedrus deodar and blue pine Pinus griffithii are predominant from 2,400m to 3,000m. Notable {{is the small}} expanse of chilgoza pine Pinus geradiana in the Dachan Range.

30|$|Mixed forests {{dominated}} by oak (Quercus spp.) and pure stands of oak are widely distributed globally. However, oak forests have poor natural regeneration (Cowell et al. 2010; Galbraith and Martin 2005; McCune and Cottam 1985; Nowacki and Abrams 2008; Shotola et al. 1992). Prior researches {{have suggested that}} significant compositional changes are occurring in oak-dominated forests and Quercus spp. are being replaced by mesophytic, relatively shade-tolerant species such as <b>maple</b> (<b>Acer</b> <b>spp.)</b> (Crow 1988; Dech et al. 2008; Gardiner and Hodges 1988; Tanouchi et al. 1994; Thadami and Ashton 1995; Watt 1919). This dominance shift has significant implications for biodiversity and ecosystems function, and has become an important focus of research and management (McEwan et al. 2011). Will shade-tolerant species ultimately replace oak species and become the dominant canopy species? If this is the case, then why are oak forests still widely distributed and dominant globally? Those questions can be addressed through examining interspecific associations.|$|R

40|$|Accurately {{describing}} {{patterns of}} tree mortality {{is central to}} understanding forest dynamics and is important for both management and ecological inference. However, for many tree species, annual survival of most individuals is high, so that mortality is rare and, therefore, difficult to estimate. Furthermore, tree mortality models have potentially complex suites of covariates. Here, we extend traditional and recent approaches to modeling tree mortality and propose a new non-parametric Bayesian method. Our model is constrained to both reflect and distinguish known relationships between mortality and its two key covariates, diameter and diameter increment growth, but it remains sufficiently flexible to capture {{a wide variety of}} patterns of mortality across these covariates. Our model also allows incorporation of outside information in the form of priors, so that increased mortality of large trees can always be formally modeled even when data are sparse.

40|$|Abstract Anoplophora glabripennis and Agrilus planipennis are wood-boring bee-tles {{introduced}} from China to North America {{that are}} capable of killing healthy trees; A. glabripennis is polyphagous but attacks on <b>maples</b> (<b>Acer</b> <b>spp.)</b> are <b>of</b> major concern in North America, and A. planipennis attacks ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). Bioassays against A. glabripennis with entomopathogenic fungi identified that a strain of Metarhizium anisopliae (F 52) is virulent against adults. The pri-mary deployment method investigated is propagation of the fungus within bands of non-woven fiber material. The fungal bands are then wrapped around tree trunks or branches, where wandering adults become contaminated with spores when walking across bands. Bands retain concentrations of viable conidia above the LC 50 for> 3 months. Infections also decrease reproduction before females die, resulting in fewer offspring. A strain of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (GHA) sprayed on infested ash trees causes mortality of adult A. planipennis as they emerge from tree trunks.
