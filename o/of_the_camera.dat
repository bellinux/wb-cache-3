5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, {{but he was so}} overwhelmed by the technology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E

5|$|The {{built-in}} gyroscope {{allows for}} some image stabilization {{for the camera}} while recording video, although it still has room for improvement, since state-of-the-art image stabilization algorithms {{do not need to}} use a gyroscope, but use image processing. Other features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> are macro (for close up pictures) and faster capture including being able to take its first picture in 1.1seconds and the next half a second later.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics; many praised Krasinski and Fischer for the dramatic fight at the end. Furthermore, the reveal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> crew was commented upon by many critics. The episode was viewed by 4.19 million viewers {{and received a}} 2.0/5 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49, ranking third in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually restored, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth. New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter in the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> {{during the first half}} of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and panoramic views of Gabbar's hideout in the caves.|$|E

5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E
5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set the properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under {{the same set of}} views. An early example of {{this kind of}} camera system can be seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E

5|$|Mathematics has {{directly}} influenced {{art with}} conceptual {{tools such as}} linear perspective, the analysis of symmetry, and mathematical objects such as polyhedra and the Möbius strip. Magnus Wenninger creates colourful stellated polyhedra, originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as recursion and logical paradox {{can be seen in}} paintings by Rene Magritte and in engravings by M. C. Escher. Computer art often makes use of fractals including the Mandelbrot set, and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as cellular automata. Controversially, the artist David Hockney has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> lucida to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that Vermeer used the camera obscura in his distinctively observed paintings.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast members}} were {{recruited}} from sketch and character comedy, having previously had roles in Gavin & Stacey, Peep Show, The Thick of It and The Mighty Boosh TV series among others. Several of the writers and researchers also occasionally appeared in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> including Punt, Jenner, George Sawyer and Susie Donkin, while actors Mathew Baynton and Ben Willbond sometimes contributed to the writing. Laurence Rickard was recruited solely as a writer, but found himself part of both the senior writing staff and starring cast after creating the character of Bob Hale, whose extended, convoluted monologues proved impossible to hand over to anyone else.|$|E

The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna's playbill image into different angles. There are four other men in the booths who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de Lempicka on them. Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita Hayworth in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings. It collapses and she blows on her finger.|$|E

5|$|The seven-person {{development}} team {{started work}} on the sequel with the ideas that did not fit into the original. They also incorporated feedback from Killer Instinct players. Killer Instinct2 art, design, and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release. Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the game engine with feedback from Nintendo's Ken Lobb. Rare used compression technology to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo64 cartridge. While Killer Instinct was planned to showcase the Nintendo 64's power, the console was more limited than Rare's arcade setup, and Rare had to optimize the arcade version to run on the console. The arcade version used an animation to give the illusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> panning horizontally, but the console version used static image files with less detail. Both the arcade and console versions use the same graphic engine and character roster.|$|E
