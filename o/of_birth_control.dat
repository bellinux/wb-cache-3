5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, certain forms <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> may require further investigations. For {{women who are}} otherwise healthy, many methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|Religions {{vary widely}} in {{their views of}} the ethics <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> The Roman Catholic Church officially only accepts natural family planning, {{although}} large numbers of Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> Among Protestants {{there is a wide}} range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E
5|$|While all methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> {{have some}} {{potential}} adverse effects, {{the risk is}} {{less than that of}} pregnancy. After stopping or removing many methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control,</b> including oral contraceptives, IUDs, implants and injections, the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> are sterilization {{by means of}} vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control,</b> but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
5|$|While less {{used in the}} {{developed}} countries than the developing world, the number of women using IUDs as of 2007 was more than 180million. Avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6% of women of childbearing age, with usage as high as 20% in areas of South America. As of 2005, 12% of couples are using a male form <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> (either condoms or a vasectomy) with higher rates in {{the developed}} world. Usage of male forms <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> has decreased between 1985 and 2009. Contraceptive use among women in Sub-Saharan Africa has risen from about 5% in 1991 to about 30% in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Dozens <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> clinics opened {{across the}} United States during the 1920s, {{but not without}} incident.Robinson, Caroline Hadley (1930), Seventy Birth Control Clinics, Williams and Wilkins (70 clinics in U.S. and Britain by 1930, cited by Kennedy, p. 291). In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing {{contraceptive}} information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited {{the health of the}} mother. The trial, in which many prominent physicians served as witnesses for the defense, brought {{a large segment of the}} medical community onto the side <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> advocates.|$|E

5|$|If {{pregnancy}} {{is a high}} concern using two methods {{at the same time}} is reasonable, and two forms <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> is recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E
5|$|It is {{theorized that}} the use <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> pills should affect eating {{behaviour}} as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels. The neurotransmitter serotonin is also thought {{to play a role}} in food intake. Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size, among other things, and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church {{attained}} increasing {{political influence}} in the 1930s, and used its influence to promote censorship of movies, and to discourage publication <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> information.

5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E

5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Globally, as of 2009, {{approximately}} 60% {{of those}} who are married and able to have children use birth control. How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries. The most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization. In the developing world overall, 35% <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.|$|E
5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E
5000|$|Topiramate {{itself is}} a weak {{inhibitor}} of CYP2C19 and induces CYP3A4; a decrease in plasma levels of estrogens and digoxin has been noted during topiramate therapy. This can reduce the effectiveness <b>of</b> oral contraceptives (<b>birth</b> <b>control</b> pills); use <b>of</b> alternative <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> methods is recommended. Neither intrauterine devices (IUDs) nor Depo-Provera are affected by topiramate.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 1930s, Clarence’s {{time was}} devoted to working with {{existing}} <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> organizations, often holding overlapping executive positions.

He purchased a house outside of Boston, Massachusetts, and funded eight field workers who were nurturing the beginnings <b>of</b> community-supported <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> clinics in Montana, Tennessee, Virginia, Florida, throughout the East Coast, and in the Midwest. During this decade, Clarence and his fieldworkers were responsible for helping to establish <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> clinics in 40 cities in 14 American states.|$|R

5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control.</b> Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended. Women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.|$|E
5|$|Though {{some groups}} {{advocate}} total sexual abstinence, {{by which they}} mean the avoidance of all sexual activity, in the context <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> the term usually means abstinence from vaginal intercourse. Abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy; however, not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all sexual activity, and in many populations {{there is a significant}} risk of pregnancy from nonconsensual sex.|$|E
5|$|While {{some forms}} <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>control</b> do {{not affect the}} menstrual cycle, {{hormonal}} contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback {{and the lack of}} estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.|$|E
