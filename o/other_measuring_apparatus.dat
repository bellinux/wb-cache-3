40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} quantum nonseparability between an observed {{system and a}} <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus,</b> or multiple <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> We show that the physical meaning {{of the outcome of}} the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> obtained by weak measurement with a post-selection differs critically from that without any post-selection. In this study, the nonseparability plays the essential role, which is shown to be the same in a simultaneous conventional von Neumann-type measurement of multiple observables. From this viewpoint, we suggest a new concept, known as simultaneous readability, which is the possibility that multiple <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatuses</b> will give the proper information of the observed system simultaneously. Next, we show that different components of the spin of an electron are not simultaneously measurable even if it has EPR correlation with another electron. Comment: 14 page...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{standard}} formalism {{of quantum mechanics}} to a quantum theory for a total system including one internal <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The internality of the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> implies that different decomposition of a given density operator for the internal <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> into mixture of pure states may have different physical implications. We use `specified mixed-state description' to call a density operator with a specified decomposition into mixture of pure states. The proposed theory has three basic assumptions, which roughly speaking have the following contents: (i) Physical states of the total system {{can be associated with}} vectors in the total Hilbert space; (ii) the dynamical evolution of a state vector obeys Schrödinger equation; and (iii) under a principle of compatible description and certain non-transition condition, a pure-vector description of the total system may imply the existence of certain specified mixed-state description. The principle of compatible description states that different mathematical descriptions for the same physical state of the total system must give consistent predictions for results of measurements performed by the internal <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus.</b> This principle imposes a restriction to vectors in the Hilbert space and this may effectively break the time-reversal symmetry of Schrödinger equation.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the {{difficult}} problem of detection of pitch deviations of high-precision master gears, a new measuring instrument is developed. Detail description about <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> of pitch deviations developed for master gears was presented in the paper. Computer aided technology was used to deal with data collected by computer, and error analysis about the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> was introduced, which affected measurement accuracy. The results confirm that the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> is able to meet measurement requirement and improve efficiency through the measuring experiments on master gears of precision grade 2 and 1 with modulus 2 mm and 2. 5 mm, respectively. And the uncertainties of single pitch deviation and total cumulative pitch deviation are 0. 07 and 0. 26, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Stapp claims that, when spatial {{degrees of}} freedom are taken into account, Everett quantum {{mechanics}} is ambiguous due to a "core basis problem. " To examine an aspect of this claim I generalize the ideal measurement model to include translational {{degrees of freedom}} for both the measured system and the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Analysis of this generalized model using the Everett interpretation in the Heisenberg picture shows that it makes unambiguous predictions for the possible results of measurements and their respective probabilities. The presence of translational degrees of freedom for the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> affects the probabilities of measurement outcomes {{in the same way}} that a mixed state for the measured system would.

50|$|If {{a quantum}} {{measurement}} involves a creation aspect, {{resulting from the}} interaction of the measuring system with the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus,</b> then we are forced to accept that microscopic quantum entities, like electrons, protons, etc., are not permanently present in space, and that only at the moment they are detected by a <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus,</b> would a position for them be created. In other terms, the HMI indicates that when a quantum entity, like an electron, in a non-spatial (superposition) state is detected, it is literally “dragged” or “sucked up” into space by the detection system. And this means that our physical reality would not be contained in space, but the other way around.|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} established universal {{uncertainty principle}} revealed that two nowhere commuting observables {{can be measured}} simultaneously in some state, whereas they have no joint probability distribution in any state. Thus, one <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> can simultaneously <b>measure</b> two observables that have no simultaneous reality. In order to reconcile this discrepancy, an approach based on quantum logic is proposed to establish the relation between quantum reality and measurement. We provide a language speaking of values of observables independent of measurement based on quantum logic and we construct in this language the state-dependent notions of joint determinateness, value identity, and simultaneous measurability. This naturally provides a contextual interpretation, {{in which we can}} safely claim such a statement that one <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>measures</b> one observable in one context and simultaneously it measures another nowhere commuting observable in another incompatible context.

For a large class of periodic kicking force, constant diffusion is found in such a non-KAM system. The influence of phase shift of the kicking potential on the short-time dynamical behavior is discussed. The general asymptotical measurement-assisted diffusion rate is obtained. The entanglement between the particle and the <b>measuring</b> <b>apparatus</b> is investigated. There exist two distinct dynamical behaviors of entanglement. The bipartite entanglement grows with the kicking steps and it gains larger value for the more chaotic system.
