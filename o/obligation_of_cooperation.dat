40|$|The article {{considers}} {{whether the}} obligations of states, which have been referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) by the United Nations Security Council, {{are the same as}} the cooperation obligations of states parties to the ICC Statute. It is argued that despite the lack of clarity in the resolutions referring the situation in Darfur and in Libya to the ICC, the better view is that the obligation imposed on Sudan and Libya to 'cooperate fully' with the ICC should be regarded as an obligation to cooperate in accordance with the provisions of the ICC Statute. This means that those states are entitled to benefit from those limited provisions of the ICC Statute that permit a refusal to cooperate with the Court or permit the state to postpone the execution of a request by the Court for assistance. The article also considers the interaction between {{the obligations of}} states to cooperate with the ICC and domestic proceedings against those sought for ICC prosecution. It considers {{the extent to which the}} <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> may be suspended by an admissibility challenge and addresses whether the permission to suspend the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> may extend to a suspension of the obligation to surrender an accused person to the ICC. © Oxford University Press, 2012, All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A {{concern with}} {{ensuring}} minimum standards of dignity for all and a doctrine {{based on the}} need to secure for everyone basic levels of rights have traditionally shaped the way in which international human rights law addresses poverty. Whether this minimalist, non-relational approach befits international law objectives in the area of world poverty begs consideration. This article offers three justifications as to why global material inequality – and not just poverty – should matter to international human rights law. The article then situates requirements regarding the improvement of living conditions, a system of equitable distribution in the case of hunger, and in particular <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> international <b>cooperation,</b> within the post- 1945 international effort at people-centred development. The contextual consideration of relevant tenets serves to demonstrate that positive international human rights law can be applied beyond efforts at poverty alleviation to accommodate a doctrine of fair global distribution...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the possible legal bases for or {{the existence of}} extraterritorial socio-economic human rights obligations {{on the part of}} wealthier European ‘Destination Countries’ vis-à-vis poor migrants. In particular, the paper considers whether <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> international <b>cooperation</b> and assistance under the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) might be a basis to address socio-economic deprivation in Countries of Origin and lead to provision of social assistance extraterritorially. The paper also {{analyzes the}} socio-economic case-law under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in respect of the conditions that attach to expulsion of migrants (e. g. M. S. S. v. Belgium and Greece, Sufi and Elmi v. the UK, and S. H. H. v. the UK). The joint analysis of these documents support that wealthy States can attract responsibilities to provide protection against living in poverty in other countries, in fact, either at home or abroad. At the same time, while language and semantics on extraterritorial socio-economic protection are converging under the ICESCR and ECHR, there are also a number of questions that remain. These relate primarily to the allocation of concrete burdens to wealthy European States for the elimination/prevention of poverty in other countries and towards migrants coming from such countries, i. e. how far does the responsibility stretch...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cooperation {{between states}} is a {{principle}} laid on foundation of the entire international legal system. In order to maintain {{international peace and security}} states have the main obligation to cooperate with each other to solve any problems which may arise and at the cooperation base must stand the good faith of the states in international relations. International cooperation in criminal matters appears as a natural consequence, a particular application basis of the great principle <b>of</b> the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> states to <b>cooperation.</b> International crime is a phenomenon that has grown in recent decades and is manifest in all fields that have a wide variety of organizational forms and appropriate techniques. In the European Union, as well as in other international organizations are made efforts to combat this phenomenon. Fighting international crime, prevention and combating it is for the international community priorities {{and one of the most}} effective ways to achieve these goals is the international cooperation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of foreign {{administrative}} decisions in the Swedish legal system. In several fields of public law there exist rules and principles providing that decisions emanating from other States’ administrative bodies should be recognized in Sweden, e. g. driving licences, university degrees and product certifications. The thesis examines the function of such rules and principles {{in light of the}} balancing of the interests of the states and individuals involved. There is no general legal duty to recognize foreign administrative decisions. However, there are some general <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> international <b>cooperation</b> within the field of public law, especially under EU Law. Specific duties to recognize foreign administrative decisions are laid down in international conventions, legal instruments of the EU and Swedish legislation. Furthermore, general principles under EU Law, such as the principle of mutual recognition, may entail a duty to recognize foreign decisions in individual cases. When there is a legal duty to recognize a foreign decision, there is very little room to refuse recognition in Sweden. As a rule, there is a right of refusal only in case of manifest errors in the issuing State. The present study investigates some legal problems arising from the handling of cases involving the recognition of foreign administrative decisions, including issues concerning control by the authorities of the issuing State. The thesis puts forward a typology for rules on the recognition of foreign administrative decisions. It is concluded that rules and principles on recognition serve the function of balancing the interests <b>of</b> international <b>cooperation,</b> legal certainty and a State’s prerogatives for the determination of its domestic rules...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the interaction under LOSC of the powers of international courts and tribunals to order binding provisional measures and the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> states to {{make every effort to}} enter into provisional arrangements pending the delimitation of a maritime boundary. The importance of provisional measures or arrangements in delimiting maritime boundaries, previous state and judicial practice related to provisional arrangements and measures, and the relevant substantive and procedural rules under LOSC are all explored as a means of explaining how courts and tribunals should exercise their powers of ordering provisional measures when provisional arrangements are required. It is argued here that an international court or tribunal should exercise caution {{in order to ensure that}} the procedural mechanism complements, rather than conflicts with, the substantive obligation. To this end, provisional measures entailing recommendations, duties <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> non-aggravation are to be preferred. 38 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain. Following on from these remarks I will adumbrate an alternative account of the relation which grounds (enforceable) <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice...|$|R
40|$|Notions of {{cosmopolitan}} {{and environmental}} citizenship {{have emerged in}} response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R

40|$|In Just Health, Norman Daniels makes {{a strong}} {{argument}} for <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance {{to fulfill the}} right to health {{at the national level}} and challenges readers to develop arguments supporting <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance at the global level. In this paper, we argue that there is global responsibility for global health and that there are <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice (beyond charity) to help fulfill (not merely respect or even protect) the right to health in other countries; these we call <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice. We show how international human rights law affirms <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice - beyond national obligations and beyond <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> charity - and assert that the human rights approach provides guidance on delineating the relationship between national and global responsibility for fulfilling the core obligations that arise from socioeconomic human rights and addressing global health inequities. We further argue that new ways of providing international assistance, originating from the global HIV/AIDS response, demonstrate the feasibility of improving health outcomes through exogenous efforts and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice thus carry much weight: the weight of lives not saved. The global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic has led to {{the emergence of a new}} international health assistance paradigm, and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is, we suggest, an embryonic form of this new paradigm. We conclude that agreements on several common parameters delineating global and national responsibility for global health can advance the movement towards a global institution for the distribution of health-related goods...|$|R
