It seeks to determine what part of observed <b>outcome</b> <b>inequality</b> may be attributed to differences in observed 'circumstances', including family background, and what part is due to 'personal efforts'. We use a micro-econometric technique to simulate what the distribution of outcomes would look like if 'circumstances' were the same for everybody.

It is shown that observed circumstances are a major source of <b>outcome</b> <b>inequality</b> in Brazil, probably more so than in other countries for which information is available. Yet, the level of inequality after equalizing circumstances remains very high. While a policy aimed at equalizing opportunities - through facilitating more equal access to schooling, for instance - might therefore be successful in lowering Brazilian inequality somewhat, more ambitious targets for inequality reduction may require more direct income redistribution.

40|$|Small World {{research}} (Watts and Strogatz 1998) {{has shown}} that “rewiring ” just a few ties to be shortcuts across an otherwise clustered network structure results in a dramatic decline in the average distance between nodes but has only a modest effect {{on the degree of}} clustering. Accordingly, Small World structures seem to strike an attractive balance between two social goals: efficiency and community. But we show that the purported efficiency gains of the Small World may not be realized, even when the “contagions” being transmitted are quite “simple ” (cf., Centola and Macy 2007). The problem is that Small Worlds rely on a small number of middlemen and are thus highly stratified. We show that structural inequality in Small World graphs can lead to dramatic <b>outcome</b> <b>inequality,</b> as reflected in the returns that actors receive from exchanging information with each other. And we show that this <b>outcome</b> <b>inequality</b> characteristic of the Small World also makes such structures inefficient when: (a) actors will not transmit valuable resources without getting equal value in return; and/or (b) actors are limited in their capacities for transmission. Under these very general conditions and especially in the connected structures studied in Small World research, the efficiency gains from the Small World are “hogged ” by a small number of middlemen positioned on the shortcuts, who act as bottlenecks and thereby cause most others to do worse than in a more clustered structure. Our analysis thus demonstrates that the trade-off between efficiency and community is difficult to avoid, and the culprit is inequality. ...|$|E
30|$|What we {{consider}} here however is inequality of opportunities, which {{is distinct from}} inequality of outcomes. This distinction becomes particularly relevant in this context because while the Hirschman/Rothschild mechanism of higher inequality signaling higher potential mobility may be plausible for <b>outcome</b> <b>inequality,</b> {{it is hard to}} imagine the same holding true for inequality of opportunities. In fact, a significant fraction of the society – particularly those belonging to the disadvantaged types – would see rising inequality of opportunity as diminishing their chances of economic mobility. By this token, it can be argued that the relationship between inequality of opportunity – unlike the case of inequality of outcomes such as income or expenditure – on perceptions of life satisfaction should be negative.|$|E

30|$|There {{are certain}} {{differences}} between health equity and health inequality in theory. Equality is a value-free concept, while equity is value-based. Group inequality receives more {{attention in the}} field of social welfare, which is usually the root of social conflicts and confrontations. The objects of equality, such as income and asset, right and freedom, opportunity, well-being, or capability, are in themselves neither good nor bad; equality on one thing is likely to cause inequality in other things or in other aspects (e.g., opportunity equality may bring about <b>outcomes</b> <b>inequality).</b> The theoretical principles of equality have their pros and cons (Hayek and Hamowy 2013; Crocker 1977; Rawls 1971; Sen 1992). This study mainly considers equality among groups; the object is health, which is premised on obtaining income from work and assets, the necessity for realizing rights and liberties, and the essential qualities for obtaining basic capabilities and accomplishing certain achievements.|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} an {{extensive}} literature on intergenerational transmission of economic outcomes (education, health and income for example), many of the pathways through which these outcomes are transmitted are not as well understood. We address this deficit by analysing the relationship between socio-economic status and child outcomes in university, based on a rich and unique dataset of university students. While large socio-economic differences in academic performance exist {{at the point of}} entry into university, these differences are substantially narrowed during the period of study. Importantly, the differences across socio-economic backgrounds in university grade attainment for female students is explained by intermediating variables such as personality, risk attitudes and time preferences, and subject/college choices. However, for male students, we explain {{less than half of the}} socio-economic gradient through these same pathways. Despite the weakening socio-economic effect in grade attainment, a key finding is that large socio-economic differentials in the earnings expectations of university students persist, even when controlling for grades in addition to our rich set of controls.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} income inequality and inequality of opportunities for income acquisition in nine developed countries during the nineties. We develop a new definition of equality of opportunity and show {{how it can be}} implemented empirically. Equality of opportunity is defined as the situation where income distributions conditional on social origin cannot be ranked according to stochastic dominance criteria. Stochastic dominance is assessed using non-parametric statistical tests. We measure social origin by parental education and occupation and use national household surveys to assess inequality of income and opportunities. USA and Italy show up as the most unequal countries both in terms of outcome and opportunity. At the opposite extreme, income distributions conditional on social origin are very close in Scandinavian countries even before any redistributive policy. The analysis highlights that <b>inequality</b> of <b>outcome</b> and <b>inequality</b> of opportunity can sometimes lead to different pictures. For instance, France and Germany experience a similar level of inequality of income but the former country is much more unequal than the latter {{from the point of view}} of equality of opportunity. Differences in rankings according to <b>inequality</b> of <b>outcome</b> and <b>inequality</b> of opportunity underscore the importance of the policymaker's choice of the conception of equality to promote.

40|$|BACKGROUND Socioeconomic inequalities {{are a key}} policy challenge. Studies to date {{have not}} taken a unified {{approach}} to assess how socioeconomic inequalities in health, behaviour and educational attainment change as children age. METHODS We examined maternal education inequalities in multiple offspring health, behavioural and educational outcomes and how these changed across childhood and adolescence in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a cohort born in 1991 / 1992 in South-West England (N= 5560 – 11 463). RESULTS Inequalities were observed for some health measures (blood pressure (BP), height, cholesterol, bone mineral density (BMD) and fat-mass (females)) but not in other measures (parent-assessed child health, triglycerides, fat-mass (males), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, C reactive protein). The strongest health inequality was systolic BP (mean difference comparing highest to lowest maternal education − 0. 28 SD (95 % CI − 0. 35 to − 0. 20), approximately 2. 6 mm Hg. Wide inequalities, similar in magnitude to BP, were observed for behavioural <b>outcomes.</b> Even greater <b>inequalities</b> were observed for offspring academic achievement (mean difference comparing highest to lowest maternal education 1. 43 SD (95 % CI 1. 37 to 1. 50), a difference of 22 %). For all behavioural outcomes and some health indicators, inequality was stable over childhood. For some outcomes (BP, BMD and most education <b>outcomes),</b> <b>inequality</b> narrowed as children got older. Only for height and attainment in English tests was there evidence of widening inequalities with age. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that within this cohort, maternal education inequalities in offspring health, behaviour and educational attainment are established in childhood but do not increase up to adolescence. Maternal education inequalities in behaviour and educational attainment were considerably larger than in health measures. Laura D Howe, Debbie A Lawlor, Carol Proppe...|$|R

Micro cross sectional data were taken from PSLM (2005 - 06 Round II). The study used two main variables, circumstances and efforts. Occupation and age were the proxy of circumstance and education was the proxy of effort (independent variable). Income was the proxy of outcome (dependent variable). Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used to check the interaction between circumstance and effort variables.

The authors argue that living in a country where taxes and transfers reduce income inequality to a greater extent, the poor may feel more protected, and the rich may also feel more generous, which may result in an emotional benefit for them. It is also possible that well-being is associated not only with actual, but also with perceived inequality. The positive effect of redistribution seems to be stronger for less affluent members of the societies and left-wing oriented individuals.

40|$|When distributing an {{indivisible}} harm or benefit between multiple individuals, {{all of whom}} have an equal claim to avoid the harm or receive the benefit, it is commonly thought that one should hold a lottery in order to give each claimant an equal chance of winning. Moreover, it is often said that, by holding a lottery, one makes the resultant <b>outcome</b> <b>inequality</b> between those who receive the harm or benefit {{and those who do not}} less unfair than it would otherwise have been. The stated view – the ‘egalitarian mixed view’ – claims that the unfairness of a brute luck ex post distribution is a function of both the degree of inequality in the ex post distribution itself, and the degree of inequality in the ex ante distribution of chances from which it is derived. Versions of the view have been prominently endorsed by a number of authors, including Arneson, Broome, Diamond, Lang, Otsuka, Parfit, and Temkin. The appeal of the view is linked to its apparent promise to accommodate intuitions that have been thought to threaten views which link the fairness of an outcome either solely to the ex ante distribution or solely to the ex post distribution. I argue, to the contrary, that the egalitarian mixed view is mistaken. In particular, I argue that the distinction at the heart of the view – that between outcomes and changes to probabilities – is morally arbitrary at best and incoherent at worst. I consider possible responses to the charge and find them wanting.
