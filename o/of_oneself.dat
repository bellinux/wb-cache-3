50|$|Acquisitiveness {{describes}} the greed to increase one's possessions, to acquire, hoard and save. It can be aimed on material or immaterial fields, {{depending on the}} development of other faculties. It stands for the love <b>of</b> <b>oneself's</b> capital and is thus basically a self-centred faculty.|$|R
40|$|At present, the {{activity}} <b>of</b> justifying <b>oneself</b> is mostly discussed in psychology, {{where it is}} typically viewed as a negative or at least regrettable activity involving changing one’s attitudes, beliefs, and feelings {{in order to minimize}} psychological threats arising from cognitive dissonance. Yet there is conceptual space, even a need, for an analysis <b>of</b> justifying <b>oneself</b> that is more content-neutral in nature. In this paper I provide such an analysis. Along the way I also briefly canvass some of the empirical work on self- justification in psychology and gesture towards issues surrounding the normative significance of the practice <b>of</b> justifying <b>oneself...</b>|$|R

25|$|Egotism is {{the drive}} to {{maintain}} and enhance favorable views <b>of</b> <b>oneself,</b> and generally features an inflated opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other overestimations.|$|E

25|$|Things such as {{scientific}} tools, political institutions, and {{the conventional}} rules of morality as dictated by traditional religion {{need to be}} transcended. This is found in Henry David Thoreau's Walden; or, Life in the Woods where transcendence is achieved through immersion in nature and the distancing <b>of</b> <b>oneself</b> from society.|$|E
25|$|The shadow is a {{representation}} of the personal unconscious as a whole and usually embodies the compensating values to those held by the conscious personality. Thus, the shadow often represents one's dark side, those aspects <b>of</b> <b>oneself</b> that exist, but which one does not acknowledge or with which one does not identify.|$|E

The section started in 1983 in Southland, from 1984 throughout the country. The name of 'Pippins' was given to this age group as the Apple and Pear Marketing board (now ENZA) initially sponsored them. Also, when cut, an apple shows the Guiding Trefoil.|$|E

25|$|In this encyclical, Benedict {{reflects}} on the concepts of eros, agape, and philia, and {{their relationship with the}} teachings of Jesus. Eros and agape are two of the various Greek words for love, each of which has a slightly different shade of meaning: agape is descending, oblative love in which one gives <b>of</b> <b>oneself</b> to another; eros is ascending, possessive love which seeks to receive from another; philia is the mutual love between friends.|$|E
25|$|Locus {{of control}} {{is one of}} the four {{dimensions}} of core self-evaluations – one's fundamental appraisal <b>of</b> <b>oneself</b> – along with neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997), and since has proven {{to have the ability to}} predict several work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. In a follow-up study, Judge et al. (2002) argued the concepts of locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy and self-esteem measured the same, single factor.|$|E

25|$|Sentience (the {{ability to}} feel, perceive, or to {{experience}} subjectivity) {{is not the}} same as self-awareness (being aware <b>of</b> <b>oneself</b> as an individual). The mirror test is sometimes considered to be an operational test for self-awareness, and the handful of animals that have passed the mirror test are often considered to be self-aware. It remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image can be properly construed to imply full self-awareness, particularly given that robots are being constructed which appear to pass the test.|$|E
25|$|In Mahayana Buddhism, another {{important}} foundation for moral action is the Bodhisattva ideal. Bodhisattvas are beings which {{have chosen to}} work towards the salvation of all living beings. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, this path of great compassion is promoted as being superior {{to that of the}} Arhat because the Bodhisattva is seen as working for the benefit of all beings. A Bodhisattva is one who arouses a powerful emotion called Bodhicitta (mind of enlightenment) which is a mind which is oriented towards the awakening <b>of</b> <b>oneself</b> and all beings.|$|E
25|$|Theory of Mind {{development}} reflects {{this capacity}} for metarepresentation. Theory of Mind refers to common sense {{understanding of the}} world, which includes the understanding that people – inclusive <b>of</b> <b>oneself</b> - possess varied and changing mental states like thoughts, beliefs and desires. These mental states are the determining aspect of behaviour. Research has shown that IO pantomime use is connected to Theory of Mind development and thus, {{that the lack of}} IO pantomimes in younger children is not the result of the child’s choice or preference.|$|E
