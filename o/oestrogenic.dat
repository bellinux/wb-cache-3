50|$|CYP17A1 is {{a member}} of the {{cytochrome}} P450 superfamily of enzymes localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.

The 17α-hydroxylase activity of CYP17A1 is required for the generation of glucocorticoids such as cortisol, but both the hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities of CYP17A1 are required for the production of androgenic and <b>oestrogenic</b> sex steroids by converting 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether p-hydroxybenzoic acid, the common metabolite of parabens, possesses <b>oestrogenic</b> activity in human breast cancer cell lines. The alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (parabens) are used widely as preservatives in consumer products to which the human population is exposed and have been shown previously to possess <b>oestrogenic</b> activity and to be present in human breast tumour tissue, which is an oestrogen-responsive tissue. Recent work has shown p-hydroxybenzoic acid to give an <b>oestrogenic</b> response in the rodent uterotrophic assay. We report here that p-hydroxybenzoic acid possesses <b>oestrogenic</b> activity in a panel of assays in human breast cancer cell lines. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was able to displace [H- 3]oestradiol from cytosolic oestrogen receptor of MCF 7 human breast cancer cells by 54 % at 5 x 10 (6) -fold molar excess and by 99 % at 10 (7) -fold molar excess. It was able to increase the expression of a stably integrated oestrogen responsive reporter gene (ERE-CAT) at a concentration of 5 x 10 (- 4) M in MCF 7 cells after 24 h and 7 days, which could be inhibited by the anti-oestrogen ICI 182 780 (Faslodex, fulvestrant). Proliferation of two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF 7, ZR- 75 - 1) could be increased by 10 (- 5) M p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Following on from previous studies showing a decrease in <b>oestrogenic</b> activity of parabens with shortening of the linear alkyl chain length, this study has compared the <b>oestrogenic</b> activity of p-hydroxybenzoic acid where the alkyl grouping is no longer present with methylparaben, which has the shortest alkyl group. Intrinsic <b>oestrogenic</b> activity of p-hydroxybenzoic acid was similar to that of methylparaben in terms of relative binding to the oestrogen receptor but its <b>oestrogenic</b> activity on gene expression and cell proliferation was lower than that of methylparaben. It can be concluded that removal of the ester group from parabens does not abrogate its <b>oestrogenic</b> activity and that p-hydroxybenzoic acid can give <b>oestrogenic</b> responses in human breast cancer cells.

40|$|AimsTo assess serum {{oestrogen}} {{levels and}} <b>oestrogenic</b> activity in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes {{compared with a}} healthy control group. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study that evaluated adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (n = 38) and healthy adolescents (control group; n = 32). Serum oestrogens, urinary oestrogen metabolites and serum <b>oestrogenic</b> activity were assessed. <b>Oestrogenic</b> activity was evaluated in an in vitro cell proliferation assay using a modified E-screen assay with MCF- 7 /BUS cells. ResultsAdolescents with Type 1 diabetes had lower <b>oestrogenic</b> activity levels in both phases of the menstrual cycle compared with the control group (follicular phase: 76 vs 94 %; luteal phase: 97 vs 131 %; P < 0. 01), even after adjusting for BMI, oestradiol and oestrone levels. Postmenarcheal adolescents with Type 1 diabetes had lower oestradiol levels compared with control subjects in the follicular phase (63. 3 pmol/l vs 89. 4 pmol/l; P < 0. 01) and higher oestrone levels compared with controls in the luteal phase (196 vs 151. 9 pmol/l; P < 0. 05). ConclusionsAdolescents with Type 1 diabetes had lower levels of serum <b>oestrogenic</b> activity, and these were lower than expected based on their serum oestradiol levels.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The in vivo oestrogenicity of {{genistein}} and its glycoside genistin {{is still}} under debate. The present study aimed to develop a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model that provides insight in dose-dependent plasma concentrations of genistein aglycone and its metabolites and enables prediction of in vivo <b>oestrogenic</b> effective dose levels of genistein and genistin in humans. Experimental Approach: A PBK model for genistein and genistin in humans was developed based on in vitro metabolic parameters. The model obtained was used to translate in vitro <b>oestrogenic</b> concentration–response curves of genistein to in vivo <b>oestrogenic</b> dose–response curves for intake of genistein and genistin. Key Results: The model predicted that genistein- 7 -O-glucuronide was the major circulating metabolite and that levels of the free aglycone were generally low [0. 5 – 17 % of total plasma genistein at oral doses from 0. 01 to 50 mg (kg·bw) − 1]. The predicted in vivo benchmark dose for 5 % response values for oestrogenicity varied between 0. 06 and 4. 39 mg kg− 1 genistein. For genistin, these values were 1. 3 -fold higher. These values {{are in line with}} reported human data and show that <b>oestrogenic</b> responses can be expected at an Asian dietary and a supplementary intake, while intake resulting from a Western diet may not be effective. Conclusions and Implications: The present study shows how plasma concentrations of genistein and its metabolites and <b>oestrogenic</b> dose levels of genistein in humans can be predicted by combining in vitro oestrogenicity with PBK model-based reverse dosimetry, eliminating the need for human intervention studies...|$|E
40|$|Growth {{responses}} to oestrogen can be reproducibly obtained using {{a selection of}} oestrogen-receptor-containing human breast cancer cell lines, and molecular mechanisms {{have been shown to}} include modulation to growth factor/receptor/signalling pathways, cell-cycle proteins, apoptosis, differentiation, adhesion, motility and migration. Considerable {{progress has been made in}} understanding the molecular basis of oestrogen action on gene expression through the ligand-activated transcription factors human oestrogen receptor α (ERα) and ERβ and the resulting effects on global gene expression patterns, but the full profile of coordination of the alterations, which brings about changes in cell growth through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Oestrogen regulation of cell growth involves a complex cross-talk between oestrogen receptor and growth factor signalling pathways such that inhibition of one pathway may lead to stimulation of another, which may explain the remarkable ability of human breast cancer cells to escape from any mode of imposed growth inhibition be it oestrogen deprivation or administration of antioestrogen. Although studies on cell growth have focused to date on the effects of physiological oestrogens, many hundreds of environmental chemicals with <b>oestrogenic</b> properties have now been measured in the human breast. Whether or not the weight of evidence eventually establishes any causal link of complex mixtures of environmental <b>oestrogenic</b> chemicals with breast cancer, the presence of so many <b>oestrogenic</b> chemicals in the breast must influence resulting <b>oestrogenic</b> responses, and the impact of this additional <b>oestrogenic</b> burden needs to be taken into account in future studies on growth regulation of human breast cancer cells...|$|E

Natural and semi-synthetic 8 -prenylnaringenin showed similar bioactivities both in a yeast screen transfected with the human oestrogen receptor and in oestrogen-responsive human Ishikawa Var-I cells. 8 -Prenylnaringenin showed comparable binding activity to both oestrogen receptor isoforms (ERalpha and ERbeta). 8 -Prenylnaringenin extracted from hops contains similar amounts of both (R) - and (S) -enantiomers, indicating that the compound is normally formed non-enzymatically.

40|$|P>Since the 1970 s, {{there has}} been a {{worldwide}} scientific discussion on the potential health consequences of human exposure to endocrine disrupters: many environmentally persistent compounds are oestrogen agonists and/or androgen antagonists. Thus, they can dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis potentially affecting human puberty timing. Zearalenone (ZEA) is a non-steroidal mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species on several grains. Despite its low acute toxicity and carcinogenicity, ZEA exhibits <b>oestrogenic</b> and anabolic properties in several animal species. ZEA food contamination is caused either by direct contamination of grains, fruits and their based-products or by 'carry-over' of mycotoxins in animal tissues, milk and eggs after intake of contaminated feedstuff. In addition, zeranol (alpha-ZAL), a resorcyl lactone derived from ZEA, has been widely used in the USA as a growth promoter to improve fattening rates in cattle. From 1978 to 1984, a great epidemic of premature thelarche and precocious puberty occurred in Puerto Rico. To explain this condition, it was suggested that dairy and meat products could be contaminated with anabolic oestrogens such as ZEA or alpha-ZAL. Subsequently, worldwide other groups have also reported causative associations between <b>oestrogenic</b> mycotoxins and development of early thelarche and/or precocious puberty in exposed children. In addition to animal data, epidemiological studies strongly support the hypothesis that human pubertal development may be induced by foetal/early or prepubertal exposure to <b>oestrogenic</b> compounds. Indeed, ZEA and its metabolites are able to adopt molecular conformation, which sufficiently resembles 17 beta-oestradiol to allow it to bind to oestrogen receptors (ERs) in target cells exerting <b>oestrogenic</b> (agonist) actions. In this view, <b>oestrogenic</b> mycotoxins are suspected as triggering factor for precocious pubertal development at least in prepubertal exposed girls...|$|E

40|$|In South Africa, limited {{data are}} {{available}} regarding possible <b>oestrogenic</b> activity in the aquatic systems and especially drinking water. Water {{in the rural areas}} is often contaminated with a complex mixture of toxic compounds originating from nearby industries, agriculture and households. In these rural areas the only access to drinking water is boreholes, natural springs and rivers. Thus human exposure to environmental contaminants in drinking water is potentially high. Two rural communities near Mokopane in the Waterberg district of the Limpopo Province were selected in order to screen for <b>oestrogenic</b> activity in drinking water sources in a rural area. Eleven 1 ℓ water samples (Molekane n= 4; Sekuruwe n= 7), were collected in prepared glass bottles and extracted on a SPE C 18 cartridge and reconstituted into ethanol. The recombinant yeast oestrogen screen was used to determine the <b>oestrogenic</b> activity in the extracts. 17 β-estradiol (E 2) was used as a positive control and the results were expressed as estradiol equivalents (EEq). The EEq of the water from both the communities ranged between 0. 63 - 2. 48 x 10 - 9 g / ℓ. These concentrations are similar to other studies conducted in Korean river waters in rural and city areas and Flemish surface waters. The recombinant yeast screen confirmed <b>oestrogenic</b> activity in the drinking water samples; further investigationis necessary to determine the source of the contamination and association with impaired growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{activator}} protein 2 (AP- 2) transcription factors are essential proteins for <b>oestrogenic</b> {{repression of the}} ERBB 2 proto-oncogene in breast cancer cells. In the present study, we have examined the possible <b>oestrogenic</b> regulation of AP- 2 genes themselves in breast-tumour-derived lines. As early as 1 h after oestrogen treatment, AP- 2 gamma mRNA was markedly increased, whereas AP- 2 alpha was down-regulated, but with slower kinetics, and AP- 2 beta was not affected at all. Addition of anti-oestrogens ablated these effects. Modulation of the protein levels corresponded {{to changes in the}} transcript levels, thus suggesting that in oestrogen-treated cells, an inversion of the balance between AP- 2 alpha and AP- 2 gamma isoforms occurs. The 5 '-untranslated region (5 '-UTR) of the human AP- 2 gamma gene contains one consensus and one degenerate oestrogen-responsive element (ERE). Reporter constructs carrying the AP- 2 gamma promoter and the 5 '-UTR were up-regulated by oestrogens in transient transfection assays. Deletion of the most conserved (but not of the degenerate) ERE from reporter constructs abrogated the <b>oestrogenic</b> response, although both ERE-containing segments were footprinted in DNaseI protection assays. In vitro binding assays demonstrated the ability of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) to bind to this site, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the endogenous gene showed that ERalpha occupies this region in response to oestrogens. We conclude that AP- 2 gamma is a primary oestrogen-responsive gene and suggest that AP- 2 proteins may mediate some <b>oestrogenic</b> responses...|$|E
40|$|The <b>oestrogenic</b> and antioestrogenic {{effects of}} a new nonsteroidal {{compound}} ZK 119010 (2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -methyl- 1 -[6 -(1 -pyrrolidinyl) -hexyl]-indol- 5 -ol) were evaluated and {{compared with those of}} tamoxifen and ICI 164384. In immature mice, ZK 119010 administered once daily for 3 days (s. c.) inhibited the uterotrophic and vaginotrophic effect of oestradiol in a dose-dependent manner and was distinctly more potent than tamoxifen or ICI 164384 in exerting antioestrogenic effects. When antioestrogens in combination with oestradiol were administered once daily for 5 days to ovariectomized adult rats, ZK 119010 at lower doses (less than or equal to 1 mg/kg) was slightly less effective than tamoxifen in inhibiting the uterotrophic effect of oestradiol. At the higher doses, however, ZK 119010 was strongly antioestrogenic, and ICI 164384 was less effective than ZK 119010 or tamoxifen. ZK 119010 at 10 mg/kg, like ICI 164384 at 30 mg/kg, caused an almost complete inhibition of the oestradiol-induced uterine growth in rats. The antioestrogenic effect of tamoxifen in rats was also limited by its inherent <b>oestrogenic</b> property. The <b>oestrogenic</b> activity of ZK 119010 was much below that of tamoxifen, whereas ICI 164384 did not show oestrogenicity. The present results indicate that ZK 119010 is a novel type of non-steroidal antioestrogen which has only a marginal <b>oestrogenic</b> effect in rats and mice. Such an antioestrogen may be useful for the treatment of oestrogen-sensitive diseases in man...|$|E
