25|$|The first {{confirmed}} AZP event {{occurred in}} November 1995. Mussels harvested from Killary Harbour, Ireland were exported to The Netherlands, resulting in eight people falling ill with DSP-like symptoms of gastrointestinal illness, including nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhea, and stomach cramps. The absence of known DSP toxins <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and dinophysistoxin-2 {{led to the}} discovery and identification of a novel aeitological agent, temporarily called Killary Toxin-3 before being renamed to AZA1. Mussels collected from the same area {{five months after the}} event were shown to contain (in μg/g whole meat) AZA1 (1.14), AZA2 (0.23), and AZA3 (0.06).|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{inhibitory}} {{effects in}} phosphatases, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> has shown promise {{in the world}} of medicine for numerous potential uses. During its initial discovery, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> specifically the crude source extract, showed potent inhibition of cancer cells, and so initial interest in the family of molecules tended to center around that feature. However, it was shown that the more cytotoxic component of H. Okadai was actually a separate family of compounds, the Halichondrines, and as such research into the cytotoxicity of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> decreased. However, the unique function of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> upon cells maintained biological interest in the molecule. <b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> has been shown to have neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and embryotoxic effects. Furthermore, in two-stage carcinogenesis of mouse skin, the molecule and its relatives have been shown to have tumor promoting effects. Because of this, the effects of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> on Alzheimer's, AIDS, diabetes, and other human diseases have been studied.|$|E
50|$|<b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{a complex}} fatty acid {{polyether}} and a potent CAPP inhibitor (Hannun, 1996). <b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is mainly used as a research tool to characterize serine/threonine phosphatases, such as CAPP, through inhibition (Hannun, 1996).|$|E
50|$|To date, {{several studies}} have been {{performed}} toward the synthesis of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and its derivatives. 3 total syntheses of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> have been achieved, along with many more formal syntheses and several total syntheses of the other dinophysistoxins. The first total synthesis of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> was completed in 1986 by Isobe et al., just 5 years after the molecule's structure was elucidated. The next two were completed in 1997 and 1998 by the Forsyth and Ley groups respectively.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> (OA) and its {{relatives}} {{are known to}} strongly inhibit protein phosphatases, specifically serine/threonine phosphatases. Furthermore, of the 4 such phosphatases, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and its relatives specifically target protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and [...] protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), at {{the exclusion of the}} other two, with dissociation constants for the two proteins of 150 nM and 30 pM respectively. Because of this, this class of molecules has been used to study the action of these phosphatases in cells. Once OA binds to the phosphatase protein(s), it results in hyperphosphorylation of specific proteins within the afflicted cell, which in turn reduces control over sodium secretion and solute permeability of the cell. Affinity between <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and its derivatives and PP2A has been tested, and it was shown that the only derivative with a lower dissociation constant, and therefore higher affinity, was DTX1, which {{has been shown to be}} 1.6 times stronger. Furthermore, for the purpose of determining the toxicity of mixtures of different <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatices, inhibitory equivalency factors for the relatives of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> have been studied. In wild type PP2A, the inhibitory equivalency relative to <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> were 0.9 for DTX-1 and 0.6 for DTX-2.|$|E

50|$|<b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is formed}} from a starter unit of glycolate, found at carbons 37 and 38, and all {{subsequent}} carbons {{in the chain}} are derived from acetate. Because polyketide synthesis is similar to fatty acid synthesis, during chain extension the molecule may undergo reduction of the ketone, dehydration, and reduction of the olefin. Failure to perform one of more of these three steps, combined with several unusual reactions is what allows {{for the formation of}} the functionality of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid.</b> Carbon deletion and addition at the alpha and beta position comprise the other transformations present in the <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> C44H68O13, is a toxin {{produced}} by {{several species of}} dinoflagellates, and is known to accumulate in both marine sponges and shellfish. One of the primary causes of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is a potent inhibitor of specific protein phosphatases and {{is known to have}} a variety of negative effects on cells. A polyketide, polyether derivative of a C38 fatty acid, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and other members of its family have shined light upon many biological processes both with respect to dinoflagellete polyketide synthesis as well as the role of protein phosphatases in cell growth.|$|E
50|$|Being polyketides, the <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> {{family of}} {{molecules}} are synthesized by dinoflagellates via polyketide synthase (PKS). However unlike {{the majority of}} polyketides, the dinoflagellate group of polyketides undergo a variety of unusual modifications. <b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and its derivatives {{are some of the}} most well studied of these polyketides, and research on these molecules via isotopic labeling has helped to elucidate some of those modifications.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the toxic}} culprits of DSP, dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), named {{for one of}} the organisms implicated in its production, Dinophysis fortii, was {{compared}} to and shown to be very chemically similar to <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> several years later, and <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> itself was implicated in DSP around the same time. Since its initial discovery, reports of DSP have spread throughout the world, and are especially concentrated in Japan, South America and Europe.|$|E
50|$|Elsewhere in Japan, in 1975 Fujisawa {{pharmaceutical}} company {{observed that the}} extract of a black sponge, Halichondria okadai, was a potent cytotoxin, and was dubbed Halichondrine-A. In 1981, the structure of one such toxin, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> was determined after it was extracted from both the black sponge in Japan, Halichondria okadai, {{for which it was}} named, and a sponge in the Florida Keys, Halichondria Melanodocia. <b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> sparked research both for its cytotoxic feature and for being the first reported marine ionophore.|$|E
50|$|Ley's {{synthesis}} of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is most unlike its predecessors, although it still contains similar motifs. Like the others, this synthesis divided <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> into three components along the acyclic segments. However, designed to display new techniques developed in their group, Ley's synthesis included forming the spiroketals using (diphenylphosphineoxide)-tetrahydrofuran and (phenylsulfonyl)-tetrahydropyrans, allowing for more mild conditions. Similar to those above, {{a portion of}} the stereochemistry in the molecule was set by starting materials obtained from the chiral pool, in this case mannose.|$|E
50|$|PCP-2 mRNA is {{regulated}} by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or calcium ionophore, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> the Ras inhibitor manumycin, and orthovanadate in Jurkat T lymphoma cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> (OA) and its derivatives, the dinophysistoxins (DTX), {{are members}} of a group of {{molecules}} called polyketides. The complex structure of these molecules include multiple spiroketals, along with fused ether rings.|$|E
50|$|The main {{route of}} {{exposure}} to DSP from <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and its relatives is through the consumption of shellfish. It was initially shown that the toxic agents responsible for DSP tend to be most concentrated in the hepatopancreas, followed by the gills for certain shellfish. The symptoms for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning include intense diarrhea and severe abdominal pains, and rarely nausea and vomiting, {{and they tend to}} occur anytime between 30 minutes and at most 12 hours after consuming toxic shellfish. It has been estimated that it takes roughly 40 μg of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> to produce diarrhetic effects in adult humans.|$|E
5000|$|... α-Hydroxylation with oxaziridines {{has been}} widely {{implemented}} in total synthesis. It is a key step in both the Holton Taxol total synthesis and the Wender Taxol total synthesis. Additionally, Forsyth implemented the transformation in his synthesis of the C3-C14 (Substituted 1,7-Dioxaspiro5.5undec-3-ene) System of <b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{scientists}} wrongly classified YTXs in {{the group}} of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxins along the lines of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and azaspiracids. These type of toxins can cause extreme gastrointestinal upset and accelerate cancer growth. Once scientists realized YTXs did not have the same toxicological mechanism of action as the other toxins (protein phosphatase inhibitors), they were given their own classification.|$|E
50|$|Many fish eat {{algae and}} other organisms that contain biotoxins (defensive {{substances}} against predators). Biotoxins accumulated in fish/shellfish include brevetoxins, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> saxitoxins, ciguatoxin and domoic acid. Except for ciguatoxine, {{high levels of}} these toxins are only found in shellfish. Both domoic acid and ciguatoxine can be deadly to humans; the others will only cause diarrhea, dizzyness and a (temporary) feeling of claustrophobia.|$|E
50|$|Dinophysis is a genus of {{dinoflagellates}} {{with more}} than 200 recognised species found in coastal and oceanic waters throughout the world. Cell densities are usually negligible, but favourable conditions can result in massive blooms also known as red tides. Attention to Dinophysis greatly increased as several species of the genus were linked to the toxin including <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> responsible for the toxic syndrome diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), a gastrointestinal illness causing huge economical losses for the mussel industry, especially around Europe and Japan.|$|E
50|$|DSP and its {{symptoms}} usually set in {{within about}} half an hour of ingesting infected shellfish, and last for about one day. A recent case in France, though, with 20 people consuming oysters manifested itself after 36 hours. The causative poison is <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> which inhibits intestinal cellular de-phosphorylation. This causes the cells to become very permeable to water and causes profuse, intense diarrhea with a high risk of dehydration. As no life-threatening symptoms generally emerge from this, no fatalities from DSP have ever been recorded.|$|E
5000|$|Potential inhibitors {{include a}} variety of {{naturally}} occurring toxins including <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> a diarrhetic shellfish poison, strong tumor promoter, and microcystin. Microcystin is a liver toxin produced by blue-green algae and contains a cyclic heptapeptide structure that interacts with three distinct regions of {{the surface of the}} catalytic subunit of PP1. [...] The structure of MCLR does not change when compexed with PP1, but the catalytic subunit of PP1 does in order to avoid steric effects of Tyr 276 of PP1 and Mdha side chain of MCLR.|$|E
50|$|CAPP {{was first}} linked to {{carcinogenesis}} {{when it was}} noticed that <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> acted as a tumor promoter and it was postulated that its inhibition of CAPP may confer this property (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The α and β isoforms of the scaffold subunit of CAPP {{have been identified as}} tumor suppressor genes in skin, lung, breast and colon-derived cell lines (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B' regulatory subunit of CAPP also appears to be overexpressed in malignant melanoma, as compared to regular epidermal cells (Janssens & Goris, 2001).|$|E
50|$|Dinophysis acuminata is {{a marine}} {{plankton}} species of dinoflagellates that {{is found in}} coastal waters of the north Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The Dinophysis genus includes both phototrophic and heterotrophic species. D. acuminata {{is one of several}} phototrophic species of Dinophysis classed as toxic, as they produce <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> which can cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). Okadiac acid is taken up by shellfish and has been found in the soft tissue of mussels and the liver of flounder species. When contaminated animals are consumed, they cause severe diarrhoea. D. acuminata blooms are constant threat to and indication of diarrhoeatic shellfish poisoning outbreaks.|$|E
50|$|The first {{cases of}} diarrhetic {{shellfish}} poisoning (DSP) due to D. acuta {{were recorded in}} 1972 in Peru, but were reported to the scientific community only in 1991. It is a mildest form of seafood poisoning, indicated by severe diarrhoea. The first toxins isolated from the species were pectenotoxins (PTX-2 and PTX-11) in 2003 from specimens collected from {{the west coast of}} South Island, New Zealand, and PTX-12 independently at Skjer, Sognefjorden in Norway. In 2004, the presence of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> esters was reported. Further identification and the importance of these compounds as causal factors of DSP were discovered in 2006.|$|E

50|$|Dinophysis acuta is {{a species}} of flagellated planktons {{belonging}} to the genus Dinophysis. It {{is one of the}} few unusual photosynthetic protists that acquire plastids from algae by endosymbiosis. By forming massive blooms, particularly in late summer and spring, it causes red tides. It produces toxic substances and the red tides cause widespread infection of seafood, particularly crabs and mussels. When infected animals are consumed, severe diarrhoea occurs. The clinical symptom is called diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. The main chemical toxins were identified in 2006 as <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> and pectenotoxins. They can produce non-fatal or fatal amounts of toxins in their predators, which can become toxic to humans.|$|E
50|$|When tau {{proteins}} become hyperphosphorylated they dissociate {{from the}} microtubules {{to which they}} provide stability and are thought to polymerize into neurofibrillary tangles {{in the brain and}} contribute to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (Janssens & Goris, 2001). The B subunit of a CAPP confers the ability to dephosphorylate hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Hyperphosphorylated tau can interact with the acidic face of the B subunit and allow the catalytic subunit to dephosphorylate the protein (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Treatment of neuronal cells with <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> has been shown to cause tau neurofibrillary tangles, indicating that disruptions of the interaction between CAPP, tau and microtubules can lead to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (Janssens & Goris, 2001).|$|E
5000|$|In {{shallow water}} L. baicalensis is bark-like, {{covering}} stones somewhat like a carpet. From {{a depth of}} 3 - 4 m it starts to have branches, and can reach a height of more than 1.2 m, which is unusually large for a freshwater sponge. On rocky grounds at depths of 5 - 12 m the branching form is particularly common and may form [...] "forests". This sponge is in mutual symbiosis with a green dinoflagellate, making it green in appearance. <b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> produced by the dinoflagellate assists the sponge to survive when Lake Baikal is iced over in winter, and the water temperature is close to 0 C. It takes 1 year for it to grow 1 cm taller.|$|E
50|$|In general, CAPP {{expression}} {{is controlled by}} an autoregulatory translational mechanism and with the developmental regulation of CAPP subunits (Janssens & Goris, 2001). Ceramide is the defining activator of CAPP while other activators include theophylline and sodium selenate. Mechanisms for their modes of activation are unknown and {{more research is needed}} to explore and identify new CAPP activators. I1PP2A and I2PP2A inhibit all possible forms of CAPP by associating with the catalytic subunit using their C-terminal domains (Li, Makkinje, & Damuni, 1996). Both inhibitors are potent and non-competitive (Li et al., 1996). It is also suggested that both inhibitors are conserved between mice and humans and that both are also about the same mass (Janssens & Goris, 2001). <b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is commonly used for producing cellular models without CAPP activity (Hannun, 1996).|$|E
50|$|Ley's main {{research}} {{field are}} the total synthesis of biomolecules. His group has published extensively on this topic, and has completed {{the synthesis of}} more than 140 natural target compounds, with notable examples including indanamycin, routiennocin, avermectin B1a, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> spongistatin, thapsigargin, epothilone A, antascomicin B, bengazole A and rapamycin. His total synthesis of azadirachtin, completed in 2007, {{is widely regarded as}} one of the major landmarks in total synthesis. In the course of this work, he has also made substantial advances in many areas of organic chemistry, including the development of new catalysts, protecting groups and reagents. He is one of the inventors of TPAP, a widely employed oxidising reagent. He has also pioneered the use of immobilised reagents and flow techniques in multi-step organic synthesis. This work now incorporates flow chemistry for multistep organic synthesis applications.|$|E
50|$|Suberites are {{a global}} genus. One species, Suberites zeteki, {{is found in}} Hawaii. S. zeteki {{associates}} with many fungi. Another, S. japonicas, is native to the waters around Japan. S. aurantiacus {{is found in the}} Caribbean sea. S.carnosus lives in the India Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea and can also be found in Irish waters. S. diversicolor can be found in Indonesia. Due to Suberites’ ability to efficiently filter water, many microbes, especially fungal species, are filtered through. If these microbes escape digestion, they can deposit on the sponge and reside there indefinitely. Symbiotic bacteria produce toxins, such as <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> which defend them from colonization by parasitic annelids. Expression of various enzymes by Suberites influences the growth of their symbiotic bacteria. Suberites often live on the shells on the mollusk Hexaplex trunculus. Suberites have mechanisms of defense against predation, such as the toxic chemicals found below.|$|E
50|$|The Ozobranchus genus of leeches {{is thought}} to be the {{mechanical}} vector of the herpesvirus, transmitting the virus from one turtle to another. These leeches are common turtle ectoparasites that exclusively feed on turtle blood, and some leeches have been found carrying more than 10 million copies of the herpesvirus DNA. The green sea turtle is an herbivore and feeds primarily on seagrass and macroalgae. Two toxins which are suspected to be associated with FP are found epiphytically on these plants. First, the toxic compound lyngbyatoxin from the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscule, and second the toxin <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> - a documented tumour-promoting toxin - from the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum. Again, causality has not been concluded, but an association seems to exist between the distribution of especially the dinoflagellates and the occurrence of FP, and as they are found on weeds, they can be ingested by foraging green sea turtles.Turtles with FP are found to have a compromised immune system. They have higher phagocytic leucocyte counts (especially heterophils) compared to healthy individuals, which seems to be an effect of FP, as it is mostly evident in individuals with severe tumours. This further supports the hypothesis of the herpesvirus as a causative agent. Immunosuppression is strongly correlated with FP, but does seem to be a consequence of the development and growth of FP rather than a prerequisite, which is similar to other virus-induced tumour diseases in other species, such as Marek’s disease in poultry.|$|E
40|$|<b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{a potent}} tumor {{promoter}} on mouse skin and in rat glandular stomach, and an inhibitor of PP- 1 and PP- 2 A. How <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> biochemically induces tumor promotion in these tissues was reviewed. <b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> bound to a catalytic subunit of PP- 1 and PP- 2 A and induced hyperphosphorylation of proteins, such as vimentin, cytokeratins, HSP 27, and tumor suppressor gene products. Since one of the <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> class compounds, microcystin-LR, induced tumor promotion in rat liver, the <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> pathway mediated through inhibition of PP- 1 and PP- 2 A is seen to be a general biochemical process of tumor promotion in various organs. The biochemical mimicry of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> by TNF-a led us to find that TNF-a: is an endogenous tumor promoter.

40|$|<b>Okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{polyether}} {{compound of}} a C 38 fatty acid, isolated {{from a black}} sponge, Halichondria okadai. Previous studies showed that <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is a skin irritant and induces ornithine decarboxylase (OrnDCase; 3 -hydroxyl-L-glutamate 1 -carboxy-lyase, EC 4. 1. 1. 17) in mouse skin 4 hr after its application to the skin. This induction was strongly inhibited by pretreatment of the skin with 13 -cis-retinoic acid. A two-stage carcinogenesis experiment in mouse skin initiated by a single application of 100 micrograms of 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and followed by application of 10 micrograms of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> twice a week revealed that <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> is a potent additional tumor promoter: tumors developed in 93 % of the mice treated with DMBA and <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> by week 16. In contrast, tumors were found in only one mouse each in the groups treated with DMBA alone or <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> alone. An average of 2. 6 tumors per mouse was found in week 30 in the group treated with DMBA and <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid.</b> Unlike phorbol 12 -tetradecanoate 13 -acetate (TPA), teleocidin, and aplysiatoxin, <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> did not inhibit the specific binding of [3 H]TPA to a mouse skin particulate fraction when added up to 100 microM or activate calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) in vitro when added up to 1. 2 microM.

40|$|Specific inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases like <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> can induce {{apoptotic}} {{cell death}} in the pancreatic beta cell line HIT. Cultivation in stepwise increased concentrations of <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> enabled the isolation of HIT 100 R cells which proliferate at 100 [*]nM <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> (8 – 10 times the initially lethal concentration). These two cell lines were used to characterize the events triggered by <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> that led to apoptosis. Biochemical markers, e. g. cytochrome c release from mitochondria and increase of caspase- 3 -like activity, revealed that induction of apoptosis by 100 [*]nM <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> in parental HIT cells started {{with the release of}} cytochrome c. In HIT 100 R cells 500 [*]nM <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> were necessary to induce alterations comparable to those observed with 100 [*]nM <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid</b> in non-resistant HIT cells. In contrast to <b>okadaic</b> <b>acid,</b> the potency of the structurally different phosphatase inhibitor cantharidic acid to induce cytochrome c release, increase of caspase- 3 -like activity and DNA fragmentation was comparable in HIT and HIT 100 R cells.
