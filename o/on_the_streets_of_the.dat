5|$|By 1525, Reading was {{the largest}} town in Berkshire, and tax returns show that Reading was the 10th largest town in England when {{measured}} by taxable wealth. By 1611, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth.

5|$|In Manhattan, a {{monument}} honoring him was installed on Raoul Wallenberg Walk, named in his honor, {{across from the}} headquarters of the United Nations.

5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E

25|$|Conditions in {{the factory}} were not agreeable, however. The main problem was that several foremen and {{departmental}} heads regarded workers as still being in the army – which they were, but only in theory, since most had been officially ‘discharged’ as unfit for active service at the front. These bosses ruled the workshops under the full might of military law. One of the main clauses of that military law insisted the men should wear military uniform at all times. ‘At all times’ meant everywhere except in the home – <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, going out into Birtley itself (with appropriate military pass) and above all at work, even if that necessitated working {{for hours on end}} next to one of the furnaces operating at several hundred degrees.|$|E

500|$|When {{the columns}} neared the {{prepared}} execution site, {{the victims were}} driven some [...] from the road into the forest, where any possessions {{that had not yet}} been abandoned were seized. Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest, near the pits, where they were ordered to strip. The victims were driven into the prepared trenches, made to lie down, and shot in the head or {{the back of the neck}} by members of Jeckeln's bodyguard. Around 13,000 Jews from Riga were killed at the pits that day, along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train. On the second day of the operation, 8 December 1941, the remaining 10,000 Jews of Riga were killed in the same way. About a thousand were killed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city or on the way to the site, bringing the total deaths for the two-day extermination to 25,000 people. For his part in organising the massacre, Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section, Ostland.|$|E

500|$|The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Spanish: [...] ), {{also known}} as Chávez: Inside the Coup, is a 2003 {{documentary}} focusing on events in Venezuela leading up to and during the April 2002 coup d'état attempt, which saw President Hugo Chávez removed from office for two days. With particular emphasis on {{the role played by}} Venezuela's private media, the film examines several key incidents: the protest march and subsequent violence that provided the impetus for Chávez's ousting; the opposition's formation of an interim government headed by business leader Pedro Carmona; and the Carmona administration's collapse, which paved the way for Chávez's return. The Revolution Will Not Be Televised was directed by Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha ÓBriain. Given direct access to Chávez, the filmmakers intended to make a fly-on-the-wall biography of the president. They spent seven months filming in Venezuela, following Chávez and his staff and interviewing ordinary citizens. As the coup unfolded on 11April, Bartley and ÓBriain filmed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital, Caracas, capturing footage of protesters and the erupting violence. Later, they filmed many of the political upheavals inside Miraflores, the presidential palace.|$|E
500|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Klausenburg {{and all of}} Transylvania {{were again}} {{integrated}} into the Kingdom of Hungary. During this time, Kolozsvár was among {{the largest and most}} important cities of the kingdom and was the seat of Kolozs County. Ethnic Romanians in Transylvania suffered oppression and persecution. Their grievances found expression in the Transylvanian Memorandum, a petition sent in 1892 by the political leaders of Transylvania's Romanians to the Austro-Hungarian Emperor-King Franz Joseph. It asked for equal rights with the Hungarians and demanded an end to persecutions and attempts at Magyarisation. The Emperor forwarded the memorandum to Budapest—the Hungarian capital. [...] The authors, among them Ioan Rațiu and Iuliu Coroianu, were arrested, tried and sentenced to prison for [...] "high treason" [...] in Kolozsvár/Cluj in May 1894. During the trial, approximately 20,000 people who had come to Cluj demonstrated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city in support of the defendants. A year later, the King gave them pardon upon the advice of his Hungarian prime minister, Dezső Bánffy. In 1897, the Hungarian government decided that only Hungarian place names should be used and prohibited the use of the German or Romanian versions of the city's name on official government documents.|$|E
500|$|One Direction's second studio album, Take Me Home, was {{released}} in November 2012. Take Me Home was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub, and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction's hits [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing", spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album, {{and were able to}} shape melodies around their tones. One Direction began recording the album in May 2012, in Stockholm at Kinglet Studios. The album cover artwork features the group surrounding a traditional British K2 red telephone box, a familiar sight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK. Take Me Home garnered mixed reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while it was criticised for its generic, rushed nature. The album's lead single, [...] "Live While We're Young", released in September 2012, reached the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist in the US, peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. The album and its second single, [...] "Little Things", both debuted at number one in the UK simultaneously; something that One Direction became the youngest act in British chart history to achieve. Take Me Home sold 540,000 copies in its first week in the US, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and topped the charts in more than thirty-four other countries. Additionally, Up All Night and Take Me Home were the number three and number four best-selling albums of 2012 globally, each album selling over 5million units worldwide.|$|E
