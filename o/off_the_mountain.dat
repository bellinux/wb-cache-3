5|$|Continuing {{immediately}} after God of War II, Kratos, Gaia, {{and the other}} Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian Gods. Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood the world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him {{nothing more than a}} pawn for the Titans' revenge.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of {{the twelve}} USAF {{personnel}} lost {{on the day of}} the battle were listed first as missing in action (MIA), then later as KIA/body not recovered. Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations were conducted by both Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border. In 2002 two of the former VPA soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies of the Americans <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> after the attack as they were unable to bury them on the rocky surface.|$|E

5|$|The Eighth Army telephoned Colonel Ernest V. Holmes, Chief of Staff of the 1st Cavalry Division, {{and told}} him that the 1st Cavalry Division had {{responsibility}} for the Walled City. Holmes replied he would send a company of engineers to Ka-san. Holmes ordered Lieutenant Colonel William C. Holley, commanding officer of the 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, to report to Colonel Raymond D. Palmer, commanding the 8th Cavalry Regiment. That afternoon Palmer in his command post on the Tabu-dong road outlined to Holley and the commanding officers of D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, and E Company, 8th Cavalry, his attack plan to regain control of Ka-san. The Engineer company, commanded by First Lieutenant John T. Kennedy, was to lead the attack, E Company following. Once the force had gained the crest and E Company had established itself in defensive positions, the Engineer company was to come <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Many of the men in D Company were veteran infantrymen who had fought in World War II.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00 on August 29, the North Koreans {{attacked}} C Company again. Men on {{the left}} flank of the company position quickly abandoned their positions and soon the entire company was retreating, leaving the North Koreans in possession of the mountain again. Captain Lawrence M. Corcoran, the company commander, was left with only the 17 men in his command post, which included several wounded. All of those who stayed were later given Bronze Star Medals. After daylight on August 30, UN air strikes again came in on Battle Mountain, and US artillery, mortar, and tank fire from the valley concentrated on the North Korean-held peak. A wounded US soldier came down <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> where he had hidden for several hours while cut off from escape. He reported that {{the main body of}} the North Koreans had withdrawn to the wooded ridges west of the peak for better cover from the airstrikes, leaving only a small covering force on the mountain itself. At 11:00, B Company, which had to this point been the reserve unit, with the 3rd Battalion in support, attacked toward the heights and retook the top by 13:00. The poor defensive positions were repaired but logistical difficulties continued for the US troops at the top.|$|E

25|$|Lack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and {{climbing}} hazards {{all contribute to}} the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> is very risky. People who die during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2006, about 150 bodies had never been recovered. It {{is not uncommon to}} find corpses near the standard climbing routes.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{estimates}} of the losses incurred by the 7th and 8th Battalions of the 29th NVA Regiment included 630 dead (discovered on and around the battlefield); including many found in makeshift mortuaries within the tunnel complex. There is no count of the NVA running <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> those killed by artillery and air strikes, the wounded and dead carried into Laos or the dead buried in collapsed bunkers and tunnels.

25|$|During the summer, the Union army {{concentrated}} {{their forces}} {{to protect the}} main highways through western Virginia. Brigadier General Joseph J.

25|$|The Department of Conservation {{immediately}} issued {{hazard warnings}} and advised {{people to keep}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> thus ending the ski season. The eruption cloud disrupted air travel, occasionally closing airports and the central North Island airspace. Black sand-like ash fell on surrounding farmland and stock had to be moved. The ash also entered streams and was washed into the pen stocks and turbines of the Rangipo power station causing rapid corrosion on the turbine blades {{which had to be}} rebuilt. Episodic eruptions continued until the end of November 1995.|$|E
25|$|By midnight, Lookout Mountain was quiet. Pettus and Holtzclaw {{received}} orders at 2 a.m. {{to march}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Postwar writings of both Union and Confederate veterans {{refer to a}} brilliant moon, which slipped into the blackness of a total lunar eclipse, screening the Confederate withdrawal. That night Bragg, stunned by the defeat on Lookout Mountain, asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat from Chattanooga or to stand and fight. Hardee counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight {{it out on the}} strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the left flank of Bragg's army.|$|E
25|$|For {{the seven}} years during which Lowe owned and {{operated}} the railway, it constantly ran into hard times, eventually being sold off. A series of natural disasters ate away at the facilities, {{the first of which}} was a kitchen fire that destroyed the Echo Mountain House in 1900. Further fires and floods eventually destroyed any remaining facilities, and the railway was officially abandoned in 1938 after a flood washed most everything <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> sides. Today, the ruins of Mount Lowe Railway remain as a monument to a once-ever experienced enterprise. It was placed on the National Register of Historical Places on January 6, 1993, a listing that was enlarged in January 2015.|$|E

25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate. Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air (1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms {{of the use of}} bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summitted after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the American Civil War, Chattanooga was {{a center}} of battle. During the Chickamauga Campaign, Union {{artillery}} bombarded Chattanooga as a diversion and occupied it on September 9, 1863. Following the Battle of Chickamauga, the defeated Union Army retreated to safety in Chattanooga. On November 23, 1863, the Battles for Chattanooga began when Union forces led by future United States President and Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant reinforced troops at Chattanooga and advanced to Orchard Knob against Confederate troops besieging the city. The next day, the Battle of Lookout Mountain was fought, driving the Confederates <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> On November 25, Grant's army routed the Confederates in the Battle of Missionary Ridge. These battles were followed the next spring by the Atlanta Campaign, beginning just over the nearby state line in Georgia and moving southeastward. After the war ended, the city became a major railroad hub and industrial and manufacturing center.|$|E

Tutur Priyanto had been retrieving and escorting residents from the slopes of the mountain. After making many trips he returned for a further ascent at 15:00 to assist others to come <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> and died during one of the subsequent eruptive events. The Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency stated at 10:00 on morning of 1 November that 38 people had been killed and 69,533 evacuated since Merapi began erupting on 26 October. The victims came from the district of Sleman, Yogyakarta, where 37 people (including 25 men and 12 women), and 1 baby died.|$|E

500|$|Sangay {{developed}} in three distinct phases. Its oldest edifice, formed between 500,000 and 250,000 years ago, is evidenced today {{by a wide}} scattering of material opening to the east, defined by a crest about [...] high. This first Sangay, pockmarked by secondary ridges, {{is thought to have}} been [...] in diameter, with a summit located [...] southeast of the present summit. The curved shape of the remnants of this first structure indicates that it suffered a massive flank collapse, scattering the nearby forest lowlands with debris and causing a large part of its southern caldera wall to slide <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> forming an embayment lower on its slopes. This [...] thick block, the best preserved specimen of Sangay's early construction, consists of sequentially layered breccias, pyroclastic flows, and lahar deposits. Acidic andesites with just under 60% silicon dioxide dominate these flows, but more basic andesites can be found as well.|$|E
