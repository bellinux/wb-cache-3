40|$|Subduction zones on Earth, {{and their}} {{associated}} trenches and hinges, migrate {{with respect to}} the <b>overriding</b> plate, as indicated by <b>overriding</b> plate deformation (e. g. backarc extension or backarc shortening), and migrate with respect to hotspot and no-net-rotation reference frames (global or "absolute" reference frames). Three geodynamic models exist that attempt to explain how "absolute" trench migration velocity correlates with <b>overriding</b> plate deformation. In one model, trench and hinge migration result from lateral migration of the slab, with trench retreat causing <b>overriding</b> plate extension, and trench advance causing <b>overriding</b> plate shortening. In the second model, trench migration is forced by the <b>overriding</b> plate, with trenchward motion causing trench retreat and <b>overriding</b> plate shortening, and motion away from the trench causing trench advance and <b>overriding</b> plate extension. In the third model, the trench and subduction hinge are thought to be static, while <b>overriding</b> plate extension/shortening is accommodated by landward/trenchward <b>overriding</b> plate motion. In this paper, the conflicting geodynamic predictions made by these three models are tested by using global kinematic calculations of trench migration velocity (vT ⊥), <b>overriding</b> plate velocity (vOP ⊥) and <b>overriding</b> plate deformation in different global reference frames. The dependence between vT ⊥ and <b>overriding</b> plate deformation, as well as vOP ⊥ and <b>overriding</b> plate deformation was investigated. Correlation coefficients (R) and confidence limits were calculated using a quantitative approach with <b>overriding</b> plate deformation velocity (vOPD ⊥), using a semi-quantitative approach with an <b>overriding</b> plate strain-classification approach, and using a Spearman rank correlation approach. For the quantitative approach the correlation between vT ⊥ and vOPD ⊥ is consistently positive (R = 0. 33 - 0. 68), where trench retreat corresponds to extension, and statistically significant at 95 % confidence level for all but one reference frame. For vOP ⊥ and vOPD ⊥ the correlation is consistently negative but much less significant (R = - 0. 29 to - 0. 17) and statistically not significant at 95 % confidence level for all reference frames. These findings indicate that trench migration results predominantly from lateral migration of the slab rather than from <b>overriding</b> plate motion. Such lateral slab migration is most likely driven by the negative buoyancy force of the slab itself, as demonstrated by geodynamic models...|$|R
40|$|Active {{convergent}} {{margins are}} primarily {{shaped by the}} interplay among the subducting plate, <b>overriding</b> plate, and mantle. The effect of important forces, like far-field mantle flow, <b>overriding</b> plate motion, and inter-plate coupling, however, remains partially ambiguous. In a preliminary attempt to clarify their role, a self-consistent, viscoelastic, plane-strain, mechanical finite element model, in which subducting plate, <b>overriding</b> plate and mantle interact dynamically, is developed. In this quasi-static framework with a freely moving slab, trench, and inter-plate fault, {{the role of a}} compressive <b>overriding</b> plate on subduction zone kinematics, morphology and stress-state is characterized. A slab interacting solely with a semi-analytical three-dimensional mantle flow formulation shows that local non-induced mantle flow influences slab geometry and kinematics, adding an important dynamic term to the system. The impact of an <b>overriding</b> plate on this system is determined completely by <b>overriding</b> plate trench-ward motions and is only pertinent if the <b>overriding</b> plate actively advances the trench. A trench-ward moving <b>overriding</b> plate indents the slab and thereby enforces trench retreat and decreases slab dip. It also stimulates over-thrusting of the <b>overriding</b> plate onto the slab, and thereby permits mountain building within the <b>overriding</b> plate. Frictional resistance is observed to have a dominant local effect within the <b>overriding</b> plate as it is increasingly dragged down, thereby inhibiting the growth of <b>overriding</b> plate topography. A distinguishable effect on large-scale trench motions and deep slab dip is, however, absent for re-normalized friction coefficients ranging up to about 0. 2. Minor additional effects include a decrease in plate motions of about 15 % and slab bending stresses of about 10 %...|$|R

5|$|During the state's early history, vetoes were seldom {{employed}} by governors primarily {{because they were}} seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could <b>override</b> them with only a simple majority. Governor James Whitcomb {{was the first to}} make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session. Roger Branigin, who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly. Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden. Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to <b>override</b> his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{models of}} {{subduction}} and continental collision {{are used to}} predict dynamic topography changes on the <b>overriding</b> plate. The modelling results show a distinct evolution of topography on the <b>overriding</b> plate, during subduction, continental collision and slab break-off. A prominent topographic feature is a temporary (few Myrs) basin on the <b>overriding</b> plate after initial collision. This "collisional mantle dynamic basin" (CMDB) is caused by slab steepening drawing, material away {{from the base of}} the <b>overriding</b> plate. Also, during this initial collision phase, surface uplift is predicted on the <b>overriding</b> plate between the suture zone and the CMDB, due to the subduction of buoyant continental material and its isostatic compensation. After slab detachment, redistribution of stresses and underplating of the <b>overriding</b> plate cause the uplift to spread further into the <b>overriding</b> plate. This topographic evolution fits the stratigraphy found on the <b>overriding</b> plate of the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone in Iran and south east Turkey. The sedimentary record from the <b>overriding</b> plate contains Upper Oligocene-Lower Miocene marine carbonates deposited between terrestrial clastic sedimentary rocks, in units such as the Qom Formation and its lateral equivalents. This stratigraphy shows that during the Late Oligocene–Early Miocene the surface of the <b>overriding</b> plate sank below sea level before rising back above sea level, without major compressional deformation recorded in the same area. Our modelled topography changes fit well with this observed uplift and subsidence...|$|R
40|$|Mountain {{building}} above subduction zones, such as {{observed in}} the Andes, is enigmatic, and the key parameter controlling the underlying dynamics remains a matter of considerable debate. A global survey of subduction zones is presented here, illustrating the correlation between <b>overriding</b> plate deformation rate and twelve physical parameters: <b>overriding</b> plate velocity, subducting plate velocity, trench velocity, convergence velocity, subduction velocity, subduction zone accretion rate, subducting plate age, subduction polarity, shallow slab dip, deep slab dip, lateral slab edge proximity, and subducting ridge proximity. All correlation coefficients are low (R ≤ 0. 39), irrespective of the global reference frame, relative plate motion model, or <b>overriding</b> plate deformation model, except for the trench velocity (0. 33 - 0. 68, exact value depends on adopted global reference frame) and subduction velocity, which shows an anticorrelation (0. 55 - 0. 57). This implies that no individual parameter can explain <b>overriding</b> plate deformation, except that trench retreat generally corresponds to extension while an approximately stable trench or trench advance generally corresponds to shortening. Understanding {{of the variety of}} strain patterns is obtained when slab edge proximity and <b>overriding</b> plate velocity are combined. Orogenesis occurs in <b>overriding</b> plates bordering central regions of wide subduction zones (≥∼ 4000 km) when the <b>overriding</b> plate is moving trenchward at 0 - 2 cm/yr (e. g., Andes, Japan). Because the center of a wide slab offers large resistance to lateral migration, the <b>overriding</b> plate effectively collides with the subduction hinge, forcing the slab to attain a shallow dip angle (e. g., Nazca and Japan slabs). <b>Overriding</b> plate extension is only found close to lateral slab edges or during <b>overriding</b> plate motion away from the center of a wide subduction zone, but in the latter scenario, maximum extension velocities are much lower than in the former scenario. For subduction settings close to lateral slab edges, <b>overriding</b> plate motion plays no significant role in <b>overriding</b> plate deformation. Thus, for rapid <b>overriding</b> plate extension, the key ingredient is rapid trench retreat, which only occurs close to lateral slab edges, while for <b>overriding</b> plate shortening, the key ingredients are (1) the resistance to rapid trench and hinge retreat, which occurs far from lateral slab edges, and (2) trenchward <b>overriding</b> plate motion...|$|R
5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to <b>override</b> Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related.

Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to <b>override</b> Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs.

40|$|We present fully dynamic generic {{three-dimensional}} laboratory {{models of}} progressive subduction with an <b>overriding</b> plate and a weak subduction zone interface. <b>Overriding</b> plate thickness (TOP) is varied systematically (in the range 0 - 2. 5 cm scaling to 0 - 125 km) to investigate {{its effect on}} subduction kinematics and <b>overriding</b> plate deformation. The general pattern of subduction {{is the same for}} all models with slab draping on the 670 kmdiscontinuity, comparable slab dip angles, trench retreat, trenchward subducting platemotion, and a concave trench curvature. The narrow slab models only show <b>overriding</b> plate extension. Subduction partitioning (νSP⊥ / (νSP⊥ + νT⊥)) increases with increasing TOP, where trenchward subducting plate motion (νSP⊥) increases at the expense of trench retreat (νT⊥). This results from an increase in trench suction force with increasing TOP, which retards trench retreat. An increase in TOP also corresponds to a decrease in <b>overriding</b> plate extension and curvature because a thicker <b>overriding</b> plate provides more resistance to deform. <b>Overriding</b> plate extension is maximum at a scaled distance of ∼ 200 - 400 km from the trench, not at the trench, suggesting that basal shear tractions resulting frommantle flow below the <b>overriding</b> plate primarily drive extension rather than deviatoric tensional normal stresses at the subduction zone interface.
