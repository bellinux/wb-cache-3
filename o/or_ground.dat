5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> feeding.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth <b>or</b> <b>ground.</b> Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E

5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter that acts as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted goat cheese <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> walnuts and cinnamon. It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (<b>or</b> <b>ground</b> up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up trees or other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E

5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, {{often in a}} cruciform design, later became a trademark of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low mezzanine floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a heat sink in electronics.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) {{vertebrates}} that do {{not maintain}} their body temperature through internal physiological processes. Their metabolic rate is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe {{by means of a}} pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin.|$|E
5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, <b>or</b> <b>ground,</b> state; {{some of them would}} have to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. This state of the electrons, called degenerate, meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E
5|$|Within the interior, {{the upper}} and middle floors are State floors; they are in turn divided into several {{reception}} rooms, throne rooms and galleries complete with royal portraits of every Chakri Monarchs (including Second King Pinklao) and their consorts. More specifically, to the east gallery are Buddhist Images and other religious images, while to the west are reception rooms for State guests and other foreign dignitaries. In {{other parts of the}} throne hall there are also libraries and rooms where the ashes of Kings (Rama IV to Rama VIII) and their Queens are housed. Many of the European-made chandeliers inside the Hall initially belonged to Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse; however they proved too big for his own residence and he eventually gave them to King Chulalongkron as gifts. The throne hall was also the first structure in Thailand in which electricity was installed, at the insistence of Prince Devavongse Varopakar. The lower floor <b>or</b> <b>ground</b> floor is reserved for servants and the Royal Guards. Currently there is a museum displaying old weapons.|$|E
