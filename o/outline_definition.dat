40|$|In {{the fight}} against malaria new {{medicines}} are an essential weapon. For {{the parts of the}} world where the current gold standard artemisinin combination therapies are active, significant improvements can still be made: for example combination medicines which allow for single dose regimens, cheaper, safer and more effective medicines, or improved stability under field conditions. For those parts of the world where the existing combinations show less than optimal activity, the priority is to have activity against emerging resistant strains, and other criteria take a secondary role. For new medicines to be optimal in malaria control they must also be able to reduce transmission and prevent relapse of dormant forms: additional constraints on a combination medicine. In the absence of a highly effective vaccine, new medicines are also needed to protect patient populations. In this paper, an <b>outline</b> <b>definition</b> of the ideal and minimally acceptable characteristics of the types of clinical candidate molecule which are needed (target candidate profiles) is suggested. In addition, the optimal and minimally acceptable characteristics of combination medicines are outlined (target product profiles). MMV presents now a suggested framework for combining the new candidates to produce the new medicines. Sustained investment over the next decade in discovery and development of new molecules is essential to enable the long-term delivery of the medicines needed to combat malaria...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is regularly {{presented as a}} reconsideration of development, which has the role of directing the choices and actions {{of public and private}} sectors. As such, sustainable {{development is}} introduced as an intellectual and political response to the unsustainable consequences of current production and consumption methods. The fact that this concept is mainly based on stances by political players (international institutions and NGOs) of international scale, places this "concept" as a potential <b>outline</b> <b>definition</b> of public policies. Keeping a distance from current production and consumption methods, it has a critical approach which allows it to be reused by those defending issues concerning them, that are threatened by the development underway. Nevertheless, the concept of sustainable development is very flexible, allowing for multiple divergent and concomitant interpretations {{to the extent that it}} appears as an empty discourse, which does not have practical unequivocal and provable consequences. For it to become operational, the concept must be translated into formulations able to make action possible: this would consist in defining problems, projects and actors through the outline of frames that will serve as reference for both private and public sectors. An aspect of the sustainable development discussion, is precisely that of opening up the issue of consumption by handing control to the consumers that could play a role in reforming unsustainabl...|$|E

40|$|In a {{wide range}} of fields, {{professional}} practice is being transformed by the increasing influence of digital analytics: the massive volumes of big data, and software algorithms that are collecting, comparing, and calculating that data to make predictions and even decisions. Researchers in a number of social sciences have been calling attention to the far-reaching and accelerating consequences of these forces, claiming that many professionals, researchers, policy makers and the public are just beginning to realise the enormous potentials and challenges these analytics are producing. Yet, outside of particular areas of research and practice, such as learning analytics, there has been little discussion of this to date in the broader education literature. This article aims to set out some key issues particularly relevant to the understandings of professional practice, knowledge and learning posed by the linkages of big data and software code.

40|$|Research question: Existing team {{identification}} research uses various definitions, conceptualisations, {{and theoretical}} frameworks. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of previous research using the two dominant theoretical approaches: identity {{theory and the}} social identity approach. Our primary purpose {{is to provide a}} theoretical framework for the on-going study of ‘team’ identification in sport management research. Findings: Scholars have used identity theory (role) and the social identity approach (group) in their quest to understand team identification, however, limited {{attention has been paid to}} the differences between the two frameworks. We focus on two aspects of role and group identification that epitomize divergence in terms of analytical focus and explanations for behavior: the basis for identification and salience. Implications. The manuscript concludes with three recommendations for future research. First, with the aim of making future research more specific, we recommend the use of fan (spectator) identification in studies using identity theory and team identification (organisation / brand) in studies exploring the influence of group identity. Second, we <b>outline</b> <b>definitions</b> for role (fan) and group (team) identification in sport research. Finally, we reflect on the measurement of team identification...|$|R
