5|$|From 3 June to 30 September 1960, Braathens SAFE {{was granted}} {{concession}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark. This became possible because SAS {{had abandoned the}} route the previous year. It was flown with a DC-3, giving an 80% load factor. On 22 July, the Braathens SAFE applied for a three-year concession, but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would restart the route. In 1961, SAS started the route Stavanger–Kristiansand–Ålborg, and in 1963 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> Oslo–Kristiansand–Ålborg. The concession allowed SAS to also take passengers on the domestic legs, giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand.|$|E
