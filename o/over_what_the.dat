5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{which was}} {{under the command of}} Major-General Richard Gale, was chosen to conduct the {{airborne}} operations on the eastern flank of the invasion area. The division was new, having been activated in April 1943, and Operation Overlord would be its first experience of combat. The division was the first to be established {{for the sole purpose of}} undertaking division-level airborne operations rather than contributing to a range of smaller operations, and there was considerable debate <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> unit should do.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1960, in {{response}} to requests by Prime Minister Lumumba, the UN Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. This called upon Belgium to remove its troops and for the UN to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the Soviet Union {{if they did not}} leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use the UN troops to subdue Katanga by force. Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, 'From these texts it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.' Secretary General Hammarskjöld refused. To Hammarskjöld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. Disagreements <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.|$|E

25|$|There is debate <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{effects of}} the 2000s energy crisis will be over the long term.

It {{should also be noted that}} several of the maps cited as evidence by the two governments displayed confusion <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> geographic facts were in the first place (displaying some islets in the wrong places, confusing the names of some islands, or even displaying islands that do not exist).|$|E

25|$|When {{asked about}} the working {{condition}} in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior {{by the standards of}} developed nations, they are actually improvements <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' standard of living, those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over subsistence farming and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or starvation by unemployment.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there were many}} {{uncertainties}} about moving to such a place as America. Stories had come back from there about failed colonies. There were fears that the native people would be violent, {{that there would be}} no source of food or water, that exposure to unknown diseases was possible, and that travel by sea was always hazardous. Balancing all this was a local political situation that was in danger of becoming unstable. The truce was faltering in what came to be known as the Eighty Years' War, and there was fear <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> attitudes of Spain might be toward them.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Hammer shot {{a half-hour}} pilot episode for a TV series {{to be called}} Tales of Frankenstein, in {{association}} with Columbia Pictures. Anton Diffring played the Baron, and Don Megowan his creation. Curt Siodmak directed. The series was scrapped, {{largely because of the}} two companies's disagreement <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> basic thrust of the series would be. Hammer wanted to do a series about Baron Frankenstein involved in various misadventures, while Columbia wanted a series of science fiction stories loosely based around the idea of science gone wrong.

25|$|When Farran {{arrived in}} Palestine, the British {{authorities}} {{were in the}} midst of attempting to suppress Jewish paramilitary organizations operating in the Mandate. The largest and most effective of these groups was known as the Irgun, which controlled between 5,000 and 6,000 paramilitary members proficient in sabotage and street fighting, as well as an intelligence section staffed by a number of ex-Special Operations Executive and Secret Intelligence Service operatives that the British Joint Intelligence Committee labelled 'excellent'. Although the Irgun and other Jewish paramilitary groups were outnumbered by a ratio of 20:1 by British security forces, British attempts to end their activities were hampered by an inadequate intelligence organization which was understaffed and over-stretched, with many of its small number of personnel consisting of 'enterprising amateurs' seconded from other units. Political violence by Jewish paramilitary groups began when the war came to an end, and by early 1947 Palestine had experienced a large number of attacks against British targets. Debates raged in London <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> best course of action was to combat the attacks. On 2 March 1947, martial law was declared throughout Tel Aviv and the Jewish sector of Jerusalem, with the intended aim of differentiating the paramilitary members from the civilian population and ending the attacks. However, this had the opposite effect, and the number of attacks actually doubled.|$|E
25|$|With {{the coming}} of 1933, however, Schmeling's image in America began to take a decided turn. In 1932, the Nazi Party became the most {{powerful}} political force in Germany, and its ideologies, voiced by party leader Adolf Hitler, overflowed with anti-Semitic tendencies. Major American cities such as New York had large Jewish populations, who worried <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> party could mean for people of their religion in the future. Schmeling, because he was German, was viewed {{as an extension of}} Hitler's plans for world domination. When he was slated to fight heavy-hitting contender Max Baer on 8 June 1933, he immediately became the 'bad guy' in the eyes of fans. Baer, who did not practice the Jewish religion but had a Jewish father, came into the ring wearing the Star of David on his shorts. Promoter Jack Dempsey played up this angle and suddenly the fight was viewed as Baer defending his faith against the prejudice of the Nazis, represented reluctantly by Schmeling. Thrown off of his game in part by the bad publicity but also because of Baer's wild, brawling style and frequent fouls (including backhand punches and rabbit punches), Schmeling was thrashed after ten rounds before nearly 60,000 onlookers at Yankee Stadium. While the German took a battering against the ropes in the tenth, the referee leapt in to stop the fight. The fight, combined with a follow-up loss to contender Steve Hamas early the next year, left many wondering if Schmeling was still a world top-class fighter.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the process, the {{candidates}} are given around 10 business-themed tasks (11 for the seventh and eighth series), which are designed to test their skills in notable areas - salesmanship, negotiation, requisitioning, leadership, teamwork, and organisation - with each episode covering a single task. Both teams are briefed by Lord Sugar <b>over</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> task involves, which also includes the rules they must adhere to (i.e. what they are restricted from doing or using in the task), and the condition for winning the task, with the most common being making the most profit, achieving high sales figures, or {{coming up with a}} concept that Lord Sugar feels is the best (such as branding). Both teams often appoint someone in their team as the project manager (PM), who acts as the team's leader and deals with important key decisions, with the choice usually derived from either a candidate's background, or the amount of confidence the team has in their choice, although Sugar himself can either suggest who the team should pick as their PM, or nominate a candidate into the role, based upon his opinion of their performance in the process, their background, or, since the seventh series, from what he has seen of their business plan. As candidate numbers are whittled down during the process, the team are periodically rearranged, primarily in the task's briefing, either to balance out the number, ensure a fair distribution of skills for a specific task, or to give less vocal candidates a chance to demonstrate their abilities.|$|E
