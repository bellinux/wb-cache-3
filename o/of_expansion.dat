In that, we obtained 4 base families <b>of</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> its solutions different from base families <b>of</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> solutions for a·b≠ 0. Altogether for x→ 0 and a= 0 there exist 11 families <b>of</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> solutions involving <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> four types: power, power-logarithmic, complicated and exotic. Most of them are new. Cases a= 0, x→∞ and b= 0 are obtained from the case a= 0, x→ 0 by means of reflections of symmetries of the equation. For a=b= 0 there are absent <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> solutions different from <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> solutions for a·b≠ 0, a= 0 and b= 0.

This redesign, and the absence <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac.

During the same year, Baade first proposed the use of the Type Ia supernova as a secondary distance indicator.

40|$|Tarski {{initiated}} a logic-based approach to formal geometry that studies first-order structures with a ternary betweenness relation (beta) and a quaternary equidistance relation (equiv). Tarski established, inter alia, that the first-order (FO) theory of (R^ 2,beta,equiv) is decidable. Aiello and van Benthem (2002) conjectured that the FO-theory <b>of</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (R^ 2,beta) with unary predicates is decidable. We refute this conjecture {{by showing that}} for all n > 1, the FO-theory <b>of</b> monadic <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (R^n,beta) is Pi^ 1 _ 1 -hard and therefore not even arithmetical. We also define a natural and comprehensive class C of geometric structures (T,beta), where T is a subset of R^n, and show that for each structure (T,beta) in C, the FO-theory of the class <b>of</b> monadic <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (T,beta) is undecidable. We then consider classes <b>of</b> <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> structures (T,beta) with restricted unary predicates, for example finite predicates, and establish a variety of related undecidability results. In addition to decidability questions, we briefly study the expressivity of universal MSO and weak universal MSO over <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (R^n,beta). While the logics are incomparable in general, over <b>expansions</b> <b>of</b> (R^n,beta), formulae of weak universal MSO translate into equivalent formulae of universal MSO.
