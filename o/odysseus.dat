Ajax becomes gravely upset when Achilles’ armor is presented to <b>Odysseus</b> instead of himself. Despite their enmity toward him, <b>Odysseus</b> persuades the kings Menelaus and Agamemnon to grant Ajax a proper burial.|$|E
5|$|Tethys is {{the third}} largest of Saturn's inner moons. Its most {{prominent}} features are a large (400km diameter) impact crater named <b>Odysseus</b> on its leading hemisphere and a vast canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with <b>Odysseus,</b> and these two features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies {{the majority of its}} surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of <b>Odysseus.</b> The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from <b>Odysseus.</b> The density of Tethys (0.985g/cm3) is less than that of water, indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with {{only a small fraction of}} rock.|$|E
5|$|The Penelopiad is a novella by Margaret Atwood. It was {{published}} in 2005 {{as part of the}} first set of books in the Canongate Myth Series where contemporary authors rewrite ancient myths. In The Penelopiad, Penelope reminisces on the events of the Odyssey, life in Hades, <b>Odysseus,</b> Helen of Troy, and her relationships with her parents. A Greek chorus of the twelve maids, whom <b>Odysseus</b> believed were disloyal and whom Telemachus hanged, interrupt Penelope's narrative to express their view on events. The maids' interludes use a new genre each time, including a jump-rope rhyme, a lament, an idyll, a ballad, a lecture, a court trial and several types of songs.|$|E
50|$|Athena {{also appears}} to <b>Odysseus's</b> son Telemachos. Her actions lead him to travel around to <b>Odysseus's</b> comrades and ask about his father. He hears stories about some of <b>Odysseus's</b> journey. Athena's push for Telemachos's journey helps him grow into the man role, that his father once held.|$|R
50|$|The episode also {{provides}} Virgil {{with an opportunity}} to show Aeneas' magnanimity in saving a member of <b>Odysseus's</b> crew, and bearing no grudge for <b>Odysseus's</b> major role in the destruction of Troy, Aeneas' home.|$|R
25|$|Athena {{also appears}} to <b>Odysseus's</b> son Telemachus. Her actions lead him to travel around to <b>Odysseus's</b> comrades and ask about his father. He hears stories about some of <b>Odysseus's</b> journey. Athena's push for Telemachos's journey helps him grow into the man role, that his father once held. She also {{plays a role in}} ending the {{resultant}} feud against the suitors' relatives. She instructs Laertes to throw his spear and to kill Eupeithes, the father of Antinous.|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} of Ulysses (in Greek, <b>Odysseus)</b> has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of <b>Odysseus</b> were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800–700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for {{his pursuit of}} knowledge beyond human bounds and for creating the deception of the Trojan horse.|$|E
5|$|The novel recaps Penelope's life in {{hindsight}} from 21st century Hades; she recalls her family life in Sparta, {{her marriage to}} <b>Odysseus,</b> her dealing with suitors during his absence, and the aftermath of Odysseus' return. The relationship with her parents was challenging: her father became overly affectionate after attempting to murder her, and her mother was absent-minded and negligent. At fifteen, Penelope married <b>Odysseus,</b> who had rigged the contest that decided which suitor would marry her. Penelope was happy with him, {{even though he was}} mocked behind his back by Helen and some maids for his short stature and lesser developed home, Ithaca. The couple broke with tradition by moving to the husband's kingdom. In Ithaca, neither Odysseus' mother Anticleia, nor his nurse Eurycleia, liked Penelope but eventually Eurycleia helped Penelope settle into her new role and became friendly, but often patronising. Shortly after the birth of their son, Telemachus, <b>Odysseus</b> was called to war, leaving Penelope to run the kingdom and raise Telemachus alone. News of the war and rumours of Odysseus' journey back sporadically reached Ithaca and with the growing possibility that <b>Odysseus</b> was not returning an increasing number of suitors moved in to court Penelope. Convinced the suitors were more interested in controlling her kingdom than loving her, she stalled them. The suitors pressured her by consuming and wasting much of the kingdom's resources. She feared violence if she outright denied their offer of marriage so she announced she would make her decision on which to marry once she finished her father-in-law's shroud. She enlisted twelve maids to help her unravel the shroud at night and spy on the suitors. <b>Odysseus</b> eventually returned but in disguise. Penelope recognised him immediately and instructed her maids not to reveal his identity. After the suitors were massacred, <b>Odysseus</b> instructed Telemachus to execute the maids who he believed were in league with them. Twelve were hanged while Penelope slept. Afterwards, Penelope and <b>Odysseus</b> told each other stories of their time apart, but {{on the issue of the}} maids Penelope remained silent to avoid the appearance of sympathy for those already judged and condemned as traitors.|$|E
5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The stories {{told in the}} Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and <b>Odysseus</b> to a Scherian court make <b>Odysseus</b> into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, <b>Odysseus</b> was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled {{to tell her story}} because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by <b>Odysseus</b> and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.|$|E

5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to <b>Odysseus,</b> {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales {{to his current}} audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like <b>Odysseus,</b> Kint allows his audience to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E
5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder {{if they would have}} killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and <b>Odysseus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Penelope, {{named after}} the wife of <b>Odysseus,</b> was the fifth ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy. She was ordered in February 1865 and was the first iron-hulled ship to be built at Pembroke Dockyard. The ship was laid down on 4 September and was {{launched}} by the wife of the new Captain-Superintendent of the dockyard, Captain Robert Hall, on 18 June 1867.|$|E
50|$|In Homer's Odyssey, Mesaulius is {{the servant}} of Eumaeus (<b>Odysseus's</b> pigman), who {{purchases}} {{him during his}} own master's long absence from Ithaca during and {{in the aftermath of}} the Trojan War.

After learning that they cannot win the Trojan War without Philoctetes' bow, the Greeks send <b>Odysseus</b> and Neoptolemus to retrieve him; due to the Greeks' earlier treachery, however, Philoctetes refuses to rejoin the army. It is only Heracles' deus ex machina appearance that persuades Philoctetes to go to Troy.|$|E
5|$|The Sirens and Ulysses {{is a large}} oil {{painting}} on canvas by the English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1837.

5|$|The sea plays a {{major role}} in Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, {{describing}} the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero <b>Odysseus</b> who struggles to return home across the sea, encountering sea monsters along the way. In the Middle Ages, the sea appears in romances such as the Tristan legend, with motifs such as mythical islands and self-propelled ships. Pilgrimage is a common theme in stories and poems such as The Book of Margery Kempe.|$|E

5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of <b>Odysseus</b> may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E
5|$|At the temple, Kassandra is {{assaulted}} by Khryse, a priest who disguises himself as Apollo {{in order to}} seduce her. She sees through his trickery and fights him off, but the god feels insulted by her refusal and makes the city's residents stop believing her prophecies. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon uses Helen's flight as a pretext for war and soon begins launching daily raids on Troy, beginning the Trojan War. Kassandra spends {{more time with her}} family to help with daily tasks while the menled by Hectorfight off the Akhaian invaders. The war continues sporadically despite the attempts of former Trojan ally <b>Odysseus</b> to end the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Double {{standards}} between genders {{and classes}} are exposed throughout the novella. <b>Odysseus</b> commits adultery with Circe while expecting Penelope to remain loyal to him. The maids' {{relations with the}} suitors are seen as treasonous and earn them an execution. Penelope condemns Helen for her involvement in getting men killed at Troy. At the same time, Penelope excuses her involvement in getting the maids killed even though, as Atwood reveals, Penelope enlisted the maids to spy on the suitors and even encouraged them to continue after some were raped.|$|E
50|$|On <b>Odysseus's</b> return, {{disguised}} {{as an old}} beggar, he finds that Penelope has remained faithful. She has devised tricks to delay her suitors, {{one of which is}} to pretend to be weaving a burial shroud for <b>Odysseus's</b> elderly father Laertes and claiming that she will choose a suitor when she has finished. Every night for three years, she undoes part of the shroud, until Melantho, one of twelve unfaithful serving women, discovers her chicanery and reveals it to the suitors.|$|R
5000|$|Same (Σάμη), also Samos (Σάμος) is an Ancient Greek {{name of a}} Homeric {{island in}} the Ionian Sea, near Ithaca and Cephalonia. In Homer's Odyssey Same is {{described}} as part of <b>Odysseus's</b> kingdom together with Ithaca, Dulichium, and Zacynthus. The Iliad, book II, in the Catalogue of Ships, contains a different list of islands comprising <b>Odysseus's</b> kingdom. Same is included together with Ithaca, Neritum, Krocylea, Aegilips and Zacynthus, indicating that the [...] "Catalogue of Ships" [...] could be a later addition to the Iliad.|$|R
50|$|Works {{that employ}} in medias res often, though not always, will {{subsequently}} use flashback and nonlinear narrative for exposition of earlier events {{in order to}} fill in the backstory. For example, in Homer's Odyssey, we first learn about <b>Odysseus's</b> journey when he is held captive on Calypso's island. We then find out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of <b>Odysseus's</b> journey precedes that moment in the narrative. On the other hand, Homer's Iliad has relatively few flashbacks, although it opens {{in the thick of the}} Trojan War.|$|R
5|$|In Greek {{literature}} {{he first}} {{appears as a}} great hunter in Homer's epic the Odyssey, where <b>Odysseus</b> sees his shade in the underworld. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, {{but there is no}} extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of Jason in Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica or Euripides' Medea; the entry in Ovid's Fasti for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s Blyton {{developed}} {{an interest in}} writing stories related to various myths, including those of ancient Greece and Rome; The Knights of the Round Table, Tales of Ancient Greece and Tales of Robin Hood were published in 1930. In Tales of Ancient Greece Blyton retold sixteen well-known ancient Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names of deities and invented conversations between the characters. The Adventures of <b>Odysseus,</b> Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians and Tales of the Romans followed in 1934.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} syncretic, {{synoptic}} account of Palamedes from the Trojan War.

The thesis accounts for Palamedes’s scarce attention in classical texts by way of Lacanian and—via Otto Rank—Freudian psychoanalytic theory, {{as well as by}} Slavoj Žižek’s adoption of the “vanishing mediator. ” After tracing a potential textual genealogy from Palamedes to Malory’s Palomydes, the thesis concludes with a reading of Palamedes’s implied presence in Inferno 26...|$|R
