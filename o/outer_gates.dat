5|$|The Grand Palace has twelve gates (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} four walls. These massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. These gates are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of these <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a clockwise direction around.|$|E
5|$|Davos Seaworth and the Night's Watch loyalists, who are {{guarding}} Jon Snow's body {{within a}} chamber in the castle, prepare themselves for battle when Alliser Thorne {{and his allies}} begin {{to break down the}} door. As they are about to break through, the <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> of the Castle are breached by the giant Wun Wun, followed by Tormund Giantsbane and an army of Wildlings, who have returned with Dolorous Edd. Outnumbered, the Night's Watchmen lay down their arms, and Alliser and the mutineers are dragged off to the cells under Edd's orders.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gates and}} wall separating the gardens {{from the park}} and farmland date from 1878 and are listed at grade II. The wrought-iron gates are by Cubitt & Co., and were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Two outer single gates and a double inner gate are supported by four sandstone piers. The outer pair of gate piers are capped by a bud-shaped device supported on scrolls; the inner pair are surmounted by a griffin and a lion, mirroring the statuary of the hall's terraces. The lower gate sections of lyre-like panels with leaf and spearhead motifs are topped with Jacobean-style arched panels. The ornate gate overthrows include shields and emblems capped with crowns, sheaves and sickles. The inner gates bear the inscription Quid retribuam domino ("What can I render to the Lord?"), while the <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> bear the date. The wall, of brick with stone dressings, features arcading and has piers surmounted with ogee caps carved to match the tiles of the main hall tower. A further feature of the gardens to survive is a grade-II-listed sundial dating from the early 19th century, which stands {{to the rear of}} the house.|$|E

25|$|On the 26th Heraugiere {{and their}} men {{embarked}} on van Bergen's boat; {{but he was}} too ill or overslept and thus sent his two nephews who would pilot the barge. Overcoming the Mark in the direction of Breda, they had to overcome the extreme cold of the Dutch winter, ice caused difficulties thus making navigation difficult which delayed the voyage by a number of days. By Saturday evening however they had reached Breda and were at the <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> early in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Taeping {{arrived at}} Gravesend some 55 minutes before Ariel, but {{that gave her}} no {{advantage}} as both ships then {{had to wait for}} the tide to rise sufficiently. Ariel then had the shorter distance to go - arriving outside East India Dock gates at 9:00 pm, but the tide was still too low for the gates to open. Taeping carried on up-river to London Docks. Here, unlike the entrance to the East India Dock, there was an inner and outer set of gates. Taeping's shallower draft allowed her through the <b>outer</b> <b>gates,</b> then they topped up the lock from the dock basin. She passed through at 9:47 pm. Ariel entered East India Dock at 10:15 pm.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the stadium}} was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Giants, the stadium's lower walls were blue and the seats and the stadium's four gates were red and blue to reflect the team colors. When the Jets moved in, green banners were hung over the walls and eventually over the <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> of the stadium anytime the team hosted a game. In addition, team-specific end zone decorations would be changed for Jets home games. This was accomplished by either painting over the Giants logos, or replacing the turf section of each end zone. Midfield decorations at the 50-yard line were typically not team-specific (in early years a Meadowlands logo, and later an NFL shield), {{which could be used}} for both teams' games.|$|E

25|$|After the Russian plan of {{surrounding}} the churches on Saturday {{was discovered by}} the Poles, {{it was decided that}} the uprising should start immediately. On Holy Wednesday the Polish garrison was secretly provided with volleys and artillery charges and overnight was dispatched to various parts of the city. The Russians were conscious of the preparations for the uprising and their troops were also equipped with additional ammunition. At 03:30 some 20 Polish dragoons left the Mirów barracks and headed for the Saxon Garden. Encountered by a small Russian force equipped with two cannons guarding the Iron Gate, the squadron charged the Russian positions and captured the guns. Soon afterwards the remainder of the Royal Horse Guard regiment left the barracks on foot and headed in two directions: towards the <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> of the city at Wola and towards the Warsaw Arsenal, where the Russian forces were preparing an assault. The crew of the Arsenal was also joined by a small troop of National Cavalry under Colonel Jan Jerzy Giessler, who crossed the Vistula overnight.|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} has {{a number}} of structures which, because of their age, have historic value and are listed on the Listed Building register. At Vale Royal, the lock built in 1860 was retained as a sluice channel when a new lock was built in the 1890s. A swing bridge crosses the chamber. [...] The sluice at the upstream end is supported by two cast iron arches on rusticated piers. A swing bridge, made of wood and iron, crosses the small lock, which was the large lock until the construction of the new large lock in the 1890s. This has three sets of gates, and could accommodate a train of four barges when the <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> were used. Again, a swing bridge crosses the lock. The gates are opened by a Pelton water turbine mechanism, and other features include a water levelling mechanism and a system for removing rubbish from behind the gates using jets of water which are controlled mechanically. [...] The lock keeper's cottage is also grade II listed. It was built in the 1850s, but was moved northwards by [...] during the 1890 reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|While Montgomery {{was making}} his advance, Arnold {{advanced}} with his main body towards the barricades of the Sault-au-Matelot at {{the northern end of}} the lower town. [...] They passed the <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> and some British gun batteries undetected. [...] However, as the advance party moved around the Palace Gate, heavy fire broke out from the city walls above them. [...] The height of the walls made it impossible to return the defenders' fire, therefore Arnold ordered his men to run forward. They advanced down a narrow street, where they once again came under fire as they approached a barricade. [...] As he was organizing his men in an attempt to take the barricade, Arnold received a deep wound in the leg from a musket ball that apparently ricocheted, and was carried to the rear after transferring command of his detachment to Daniel Morgan. Under Morgan's command, they captured the barricade, but had difficulty advancing further because of the narrow twisting streets and damp gunpowder, which prevented their muskets from firing. Morgan and his men holed up in some buildings to dry out their powder and rearm, but they eventually came under increasing fire; Carleton had realized the attacks on the northern gates were feints and began concentrating his forces in the lower town. A British force of 500sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the first barricade, trapping Morgan and his men in the city. With no avenue of retreat and under heavy fire, Morgan and his men surrendered. The battle was over by 10am.|$|E

50|$|The Zwinger {{in front}} of a town gate is a {{fortified}} area between the main <b>gate</b> and the <b>outer</b> <b>gate</b> of a medieval town gateway system. Town gates were often built {{in the shape of a}} gate tower, with a second, and sometimes even a third, gate {{in front of}} it (so-called double or triple gate systems). In front of the town walls in the area of the town gates there was usually a second wall in which the <b>outer</b> <b>gate</b> was located. An enemy who had breached the <b>outer</b> <b>gate</b> and penetrated the Zwinger would find himself in an enclosed area with very little scope to exploit his initial success. By contrast, the defenders retreating behind the main town walls could easily engage the enemy below them in the killing ground of the Zwinger.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{a double}} gate. The outer gate is [...] wide and [...] deep. It is {{accessible}} by only one gate and also had a very fine Baoli which suggests that it was meant for the Chief and his family.This gate has a bastion and a defensive wall on each side. On the bastions cannons could be deployed. The inner and <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> are almost mirror images of each other. The top of the gate has five battlements. All of these have loopholes as well as machicolation. Unlike other gates of this Qila, the inner side of the gate has five battlements.|$|E
2500|$|Flood locks {{which have}} been used only as flood gates (see below) are often {{incapable}} of reverting to their former purpose without refurbishment. That is, where only <b>outer</b> <b>gates</b> are ever closed (probably because a waterway is not a true commercial one, and therefore there is no financial imperative for a boat to venture out onto a flooded river) inner gates soon suffer from lack of maintenance. A good example is on the Calder and Hebble Navigation, where structures {{referred to in the}} boating guides as [...] "Flood Locks" [...] are clearly only capable of being used for flood-prevention, not for [...] "penning" [...] boats to or from the river in flood.|$|E
