5|$|The Byzantine Emperor, John V Palaiologos visited Louis in Buda {{in early}} 1366, seeking his {{assistance}} against the Ottoman Turks , who had {{set foot in}} Europe. This was the first occasion that a Byzantine Emperor left his empire to plead for a foreign monarch's assistance. According to Louis's physician, Giovanni di Conversino, at {{his first meeting with}} Louis, the emperor refused to dismount and to take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> which offended Louis. John V pledged that he would promote the union of the Byzantine Church with the Papacy, and Louis promised to send him help, but neither the emperor nor Louis fulfilled their promises. Pope Urban encouraged Louis not to send help to Constantinople before the emperor guaranteed the Church union.|$|E

500|$|Alf {{first saw}} Julia Stanley at the 'Trocadero' club, a {{converted}} cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool. Although {{he did not}} speak {{to her at the}} time, he later saw Julia again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Alf, who was dressed in a bowler hat and holding a cigarette holder, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. The 14-year-old Julia said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old replied that Julia looked [...] "lovely", and sat down next to her. Julia asked him to take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> so he promptly took it off and threw it straight into the lake.|$|E
500|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name. At the Trocadero club, a converted cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool, he first saw an [...] "auburn-haired girl with a bright smile and high cheekbones"; Julia Stanley. [...] He saw her again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Lennon, who {{was dressed in a}} bowler hat and with a cigarette holder in hand, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. Julia (14 years old) said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old Alf replied that she looked [...] "lovely", and sat down next to her.

500|$|Walker took {{command of}} the 64-gun [...] on 8 February 1798, before {{transferring}} in quick succession to the 56-gun , the 98-gun , the 90-gun [...] and lastly the 50-gun [...] on 7 October 1800. He commanded Isis in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and in the Baltic Sea, {{as well as with}} the Channel Fleet. Isis was assigned to the Baltic expedition under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and joined Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron for the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The plan of attack had to be improvised at the last minute, after several ships ran aground while trying to enter the harbour, including Nelson's flagship, [...] Walker took Isis in to engage both his own target as well as Elephants, and ended up fighting two Danish blockships and a 14-gun battery. When eventually Nelson was able to work his way down the line he left Walker at his task and took another position. As he passed, Nelson took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> waved it, and cried, 'Well done, brave Walker! Go on as you have begun; nothing can be better'. After four and a half hours of intense fighting Isis silenced her opponents, at the heavy cost of nine officers and 103 men killed or wounded. Nelson came aboard Isis the following morning and thanked Walker and his men for their brave efforts.|$|E

2500|$|... "Lima {{became the}} {{prisoner}} of a system," [...] {{according to the}} pentito Leonardo Messina. [...] "Before this latest generation, being a friend of mafiosi was easy for everybody… It was a great honour for a mafioso to have a member of parliament at a wedding or a baptism… When a mafioso saw a parliamentarian he would take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> and offer him a seat." [...] With the rise of power of the Corleonesi this changed profoundly. [...] "Now, {{it has become an}} imposition: do this or else," [...] Messina said.|$|E
2500|$|The Sorting Hat {{originally}} {{belonged to}} Godric Gryffindor, {{one of the}} four founders of Hogwarts. The four founders used to hand-pick the students for their houses, but then realised someone else would have to do it after they died, so Gryffindor took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> enchanted it, and let it choose. Since then, the Sorting Hat has always been used to choose which house the students are put in. Due to its age, it appears [...] "patched and frayed and extremely dirty." [...] Before Sorting the students each year, the hat recites a new introductory song. These songs occasionally warn of danger to come, as in Order of the Phoenix. The Sorting Hat's songs vary in length and content, but always include a brief description of each house.|$|E
2500|$|His coolness in the {{direction}} of court favour gave rise to suspicions of his puritan leaning. These were increased by an incident of James's second visit to Cambridge. A comedy called Ignoramus, by George Ruggle of Clare Hall, was to be acted before the king. Preston's pupil Morgan (of the Morgans of Heyford) was cast for a woman's part. Preston objected; the lad's guardians overruled the objection; Morgan, who was removed to Oxford, subsequently joined the Roman Catholic Church. His strictness greatly increased his reputation as a tutor with puritan parents; 'he was,' says Fuller, 'the greatest pulpit-monger in England in man's memory. ... every time, when Master Preston plucked <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> to Doctor Davenant, the college master, he gained a chamber or study for one of his pupils'.|$|E

2500|$|Stuart's last {{obstacle}} was Custer, {{with four}} hundred veteran troopers of the First Michigan Cavalry, directly in his path. Outnumbered but undaunted, Custer rode {{to the head}} of the regiment, [...] "drew his saber, threw <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> so they could see his long yellow hair" [...] and shouted... "Come on, you Wolverines!" [...] Custer formed his men in line of battle and charged. [...] "So sudden was the collision that many of the horses were turned end over end and crushed their riders beneath them...." [...] As the Confederate advance stopped, their right flank was struck by troopers of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Michigan. McIntosh was able to gather some of his men from the First New Jersey and Third Pennsylvania and charged the rebel left flank. [...] "Seeing that the situation was becoming critical, I [...] turned to [...] and said: [...] "I have been ordered to hold this position, but, if you will back me up in case I am court-martialed for disobedience, I will order a charge." [...] The rebel column disintegrated into individual saber and pistol fights.|$|E
2500|$|As {{an example}} of his later {{vaudeville}} career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street. He was billed as [...] "King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field." [...] His trousers and shirt collar were too big and he buttoned his jacket wrong. [...] Also, his straw hat was a size too small. [...] "It was impossible {{to look at this}} vaudeville make-up and not laugh", the New York Sun said. [...] "Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music at a lot of friends up in the private boxes." [...] Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner William [...] "Billy" [...] Jerome [...] "took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> to him, and introduced him as 'Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.'" [...] They sang a parody. [...] Later, after reciting [...] "Casey at the Bat", he said, according to the Sun, [...] "I'm right at home with Casey." [...] Also, [...] "It's the first time I’ve been in these clothes, and I don’t quite understand them. [...] Besides I’ve been over to Guttenberg [...] to-day, and that is an excuse for anything that a man may do. Come and see me again. I’m obliged for your welcome." ...|$|E
