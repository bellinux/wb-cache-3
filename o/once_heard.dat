500|$|In {{a review}} of the 2014 reissue of Dark Horse, for Paste magazine, Robert Ham cited the song as a {{highlight}} of the album, writing: [...] "The giddy 'Is It [...] "He" [...] (Jai Sri Krishna)'... is a joyous affirmation of [...] spiritual beliefs that mashes up many of his musical interests, with Indian instruments finding consort with rambling English folk and R horn stabs." [...] Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp identified [...] "a lot of rewarding listening [...] for those willing to listen with an open mind", among which, he continues: [...] "'Far East Man' is a smooth soul collaboration with Ron Wood that, <b>once</b> <b>heard,</b> lodges itself in the brain.

500|$|Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Mojo, Tom Doyle {{describes}} the song as [...] "the excellently smooth Steely Dan-ish Far East Man".

[...] Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp similarly finds [...] "a lot of rewarding listening" [...] on Dark Horse, and highlights the track as [...] "a smooth soul collaboration with Ron Wood that, <b>once</b> <b>heard,</b> lodges {{itself in the}} brain". In his review of the 2014 reissues, for Record Collector, Oregano Rathbone cites [...] "Far East Man" [...] {{as an example of}} how each of Harrison's Apple albums post-All Things Must Pass [...] "contains shivery moments of release".|$|E
500|$|Although Thomas {{had a deep}} {{connection}} with Wales, he disliked Welsh nationalism. He once wrote, [...] "Land of my fathers, and my fathers can keep it". While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama The Three Weird Sisters. Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled [...] "I only <b>once</b> <b>heard</b> Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism." [...] Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not 'rejected enough' of the elements that Thomas disliked– [...] "Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality". Apologetically, {{in a letter to}} Keidrych Rhys, editor of literary magazine Wales, Thomas's father wrote that he was [...] "afraid Dylan isn't much of a Welshman". Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father's hostility towards the Welsh language.|$|E

500|$|Walpole {{is quite}} taken by this {{tradition}} and mentions it in several letters to his friends. [...] In {{a letter to}} the Countess of Ailesbury (Lady Caroline Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll and widow of Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin and 3rd Earl of Ailesbury but by this stage married to Hon. H. S. Conway), Walpole with tongue firmly in cheek berates her for not having come to Whichnoure to claim the flitch: [...] "Are you not ashamed, Madam, never to have put in your claim? It is above a year and a day that you have been married, and I never <b>once</b> <b>heard</b> either of you mention a journey to Whichnoure." [...] Describing the location and explaining why the flitch no longer gets claimed, he writes [...] "... it is a little paradise, and the more like an antique one, as, by all I have said, the married couples seem to be driven out of it." [...] Walpole concludes, [...] "If you love a prospect, or bacon, you will certainly come hither." ...|$|E

Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means [...] "light" [...] and Kubo sees her as [...] "a ray of light for Ichigo." [...] Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it. After designing Rukia's zanpakutō, Kubo noted he liked it a lot and made it to be the most beautiful one from the series.|$|E

[...] The implication is that this song was similar to a sailor song, probably the well-known shanty, [...] "Haul Away, Joe" [...] or [...] "Haul Away for Rosie," [...] viz.: [...] "Way, haul away; O, haul away, my Rosey; Way, haul away; O, haul away, Joe."

2500|$|A brick annex, {{designed}} by architect W.R. Lowery, was constructed against the high school's south side in 1913 {{at a cost}} of $200,000. At this time, the boiler system was moved from the basement of the high school to the area between the main building and the annex. An urban legend (which may have begun as early as the 1910s) began to circulate that the old boiler room was turned into a swimming pool, and that a student drowned in the pool—leaving the high school haunted. An investigation in the 1990s revealed that although student Grant Mill from Great Falls High School did drown in 1915, he did not drown in a fictitious pool in the basement but rather in the Missouri River. (Nonetheless, in July 2010, museum executive director Kathy Lear admitted that she <b>once</b> <b>heard</b> ghostly radio music coming from the basement late one afternoon.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Within the [...] "tale" [...] {{sections}} of the book, Peter, Martin, and Jack fall into bad company (becoming the official religion of the Roman empire) and begin altering their coats (faith) by adding ornaments.

He begins to rule by authority (he remembered the handyman saying that he <b>once</b> <b>heard</b> the father {{say that it was}} acceptable to don more ornaments), until such a time that Jack rebels against the rule of Peter. Jack begins to read the will (the Bible) overly literally. He rips the coat to shreds to restore the original state of the garment which represents the [...] "primitive Christianity" [...] sought by dissenters. He begins to rely only upon [...] "inner illumination" [...] for guidance and thus walks around with his eyes closed, after swallowing candle snuffs. Eventually, Peter and Jack begin to resemble one another, and only Martin is left with a coat that is at all like the original.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his early}} age Ammi {{attended}} the college at Caesarea, {{presided over by}} R. Hoshaiah I (Yer. Shab. iii. 5d), and later he went to Tiberias and became the disciple of R. Johanan, at whose death he voluntarily observed the ritual period of mourning prescribed {{on the death of}} nearest relatives only (M. Ḳ. 25b). When he <b>once</b> <b>heard</b> that his Babylonian contemporary, R. Nachman, had expressed himself disrespectfully of a misapplied opinion of R. Johanan, he indignantly exclaimed, [...] "Does NaḦman think that because he is the son-in-law of the exilarch, he may speak disparagingly of R. Johanan's opinions?" [...] (Ḥul. 124a). In Tiberias he became the center of a large circle of learned friends, among whom were R. Abbahu, R. Ḥanina (Ḥinena) b. Pappi, R. Isaac, and R. Samuel b. NaḦmani (M. Ḳ. 17a, 20a; Yeb. 48b), but the closest and most enduring friendship existed between him and R. Hiyya bar Abba and R. Assi (Berachot 16a, Yer.

2500|$|Historian Darren R.

[...] In 1967, Lou Reed famously wrote, [...] "Will none of the powers that be realize what Brian Wilson did with the chords?" [...] Pitchfork Media posited, [...] "At some point, you learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. … Once you've absorbed [...] , you find yourself going back through songs like [...] "Don't Worry Baby", [...] "The Warmth of the Sun", and [...] "I Get Around", finding a deeper brilliance where you <b>once</b> <b>heard</b> only pop craftsmanship."
