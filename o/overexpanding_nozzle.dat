To assess the actual potential of payload growth given by the application of such a device, the ascent trajectory must be evaluated and possibly optimized. A fast and reliable in-house code, based on the optimal-control theory, is used to optimize the ascent trajectory. Results show that the ideal velocity gain can be increased with throttling. However, ascent losses offset this benefit and reduce the actual payload; in any case, the launcher experiences lower dynamical loads and gains flexibility.

The results are compared with available experimental data in a nozzle of the same geometry. The asymmetric jet plume is well predicted by the simulation and is consistent with the experiments. Among the different turbulence models tested, the two-equation Shear Stress Model (SST) is found to agree closest to the experiments. The simulations are able to predict the velocity profiles, total pressure decay, and axial jet thickness distribution in the jet plume reasonably well. Jet mixing is governed by Ae/At {{and to a lesser extent}} by NPR. Increasing Ae/At results in a significant increase of mixing rate.

40|$|A {{detailed}} experimental, theoretical, and computational {{study of}} separated nozzle flows has been conducted. Experimental testing was {{performed at the}} NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel Complex. As {{part of a comprehensive}} static performance investigation, force, moment, and pressure measurements were made and schlieren flow visualization was obtained for a sub-scale, non-axisymmetric, two-dimensional, convergent- divergent nozzle. In addition, two-dimensional numerical simulations were run using the computational fluid dynamics code PAB 3 D with two-equation turbulence closure and algebraic Reynolds stress modeling. For reference, experimental and computational results were compared with theoretical predictions based on one-dimensional gas dynamics and an approximate integral momentum boundary layer method. Experimental results from this study indicate that off-design <b>overexpanded</b> <b>nozzle</b> flow was dominated by shock induced boundary layer separation, which was divided into two distinct flow regimes; three- dimensional separation with partial reattachment, and fully detached two-dimensional separation. The test nozzle was observed to go through a marked transition in passing from one regime to the other. In all cases, separation provided a significant increase in static thrust efficiency compared to the ideal prediction. Results indicate that with controlled separation, the entire <b>overexpanded</b> range of <b>nozzle</b> performance would be within 10 % of the peak thrust efficiency. By offering savings in weight and complexity over a conventional mechanical exhaust system, this may allow a fixed geometry nozzle to cover an entire flight envelope. The computational simulation was in excellent agreement with experimental data over most of the test range, and {{did a good job of}} modeling internal flow and thrust performance. An exception occurred at low nozzle pressure ratios, where the two-dimensional computational model was inconsistent with the three-dimensional separation observed in the experiment. In general, the computation captured the physics of the shock boundary layer interaction and shock induced boundary layer separation in the nozzle, though there were some differences in shock structure compared to experiment. Though minor, these differences could be important for studies involving flow control or thrust vectoring of separated nozzles. Combined with other observations, this indicates that more detailed, three-dimensional computational modeling needs to be conducted to more realistically simulate shock-separated nozzle flows...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{discusses}} the exhaust flow features {{and the various}} unsteady flow separation characteristics in subscale <b>overexpanded</b> <b>nozzles</b> that lead to generation of side-loads. While a DiMR type of Mach reflection features in the exhaust of a truncated ideal contour nozzle an InMR occurs in a thrust optimized parabolic nozzle. The main contributor towards generation of sideloads in a parabolic nozzle {{is known to be}} the flow transitions (free shock separation →restricted shock separation and vice-versa) and the shock unsteadiness preceding them. However, in a truncated ideal contour nozzle (that features only FSS condition) the strongest cause of side-load origin are seen to be (i) the asymmetry of separation front around the nozzle circumference, (ii) length of separation region and, (iii) length of back-flow region. The flow asymmetry causes variations in pressure rise at separation and hence, in the local value of rms fluctuations. The length of separation region also shows considerable variations with NPR and tends to peak at NPR similar to those at which peaks in (σ w/Pw) max value and strain-gauge signal occur. Data therefore suggests that that the necessary condition for side-load generation in a TIC nozzle is not just the flow asymmetry but also the length of separation region which shows significant variation as the separation front gradually approaches the nozzle exit. The length of back-flow region, on the other hand, also seems to control the large-scale fluctuations of the separation front. As the extent of back-flow region decreases, the oscillations of separation shock die down with a subsequent drop in the side-load signal even when the separation front exhibits circumferential asymmetry...|$|R

Jet noise from supersonic C-D nozzle flows under forward flight was found to depend critically on the flight velocity and nozzle pressure ratio.

40|$|Surveys of {{both the}} static and dynamic wall {{pressure}} signatures on the interior surface of a sub-scale, cold-flow and thrust optimized parabolic nozzle are conducted during fixed nozzle pressure ratios corresponding to FSS and RSS states. The motive {{is to develop a}} better understanding for the sources of off-axis loads during the transient start-up of <b>overexpanded</b> rocket <b>nozzles.</b> During FSS state, pressure spectra reveal frequency content resembling SWTBLI. Presumably, when the internal flow is in RSS state, separation bubbles are trapped by shocks and expansion waves; interactions between the separated flow regions and the waves produce asymmetric pressure distributions. An analysis of the azimuthal modes reveals how the breathing mode encompasses most of the resolved energy and that the side load inducing mode is coherent with the response moment measured by strain gauges mounted upstream of the nozzle on a flexible tube. Finally, the unsteady pressure is locally more energetic during RSS, albeit direct measurements of the response moments indicate higher side load activity when in FSS state. It is postulated that these discrepancies are attributed to cancellation effects between annular separation bubbles...|$|R
40|$|The present {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} the cold spray process examines the gas and particle dynamics {{both inside and outside}} the nozzle in the context of improving particle deposition. In the first part of the investigation, the one-dimensional isentropic relations coupled with the drag force acting on a particle is employed in a parametric study of the nozzle performance. Next, the addition of a barrel section to the end of the nozzle is proposed and shown to be more efficient in some cases than using the diverging section of the nozzle for particle acceleration. Finally, the effect of nozzle wall friction is incorporated to assess the amount of deviation from the isentropic model. The gas and particle dynamics between the nozzle and substrate during the steady cold spray process is the focus of the second part of the investigation. An underexpanded and <b>overexpanded</b> <b>nozzle</b> is employed to accelerate the particles and the operating conditions were set to those used in the validation cases. The particle impact statistics are extracted to provide information on the particle impact speed, angle and location. The particles are also tracked during their flight between the nozzle and substrate to characterise their response to changes in the gas flow. It was found that the variation in particle speed across the embedded shock structures became minimal as the diameter increased. For particles with a Stokes number greater than one, the nozzle exit velocity may be used as an approximation of the impact speed. A theoretical model is also proposed for calculating the particle impact speed using the nozzle exit conditions. The deployment of the shock tube in cold spray is a recent innovation in which a planar shock is released into the ambient air towards a substrate while the particles are injected across the wake of the shock. Although the process suffers from a number of practical limitations, monodisperse particles are used to compare the impact speed produced by steady and unsteady cold spray processes. It was found that this process also offers a mean of studying the shock formation process in underexpanded impinging jets. The shock speeds were selected such that either a shock diamond or Mach disk is reproduced in the impingement region characteristic of a moderately and highly underexpanded jet. Although the unsteady cold spray process requires a much lower driving pressure to produce the impact speeds found during the steady process, there are several practical limitations associated with it...|$|R

A simplified axisymmetric nozzle geometry, representative of the nozzle on the NASA Dryden NF- 15 B Lift and Nozzle Change Effects on Tail Shock (LaNCETS) research airplane, was considered. The highly underexpanded nozzle flow is found to provide significantly more reduction in the tail shock strength in the sonic boom N-wave pressure signature than perfectly expanded and <b>overexpanded</b> <b>nozzle</b> flows. A tail shock train in the sonic boom signature, similar to what was observed in the LaNCETS flight data, is observed for the highly underexpanded nozzle flow. The CFD results provide {{a detailed description of the}} nozzle flow physics involved in the LaNCETS nozzle at different nozzle expansion conditions and help in interpreting LaNCETS flight data as well as in the eventual CFD analysis of a full LaNCETS aircraft. The current study also provided important information on proper modeling of the LaNCETS aircraft nozzle. The primary objective of the current CFD research effort was to support the LaNCETS flight research data analysis effort by studying the detailed nozzle exhaust jet plume s imperfect expansion effects on the sonic boom signature of a supersonic aircraft. Figure 1 illustrates the primary flow physics present in the interaction between the exhaust jet plume shock and the sonic boom coming off of an axisymmetric body in supersonic flight. The steeper tail shock from highly expanded jet plume reduces the dip of the sonic boom N-wave signature. A structured finite-volume compressible full Navier-Stokes CFD code was used in the current study. This approach is not limited by the simplifying assumptions inherent in previous sonic boom analysis efforts. Also, this study was the first known jet plume sonic boom CFD study in which the full viscous nozzle flow field was modeled, without coupling to a sonic boom propagation analysis code, from the stagnation chamber of the nozzle to the far field external flow, taking into account all nonisentropic effects in the shocks, boundary layers, and free shear layers, and their interactions at distances up to 30 times the nozzle exit diameter from the jet centerline. A CFD solution is shown in Figure 2. The flow field is very complicated and multi-dimensional, with shock-shock and shockplume interactions.

The results suggest that very different shock structures and flow separation may appear depending on the nozzle contour as well as on the operating pressure and temperature ratios. In the case of TOP nozzle, the simulations reveal the existence of a small recirculation bubble at the vicinity of the secondary injection, due to a shock/boundary layer interaction. In addition, it has been shown that, at high temperature ratios, compressibility effects on the growth rate of the mixing layer, which develops between the main stream and the secondary jet injection, become significant and cannotbe neglected in the computation...|$|R

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{potential of}} space flight {{can be described}} as a quotient of system performance and system weight. The system costs are primarily dependent on this quotient. To increase the quotient focus has been on reducing the system weight. After exploiting numerous ways of reducing the system weight and finally reaching the limit of mechanical load capacities, the current aim is to increase the thrust-to-weight ratio of the rocket nozzle. This is achieved by reducing the divergent length and increase the specific momentum of the nozzle, i. e. increasing the expansion ratio. However, this may causes the <b>nozzle</b> to be <b>overexpanded</b> at sea level and thus provokes the flow to separate from the nozzle wall. The unsteady and asymmetric flow separation generates lateral forces on the nozzle wall, so called side loads, which can be of dimensioning size for the nozzle and the rocket structure and not at least for the payload. Extensive studies have been made through the years to understand the flow separation phenomena in <b>overexpanded</b> rocket <b>nozzles.</b> A better understanding could lead to better prevention or even control of flow separation. In addition, a reliable separation model is needed for accurate prediction of the side-loads experienced during start up and shut down of the engine. The aim of this thesis was to examine current separation models and try to develop a new semi-empirical model for hot gases. Focus was on the recirculation region where the flow is separated from the nozzle wall. A new model was developed to determine the pressure- and flow distribution in the recirculation region. The model includes various parameters of the jet- and ambient gas and can therefore be used for hot gases. Several steps of the model were validated with good agreement with experimental data and numerical results found in the literature. The complete model on the other hand showed poor agreement with experiment and further work must therefore be made before the model can be useful. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

In the work presented here, compressible LES simulations have been done for slightly <b>overexpanded</b> conical C-D <b>nozzle</b> with a Mach number of 1. 58 at NPR = 4. 0 and a free stream flow Mach number of 0. 1.

The acoustic field is expanded to the far field using the Kirchhoff integral method. The effect of injection frequency and pulsation characteristics on the flow-field and the radiated sound is investigated. Comparison is made between the LES and simulations and experiments for the steady-state and no injection cases and shows excellent agreement for the screech tone frequency and the predictided OASPL is within 2 dB deviation from the measurements. The pulsating injection cases investigated show that the frequency spectrum and the noise levels are sensitive to the injection frequency as well as pulsation characteristics.

40|$|Reducing {{noise of}} {{tactical}} jet aircraft {{has taken on}} fresh urgency as core engine technologies allow higher specific-thrust engines and as society become more concerned {{for the health of}} its military workforce. Noise reduction on this application has lagged the commercial field as incentives for quieting military aircraft have not been as strong as in their civilian counterparts. And noise reduction strategies employed on civilian engines may not be directly applicable due to the differences in exhaust system architecture and mission. For instance, the noise reduction technology of chevrons, examined in this study, will need to be modified {{to take into account the}} special features of tactical aircraft nozzles. In practice, these nozzles have divergent slats that are tied to throttle position, and at take off the jet flow is highly <b>overexpanded</b> as the <b>nozzle</b> is optimized for cruise altitude rather than sea level. In simple oil flow visualization experiments conducted at the onset of the current test program flow barely stays attached at end of nozzle at takeoff conditions. This adds a new twist to the design of chevrons. Upon reaching the nozzle exit the flow shrinks inward radially, meaning that for a chevron to penetrate the flow it must extend much farther away from the baseline nozzle streamline. Another wrinkle is that with a variable divergence angle on the nozzle, the effective penetration will differ with throttle position and altitude. The final note of realism introduced in these experiments was to simulate the manner in which bypass flow is bled into the nozzle wall in real engines to cool the nozzle, which might cause very fat boundary layer at exit. These factors, along with several other issues specific to the application of chevrons to convergent-divergent nozzles have been explored with particle image velocimetry measurements and are presented in this paper...|$|R
