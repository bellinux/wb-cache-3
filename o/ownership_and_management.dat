5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; {{reductions}} in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.|$|E

5|$|International Speedway Corporation (ISC) is a {{corporation}} whose primary business is the <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> of NASCAR and IndyCar race tracks.

The company has played an important, though controversial, role in the modernization of the sport. It has worked with NASCAR to create new tracks and update older ones in an effort to improve the racing and the experience for spectators (though because both companies have several members of the France family in top positions, ISC's competitors have filed multiple lawsuits on antitrust grounds) and has constructed popular new tracks in regions previously thought uninterested in NASCAR.|$|E
5|$|The late 1960s was a {{turbulent}} {{time for the}} club and pressure from fans led to a change of <b>ownership</b> <b>and</b> <b>management.</b> The problems started when the club was relegated from the first tier of English football for the third time, under manager Dick Taylor in 1967. Within two years, pressure from supporters had led to {{the resignation of the}} board of directors. The club was then relegated to the Third Division. In the 197172 season Aston Villa returned to the Second Division as champions with a record 70 points. In 1974 Ron Saunders was appointed manager and by 1975 he had led the club back into the First Division and into European competition. The club was back among the elite and it continued to have much success under Saunders and won the league in the 198081 season. Saunders' resignation halfway through the 198182 season came as a surprise, with the club in the quarter-final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his assistant manager Tony Barton who guided them to 10 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam. However, winning the cup marked a pinnacle and the club fell steadily down the League standings {{over the next five years}} and was relegated in 1987. However, the club was promoted the following year and achieved second place in the Football League in 1989.|$|E
