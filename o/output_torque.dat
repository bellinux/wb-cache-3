25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding <b>output</b> <b>torque</b> by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E

2500|$|Such a CMG {{includes}} two gimbals per rotor. [...] As an actuator, {{it is more}} versatile than a single-gimbal CMG because {{it is capable of}} pointing the rotor's momentum vector in any direction. [...] However, the torque generated by one gimbal's motion must often be reacted by the other gimbal {{on its way to the}} spacecraft, requiring more power for a given torque than a single-gimbal CMG. [...] If the goal is simply to store momentum in a mass-efficient way, as in the case of the International Space Station, dual-gimbal CMGs are a good design choice. [...] However, if a spacecraft instead requires large <b>output</b> <b>torque</b> while consuming minimal power, single-gimbal CMGs are a better choice.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least three}} {{single-axis}} CMGs {{are necessary for}} control of spacecraft attitude. [...] However, {{no matter how many}} CMGs a spacecraft uses, gimbal motion can lead to relative orientations that produce no usable <b>output</b> <b>torque</b> along certain directions. [...] These orientations are known as singularities and are related to the kinematics of robotic systems that encounter limits on the end-effector velocities due to certain joint alignments. [...] Avoiding these singularities is naturally of great interest, and several techniques have been proposed. [...] David Bailey and others have argued (in patents and in academic publications) that merely avoiding the [...] "divide by zero" [...] error that is associated with these singularities is sufficient. Two more recent patents summarize competing approaches. See also: Gimbal Lock.|$|E

2500|$|Most CMGs hold {{rotor speed}} {{constant}} using relatively small motors to offset changes due to dynamic coupling and non-conservative effects. [...] Some academic {{research has focused}} on the possibility of increasing and decreasing rotor speed while the CMG gimbals. [...] Variable-speed CMGs (VSCMGs) offer few practical advantages when considering actuation capability because the <b>output</b> <b>torque</b> from the rotor is typically much smaller than that caused by the gimbal motion. The primary practical benefit of the VSCMG when compared to the conventional CMG is an additional degree of freedom—afforded by the available rotor torque—which can be exploited for continuous CMG singularity avoidance and VSCMG cluster reorientation. Research has shown that the rotor torques required for these two purposes are very small and within the capability of conventional CMG rotor motors. Thus, the practical benefits of VSCMGs are readily available using conventional CMGs with alterations to CMG cluster steering and CMG rotor motor control laws. The VSCMG also {{can be used as a}} mechanical battery to store electric energy as kinetic energy of the flywheels.|$|E
