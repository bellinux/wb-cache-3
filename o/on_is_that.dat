25|$|Ultimately, the {{question}} of the order of composition remains unanswered, {{and the only thing that}} critics can agree <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all three plays (in whatever order) were written by early 1592 at the latest.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of string theory from early <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is not manifestly {{background}} independent. In string theory, one must typically specify a fixed reference geometry for spacetime, and all other possible geometries are described as perturbations of this fixed one. In his book The Trouble With Physics, physicist Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics claims {{that this is the}} principal weakness of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity, saying that string theory has failed to incorporate this important insight from general relativity.|$|E
25|$|The one {{tangible}} {{result that}} all the research continually focused <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher {{quality of life for}} disabled individuals. It can also be argued that the research upholds the idea that the cost per individual was lower for those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program than for those attending institutions for similar services. The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical {{to keep in mind that}} the HCBS waiver program varies state by state with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.|$|E

50|$|At a {{point during}} the operations, due {{to the risk of}} pilots {{ejecting}} over the USSR, excuses were worked out to explain why US pilots were found flying combat aircraft over the Soviet Union. The excuse they settled <b>on</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the USAF pilots were training IIAF pilots in their new aircraft and simply got lost. Typically by this stage an Iranian would pilot while a USAF officer would navigate.|$|R
2500|$|The {{etymology}} of sampi {{has given}} rise to much speculation.

2500|$|When, despite Abrams' expectations, {{the enemy}} {{still had not}} attacked, the U.S. air action became an issue.

50|$|AS-102 was {{designed}} to repeat the flight of AS-101. It would once again carry a boilerplate Apollo Command and Service Module. The only difference from Boilerplate 13 carried <b>on</b> AS-101 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> Boilerplate 15, one of the simulated Reaction Control System thruster quads (attitude control thrusters) was instrumented to record launch temperatures and vibrations. Another major difference <b>on</b> AS-102 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Launch Escape System (LES) tower would be jettisoned using the launch escape and pitch control motors. The mission used Apollo boilerplate BP-15.|$|R

What became clearer and clearer as the day went <b>on</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> all these children had a serious history of suffering behind them. This, however, was never referred to....In my conversations with the therapists and mothers, I inquired about the life stories of individual children. The facts confirmed my hunch. No one, however, was willing to take these facts seriously.|$|R

2500|$|A vertex {{that is not}} the {{endpoint}} of an edge in some {{partial matching}} [...] is called a free vertex. The basic concept that the algorithm relies <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of an augmenting path, a path that starts at a free vertex, ends at a free vertex, and alternates between unmatched and matched edges within the path. It follows from this definition that, except for the endpoints, all other vertices (if any) in augmenting path must be non-free vertices. An augmenting path could consist of only two vertices (both free) and single unmatched edge between them.|$|E
2500|$|On September 3, 2007 the New York Times {{reported}} that Hill met in Geneva {{for two days}} of one-on-one negotiations with Kim Kye-gwan, who heads the North Korean negotiating team, and that North Korea had agreed to disable its main nuclear fuel production plant {{by the end of}} 2007 and to account for all of its nuclear programs to international monitors. North Korea had also agreed to turn off its main nuclear reactor this summer. [...] "One thing that we agreed <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the D.P.R.K. will provide a full declaration of all of their nuclear programs and will disable their nuclear programs {{by the end of this}} year, 2007", Hill told reporters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{have been the}} subject of much debate, with various factors proposed and discounted or modified. The language of schizophrenia research under the medical model is scientific. [...] Such studies suggest that genetics, prenatal development, early environment, neurobiology and psychological and social processes are important contributory factors. Current psychiatric research into the development of the disorder is often based on a neurodevelopmental model [...] (proponents of which see schizophrenia as a syndrome.) However, schizophrenia is diagnosed on the basis of symptom profiles. Neural correlates do not provide sufficiently useful criteria. [...] "Current research into schizophrenia has remained highly fragmented, much like the clinical presentation of the disease itself". The one thing that researchers can agree <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> schizophrenia is a complicated and variable condition. It is best thought of as a syndrome, a cluster of symptoms that may or may not have related causes, rather than a single disease.|$|E

2500|$|One {{often cited}} {{description}} that Mandelbrot published to describe geometric fractals is [...] "a rough or fragmented geometric shape {{that can be}} split into parts, {{each of which is}} (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole"; this is generally helpful but limited. Authors disagree on the exact definition of fractal, but most usually elaborate on the basic ideas of self-similarity and an unusual relationship with the space a fractal is embedded in. One point agreed <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> fractal patterns are characterized by fractal dimensions, but whereas these numbers quantify complexity (i.e., changing detail with changing scale), they neither uniquely describe nor specify details of how to construct particular fractal patterns. In 1975 when Mandelbrot coined the word [...] "fractal", he did so to denote an object whose Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension is greater than its topological dimension. It has been noted that this dimensional requirement is not met by fractal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve.|$|E
2500|$|Endel Tulving {{originally}} described {{episodic memory}} as {{a record of}} a person's experience that held temporally dated information and spatio-temporal relations. A feature of episodic memory that Tulving later elaborates <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it allows an agent to imagine traveling back in time. A current situation may cue retrieval of a previous episode, so that context that colours the previous episode is experienced at the immediate moment. The agent is provided with a means of associating previous feelings with current situations. Semantic memory, on the other hand, is a structured record of facts, concepts, and skills that we have acquired. Semantic information is derived from accumulated episodic memory. Episodic memory {{can be thought of}} as a [...] "map" [...] that ties together items in semantic memory. For example, all encounters with how a [...] "dog" [...] looks and sounds will make up the semantic representation of that word. All episodic memories concerning a dog will then reference this single semantic representation of [...] "dog" [...] and, likewise, all new experiences with the dog will modify the single semantic representation of that dog.|$|E

50|$|Both sides found {{themselves}} {{the target of}} attacks from Unicron again; hordes of Terrorcon drones, sent by Alpha Quintesson to steal energon ore with which to revive the now-shattered husk of Unicron. What the alien did not count <b>on</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Megatron's spark had survived within the remains, and was siphoning energon from Unicron's body. Soon the Decepticon leader had revived himself in a new form, driven off Alpha Quintesson, and, along with an elite cadre of soldiers and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of mindless Terrorcon drones, begun his new plans for conquest.|$|R
