INFORMATION TO CDC This {{section is}} {{designed}} to help your agency report on d-up! activities for CDC’s National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation Data Set (NHM&E DS) using the Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS) software. Please refer to CDC’s National Monitoring and Evaluation Guidance for HIV Prevention Programs (CDC, 2008 a) and the Program Evaluation and Monitoring (PEMS) User Manual (CDC, 2008 b) for more detailed information on using the PEMS software. If your agency receives funds to implement d-up! from the health department or another agency, consult with that funding agency regarding specific data collection and reporting requirements. Two kinds of information about d-up! are required in NHM&E DS:* A. Program planning data or data <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>program</b> plan for the intervention B. Program implementation (referred to as “client services data”) or data on what you deliver (i. e., your implementation of intervention activities) and with whom * Disclaimer: The reporting requirements for the National HIV Prevention Program Monitorin...|$|E
40|$|As {{is often}} the case for me, my {{thoughts}} about this presentation crystallized a few hours before my deadline for carving it into digital stone. As a result, the title that I would now propose for this presentation appears nowhere <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>program.</b> This new and improved title is “Disability Studies: The Unexpected Guest in Health Law Discourse”. There is a certain irony perhaps that not only my title, but my virtual presence at this conference are all situated {{in the realm of the}} unexpected, but that irony is tangential to my present intentions. Let me explain first that my title comes from a commentary entitled, “Re-flections on Social Justice and Personal Identity” 1. The author, Adrienne Asch, a pioneer in disability studies, describes her experience of all-too-frequent reminders that, as a blind woman, she is an unanticipated participant in both professional and social gatherings. I’ll quote briefly, from an anecdote that Asch uses as point of departure for her reflections: Sitting beside a stranger waiting for a lecture to begin at an academic conference, the stranger whispers loudly not ‘Hello, my name is Carol,...|$|E
40|$|Who {{should read}} this material? : This packet is {{intended}} for epidemiologists or program staff members who are planning or currently serving as program managers for a field epidemiology training program. What is the FETP Standard Core Curriculum Project?: One of the challenges to those starting and maintaining a field epidemiology training program {{is the development of}} a detailed program curriculum based on identified competencies. Using best practices of both science and adult education, the epidemiologists, instructional designers and public health advisors in Coordinating Office for Global Health have collaborated to create this suggested standard core curriculum for a two-year training program. Who is the target audience of a Field Epidemiology Training program?: This curriculum was created based on the following assumptions:FETP Target Audience Participants: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Have health background 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Are available full time for formal training, field work & related Ministry of Health activities 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Have access to instructors and materials as needed 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Have basic computer skills, such as familiarity with basic hardware and software navigation 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Have access to required resources, including PC, email and internet access 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Require additional and consistent training during the entire two year program 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Take an active role in their education and vigorously seek solutions as issues arise 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Have the initiative to complete assignments in a timely mannerHow can this curriculum help me?: This curriculum provides guidelines to assist you in developing and managing your field epidemiology training program.

Gill presented an observation method for lazy functional languages that preserves the program's semantics. However, users need to define for each type how its values are observed: a laborious task and strictness of the program can easily be affected. Here we define how any value can be observed based on the structure of its type by applying generic programming frameworks. Furthermore we present an extension to specify per observation point how much to observe of a value. We discuss especially functional values and behaviour based on class membership in generic programming frameworks...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} {{five to ten years}} risk {{assessments}} have become a non-negotiable part of outdoor programs. This is partly driven by WHS Legislation and increasing interest in outdoor education from regulatory authorities, but also by a realisation from within the sector that a proactive approach to hazard identification and risk management is required to prevent serious injuries. Yet at the planning and practice level confusion remains as to how to approach this process in a meaningful way and not simply just a futile compliance exercise in ‘ticking the box’. As a practitioner and risk manager for many years, Clare has witnessed this challenge and has initiated strategies within both her own organisation and those that she consults with regularly; to attempt to empower staff at all levels more in relation to risk assessment. This interest has now led to a full-time PhD with the Accident Research Team at the University of the Sunshine Coast (USCAR) to develop a risk assessment tool for organised outdoor activities that adopt a ‘systems thinking’ approach. In this workshop, Natassia and Clare will discuss approaches and methods for conducting risk assessments that: 1) Address compliance requirements; and 2) attempt to focus on meaningful outcomes that align and compliment the desired aims of the program. Socio-technical systems theory will be discussed as a potential underpinning framework that can drive a more holistic and collaborative approach to risk assessments. They will aim to show that conducting a good risk assessment should not be a futile exercise; rather, that it can and should be an empowering, conscious and collaborative process of identifying and taking action to minimise the potential of serious injury or harm to participants and staff <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R

40|$|With {{heightened}} {{concern about}} global warming and rapidly-increasing fossil fuel prices, improving the energy efficiency of our home heating systems, appliances, and automobiles has become a priority for many of us. "Energy hogs " who waste energy, whether knowingly or inadvertently, contribute {{in a major way}} to the world climate and energy crises. Conversely, by modifying some of our behaviors to use energy more efficiently, we become more responsible citizens of the world, and can actually save some of our own money by consuming less energy. You can apply similar principles to <b>your</b> SAS <b>programming.</b> While it's true that revising your SAS code will probably not save any cuddly animal species from extinction, employing more energy-efficient SAS programming techniques will make you a better corporate citizen by reducing the load <b>on</b> <b>your</b> enterprise's servers, disk storage, and network bandwidth.
