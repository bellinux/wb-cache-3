40|$|Savonius rotor is a {{vertical}} axis rotor with simple {{in design and}} easy to fabricate at lower cost. The rotation of the rotor {{is due to the}} drag difference between the advancing blade and returning blade. Net driving force can be increased by reducing the reverse force on the returning blade or increasing the positive force on the advancing blade. Former can be realized by providing a flow obstacle to the returning blade and latter can be realized by concentrating the flow towards the advancing blade. The objective of the present work is to identify the optimal position of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> (on advancing blade side) placed upstream to the flow which would result in increase in power generated by the rotor. Tests are conducted to identify the optimum position of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> on the advancing blade side {{in the presence of a}} <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> on the returning blade side at its optimum position. Results suggest that two <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> placed at their optimal positions upstream to the flow increase the coefficient of power to 0. 35. This is significantly higher than the coefficient of power of 0. 14 observed for the rotor without <b>deflector</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises the two part work {{carried out}} during project 7 of work package 3 of the EU funded {{research}} project AMEDEO. At first, {{the outcome of}} a practical application and extension of a numerical coupled FEA-CFD methodology is presented. Extensive use is made of FEA (solids) and CFD (fluid) modelling techniques to understand the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a turbine stator well cavity, due to the interaction of cooling air supply with the main annulus. In this investigation, two different geometries (baseline and a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> design) with a specific amount of cooling air are modelled and the impact of the structural deflections on the heat transfer is investigated. The second part focuses on a CFD-based automated optimisation of a turbine stator well (TSW) geometry with an included stationary <b>deflector</b> <b>plate.</b> Experiments as well as numerical simulations have shown that due to the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> the cooling flow is fed more directly into the disc boundary layer, allowing more effective use of less cooling air, leading to improved engine efficiency. Therefore, the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> geometry is embedded in an automated optimisation loop to further reduce the amount of cooling air. The optimisation strategy concentrates on a flexible design parameterisation of the cavity geometry with <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and its implementation in an automatic 3 D meshing system. The parameterised geometry is optimised using a metamodel-assisted approach based on regressing Kriging in order to identify the optimum position and orientation of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> inside the cavity...|$|R
40|$|We have {{implemented}} a fast switching electrostatic {{system on the}} actinides beamline on the ANTARES accelerator at ANSTO, to improve the precision of analyses by accelerator mass spectrometry. This high-energy bouncing system {{is based on a}} pair of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> deflecting in the orbit plane, set at the entrance and exit of the analysing magnet. The design of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> is unique, and it was modelled by SIMION in order to minimize field inhomogenity and fringe field effects. The pair of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> are supplied by a high-voltage amplifier driven by an EPICS-enabled control unit, with two 4 W power supplies providing up to Â± 10 kV modulation. The high-energy bouncing system is synchronized with the existing low-energy bouncing system. To measure the isotopic ratio with the new system, the magnetic fields of the injector and analysing magnets are set to transmit selected isotopes along the beam line with zero voltage applied.

40|$|Low-pressure centre-pivot {{systems are}} usually {{equipped}} with spray head sprinklers {{that can have}} different types of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> and thus produce different drop sizes causing different effects on the infiltration process. Field tests using low-pressure (140 kPa) spray head sprinklers with smooth and medium groove <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> and maximum water applications rates between 99 and 125 mm/h were carried out in a Mediterranean soil. These tests {{made it possible to}} study the effect of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> on irrigation uniformity, runoff and sediment yield. Medium groove deflectors produce lower irrigation uniformity, but apply water with larger water droplets which are less affected by wind and can lead to less evaporation and wind drift losses. However, these droplets have higher impact energy over the soil surface, increasing surface sealing and crust formation, which reduce infiltration and increase runoff. Higher runoff amounts and soil particles detachment produced by grooved deflectors also lead to more sediment yield and soil erosion...|$|R

40|$|At present, it is {{a common}} {{practice}} to expose engine components to main annulus air temperatures exceeding the thermal material limit in order to increase the overall engine performance and to minimize the engine specific fuel consumption. To prevent overheating of the materials and thus the reduction of component life, an internal flow system is required to cool and protect the critical engine parts. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} insertion of a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> in turbine cavities leads to a more effective use of reduced cooling air, since the coolant is fed more effectively into the disk boundary layer. This paper describes a flexible design parameterization of an engine representative turbine stator well geometry with stationary <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and its implementation within an automated design optimization process using automatic meshing and steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Special attention and effort is turned to the flexibility of the parameterization method in order to reduce the number of design variables to a minimum on the one hand, but increasing the design space flexibility and generality on the other. Finally, the optimized design is evaluated using a previously validated conjugate heat transfer method (by coupling a finite element analysis (FEA) to CFD) and compared against both the nonoptimized deflector design and a reference baseline design without a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{possible}} to produce concentrated free surface water jets by rapidly accelerating a geometrically shaped curved <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> below the free water surface. This principle has been established using a self focusing electromagnetic acoustic source (FEMAS) and this report verifies it using a shock tube based mechanical analogue of that system. The shape, form and speed o f the water jets produced vary between the two systems. Discrete pressure measurements using a needle hydrophone positioned at different points below the free water surface are presented. The variation in pressure amplitudes recorded highlight the scatter and uncertainty inherent in a complex coupled system, while the form o f the pressure trace is dependant on the mechanical design o f the system in use and the position o f the needle hydrophone in the pressure field.

40|$|Engine {{components}} are commonly {{exposed to air}} temperatures exceeding the thermal material limit {{in order to increase}} the overall engine performance and to maximise the engine specific fuel consumption. To prevent the overheating of the materials and thus the reduction of the component life, an internal flow system must be designed to cool the critical engine parts and to protect them. As the coolant flow is bled from the compressor and not used for the combustion an important goal is to minimise the amount of coolant in order to optimise the overall engine performance. Predicting the metal temperatures is of paramount importance as they are a major factor in determining the component stresses and lives. In addition, as modern engines operate in ever harsher conditions due to efficiency requirements, the ability to predict thermo-mechanical displacements becomes very relevant: on the one hand, to prevent damage of components due to excessive rubbing, on the other hand, to understand how much air is flowing internally within the secondary air system for cooling and sealing purposes, not only in the design condition but throughout the engine life-span. In order to achieve this aero-engine manufacturers aim to use more and more accurate numerical techniques requiring multi-physics models, including thermo-mechanical finite elements and CFD models, which can be coupled in order to investigate small variations in temperatures and displacements. This thesis shows a practical application and extension of a numerical methodology for predicting conjugate heat transfer. Extensive use is made of FEA (solids) and CFD (fluid) modeling techniques to understand the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a turbine stator well cavity, due to the interaction of cooling air supply with the main annulus. Previous work based on the same rig showed diffculties in matching predictions to thermocouple measurements near the rim seal gap. In this investigation, further use is made of existing measurements of hot running seal clearances in the rig. The structural deflections are applied to the existing model to evaluate the impact in flow interactions and heat transfer. Furthermore, for one test case unsteady CFD simulations are conducted in order {{to take into account the}} flow unsteadiness in the heat transfer predictions near the rim. In addition to a baseline test case without net ingestion, a case simulating engine deterioration with net ingestion is validated against the available test data, also taking into account cold and hot running seal clearances. Furthermore an additional geometry with a stationary <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> is modelled and validated for the same flow cases. Experiments as well as numerical simulations have shown that due to the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> the cooling flow is fed more directly into the disc boundary layer, allowing more effective use of less cooling air, leading to improved engine efficiency.

40|$|Astrochemistry is {{the study}} of {{chemical}} reactions that occur in space. Due to the extremely low pressure and temperature in space, many unique reactions that are impossible on earth can occur in space. The rate of reactions that occur in the interstellar medium (ISM) is very low due to (1) the distance travelled before two molecules collide and (2) the charge of the reactants to trigger a reaction. The focus of the Perera research lab is to explore the possible gas phase reactions between ions and neutral molecules that may occur in the ISM. In order to simulate ISM conditions on earth it is necessary to construct a multi-stage instrument. The first stage of the instrument consists of a supersonic ion source. Between the first and second stage is a skimmer which helps to focus the ions. The second stage of the instrument contains the first set of ion optics, a set of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> which will condense the ions into a beam.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation to}} explore {{the characteristics of the}} initial drop screen which was formed by sprinkler heads at low water pressures was carried out. Two commercially available sprinkler heads (with thin and massive frame arms) were modified, {{not only in terms of}} <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> design, but also with respect to the orifice diameter, in order to decrease the flow and study the effect on liquid sheet thickness, initial sheet angle, sheet breakup distance and drop size distributions and their correspondence with the existing mathematical models. It was found that the addition of a boss in the sprinkler design had little impact on the average drop size and sheet breakup distance. The presence of the boss was found to influence the initial angle of the liquid sheet, which was in line with findings of previous researches. Longer slots on the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> did not change the initial angle of the sheet considerably, but did result in an earlier sheet breakup and smaller median drop diameter. A drop combustion sub-model was built, introducing two novel parameters: theoretical heat capacity (THC) and evaporate heat capacity (EHC), which could be used for estimating the actual heat capacity of the spray. In combination with the calculated drop size distribution in a spray screen, the combustion sub-model confirmed that sprinkler performance does not depend merely on provided flow, but rather on the drop size and the number of drops in a drop screen.
