By supporting a strong interdisciplinary research team, capable of exploring marine animals and plants as a sustainable source of materials for use as functional ingredients and foods, the vision for NutraMara was to position Ireland to the fore in use of marine bioresources as health beneficial ingredients. Sea Change—A Marine Knowledge, Research & Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007 - 2013 —was launched in early 2007 and was the outcome of extensive analysis and consultation with government departments, state agencies, industry and the third-level sector. It outlines {{a vision for the}} development of Ireland’s marine sector and sets clear objectives aimed at achieving this vision, namely to: 1. Assist existing, and largely indigenous, marine sub-sectors to improve their overall competitiveness and engage in activity that adds value to their outputs by utilising knowledge and technology arising from research. 2. Build new research capacity and capability and utilise fundamental knowledge and technology to create new marine-related commercial opportunities and companies. 3. Inform public policy, governance and regulation by applying the knowledge derived from marine research and monitoring. 4. Increase the marine sector’s competitiveness and stimulate the commercialisation of the marine resource in a manner that ensures its sustainability and protects marine biodiversity and ecosystems. 5. Strengthen the economic, social and cultural base of marine dependant regional/rural communities. The Sea Change strategy was developed {{as an integral part of}} the government’s Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) and the Marine Institute as the lead implementation agency is working within SSTI policy and with government departments and agencies to deliver on the Strategy. The Marine Institute managed Marine Research Sub-Programme, one of eight sub-programmes within the Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Programme of the National Development Plan 2007 — 2013, targets funding to meet the objectives of the Sea Change strategy.

40|$|The {{family of}} {{mammalian}} 2 -oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes (PDC, BCOADC and OGDC) are stable, high Mr assemblies composed of multiple copies of 3 separate enzymes (E 1, E 2 and E 3) that catalyse key stages in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Their respective E 1 and E 2 enzymes are complex-specific while E 3 is the identical gene product in all 3 complexes. In general terms, the oligomeric E 2 ‘cores’ provide the structural and mechanistic framework {{to which their}} partner E 1 and E 3 enzymes are tethered tightly but non-covalently. However, the mode of E 1 and E 3 binding differs significantly from complex to complex. In the BCOADC, its cubic E 2 core is composed of 24 identical subunits to which E 1 b and E 3 bind stably in a mutually-exclusive fashion via multiple subunit binding domains (SBDs). In a variation of this theme, the icosahedral (60 -meric) E 2 -PDC core comprises 2 types of subunit, E 2 and an E 2 -related polypeptide, E 3 binding protein (E 3 BP). In this case, E 1 p and E 3 bind independently to specific SBDs located on E 2 and E 3 BP, respectively. In contrast, OGDC differs significantly from its counterparts as its 24 -meric E 2 core does not contain any apparent SBDs. In addition, there is no equivalent to E 3 BP in this complex. Hence, how stable complex formation is achieved for the OGDC is still an area of active research, particularly in view of increasing evidence implicating OGDC deficiency as a major causative factor {{in a variety of}} neurodegenerative and oxidative stress disorders. Previous subunit-specific proteolysis, enzymatic and immunological studies on native bovine OGDC in our laboratory have suggested that an intact E 1 o N-terminal region is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the complex. In particular, a single cleavage of E 1 o at Arg 77 results in complete loss of OGDC function stemming from dissociation of both E 3 and a large, active E 1 o species (E 1 ') from the native E 2 core assembly. The principal aim of this thesis was to establish the location and precise nature of the domains responsible for protein-protein interactions between the constituent E 1 o, E 2 o and E 3 enzymes of OGDC and their roles in assembly, taking into account our previous data and the unique domain organisation of E 2. It was also a goal to produce a recombinant version of the human OGDC for future biomedical studies including genetic analysis of naturally-occurring mutant forms. Initially, the cloning, expression and purification of a series of E 1 o N-terminal constructs (His-tag, GST or MBP fusion proteins: 60, 90 and 153 a. a. s in length) is described extending from Ser 1 to Phe 153 of mature human E 1 <b>o.</b> <b>Access</b> to 10 - 30 mg of highly-purified E 1 o N-terminal peptides was required to enable testing of the ability of this region to interact with E 3 (and also E 2) employing a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques. High-level expression of full-length E 1 o was also achieved; however, attempts to produce active E 1 o in soluble form proved unsuccessful. Recombinant human E 2 o and E 3 were both produced as soluble active enzymes in high yield. A preliminary structural characterisation of the E 1 o N-terminal region was also undertaken employing synthetic peptides, circular dichroism and a basic bio-informatics approach. These studies demonstrated that the N-terminal region had the potential to form 2 short α-helical segments linked by regions of unstructured and flexible polypeptide chain. Moreover, a 3 D-structural prediction for mature, full-length human E 1 o confirmed that its N-termini were highly accessible, extending above the enzyme surface and situated in close proximity {{at one end of the}} homodimer. Although there was no apparent sequence homology, our data also suggested that this region had several of the main structural features of the E 3 -SBD located on E 3 BP. Direct evidence that the N-terminal region of E 1 bound to E 3 post-translationally was obtained using peptide array technology, alanine scanning, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), affinity chromatography and gel filtration (GFC). Interaction of E 1 o N-terminal peptides with E 3 was salt-sensitive and reduced over the range 0 - 0. 5 M NaCl, i. e. similar to that required to promote E 3 dissociation from intact OGDC. Only the longer E 1 o- 90 and E 1 o- 153 constructs complexed with E 3 and evidence suggested that steric hindrance by the fusion partner blocked E 3 binding to the short E 1 o- 60 GST fragment. As expected, in the absence of any obvious SBD on E 2 o, no direct interaction could be detected between E 2 o and E 3 using ITC or GFC. In addition, no post-translation association occurred between our purified E 1 o constructs and fully-assembled, oligomeric E 2 o. In contrast, co-expression of E 1 o- 90 and E 1 o- 153 constructs with E 2 o (but not E 1 o- 60) resulted in the formation of an E 1 o- 90 /E 2 o GST or E 1 o- 153 /E 2 o GST sub-complex. Moreover, these N-terminal E 1 o/E 2 o sub-complexes supported stable E 3 binding as judged by affinity chromatography and GFC. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis have established that the E 1 o N-terminal region is pivotal for mediating formation of a stable multi-enzyme assembly by directing self-integration with the E 2 o core during or immediately after synthesis and subsequently promoting high-affinity E 3 binding in a manner reminiscent of E 3 BP integration with the oligomeric E 2 -PDC core. To test the functional importance of the putative E 3 -binding domain on E 1 o, the E 1 o constructs were employed as inhibitors of OGDC and PDC activity since it was anticipated that they should displace E 3 from its normal binding site in the intact complexes. Incubation of OGDC or PDC with the E 1 o- 90 and E 1 o- 153 (but not E 1 o- 60) constructs caused preferential inhibition of OGDC activity. Conversely, an E 3 BP-SBD construct was a more effective inhibitor of PDC suggesting that the mode of E 3 interaction differs significantly in these 2 complexes. In summary, our data have provided (a) new insights into the structure, organisation and mode of assembly of the mammalian OGDC; (b) suggested new approaches to producing a recombinant model OGDC as an important biological tool for future biomedical and genetic studies and (c) raised new questions concerning the subunit composition, architecture, and stoichiometry of its core assembly. ...|$|E

It supports Lookup and Prefix-Matching operations with a constant internal memory and linear processing requirements. The number of disk accesses {{it takes to}} search for a string among n unique finite strings is bounded by Θ(log ∗ n), while for a prefix-matching operation it takes Θ(log ∗ n) + <b>O</b> (n B <b>accesses,</b> where B is the size of one page in the flash memory.) disk...|$|R
