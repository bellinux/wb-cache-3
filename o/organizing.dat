40|$|<b>Organized</b> crime {{scholars}} have paid scant attention to gender and stereotyped roles {{of women in}} the commission of <b>organized</b> crime activities. Traditionally, <b>organized</b> crime is seen as a form of criminality perpetrated by men only. Women are usually portrayed as victims of <b>organized</b> crime or as “mean girls”, girlfriends, wives, lovers of brides of notorious gangsters and mobsters. In the southern African context, little historical or comparative data is available on {{the role of women in}} <b>organized</b> crime. Existing data is basic and proceeds on the assumption of gender-neutrality or the implied male composition of <b>organized</b> crime groups. The link of women to <b>organized</b> crime is one of suffering and exploitation. However, in reality women fulfill varied roles and functions within transnational <b>organized</b> crime networks in the region. In some instances, they are the foot soldiers of drug and human trafficking syndicates. Sometimes they are the intermediaries or powerful matriarchs at the apex of transnational <b>organized</b> crime networks. Reliant on empirical findings undertaken for a regional 3 -year project on <b>organized</b> crime trends in southern Africa, this paper will examine the dynamism of the role of women in <b>organized</b> crime in the region and argues that women play a multifaceted role with implications for themselves, their families, society and <b>organized</b> crime. Gender mainstreaming within scholarly literature and policy research is in nascent stages, this paper pleads for a more gender-sensitive approach to <b>organized</b> crime analysis...|$|R
