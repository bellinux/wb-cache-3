40|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the strengths of adhesively bonded metallic and <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> steel has been hindering proper application of these metallic materials for practical purpose in Australia. To address this problem, first an extensive database on the initial joint strengths were compiled. Lap shear test and Width Tapered Cantilever Beam test geometries were employed for evaluating the average stress at failure and the fracture energy of adhesive joints respectively. By observing the mechanism of failure and the data on joint strengths, reasons explaining why some adhesives formed a stronger joint than the others were determined. Extensive surface characterisation techniques by SEM, AFM and contact angle goniometer were utilised for these investigations. It was evident from these studies that a correlation existed between the joint fracture energy 2 ̆ 7 Gc 2 ̆ 7 and total thermodynamic work of adhesion 2 ̆ 7 Wa 2 ̆ 7. The acid - base interaction between adhesive and adherend was found to be influencing the joint strength. 2 ̆ 7 Gc 2 ̆ 7 was affected by the bulk fracture energy of the adhesive 2 ̆ 7 Ga 2 ̆ 7. It was evident that a joint strength model could be developed on the basis of some correlation between 2 ̆ 7 Gc 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Wa 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Ga 2 ̆ 7. For the estabhshment of the model, polished steels and unfilled adhesives were selected. A statistical software package was utilised for correlating 2 ̆ 7 Gc 2 ̆ 7 with 2 ̆ 7 Wa 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Ga 2 ̆ 7, thereby establishing a model for predicting initial joint strengths. The durability of adhesive joints on exposure to a harsh environment were observed by exposing lap shear and 2 ̆ 7 wedge test 2 ̆ 7 samples to a proper environment. The mechanism of failure were also studied by unaided eye. Moisture absorption studies were also carried out using epoxy and polyurethane adhesives. It was observed that although a decrease in joint strength of epoxy bonded joints every month may be related to moisture absorption, the overall strength retention may not depend on this factor alone. For polyurethane adhesive, joint strength decay was influenced to a greater extent by the adhesion mechanisms rather than moisture absorption...|$|R
40|$|AbstractApplication of {{the coating}} to {{material}} {{in a flat}} condition has economical, technological and ecological advantages. As the material is subsequently formed into shape not only the base material needs to withstand this process but the coating as well. Development of forming tools for coated metals is mainly concerned with the prediction of performance of the base material and does not analyse {{the condition of the}} coating. However, during the forming process, major surface damage can occur when the <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> is bent and unbent around the die geometry. To reduce surface damage of coatings, proper control of the parameters during forming and a detail study of the surface conditions is required. This research is conducted on metallically and organically <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> material which is commonly used for structural applications. The crack density of the coating is analysed during a deep drawing process and a forming limit diagram is obtained from the biaxial straining of the prepainted steel samples. The results show that cracks initiate from within the <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> and are linked to the strain in the base material...|$|R

In sheet metal forming processes, the usage of liquid lubricants can be decreased by using self lubricated tribo surfaces which will result in more environmentally friendly workshops. In the present work two different concepts, i. e. the deposition of thin organic coatings on the steel sheet and PVD coatings on the tool, have been evaluated. The sheet materials investigated include Zn and 55 %Al-Zn metal <b>coated</b> steel <b>sheet,</b> which in general are difficult materials to form under dry conditions since they are sticky and thus have a high tendency to adhere to the tool surface. The PVD coatings include CrN, TiN and various DLC coatings. The work comprises tribo testing and post test characterisation using surface analytical techniques in order to evaluate the tribological properties of the tribo surfaces. The tribological tests of different tribo couples were conducted by using modified scratch testing and ball-on-disc testing. From these test results different friction and wear mechanisms have been identified. The deposition of thin organic coatings on the steel sheet metal {{has been found to be}} promising in order to control the friction and to avoid metal-metal contact resulting in galling. However, it has been found that the tribological characteristics of <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> steel <b>sheet</b> are strongly influenced by coating chemical composition, the substrate surface topography and the coating thickness distribution. The performance of the PVD coatings depends mainly on the chemical composition and topography of the coated surface. By choosing PVD coatings such as diamond like carbon (DLC) low and stable friction coefficients can be obtained in sliding contact against Zn. Surface irregularities such as droplet-like asperities may cause an initial high friction coefficient. However, after a running in process or by polishing the PVD coating low friction coefficients can be obtained resulting in a stable sliding contact. The combination of imaging (optical profilometry, LOM, SEM) and chemical analytical techniques (EDS, AES, ToF-SIMS) gave valuable information concerning the friction and wear properties of the tribo surfaces investigated...|$|R
40|$|Polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal {{components}} find diverse applications in many industries. The manufacturing {{of the components}} generally involves forming of sheet metal into the desired shape and coating of the formed part with <b>organic</b> <b>coating.</b> An alternative manufacturing route is to <b>coat</b> the <b>sheet</b> metal first before forming. The change in the manufacturing sequence can potentially improve cost and reduce environmental impact. This approach, however, requires the coating to survive the deformation process. Thus, the effect of plastic deformation on coating adhesion is of primary interest to many engineers and researchers. This research aims at developing a methodology to predict the adhesion of coating after metal forming processes. A pull-off apparatus that measures the coating pull-off stress was used to indicate the coating adhesion strength. Several types of specimen were designed to obtain uniaxial tension, biaxial tension, and tension-compression deformation modes on pre-coated sheet by using a uniaxial tensile tester. Experimental results from two selected polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metals show that coating adhesion was affected by plastic deformation. An analytical model based on a virtual interface crack concept was developed to indicate the adhesion potential of the coating-substrate interface. From interfacial fracture mechanics, the initial adhesion potential {{is defined as the}} energy release rate characterized by the virtual interface crack and the initial pull-off stress. The analytical model was used to predict coating adhesion loss after deformation in uniaxial tension mode. The analytical model predictions agreed well with experimental results. Finite element analysis tool was applied to simulate more complex deformation modes in stamping of <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> meals. The stress field near the interface crack tip was used to calculate the energy release rate and predict the adhesion loss under different deformation modes. The predictions obtained from numerical method are also in good agreements with the experimental results in biaxial tension and tension-compression modes. The research has led {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of plastic deformation on coating adhesion. The developed adhesion test methods can be used to generate useful information on coating durability for diverse practical use. It is also expected that the results of the research will facilitate the development of better polymer <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal to be used in sheet metal forming processes...|$|R

In order to extend the service life of the <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> copper a specific surface pre-treatment is often required. Nevertheless, probably because of the limited market of this application, no specific pre-treatments for copper are industrially developed, {{with the exception of}} cleaning procedures, but simply extensions of existing pre-treatments optimised for other metals (aluminium, zinc, magnesium alloys) are used.

Medical implants such as stents, bone screws and bone plates could be made by biodegradable metals. These implants would serve their purpose within the patient’s body and disintegrate harmlessly, eliminating a need for removal surgeries. Magnesium is a prime contender as a biodegradable metal due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Surface modification techniques are needed to enable its suitability for specific applications. For example, localized deliveries of drugs are needed from cardiovascular stents to treat restenosis while localized deliveries of antibiotics are needed from bone plates to treat post-operative infections. These surface coating techniques should not significantly change the underlying corrosion behavior of Magnesium while providing localized drug delivery. <b>Organic</b> <b>coating</b> such as self-assembled monolayers is a technique {{which could be used}} for localized delivery of drugs and antibiotics from the surface of magnesium. This research aims to evaluate the bio corrosion behavior of these <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> magnesium alloys.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{properties of}} magnesium alloys, especially the high strength/weight ratio, make them desirable {{materials in the}} automotive industry. However, their high corrosion susceptibility has greatly limited or even prevented their larger scale use for various applications. <b>Organic</b> <b>coating</b> {{is one of the}} most effective ways to prevent magnesium alloys from corrosion. In this report, the recent progress of organic coatings on magnesium alloys and techniques for evaluating the performance of organic coatings are reviewed. As a critical layer in a normal <b>coating</b> system, <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> has great potential to prevent magnesium alloys from corrosion attack. However, some unsolved problems currently limit the application of organic coatings. Firstly, organic coatings usually have poor adhesion if they are applied without an appropriate pre-treatment. Sol-gel coating or plasma polymerization requires the least pre-treatment prior to deposition. However, the corrosion and wear resistance of these coatings have not been documented. Secondly, it is difficult to prepare a uniform, pore-free organic layer. So, it is usually necessary to apply multiple layers of these coatings to provide sufficient/optimum corrosion and wear resistance. Finally, a number of <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> techniques are still solvent based, which poses an environmental concern. New water-borne and powder coating technologies should be developed. In order to evaluate the performance of organic coatings on magnesium, both electrochemical and non-electrochemical techniques have been developed. Information from different techniques gives insight into the organic coating/magnesium alloy interface in different aspects. Comprehensive knowledge about the interface is indispensible for understanding the degradation of the <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> and developing new coating strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.
