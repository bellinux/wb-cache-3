Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments. The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles A and B signified the elevation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>native</b> Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.|$|E
5|$|Spanish Hill is a hill {{located in}} the borough of South Waverly, Pennsylvania. The hill is {{controversial}} among historians and archaeologists; opinions regarding the origin of structures found on the site vary from embankments created by early farmers, to the remnants <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Native</b> American village and battlements, due to the site's similarity to the description found {{in the account of}} Étienne Brûlé of a settlement called Carantouan. The area in the hill's vicinity was previously occupied by Susquehannock Native Americans. It was a common site for both amateur and professional archaeology, as well as relic hunting. The source of the name remains unknown, but various theories have been proposed as to its origin.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing {{threat to the}} remaining native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords began {{to build their own}} castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>native</b> Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} team began site excavation on March 3. Workers excavated artifacts {{dating to}} around 1150 AD.

Archaeologists believe the area was the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Native</b> American settlement and that the artifacts were the remnants of a workshop where mineral water from underground sulfur-bearing springs was boiled to collect salt. The artifacts are on permanent display in the Tennessee State Museum's Mississippian Period exhibit. A portion of the property was used as a city cemetery in the 1800s. The interred were relocated.|$|E

At UCLA, he was a four sport athlete and graduated in 1939 with a bachelor's degree in Banking and Finance. He intended to work alongside his father in real estate and banking but instead joined the military upon the outbreak of World War II.|$|E

5|$|Ex parte Crow Dog, , is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States that followed {{the death of one}} member <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Native</b> American tribe at the hands of another on reservation land. Crow Dog {{was a member of the}} Brulé band of the Lakota Sioux. On August5, 1881 he shot and killed Spotted Tail, a Lakota chief; there are different accounts of the background to the killing. The tribal council dealt with the incident according to Sioux tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution to the dead man's family. However, the U.S. authorities then prosecuted Crow Dog for murder in a federal court. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang. The Supreme Court held that unless authorized by Congress, federal courts had no jurisdiction to try cases where the offense had already been tried by the tribal council. Crow Dog was therefore released. This case was the first time in history that an Indian was held on trial for the murder of another Indian. The case led to the Major Crimes Act in 1885, which placed some major crimes (initially seven, now 15) under federal jurisdiction if committed by an Indian against another Indian on a reservation or tribal land. This case was the beginning of the plenary power legal doctrine that has been used in Indian case law to limit tribal sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} on the Gregorian mission comes from Bede's narrative, and this reliance on one source necessarily leaves the picture of native missionary efforts skewed. First, Bede's information is mainly from the north and the east of Britain. The western areas, where the native clergy was strongest, was an area little covered by Bede's informants. In addition, although Bede presents the native church as one entity, in reality the native British were divided into a number of small political units, which makes Bede's generalisations suspect. The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the Libellus points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity. Besides the text of the Libellus contained within Bede's work, other versions of the letter circulated, some of which included a question omitted from Bede's version. Wood argues that the question, which dealt with the cult <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>native</b> Christian saint, is only understandable if this cult impacted Augustine's mission, which would imply that Augustine had more relations with the local Christians than those related by Bede.|$|E
