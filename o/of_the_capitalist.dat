5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitalist</b> system that had been erased by communism.

The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E

The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed {{it would be impossible to}} meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The collectivisation process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
5|$|Weber's essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is {{his most}} famous work. It is argued that this work should {{not be viewed as}} a {{detailed}} study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the economic system. In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber put forward the thesis that Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy. Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant. Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitalist</b> economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.|$|E

25|$|For Sonja Weinberg, as {{distinct}} from economic and religious anti-Judaism, antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences.

25|$|Educational {{attainment}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} prominent determinants of class status. As educational attainment represents expertise, which is a necessary component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitalist</b> market system, its ownership may be seen as the ownership of one of the factors of production.

Those with higher educational attainment tend to be positioned in occupations with greater autonomy, influence over the organizational process, and better financial compensation.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March 1864, the Russian authority, {{compelled}} by the uprising {{to compete for}} the loyalty of Polish peasants, officially published an enfranchisement decree in Congress Poland along the lines of an earlier land reform proclamation of the insurgents.

25|$|Freegans' {{rejection}} of veganism is often tied to their discovery of food waste, estimated as up to 40% {{of the food}} supply in the United States and other Western countries.

Moreover, the presence of food in supermarket dumpsters shows, according to some freegans, that the vegan theory of social change is flawed, because markets do not efficiently translate consumer preferences into changes in production.|$|E

2500|$|Liberalism {{increasingly}} shaped American {{intellectual life}} in the 1930s and 1940s, {{thanks in large part}} to two major two-volume studies that were widely read by academics, advanced students, intellectuals and the general public: Charles A.

The Beards exposed the material forces that shaped American history, while Parrington, focused on the material forces that shaped American literature. Virtually all political history, according to the Beards, involved the bitter conflict between the agrarians, farmers and workers, led by the Jeffersonians, and <b>the</b> <b>capitalists,</b> led by <b>the</b> Hamiltonians. The Civil War marked a great triumph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitalists,</b> and comprised <b>the</b> [...] "Second American Revolution."

25|$|To {{maximise}} {{the potential}} of new, white-run farms, the Company launched a wide-scale land settlement programme for white settlers. As part of this drive it reorganised the geographical distribution of native reserve areas, moving the reserves and often reducing them in size where the land was of particularly high quality. To ensure that the white farmers would retain the reliable access to markets that the nascent railway network provided, tribal reserve boundaries in various relevant places were redrawn by the Company to place the railway lines outside. The new hut taxes concurrently compelled black peasants to find paid work, which {{could be found in}} the new agricultural industry, though most tribesmen were reluctant to abandon their traditional lifestyles in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitalist</b> labour market. Managers at farms and mines often had great trouble sourcing sufficient manpower.|$|E
25|$|Since its foundation, {{the socialist}} party has opposed every war – {{including}} both World War I and World War II. Although, in its early years, party writers frequently would contrast the numbers of dead in wars with the numbers killed and maimed in industrial incidents (by {{way of trying to}} contrast the passions and efforts put into war with the lack of response to the conditions of capitalism) the party argued that wars in capitalism were fought in the interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitalist</b> class and – as with their case against nationalism – the workers did all the dying for no gain for themselves. Further, they emphasised that while the press and politicians tried to call for strike moderation, the capitalists would continue the class war despite hostilities, forcing down wages and up consumer good prices. During both wars, some members won Conscientious objector status.|$|E
25|$|In October 1987 the Guildford branch {{circulated}} {{an internal}} discussion document {{arguing that the}} growing socialist movement would have a profound economic impact on the operation of capitalism before the overthrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitalist</b> class and the formal establishment of socialism. They claimed that socialists would use their influence politically (through the legislature and local councils) to adjust patterns of state income and expenditure in ‘socialistic’ directions, including the provision of free services. Drawing inspiration from writers like André Gorz, they also claimed that socialists would be encouraging {{the growth of the}} non-monetary, voluntary sector of the economy and should be instrumental in developing support networks for co-operatives and LETS schemes. This critique of the Party's revolutionary strategy was vigorously rebutted in other circulars from branches and members and at Party conference. A small number of proponents of the Guildford perspective resigned. They went on to publish the journal Spanner, so-called because it aimed to ‘span’ opinion across the non-market socialist sector of political thought, and in recent years some have been instrumental in founding the small World In Common group.|$|E
