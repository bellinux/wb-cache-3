5|$|When Bligh {{landed in}} England on 14 March 1790, {{news of the}} mutiny had preceded {{him and he was}} fêted as a hero. In October 1790 at a formal court-martial for the loss of Bounty, he was honourably acquitted <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss and was {{promoted}} to post-captain. As an adjunct to the court martial, Bligh brought charges against Purcell for misconduct and insubordination; the former carpenter received a reprimand.|$|E
5|$|Bligh {{had landed}} in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly {{promoted}} to post-captain. In the following months {{he wrote his}} account of the mutiny, and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at court martial <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bounty's loss. Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London. Bligh would be gone for more than two years, and would thus be absent from the court martial proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Her oft {{worn-out}} {{and poor}} condition contributed to her being wrecked when in June 1809 she grounded on an uncharted shoal {{in the mouth}} of the River Plate, whilst seeking shelter with the rest of her squadron from a storm. All hands and most of the ship's stores were saved, but the condition of the ship's timbers made it impossible to free the ship; her captain was cleared <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ship's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. Recently, the wreck of Agamemnon has been located, and several artefacts have been recovered, including one of her cannons.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August, the Jewish Community Centre in Palmotićeva Street in Zagreb, and Jewish graves at the Mirogoj Cemetery, were bombed {{as a part}} of Operation Labrador. The explosions caused {{property}} damage, but {{resulted in}} no casualties. There were no public claims <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attack. Aside from the two explosions in Zagreb, agents assigned to Operation Labrador were thought to also be responsible for bombing the Zagreb–Belgrade railway near Vinkovci and a railway line between Glina and Vojnić. The railway attacks have also been ascribed to Operation Opera.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{was down}} to half {{strength}} when it was withdrawn from the front line on Leyte for a brief rest in January 1945, but few reinforcements arrived before it was ordered to move to Luzon, where it disembarked over the beaches at San Fabian on 27 January 1945. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered the 1st Cavalry Division's commander, Major General Vern D. Mudge, to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. For this, Mudge formed three flying columns. Initially, Chase's 1st Brigade's mission was to follow one of the columns but on 1 February he was relieved <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{main body of the}} 1st Brigade and placed in command of all three flying columns.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{government}} {{agreed to}} pay compensation for the damaged property {{but not for the}} actual victims of the massacre, although Bayard was inclined to resist the requests for payments. In a letter to the minister of China's Washington legation dated February 18, 1886, he expressed a personal view that the violence against Chinese immigrants was precipitated by their resistance to cultural assimilation, and that racism against Chinese was typically found among other immigrants rather than the majority of the populace: Denby's predictions caused Bayard to seek a Congressionally appropriated indemnity. At Bayard's urging, the U.S. Congress provided US$147,748.74 as an indemnity. The compensation was made as a monetary gift and not as a legal decree <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> massacre and the outcome amounted to a minor diplomatic victory for China.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
