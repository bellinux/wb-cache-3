40|$|The {{geometrical}} coupling between {{strain and}} twist in double helices is investigated. <b>Overwinding,</b> where strain leads to further winding, {{is shown to}} be a universal property for helices, which are stretched along their longitudinal axis when the initial pitch angle is below the zero-twist angle (39. 4 deg). Unwinding occurs at larger pitch angles. The zero-twist angle is the unique pitch angle at the point between <b>overwinding</b> and unwinding, and it is independent of the mechanical properties of the double helix. This suggests the existence of zero-twist structures, i. e. structures that display neither <b>overwinding,</b> nor unwinding under strain. Estimates of the <b>overwinding</b> of DNA, chromatin, and RNA are given. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures; typos fixed; added ref. and acknowledgemen...|$|R
40|$|As {{sections}} of a strand duplexed DNA denature {{when exposed to}} high temperature, the excess linking number is {{taken up by the}} undenatured portions of the molecule. The mechanical energy that arises because of the <b>overwinding</b> of the undenatured sections can, in principle, alter the nature of the thermal denaturation process. Assuming that the strains associated with this <b>overwinding</b> are not relieved, we find that a simple model of strain-altered melting leads to a suppression of the melting transition when the unaltered transition is continuous. When the melting transition is first order in the absence of strain associated with <b>overwinding,</b> the modification is to a third order phase transition.

40|$|To {{understand}} how underwinding and <b>overwinding</b> the DNA helix affects its structure, we simulated 19 independent DNA systems with fixed degrees of twist using molecular dynamics {{in a system}} that does not allow writhe. Underwinding DNA induced spontaneous, sequence-dependent base flipping and local denaturation, while <b>overwinding</b> DNA induced the formation of Pauling-like DNA (P-DNA). The winding resulted in a bimodal state simultaneously including local structural failure and B-form DNA for both underwinding and extreme <b>overwinding.</b> Our simulations suggest that base flipping and local denaturation may provide a landscape influencing protein recognition of DNA sequence to affect, for examples, replication, transcription and recombination. Additionally, our findings help explain results from single-molecule experiments and demonstrate that elastic rod models are strictly valid on average only for unstressed or overwound DNA up to P-DNA formation. Finally, our data support a model in which base flipping can result from torsional stress...|$|R
50|$|As {{long as the}} {{mainspring}} is {{less than}} fully wound, the bridle holds the mainspring by friction to the barrel wall, allowing the mainspring to be wound. When the mainspring reaches full wind, its force is stronger than the bridle spring, and further winding pulls the bridle loose from the notches and it simply slides along the wall, preventing the mainspring from being wound further. The bridle must grip the barrel wall {{with just the right}} force to allow the mainspring to wind fully but not <b>overwind.</b> If it grips too loosely, the bridle will begin to slip before the mainspring is fully wound, a defect known as 'mainspring creep' which results in a shortened reserve power time.|$|E

The conclusion of the technology study is that a mechanical safety device is necessary to support current systems. It was decided to concentrate on vertical shafts as these pose the bigger problem.

40|$|The {{compaction}} of chromatin {{that occurs}} when cells enter mitosis {{is probably the most}} iconic process of dividing cells. Mitotic chromosomal compaction or ‘condensation’ is functionally linked to resolution of chromosomal intertwines, transcriptional shut-off and complete segregation of chromosomes. At present, understanding of the molecular events required to convert interphase chromatin into mitotic chromosomes is limited. Here, we review recent advances in the field, focusing on potential chromosomal compaction mechanisms and their importance to chromosome segregation. We propose a model of how metaphase chromosomes could be shaped based on the enzymatic activities of condensin and topoisomerase II in <b>overwinding</b> and relaxation of the DNA fiber during mitosis. We suggest that condensin <b>overwinding</b> is an important requirement for intertwine resolution by topoisomerase II and, together with the inhibition of transcription, contributes to cytological mitotic chromosome appearance or ‘condensation...|$|R
50|$|Topoisomerases are {{enzymes that}} {{participate}} in the <b>overwinding</b> or underwinding of DNA. The winding problem of DNA arises due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure. During DNA replication and transcription, DNA becomes overwound ahead of a replication fork. If left unabated, this torsion would eventually stop the ability of DNA or RNA polymerases involved in these processes to continue down the DNA strand.|$|R

40|$|DNA {{supercoiling}} is {{a fundamental}} biological process occurring in all cells. We developed a theory of braiding (supercoiling) {{of a pair of}} DNA molecules that takes into account the contribution of the bending and the electrostatic energy. The electrostatic interaction was calculated {{within the framework of the}} Kornyshev-Leikin theory of DNA interactions, which takes into account realistic helical patterns of charge. Because of the chirality of the charge patterns, we predict that left-handed braiding of a pair of DNA molecules is more favourable than right-handed braiding. Applying our model to the case of closed loop DNA supercoiling and to single molecule DNA micromanipulations, we predict novel effects that have not yet been experimentally observed. We show that supercoiling may occur in topologically relaxed plasmids, as a consequence of attractive chiral forces. We speculate about the potential biological role of the predicted effects in the case of topoisomerase action, and the occurrence of positively supercoiled DNA in hyperthermophilic bacteria and archea. Our findings also suggest alternative an explanation of well-known experiments that proved that divalent ions <b>overwind</b> DNA. We also give an explanation for pairing of homologous DNA molecules in monovalent salt, and explain the occurrence of tight supercoiling observed in cryo-electron and atomic force microscopy. The analysis of existing experimental data shows that in most cases the chiral effects that we predict remain elusive. The theory therefore awaits final experimental verification.

40|$|The topological {{state of}} DNA in hyperthermophilic archaea appears to {{correspond}} to a linking excess in comparison with DNA in mesophilic organisms. Since DNA binding proteins often contribute to the control of DNA topology by affecting DNA geometry {{in the presence of}} DNA topoisomerases, we tested whether the histone-like protein Sso 7 d from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus alters DNA conformation. In ligase-mediated supercoiling assays carried out at 37, 60, 70, 80 and 90 degrees C we found that DNA binding of increasing amounts of Sso 7 d led to a progressive decrease in plasmid linking number (Lk), producing negative supercoiling. Identical unwinding effects were observed when recombinant non-methylated Sso 7 d was used. For a given Sso 7 d concentration the DNA unwinding induced was augmented with increasing temperature. However, after correction for the <b>overwinding</b> effect of high temperature on DNA, plasmids ligated at 60 - 90 degrees C exhibited similar sigma values at the highest Sso 7 d concentrations assayed. These results suggest that Sso 7 d may play a compensatory role in vivo by counteracting the <b>overwinding</b> effect of high temperature on DNA. Additionally, Sso 7 d unwinding could be involved in the topological changes observed during thermal stress (heat and cold shock), playing an analogous role in crenarchaeal cells to that proposed for HU in bacteria...|$|R

25|$|The Sidewinder is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} the drawbacks of the stacked design.

Thus, unlike stacked coils, output is hotter since the net effect is to add rather than subtract the signal between the coils; thus, the impedance can be lower, avoiding <b>overwinding</b> to obtain sufficient output. There is less signal cancellation. Sonically these sit somewhere between a true P-90 and a stacked pickup. They don't chime but they aren't nasal or lifeless either.
