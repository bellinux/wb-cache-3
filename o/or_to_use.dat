The seeds are {{generally}} too small for birds to feed on, although the American goldfinch {{has been reported to}} consume them. Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves (Hawaiian goose) or flowers (palila), <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the plant as a source when foraging for insects (white-headed woodpecker).|$|E

The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|The playable {{character}} can lead {{a group of}} three additional allies into battle, controlling their actions to attack a single enemy <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> specific powers. Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or staking—having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.|$|E

5|$|Dual Destinies was {{the first}} game in the main series to be {{developed}} for the Nintendo 3DS; this move from the Nintendo DS to the Nintendo 3DS {{was the most difficult}} part of the development, with the development team being unsure of whether to use 2D graphics like with previous games <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> 3D models. Eventually they decided to use 3D graphics, because of the stereoscopic 3D effect being a selling point for the Nintendo 3DS system. Because of the move to 3D, the in-house artist Takuro Fuse was in charge of the art direction, rather than the series regular Tatsuro Iwamoto, so that they could have meetings about the art more often. This was Fuse's first work on the main series, so he initially had problems with making character designs that fit the series, and had to get a lot of feedback from Eshiro. According to Eshiro and Yamazaki, they put effort into the graphics, wanting to ensure that Dual Destinies graphics looked better than those of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} electrical grid, {{and local}} transformers in particular, {{may not have}} enough capacity to handle the additional power load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume {{three times as much}} electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles in the same neighborhood recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight, when rates are lower.|$|E

25|$|Until June 12, 2009, {{a section}} of I-40 through {{downtown}} Knoxville between James White Parkway and Hall of Fame Drive was completely closed to all traffic for about 18 months for reconstruction.

The four-lane section, which was quite substandard, congested, and accident-prone, was widened to six lanes to improve traffic flow and safety.
