2500|$|Mammomonogamus is a genus of {{parasitic}} nematodes of {{the family}} Syngamidae that parasitise the respiratory tracts of cattle, sheep, goats, deer, cats, orangutans, and elephants. The nematodes can also infect humans and cause the disease called mammomonogamiasis.

Infection in humans is very rare, with only about 100 reported cases worldwide, and {{is assumed to be}} largely accidental. Cases have been reported from the Caribbean, China, Korea, Thailand, and Philippines. The worm usually inhabits the upper-respiratory region in the trachea, bronchus, or larynx, and can elicit chronic coughing and asthma-like symptoms. One interesting case from Thailand reported finding worms in the patient's duodenum, suggesting M. laryngeus can also be a gastrointestinal parasite. More research is needed because the life cycle is not completely known. Diagnosis is made by recovering the worms on bronchoscopy or <b>oesophagogastroduodenoscopy.</b> Due to the scant amount of information available on this parasite in literature, increased awareness is necessary, especially in endemic areas near M. laryngeus’ reservoir hosts, for clinicians, the local population in the endemic area, and traveling tourists, to effectively recognize and prevent mammomonogamiasis.|$|E

Materials and Methods: The study is a descriptive one which was carried out at the endoscopy unit of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital, (LAUTECH), Osogbo, Osun State.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy</b> is the {{investigation}} of choice to identify mucosal lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract, but it is poorly tolerated by patients. A simple non-invasive technique to image the upper gastrointestinal tract, which could be made widely available, would be beneficial to patients. Capsule endoscopy is well tolerated by patients but the stomach has proved difficult to visualise accurately with capsule technology due to its’ capacious nature and mucosal folds, which can obscure pathology. MiroCam Navi (Intromedic Ltd, Seoul, Korea) is a capsule endoscope containing {{a small amount of}} magnetic material which has been made available with a handheld magnet which might allow a degree of control. This body of work aims to address whether this new technology could be a feasible alternative to conventional flexible endoscopy of the stomach. METHODS: Four studies were conducted to test this research question. The first explores the feasibility of magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy of the stomach and operator learning curve in an ex vivo porcine model. This was followed by a randomised, blinded trial comparing magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy to conventional flexible endoscopy in ex vivo porcine stomach models. Subsequently a prospective, single centre randomised controlled trial in humans examined whether magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy could enhance conventional small bowel capsule endoscopy by reducing gastric transit time. Finally a blinded comparison of diagnostic yield of magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy compared to <b>oesophagogastroduodenoscopy</b> was performed in patients with recurrent or refractory iron deficiency anaemia.

We present {{a case of}} life-threatening haemorrhage caused by a large ulcerating duodenal GIST arising from the third part of the duodenum managed by a limited duodenal wedge resection. Case Presentation. A 61 -year-old patient presented with acute life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding. After <b>oesophagogastroduodenoscopy</b> failed to demonstrate the source of bleeding, a 5 [*]cm ulcerating exophytic mass originating from the third part of the duodenum was identified at laparotomy.
