5|$|In 2001, Zhe-Xi Luo {{and colleagues}} {{alternatively}} proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare Figure 3, top)—once {{giving rise to}} the marsupials and placentals (Boreosphenida), and once producing Ambondro, the Cretaceous Australian Ausktribosphenos, and the living monotremes, which {{first appeared in the}} Cretaceous (united as Australosphenida). They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the <b>outer</b> <b>front</b> corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} lower molar, the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are {{separated}} by an anteromedian fossette. The second lower molar bears a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps, the protoconid and metaconid, that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) at the <b>outer</b> <b>front</b> (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The third lower molar also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial cingulum. The first lower molar has large roots at the front and back of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one at the front and one at the back.|$|E
5|$|The M2 {{is similar}} to that of eosimiids and almost {{identical}} to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the <b>outer</b> <b>front</b> corner of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus.|$|E

5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the <b>outer</b> <b>front</b> (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E
25|$|To {{power the}} flippers, the {{shoulder}} girdle and the pelvis had been greatly modified, developing into broad bone plates at {{the underside of}} the body, which served as an attachment surface for large muscle groups, able to pull the limbs downwards. In the shoulder, the coracoid had become the largest element covering the major part of the breast. The scapula was much smaller, forming the <b>outer</b> <b>front</b> edge of the trunk. To the middle, it continued into a clavicle and finally a small interclavicular bone. As with most tetrapods, the shoulder joint was formed by the scapula and coracoid. In the pelvis, the bone plate was formed by the ischium at the rear and the larger pubic bone in front of it. The ilium, which in land vertebrates bears the weight of the hindlimb, had become a small element at the rear, no longer attached to either the pubic bone or the thighbone. The hip joint was formed by the ischium and the pubic bone. The pectoral and pelvic plates were connected by a plastron, a bone cage formed by the paired belly ribs that each had a middle and an outer section. This arrangement immobilised the entire trunk.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} the {{in-plane}} perturbation {{of a system of}} two coplanar slit-cracks carried out in Part I is specialized to the case where the distance between the inner crack fronts is small, or equivalently that between the <b>outer</b> <b>fronts</b> large. The limit process involved is complex because of appearance of a “boundary layer” in the limiting case considered; this boundary layer occurs near the origin in the Fourier space used to determine the unknown components of the fundamental kernel looked for. A technique of matched asymptotic expansions is used to tackle this difficulty. The problem is thus reduced to determining two unknown functions only, which characterize the “interactions” between the two inner fronts. These functions obey a system of nonlinear differential equations in Fourier’s space, which are solved analytically near the origin and numerically in general. The results evidence a very slow decrease of long-range interactions between distinct points on the same front or distinct ones. This represents a striking difference with respect to the cases considered earlier of a single semi-infinite crack and a single slit-crack...|$|R

2500|$|Electronic {{stability}} control (ESC), {{also referred}} to as electronic stability program (ESP) or dynamic stability control (DSC), is a computerized technology that improves a vehicle's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding). When ESC detects loss of steering control, it automatically applies the brakes to help [...] "steer" [...] the vehicle where the driver intends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as the <b>outer</b> <b>front</b> wheel to counter oversteer or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer. Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained. ESC does not improve a vehicle's cornering performance; instead, it helps to minimize the loss of control. [...] According to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one-third of fatal accidents could be prevented by the use of the technology.|$|E

If I might make so bold as to defend that extravagant conception, Mr Merdle, I would hint that it originated after the Railroad-share epoch, in the times of a certain Irish bank, and of one or two other equally laudable enterprises. If I were to plead anything in mitigation of the preposterous fancy that a bad design will sometimes claim to be a good and an expressly religious design, it would be the curious coincidence that it has been brought to its climax in these pages, {{in the days of the}} public examination of late Directors of a Royal British Bank. But, I submit myself to suffer judgment to go by default on all these counts, if need be, and to accept the assurance (on good authority) that nothing like them was ever known in this land.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the potential {{role played by}} different geological factors {{on the development of}} a thrust system. In particular our goal is to analyze how pre-existing compressional structures located in the foreland of a thrust-and-fold beltmay affect the kinematics of a thrust system. Westudied such circumstances both in a natural case and through analogue models. As a natural case,we selected the Central Po Plain (Italy),where the buried external fronts of the Northern Apennines and Southern Alps are very close to each other. Starting from a regional cross-section representative of this tectonic setting, we reconstructed the post-Messinian development of the Apennines thrust fronts, which includes out-of-sequence thrusting. Then, we modeled this evolution through a set of analogue experiments to evaluate the possible relationships of the out-of-sequence thrusting with the burial of the syntectonic sediments and/or the existence of the <b>outer</b> <b>fronts</b> of an opposite verging chain in its foreland. The comparison between natural case and models highlights that the presence of opposite verging thrust fronts in the foreland of a belt limits the propagation of new thrusts favoring the out-of-sequence reactivation of inner thrusts. An analysis of the study areawith respect to adjacent tectonic settings, coupledwith analoguemodels, revealed that syntectonic sedimentation aswell has a role in the reactivation of the inner fronts, although secondary. In the Po Plain specific case, this implies that the presence of the buried Southern Alps fronts affects the Northern Apennines kinematics, even if the two fronts did not collide yet...|$|R

During this period, both the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) National Seismic Network and the regional networks have been greatly improved. We compare the results of the integrated catalogue obtained in this study with the Catalogue of the Italian Seismicity between 1981 and 2001 [Castello, B., Selvaggi, G., Chiarabba, C., Amato, A., 2006. CSI Catalogo della sismicità italiana 1981 – 2002, versione 1. 1. INGV-CNT, Roma. [URL]) ], confirming the basic known features of the seismic activity in the region, but also evidencing some original and interesting results. In particular, the new data set allows us to better define the geometry and kinematics of the crustal seismicity, which is confined to the upper 20 km and shows a clear general deepening from west to east. In the crust, we find additional evidence of extensional seismicity below the central portion of the belt and thrust/reverse faulting mechanisms at the <b>outer</b> <b>fronts</b> of the Apennines. Looking at the seismicity along the belt, it is also possible to observe aseismic regions, which could be due to either locked or creeping portions of the Apenninic fault system. At greater depth, the west-dipping seismicity distribution down to about 70 km confirms the hypothesis of a slab of Adriatic lithosphere subducted below the Apennines, but also suggests that there are strong lateral heterogeneities and possibly tears in the slab...|$|R
