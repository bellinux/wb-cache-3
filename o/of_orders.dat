5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones {{and a few other}} employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the orders could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock. The game's volume <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle the tens of thousands <b>of</b> <b>orders.</b> Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A multiparameter {{negative}} {{binomial distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>order</b> k is obtained by compounding the extended (or multiparameter) Poisson distribution <b>of</b> <b>order</b> k by the gamma distribution. A multiparameter logarithmic series distribution <b>of</b> <b>order</b> k is derived next, as the zero truncated limit of the first distribution. Finally a few genesis schemes and interrelationships are established for these three multiparameter distributions <b>of</b> <b>order</b> k. The present work extends several properties <b>of</b> distributions <b>of</b> <b>order</b> k. Key words and phrases: Multiparameter distributions <b>of</b> <b>order</b> k, type I and type II distributions <b>of</b> <b>order</b> k, genesis schemes and interrelationships, extended distributions <b>of</b> <b>order</b> k. 1...|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1781, both pro-British and separatist forces began concentrating in Virginia, a state that had {{previously}} not experienced more than naval raids. The British forces were led at first by the turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by William Phillips before General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, arrived in late May with his southern army to take command. In June he marched to Williamsburg, where he received a confusing series <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> from General Sir Henry Clinton that culminated in a directive to establish a fortified deep-water port (which would allow resupply by sea). In response to these orders, Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in late July, where his army began building fortifications. The presence of these British troops, coupled with General Clinton's desire for a port there, made control of the Chesapeake Bay an essential naval objective for both sides.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E

5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, {{but he refused to}} deep fry the chicken, which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance <b>of</b> <b>orders,</b> there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E

The battalion continued to hold the line until 6:00am when, following receipt <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> to withdraw, it moved back to Keat Hong village to take up the role of brigade reserve.
