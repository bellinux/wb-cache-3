5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remarkable</b> C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E

While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters.

500|$|English theologian Richard Holt Hutton {{summarized}} the poem as Tennyson's [...] "friendly {{picture of the}} insatiable craving for new experience, enterprise, and adventure, when {{under the control of}} a luminous reason and a self-controlled will." [...] The contemporary poet Matthew Arnold was early in observing the narrative irony of the poem: he found Ulysses' speech [...] "the least plain, the most un-Homeric, which can possibly be conceived. Homer presents his thought to you just as it wells from the source of his mind: Mr. Tennyson carefully distils his thought before he will part with it. Hence comes ... a heightened and elaborate air." [...] A bit later, journalist and apologist Gilbert Keith Chesterton saw Ulysses as a [...] "tribute to Christianity" [...] as getting to the heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>remarkable</b> difference between the outlook of Antiquity and the Christian-shaped modern one, remarking: [...] "The poet reads into the story of Ulysses the conception of an incurable desire to wander.

[...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E
