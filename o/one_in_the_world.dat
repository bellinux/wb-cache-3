5|$|Miller's {{abilities}} as an all-rounder led to enormous success as both batsman and bowler. The ICC player rankings {{have been applied}} retrospectively to cricket history and Miller achieved top ten rankings with both bat and ball. As a batsman, he peaked at ninth {{in the world in}} 1952, and was a top-20 player from shortly after his début {{and for the rest of}} the duration of his career. Miller's bowling abilities led to even greater success. By the end of 1946, he was already ranked sixth in the world and thereafter never slipped lower than ninth; for much of his career, he was the second-best bowler in the world according to the ratings, remarkably, for a 36-year-old, peaking at the number 1 slot for a few months in 1956. As an all-rounder, therefore, it is unsurprising to find that he was peerless for most of his career, ranked as number <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> for most of his career, including an unbroken eight-year run from June 1948 until his retirement.|$|E

The displays include historical background materials, scientific information, kiosks with a variety of information, videos available for viewing and an exhibit of electronic image analysis of the shroud, among other interesting artifacts.|$|E
