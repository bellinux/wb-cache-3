50|$|Calcitonin gene related {{peptides}} (CGRPs) {{have been}} found {{to play a role in}} the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine. CGRP receptor antagonists, such as <b>olcegepant</b> and telcagepant, have been investigated both in vitro and in clinical studies for the treatment of migraine. In 2011, Merck stopped phase III clinical trials for their investigational drug telcagepant. Research as of 2016 is looking at CGRP monoclonal antibodies, of which four are in phase II development, three targeting CGRP itself and one targeting the receptor. Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise as has transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation.|$|E
40|$|Tfelt-Hansen [1] {{suggests}} that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (CGRP-RA) offer relief {{to only a}} fraction of patients. To support his hypothesis, he points out that only around two-thirds of migraineurs receiving intravenous (IV) <b>olcegepant</b> achieved pain relief in 2 h, and 46 % of patients had pain relief in 1 h [2], figures that are lower than previously reported values for subcutaneous sumatriptan [3]. He also considers that the therapeutic gain for oral telcagepant 300 mg [4, 5] was modest. He concludes by saying that ‘‘…there is most likely an inherent limit to the response one can expect from CGRP receptor antagonists, such as <b>olcegepant</b> and telcagepant, in the acute treatment of migraineurs as a group. ’’ The issues raised by Dr. Tfelt-Hansen are certainly o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Capsaicin, a pungent {{constituent}} {{from red}} chilli peppers, activates sensory nerve fibres via transient receptor potential vanilloid receptors type 1 (TRPV 1) to release neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P. Capsaicin-sensitive nerves are widely distributed in human and porcine vasculature. In this study, {{we examined the}} mechanism of capsaicin-induced relaxations, with special emphasis {{on the role of}} CGRP, using various pharmacological tools. Segments of human and porcine proximal and distal coronary arteries, as well as cranial arteries, were mounted in organ baths. Concentration response curves to capsaicin were constructed in the absence or presence of the CGRP receptor antagonist <b>olcegepant</b> (BIBN 4096 BS, 1 μM), the neurokinin NK...|$|E
40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is {{a potent}} neuropeptide that {{plays a key role}} in the {{pathophysiology}} of migraine headache. CGRP levels in the cranial circulation are increased during a mi-graine attack, and CGRP itself has been shown to trigger mi-graine-like headache. The correlation between CGRP release and migraine headache points to the potential utility of CGRP receptor antagonists as novel therapeutics in the treatment of migraine. Indeed, clinical proof-of-concept in the acute treatment of mi-graine was demonstrated with an intravenous formulation of the CGRP receptor antagonist BIBN 4096 BS (<b>olcegepant).</b> Here we report on the pharmacological characterization of the first orally bioavailable CGRP receptor antagonist in clinical de-velopment, MK- 0974 [N-[(3 R, 6 S) - 6 -(2, 3 -difluorophenyl) - 2 -oxo- 1 -(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) azepan- 3 -yl]- 4 -(2 -oxo- 2, 3 -dihydro...|$|E
40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has a {{widespread}} distribution throughout the trigeminovascular system and other brain areas involved in migraine pathogenesis. Serum levels of CGRP are elevated during the migraine attack {{and return to}} normal with alleviation of pain. Intravenous injection of CGRP in migraineurs results in delayed headache similar to migraine. Since CGRP receptor antagonists lack direct vasoconstrictor activity, this therapeutic approach may offer advantages over the current mainstay of specific acute migraine treatment with 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists (triptans), contra-indicated in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. Intravenous BIBN 4096 BS (<b>olcegepant)</b> and oral MK- 0974 (telcagepant), two CGRP-receptor antagonists, were safe and effective {{in the treatment of}} migraine attacks hi Phase I and II trials. In a Phase III clinical trial, the efficacy of telcagepant 300 mg was comparable to that of zolmitriptan 5 mg. We intend to review the rationale for the use of CGRP-receptor antagonists, and to outline current developments and future perspectives...|$|E
40|$|The neuropeptide {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a {{key role}} in migraine. However, a major challenge for studying CGRP actions is the lack of animal models for migraine. Clinical studies suggested that migraineurs are more sensitive to CGRP than people who do not suffer from migraine. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse that is sensitized to CGRP (nestin/hRAMP 1 mice). The mice have elevated expression of a subunit of the CGRP receptor, human receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (hRAMP 1). Nestin/hRAMP 1 mice have two symptoms of migraine: photophobia and mechanical allodynia. The light aversion was greatly enhanced by intracerebroventricular administration of CGRP. CGRP had little effect on motility in the light zone, but once in the dark, the mice moved less than controls. The CGRP-induced light aversion was attenuated by co-administration of the CGRP receptor antagonist <b>olcegepant.</b> These findings suggest that CGRP acts as a neuromodulator to increase sensory responses and that regulation of a single gene, hRAMP 1, could potentially contribute to migraine susceptibility...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDysregulation of the {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP), {{a potent}} vasodilator, is directly {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of migraine. CGRP binds to and signals through the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R), a heterodimer containing the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), a class B GPCR, and RAMP 1, a receptor activity-modifying protein. We have solved the crystal structure of the CLR/RAMP 1 N-terminal ectodomain heterodimer, revealing how RAMPs bind to and potentially modulate {{the activities of the}} CLR GPCR subfamily. We also report the structures of CLR/RAMP 1 in complex with the clinical receptor antagonists <b>olcegepant</b> (BIBN 4096 BS) and telcagepant (MK 0974). Both drugs act by blocking access to the peptide-binding cleft at the interface of CLR and RAMP 1. These structures illustrate, for the first time, how small molecules bind to and modulate the activity of a class B GPCR, and highlight the challenges of designing potent receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine and other class B GPCR-related diseases...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{headaches}} such as migraine {{are among}} the most prevalent neurological disorders, affecting up to one-fifth of the adult population. The scientific work in the last decade has unraveled much of the pathophysiological background of migraine, which is now considered to be a neurovascular disorder. It has been discovered that the trigemino-cerebrovascular system {{plays a key role in}} migraine headache pathophysiology by releasing the potent vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This neuropeptide is released in parallel with the pain and its concentration correlates well with the intensity of the headache. The development of drugs of the triptan class has provided relief for the acute attacks but at the cost of, mainly cardiovascular, side effects. Thus, the intention to improve treatment led to the development of small CGRP receptor antagonists such as <b>olcegepant</b> (BIBN 4096 BS) and MK- 0974 that alleviate the acute migraine attack without acute side events. The purpose of this review is to give a short overview of the pathological background of migraine headache and to illustrate the mechanisms behind the actions of triptans and the promising CGRP receptor blockers...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Migraine afflicts {{approximately}} 11 % of {{the population}} worldwide producing substantial disability, resulting in loss of productivity {{both at home and}} at the workplace. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is closely involved in the cascade of molecular events leading to migraine painful crisis. Areas covered: Acute treatment of migraine is actually based on the use of triptans, class drug which presents a clear limitation due to its cardiovascular side effects. Gepants, a CGRP antagonist class, might offer a new non-vasoconstrictive approach in the acute treatment of migraine. Four chemically unrelated CGRP receptor (CGRP-R) antagonists (<b>olcegepant,</b> telcagepant, MK- 3207 and BI 44370 TA) have displayed efficacy in the treatment of migraine. Expert opinion: When compared with triptans, gepants class showed a similar efficacy, moreover corresponding to the best published results for oral triptans. CGRP antagonists are in different phases of their development, and the treatment of migraine could be based on the use of gepants, as class of acute medications. However, CGRP-R antagonists clinical trials seem to be discouraging for their forthcoming use in clinical practice. New CGRP-R antagonists, such as BMS- 927711 and BI 44370 TA, are in the pipeline and their developments will outline the future of this drug class...|$|E
40|$|Migraine is {{a complex}} {{neurological}} disorder in which genetic and environmental factors interact. At present, frontline therapies in migraine's acute treatment {{include the use of}} NSAIDS and triptans. Restrictions in the use of frontline drugs for migraine treatment and evidence concerning CGRP's key role led research towards new pathways involved in migraine pathophysiology. CGRP is a strong vasodilatory neuropeptide released from activated trigeminal sensory nerves. The development of CGRP antagonists has also been driven by the fact that triptans are vasoconstrictive and cannot be used in patients with vascular risk factors. BIBN 4096 (<b>olcegepant)</b> is the first CGRP antagonist for the treatment of migraine which has been tested in clinical trials, but its principal limitation is that BIBN 4096 presents low oral bioavailability and has only been tested through intravenous formulation. The first oral nonpeptide CGRP antagonist, MK- 0974 (telcagepant), has recently been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of migraine attacks. This development can be considered the most important pharmacological breakthrough for migraine treatment since the introduction of sumatriptan in the early 1990 s. These results are important since they confirm the current pathophysiological concept of migraine. The future introduction of CGRP antagonists in clinical practice could represent a progress for migraine therapy. © 2008 Expert Reviews Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Importance of the field: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) {{receptor}} antagonists {{have recently}} come to attention {{with the development}} of <b>olcegepant</b> and telcagepant for the treatment of migraine. The availability of high-affinity, non-peptide antagonists opens the way for trials of these compounds in other conditions where CGRP antagonism might be useful, such as septic shock and inhibition of angiogenesis. Areas covered in this review: This review summarises knowledge about the structure and signalling properties of the CGRP receptor. The clinical ramifications of targeting the CGRP receptor, the profiles of existing antagonists and the requirements for screening new compounds will be discussed. What the reader will gain: Readers will gain an overview of how current non-peptide antagonists seem to bind similar epitopes contributed by both calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP 1), the main CGRP receptor subunits. We will discuss how current antagonists have low bioavailability, limiting their use. For selectivity at CGRP receptors, {{it will be necessary to}} target parts of the receptor influenced by both RAMP 1 and CLR. Take home message: For the design of radically new antagonists, more structural information on the receptor is needed. Current screens are largely based on measuring CGRP-mediated changes in cAMP. CGRP receptors can influence other signalling pathways and pathway-selective allosteric antagonists may be useful, but more information is needed about the mechanism of action of CGRP to assess the value of this. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{shift of}} {{our understanding of}} migraine from a vascular disorder to a brain disorder has dramatically altered the approach {{to the development of}} new medicines in the field. Current pharmacologic treatments of acute migraine consist of nonspecific and relatively specific agents. Migraine-specific drugs comprise two classes, the ergot alkaloid derivatives and the triptans, serotonin 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists. The ergots, consisting of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (DHE), are the oldest specific antimigraine drugs available and are considered relatively safe and effective. Ergotamine has been used less extensively because of its adverse effects; DHE is better tolerated. The triptan era, beginning in the 1990 s, was a period of considerable change, although these medicines retained vasoconstrictor actions. New methods of delivering older drugs include orally inhaled DHE and the transdermal formulation of sumatriptan, both currently under study. Novel medicines being developed are targeted at neural sites of action. Serotonin 5 -HT 1 F receptor agonists have proven effective in phase II studies and have no vascular actions. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists are another promising nonvasoconstrictor approach to treating acute migraine. <b>Olcegepant</b> (BIBN 4096 BS) and telcagepant (MK- 0974) {{have been shown to be}} safe and effective in phase I, II, and (for telcagepant) phase III clinical trials. Other targets under investigation include glutamate (AMPA/kainate), TRPV 1, prostanoid EP 4, and nitric oxide synthase. With new neural targets and the potential for therapeutic advances, the next era of antimigraine medications is near...|$|E
40|$|Migraine is a complex, {{neurovascular}} {{disorder in}} which genetic {{and environmental factors}} interact. At present, frontline therapies in the acute treatment of migraine {{include the use of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans. Evidence indicates that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a fundamental role in the mechanism of migraine. CGRP is a strong vasodilatatory neuropeptide that is released from activated trigeminal sensory nerves. The development of CGRP antagonists has also been driven by the fact that triptans are vasoconstrictive and cannot be safely used in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. <b>Olcegepant</b> (BIBN 4096) is the first CGRP antagonist for the treatment of migraine that has been tested in clinical trials, but because of its poor oral bioavailability, only the intravenous formulation has been tested. The first oral non-peptide CGRP antagonist, telcagepant, has been shown recently to be highly effective in the treatment of migraine attacks. This development can be considered as the most important pharmacological breakthrough for migraine treatment since the introduction of sumatriptan in the early 1990 s. These results are also of importance, since they support an interesting pathophysiological hypothesis of migraine. The pipeline of future compounds for the treatment of acute migraine headaches include TPRV 1 antagonists, prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP(4)) receptor antagonists, serotonin 5 HT 1 (F) receptor agonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. The immediate future of a preventative treatment for migraine headaches is well represented by botulinum toxin type-A, glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, gap-junction blocker tonabersat and an angiotensin type 1 blocker candesartan...|$|E

Segments of human and porcine proximal and distal coronary arteries, as well as cranial arteries, were mounted in organ baths. Concentration response curves to capsaicin were constructed in the absence or presence of the CGRP receptor antagonist <b>olcegepant</b> (BIBN 4096 BS, 1  μM), the neurokinin NK 1 receptor antagonist L- 733060 (0. 5  μM), the voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker ruthenium red (100  μM), the TRPV 1 receptor antagonist capsazepine (5  μM), the nitric oxide synthetase inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester HCl (l-NAME; 100  μM), the gap junction blocker 18 α-glycyrrhetinic acid (10  μM), as well as the RhoA kinase inhibitor Y- 27632 (1  μM). Further, we also used the K+ channel inhibitors 4 -aminopyridine (1  mM), charybdotoxin (0. 5  μM) [*]+[*]apamin (0. 1  μM) and iberiotoxin (0. 5  μM) [*]+[*]apamin (0. 1  μM). The role of the endothelium was assessed by endothelial denudation in distal coronary artery segments. In distal coronary artery segments, we also measured levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) after exposure to capsaicin, and in human segments, we also assessed the amount of CGRP released in the organ bath fluid after exposure to capsaicin. Capsaicin evoked concentration-dependent relaxant responses in precontracted arteries, but none of the above-mentioned inhibitors did affect these relaxations. There was no increase in the cAMP levels after exposure to capsaicin, unlike after (exogenously administered) α-CGRP. Interestingly, there were significant increases in CGRP levels after exposure to vehicle (ethanol) as well as capsaicin, although this did not induce relaxant responses. In conclusion, the capsaicin-induced relaxations of the human and porcine distal coronary arteries are not mediated by CGRP, NK 1, NO, vanilloid receptors, voltage-sensitive calcium channels, K+ channels or cAMP-mediated mechanisms. Therefore, these relaxant responses to capsaicin are likely to be attributed to a non-specific, CGRP-independent mechanism...|$|E
