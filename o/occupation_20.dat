The available data indicates {{that the number of}} displaced manufacturing workers in offshorable occupations from 2003 to 2005 (489, 000) roughly equals the number of TAA-certified manufacturing workers over the same period (450, 000).

Tracing the top <b>20</b> <b>occupations</b> in which “new Mexican immigrants” enter in 1970 – 1980, 1980 – 1990, and 1990 – 2000, we find that over 60  % of them in each cohort were in somewhat similar occupations.
