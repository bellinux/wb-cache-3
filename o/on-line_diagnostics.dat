5000|$|The FMEDA {{technique}} {{was developed in}} the late 1980s by exida engineers based in part on a paper in the 1984 RAMS Symposium. The initial FMEDA added two additional pieces of information to the FMEA analysis process. The first piece of information added in an FMEDA is the quantitative failure data (failure rates and the distribution of failure modes) for all components being analyzed. The second piece of information added to an FMEDA is the probability of the system or subsystem to detect internal failures via automatic <b>on-line</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> This is crucial to achieving and maintaining reliability in increasing complex systems and for systems that may not be fully exercising all functionality under normal circumstances such as a low demand Emergency Shutdown System, ESD System.There is a clear need for a measurement of automatic diagnostic capability. This was recognized in the late 1980s [...] In that context the principles and basic methods for the modern FMEDA were first documented in the book Evaluating Control System Reliability. The actual term FMEDA was first used in 1994 [...] and after further refinement the methods were published in the late 1990s. The method was explained to members of the IEC 61508 committee in the late 90s and included in the standard as a method of determining failure rate, failure mode and diagnostic coverage for products. FMEDA techniques have been further refined during the 2000s primarily during IEC 61508 preparation work. The key changes have been:1. Use of Functional Failure Modes;2. Mechanical Component Usage;3. Prediction of manual proof test effectiveness; and4. Prediction of product useful life.With these changes, the FMEDA technique has matured to become more complete and useful.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} the {{diagnosis}} of PV panels was mainly devoted to evaluate the performance degradation due to the manufacturing process and to guarantee the 25 years lifetime; these analysis was essentially based on off-line costly laboratory measurement. Recent studies shown that the degradation of photovoltaic (PV) panels is accelerated by various unpredictable and unavoidable phenomena, e. g, the extreme environmental and operating conditions, or {{by the type of}} electrical connections thus, in order to prevent the stop of the PV plants, the development of <b>on-line</b> <b>diagnostic</b> techniques is assuming great of interest for the customers and manufacturers of PV systems. The real-time monitoring of the electrical and environmental operating conditions, devoted to the energy productivity analysis, is a feature already offered to the PV customers. However these analyses are mainly used to quantify the return of the investment of the PV plants. The estimation of the global energy productivity is a too coarse information for understanding the problems affecting the modules and for performing the right repairing. Thus, new and even more advanced <b>on-line</b> <b>diagnostic</b> algorithms must be developed in order to monitor the status of the cells and to predict failures before they lead to a significant reduction on the energy produced by the module.

40|$|Development of {{the power}} gridtowards a more {{reliable}} and smarter system requires frequent on-line monitoring {{of the power}} components. Power transformers and their bushings are particularly important components in a power transmission system and their insulation degradation may lead to catastrophic failures. Time consuming and costly replacement of these components raise {{the importance of their}} frequent monitoring. A fault in a power transformer bushing can also involve in the failure of the transformer. Therefore, <b>on-line</b> <b>diagnostics</b> of power transformers and their bushings is of great interest. Several methods exist for diagnostics of these components. However, some of them can only be done off-line in maintenance periods, and the existing on-line methods generally provide less information, especially on the internal solid insulation parts. In this project, a new technique for <b>on-line</b> <b>diagnostics</b> of the power transformer and the bushing insulation is proposed. In this technique, natural transients happening in the power system such as lightning and switching surges can be used as stimuli for on-line dielectric response measurements. This technique can provide information on insulation close to what Dielectric Spectroscopy offers in off-line measurements. The wide-ranging frequency content of power system transients is their advantage for being usedas stimuli when measuring the Dielectric Response. The response can have particular signatures due to different types of defects in the insulation varying with frequency. Oil-impregnated paper as a major insulation component in power transformer and its bushing has been investigated in this project. Moisture content and temperature, as two important degradation factors in this type of insulation, have been studied to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in the diagnostics of the oil-impregnated paper. The results are verified with the dielectric response obtained through commercial instruments. The results show that the proposed technique has the ability to track the changes in dielectric response due to the moisture content and temperature. Measurements were done at both highvoltage (40 kV) and low voltage (10 V) levels, and the corresponding circuit models to achieve reasonable accuracy for the results are discussed. Moving on from the material samples, a further study was done on three service-aged 150 kV bushings to investigate the feasibility of the technique on the diagnostics of power transformer bushings. Their dielectric response measured by the transient stimuli showed good agreement with their response obtained by the commercial instruments. The effect of the transformer winding on the transient response of the bushing is a further aspect of the real conditions for <b>on-line</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> This has been investigated through the simulation of transient models for transformers and bushings, and possible solutions for distinguishing the responses are presented. The proposed new <b>on-line</b> <b>diagnostics</b> technique by utilizing natural transients can provide information about the insulation system in a certain range of frequency without interrupting the operation or requiring an external voltage source. However, the validity range of the results depends on the bandwidth of the applied transients and other measurement considerations. This approach can be valuable in frequent monitoring of dielectric properties of the power transformers and their bushings as a complement to the other available on-line techniques.

40|$|Input {{and output}} (I/O) of {{simulation}} data {{is an important}} aspect in high performance computing (HPC). Especially in high resolution numerical simulations over large domains {{with a high degree}} of distributed memory parallelisation I/O becomes a limiting factor. In the last years computational throughput of HPC systems increased, opening the ability to operate numerical weather and climate models with increasingly finer resolutions. This results in increasing amounts of data output from the model system. From the user's perspective the problems arise, where to store and archive these data, and which tools to use for subsequent post-processing. Transferring large data between different systems and subsequent processing require additional I/O operations, repeatedly hitting the I/O bottleneck and also memory limits of the computing system, if postprocessing is performed serially. One way to deal with I/O limitations is reducing the amount of output data by coarse-graining, although this may abandon advantages previously gained through the finer resolved simulations in subsequent processing. In contrast, on-line diagnostic tools use the fully resolved data, perform data reduction, and enable advanced diagnostics, which are not applicable off-line. We introduce a general and standardised interface to include sophisticated on-line diagnostic tools into the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) modelling framework based on the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy).
