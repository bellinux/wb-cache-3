You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all <b>our</b> <b>cities</b> are dust, to stand intact, to mark where we have been, to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish.|$|E

25|$|Utility {{companies}} are typically legally responsible {{for maintaining the}} electrical infrastructure that brings power to <b>our</b> <b>cities,</b> neighborhoods, and individual buildings. Utility companies typically own this infrastructure up to the property line of an individual parcel, {{and in some cases}} own electrical infrastructure on private land as well. Utilities have expressed concern that the use of Net Metering for ZNE projects threatens the Utilities base revenue, which in turn impacts their ability to maintain and service the portion of the electrical grid that they are responsible for. Utilities have expressed concern that states that maintain Net Metering laws may saddle non-ZNE homes with higher utility costs, as those homeowners would be responsible for paying for grid maintenance while ZNE home owners would theoretically pay nothing if they do achieve ZNE status. This creates potential equity issues, as currently, the burden would appear to fall on lower-income households. A possible solution to this issue is to create a minimum base charge for all homes connected to the utility grid, which would force ZNE home owners to pay for grid services independently of their electrical use.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{called for}} a bill {{regulating}} toxins {{in the air and}} increasing funding for pollution programs. Edmund Muskie, a Senator from Maine and political environmentalist, praised Johnson's words, pledged to hold hearings on the proposals, and would soon sponsor the Johnson administration's bill, which became the Air Quality Act. Muskie also co-sponsored bills in 1967 for research on non-polluting automobiles using either electric or fuel cell technology. While discussing the research bills on the Senate floor, Muskie said [...] "the serious air pollution situation in New York City [...] dramatically illustrated what <b>our</b> <b>cities</b> may be facing in the future if an alternative to the [...] combustion engine is not developed." ...|$|E

500|$|Mayors from 14 NBA cities {{wrote an}} open letter to NBA {{commissioner}} David Stern and NBPA chief Billy Hunter, requesting that they end the lockout based on [...] "the perspective [...] residents and the negative impact a canceled season might have on them, <b>our</b> <b>cities,</b> and our local economies". Time noted that arena workers would be affected by the cancellation of games. However, separate studies by University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Lake Forest College found no historic significant effect to the economies of cities with sports franchises affected by work stoppages. Explanations included consumer shifting of spending on sporting events to other forms of entertainment, reduced local government spending on crowd and traffic control, and higher productivity by the general workforce without the distraction of games.|$|E
500|$|The Kazon were {{inspired}} by Los Angeles gangs, and were referenced in a [...] "shorthand 'Crips' and 'Bloods' fashion". The idea for the Kazon as warrior sects, {{as opposed to a}} unified race, was introduced by Taylor, who drafted them as [...] "three gangs, with constantly shifting relationships and allegiances. Just as we think we have sorted it out, the balance shifts again." [...] While discussing the Kazon's original inspiration, Taylor viewed them as a way [...] "to address the tenor of our times and what [...] was happening in <b>our</b> <b>cities</b> and recognizing a source of danger and social unrest". Piller further described the premise for the Kazon as rooted in gang violence and warfare by clarifying: [...] "Our intention was to create a sort of disorganized anarchy, them-against-them as much as them-against-us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Contemporary {{human rights}} city {{initiatives}} grow directly from earlier organizing around rights claims in urban settings. The widespread nature of urban problems affecting peoples’ everyday lives and survival have generated similar types of responses in {{places around the}} world, helping account for the simultaneous emergence and consolidation of popular claims to the “right to the city." [...] According to David Harvey, “to invoke rights to the city means ‘to claim some kind of shaping power over the processes of urbanization, over {{the ways in which}} <b>our</b> <b>cities</b> are made and remade and to do so in a fundamental and radical way’." ...|$|E

One member of the group, Oxford University researcher Bradley Garrett, later revealed to various news outlets that over 20 urban explorers had {{made their way to the}} top of the building during its construction.

2500|$|On September 23, Montreal and Toronto mayors Gérald Tremblay and David Miller {{laid out}} their demands for urban municipalities, {{describing}} cities' current financial problems {{as a national}} issue, saying that cities have become the country's economic, {{social and cultural development}} engines and need appropriate support, and that they need better [...] "fiscal tools" [...] to continue their role as Canada's economic engines or the country will suffer. They listed Homelessness, traffic gridlock, crowded buses and overstretched police departments as {{just a few of the}} symptoms, that [...] "These problems are too big and too important to be solved on the backs of property taxpayers" [...] and that [...] "in order to remain competitive, transport goods efficiently and attract new talent, <b>our</b> <b>cities</b> require quality infrastructure, affordable housing and first-rate recreational and cultural facilities". Jean Perrault, president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and mayor of Sherbrooke, Quebec, has stated that things like the Federal Gas Tax Fund were an important federal commitment, but that more is needed to tackle cities' overwhelming infrastructure needs.|$|E

It also stated it was [...] "carefully observing" [...] events in the east and south of Ukraine, and again called for [...] "real constitutional reform" [...] that would turn Ukraine into a federation. In a 7 April opinion piece that appeared in The Guardian, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov wrote that it was Europe and the United States, and not Russia, that was guilty of destabilising Ukraine and that [...] "Russia is doing all it can to promote early stabilisation in Ukraine". The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a stern condemnation of the [...] "criminal order" [...] by Kiev for armed aggression against Donetsk: [...] "The Kiev authorities, who self-proclaimed themselves {{as a result of a}} coup, have embarked on the violent military suppression of the protests," [...] demanding that [...] "the Maidan henchmen, who overthrew the legitimate president, to immediately stop the war against their own people, to fulfill all the obligations under the Agreement of 21 February." [...] Russian president Vladimir Putin compared the siege of the DPR and LPR-controlled cities of Donetsk and Luhansk to the Siege of Leningrad during the Second World War: [...] "Sadly, it reminds me of World War II, when German fascist forces surrounded <b>our</b> <b>cities,</b> like Leningrad, and shelled population centres and their residents".|$|E
