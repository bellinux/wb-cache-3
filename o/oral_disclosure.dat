50|$|In Italy, {{a utility}} model (in Italian: 'Modello d'utilità') is {{considered}} to be new if it does not form part {{of the state of the}} art. The state of the art comprises any knowledge made available to the public by means of a written or <b>oral</b> <b>disclosure,</b> anywhere in the World, before the filing date of the application or the priority date (if claimed). The utility model must also involve an inventive step, i.e. machines, devices or items which are claimed in the utility models must be more effective and/or easier to use than the ones according to prior art. Utility models cannot claim processes or methods. At the time of filing the application a filing fee is due which also covers the maintenance for years 1 to 4. No claim fee is provided. The Italian Patent and Trademark Office (UIBM) does not perform substantive examination of the application in order to assess novelty and inventive step of what is claimed; the examination is limited to formal requirements only. Publication occurs at 18 months from the filing date or the oldest priority date, if any; at the time of filing the application the applicant may request advance publication, which normally occurs within 90 days. In any case only bibliographic data are published after 1 month from the filing. Grant generally occurs within 2 years. The validity of an Italian utility model is ascertained by the Judge and his/her technical expert, during litigation. At the end of the fourth year from the filing of the application, a maintenance fee for the years 5 to 10 falls due. Foreign companies/residents must indicate an address of service in Italy, that may correspond to the domicile of a lawyer or, as always occurs, a chartered patent attorney.|$|E

5000|$|A patent {{has been}} defined as the title granted to protect an {{invention}}. An invention on the other hand {{has been defined}} as an idea of an inventor which permits in practice, the solution to a specific problem in the field of technology. Under the patent act, discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods, schemes, rules or methods for doing business, performing purely mental acts or playing games, methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy, as well as diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body are excluded from patent protection [...] The requirement for patentability is that the invention must be new, involves an inventive step and is industrially applicable [...] The act defines states that, an invention is new if it is not anticipated by a prior art [...] Prior art consists of everything disclosed to the public, anywhere in the world, by publication in tangible form or by <b>oral</b> <b>disclosure,</b> by use or in any other way, prior to the filing or, where appropriate, the priority date, of the application claiming the invention. An invention shall be considered as involving an inventive step if, having regard to the prior art relevant to the application claiming the invention and as defined in subsection (3) of the Act, {{it would not have been}} obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art [...] An invention shall be considered industrially applicable if it can be made or used in any kind of industry [...] The right to a patent belongs to the inventor and where two or more persons have jointly made an invention, the right to the patent belongs to them jointly. The right to a patent under the act may be assigned, transferred or devolve by succession. As regard the procedure for applying for a patent under the act, an inventor must file an application for the registration of a patent with the Registrar of Companies and shall contain a request, a description, one or more claims, one or more drawings where required, and an abstract. After a patent has been granted, it prevents the exploitation of the patented invention in the country by a person other than the owner of the patent shall require the owner's consent. The owner of the patent shall, in addition to any other rights, remedies or actions available to the owner, have the right, to institute court proceedings against any person who infringes the patent without the consent of the owner. A patent lasts for 20 years after the date of filing the application. A patent can be invalidated by a court upon the request of an interested person. If the person requesting the invalidation proves that a person has not complied with any of the requirements of a patent under sections 1(2) and (3), 2, 3, 5 (5), (6), (7) or (8); or if the owner of the patent is not the inventor or the inventor's successor in title, the patent shall be invalidated.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{how to improve}} feasibility in disclosing personal distress by writing. Disclosing personal distresses, such as mental problems, by writing {{is thought to be}} good for health. However, qualitative research about the utility of written disclosure was not been conducted enough. Written disclosure is a single-handed approach contrary to <b>oral</b> <b>disclosure.</b> To fully utilize written disclosure, the exploration of its process is important. In this study, a 3 -day written disclosure task was introduced to eight Japanese undergraduate students individually. Semi-structured interviews were conducted one week after the task. Analyses with the KJ method suggested written disclosure was often used when participants felt uncomfortable receiving advice directly from others, and it helped the writer better express his/her problems. Furthermore, successful experiences of disclosure were found to increase positive attitudes toward using written disclosure. Results suggested participants were sometimes hesitant to write about their serious issues, so dealing with less severe issues on the ﬁrst day would be advisable. Also, written disclosure was thought to be more appropriate than <b>oral</b> <b>disclosure</b> when the participant had not necessarily pinpointed the cause of the problem...|$|E
50|$|In other countries, {{including}} European countries, any {{act that}} makes an invention {{available to the}} public, no matter where in the world, before the filing date or priority date {{has the effect of}} barring the invention from being patented. Examples of acts that can make an invention available to the public are written publications, sales, public <b>oral</b> <b>disclosures</b> and public demonstrations or use.|$|R

5000|$|To {{anticipate}} the subject-matter of a patent claim, prior art is generally {{expected to provide}} a description sufficient to inform an average worker in the field (or the person skilled in the art) of some subject matter falling {{within the scope of}} the claim. Prior art must be available in some way to the public, and in many countries, the information needs to be recorded in a fixed form somehow. Prior art generally does not include unpublished work or mere conversations (though according to the European Patent Convention, <b>oral</b> <b>disclosures</b> also form prior art—see [...] ). It is disputed whether traditional knowledge (e.g., of medical properties of a certain plant) constitutes prior art.|$|R
2500|$|SEC is {{specifically}} authorized to issue [...] "point-of-sale disclosure" [...] rules when retail investors purchase investment products or services; these disclosures include concise information on costs, risks, and conflicts of interest. This authorization follows up the SEC's failure to implement proposed point-of-sale disclosure rules in 2004 and 2005; These proposed rules generated opposition {{because they were}} perceived as burdensome to broker-dealers. For example, they would require <b>oral</b> <b>disclosures</b> for telephone transactions, were not satisfied by cheap internet or email disclosures, and could allow the customer to request disclosures specific {{to the amount of}} their investment. In determining the disclosure rules, the Act authorizes the SEC to do [...] "investor testing" [...] and rely on experts to study financial literacy among retail investors.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} {{disclosure}} alters representations of emotional or traumatic events and that linguistic parameters may index such change. Most {{work has been}} conducted among younger adults; hence, this report examined whether changes in the proportions of pronoun, emotion, and cognitive characteristics across two narrations predicted changes in {{mental and physical health}} outcomes in a later life sample. Black and White men and women (N = 160) aged 50 to 70 years completed two 10 -minute <b>oral</b> <b>disclosures</b> at baseline and 1 -month follow-up, describing a sad event in conjunction with either a happy or a neutral event, and completed measures of depressive symptomatology, stress, and health. Despite some variation across outcomes, reductions in symptoms were generally predicted by lowered proportions of first personal singular pronouns and sadness words and increased proportions of insight and causal words; directional change scores were more useful than absolute change in predicting outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for tailoring disclosure-based interventions among older groups for which traditional written paradigms may be poorly suited, and directions for future research are given...|$|R
40|$|We {{appreciate}} the remarks made by Bernstein et al and by Marlu et al. In our study, a single {{dose of the}} prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) Cofact normalized the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban, but not that of dabigatran, measured by means of coagulation assays in healthy subjects. 1 We agree with the comment by Marlu et al that these tests may insufficiently represent a definitive beneficial effect in patients with hemorrhage. To establish PCCs as effective reversing agents for the new oral anticoagulants, clinical data are required, as indicated in the Discussion of our article. However, {{in the absence of}} such data for any agent that may reverse the anticoagulant effect of the new agents, an increase in thrombin generation, as observed in our study, may be considered the best available surrogate outcome parameter. We agree with Bernstein et al that various PCCs may have different properties and that results in our study with Cofact can be translated to alternative PCCs only to a limited extent. Those different properties may explain why our findings contradict some of the animal studies designed for the same purpose in examples mentioned by both Bernstein et al and Marlu et al. Activated PCCs such as Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypass Agent may therefore be more potent hemostatic agents and could be capable of reversing the anticoagulant effect of direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran. However, this has not yet been established in humans. Previous studies with activated factor VII as a potent prohemostatic agent showed a lack of thrombin generation in subjects treated with the thrombin inhibitor melagatran. 2 In the absence of clinical trial data, we would applaud a registry as proposed by Bernstein et al to record clinical experience with reversal of the anticoagulant effect of all new <b>oral</b> anticoagulants. <b>Disclosures</b> Dr Kamphuisen has served as a consultant for Bayer, Boehringer, CSL Behring, and Ablynx and has received investigator-initiate...|$|R
