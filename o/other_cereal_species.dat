40|$|Rice {{was chosen}} as a model {{organism}} for genome sequencing because of its economic importance, small genome size, and syntenic relationship with <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species.</b> We have constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome fingerprint–based physical map of the rice genome to facilitate the whole-genome sequencing of rice. Most of the rice genome (� 90. 6 %) was anchored genetically by overgo hybridization, DNA gel blot hybridization, and in silico anchoring. Genome sequencing data also were integrated into the rice physical map. Comparison of the genetic and physical maps reveals that recombination is suppressed severely in centromeric regions {{as well as on}} the short arms of chromosomes 4 and 10. This integrated high-resolution physical map of the rice genome will greatly facilitate wholegenom...|$|E
30|$|Even though {{considerable}} genetic synteny {{was found}} in comparisons of other cereals to rice, sequencing of orthologous genomic regions uncovered considerable variation, in gene content, repeat structure and size. One of the first comparisons of rice, maize and sorghum, preceding the rice genome sequencing project, revealed extensive size variation, especially inflated in maize, and in conservation of low copy sequences among the three species (Chen et al. 1997). Subsequent {{studies have shown that}} while rice is generally predictive of gene content in related cereal genomes, many genes are missed as either absent in rice, or present in rice and absent in the comparator. For instance in a rice-barley comparison around a disease resistance locus, barley had six additional genes not found in the rice orthologous region (Moore et al. 1995). Thus, while useful for leveraging genetics in <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species,</b> additional crop genome sequences were required to fully address the genetic underpinning of traits in those crops.|$|E
40|$|Purothionins {{are basic}} polypeptides with {{antimicrobial}} properties that {{are present in}} the endosperm of wheat and <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species.</b> Susceptibility to wheat purothionins among phytopathogenic bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Agrobacterium, Erwinia, and Corynebacterium has been investigated. Sensitive strains have been found in all of these genera except Agrobacterium (the only strain of A. tumefaciens available proved to be resistant). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) with partially purified crude purothionins ranged from 1 fig/xn for C. sepedonicum (C. 5) to 540 yug/ml for E. amylouora (E. 3). Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were not higher than twice the MIC valué, except for C. poinsettiae (C. 4) (MBC/MIC = 8). Purothionins a and /?, obtained by carboxymethyl-cellulose column chromatography, were tested against P. solanacearum (P. 2) and X. phaseoli (X. 2); a purothionin was more active than (3 against X. 2, and fü more active than a against P. 2.

Half of the artificially infected plants were caged whereas the other half was left no caged. One month after artificial aphid infection plants were sampled weekly, and insects were counted. R. padi was the most abundant species, followed by S. avenae, M. dirhodum and D. noxia on caged tillers. Significant relationships were found between C. septempunctata and R. padi densities and between Aphidius ervi and S. avenae densities. Activity of parasitoids was hampered by hyperparasitoids. Chalcididae hyperparasitoids were more than twice as abundant as parasitoids. D. noxia was ca. ten to twenty times more frequent on no caged tillers, compared to <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> aphid <b>species.</b> Populations of indigenous aphid species: R. padi, S. avenae and M. dirhodum were under the economic threshold on the no caged tillers. The results suggest that the indigenous aphid species were more influenced by local natural enemies than Diuraphis noxia predators and parasitoids presented in this study were not able to keep D. noxia populations under economic injury level...|$|R
40|$|The {{effector}} protein NIP 1 {{from the}} barley (Hordeum vulgare) pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis specifically induces {{the synthesis of}} defense-related proteins in cultivars of barley expressing the complementary resistance gene, Rrs 1. In addition, it stimulates {{the activity of the}} barley plasma membrane H+-ATPase in a genotype-unspecific manner and it induces necrotic lesions in leaf tissues of barley and <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> plant <b>species.</b> NIP 1 variants type I and II, which display quantitative differences in their activities as elicitor and H+-ATPase stimulator, and the inactive mutant variants type III* and type IV*, were produced in Escherichia coli. Binding studies using 125 I-NIP 1 type I revealed a single class of binding sites with identical binding characteristics in microsomes from near-isogenic resistant (Rrs 1) and susceptible (rrs 1) barley. Binding was specific, reversible, and saturable, and saturation ligand-binding experiments yielded a Kd of 5. 6 nm. A binding site was also found in rye (Secale cereale) and the nonhost species wheat (Triticum aestivum), oat (Avena sativa), and maize (Zea mays), but not in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). For NIP 1 types I and II, equilibrium competition-binding experiments revealed a correlation between the difference in their affinities to the binding site and the differences in their elicitor activity and H+-ATPase stimulation, indicating a single target molecule to mediate both activities. In contrast, the inactive proteins type III* and type IV* are both characterized by high affinities similar to type I, suggesting that binding of NIP 1 to this target is not sufficient for its activities...|$|R
40|$|Einkorn (Triticum monococcum L.) is A-genome diploid wheat {{that has}} a {{potential}} to become a useful model for understanding the biology and genomics in Triticeae. Unfortunately, the application of modern technologies such as genetic engineering, RNAi-based gene silencing and genome editing is not available for einkorn {{as there is no}} efficient in vitro tissue culture and plant regeneration system. In the present study an efficient and simple protocol for plant regeneration via direct or indirect somatic embryogenesis and organogenesis has been developed. Various auxins used as sole inductors in einkorn displayed low effect for morphogenesis (0 - 8 %) and plant regeneration (1 - 2 shoots per explant). The addition of Daminozide, the inhibitor of biosynthesis of gibberellins, together with auxin significantly improved the formation of morphogenic structures, especially when Dicamba (51. 4 %) and Picloram (56. 6 %) were used for combination; furthermore, the simultaneous addition of cytokinin into induction medium significantly promoted in vitro performance. Among the tested cytokinins, the urea-type substances, such as TDZ and CPPU were more effective than the adenine type ones, BA and Zeatin, for the regulation of morphogenesis; especially, TDZ was more effective than CPPU for shoot formation (11. 73 vs. 7. 04 per regenerating callus). The highest morphogenic response of 90. 2 % with the production of more than 10 shoots per initial explant was observed when 3. 0 mg/L Dicamba, 50. 0 mg/L Daminozide and 0. 25 mg/L TDZ were combined together. Along with the identification of appropriate induction medium, the optimal developmental stage for einkorn was found as partially transparent immature embryo in size of around 1. 0 mm. Although in the present study the critical balance between plant growth regulators was established for einkorn only, we assume that further the proposed strategy could be successfully applied to <b>other</b> recalcitrant <b>cereal</b> <b>species</b> and genotypes...|$|R
40|$|Rice, {{one of the}} world's most {{important}} food plants, has important syntenic relationships with the <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species</b> and is a model plant for the grasses. Here we present a map-based, finished quality sequence that covers 95 % of the 389 Mb genome, including {{virtually all of the}} euchromatin and two complete centromeres. A total of 37, 544 non-transposable-element-related protein-coding genes were identified, of which 71 % had a putative homologue in Arabidopsis. In a reciprocal analysis, 90 % of the Arabidopsis proteins had a putative homologue in the predicted rice proteome. Twenty-nine per cent of the 37, 544 predicted genes appear in clustered gene families. The number and classes of transposable elements found in the rice genome are consistent with the expansion of syntenic regions in the maize and sorghum genomes. We find evidence for widespread and recurrent gene transfer from the organelles to the nuclear chromosomes. The map-based sequence has proven useful for the identification of genes underlying agronomic traits.

40|$|Repetitive DNA {{sequences}} {{have been}} demonstrated {{to play an important}} role for centromere function of eukaryotic chromosomes, including those from fission yeast, Drosophila melanogaster, and humans. Here we report on the isolation of a repetitive DNA element located in the centromeric regions of cereal chromosomes. A 745 -bp repetitive DNA clone, pSau 3 A 9, was isolated from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). This DNA element is located in the centromeric regions of all sorghum chromosomes, as demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Repetitive DNA sequences homologous to pSau 3 A 9 also are present in the centromeric regions of chromosomes from <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species,</b> including rice, maize, wheat, barley, rye, and oats. Probe pSau 3 A 9 also hybridized to the centromeric region of B chromosomes from rye and maize. The repetitive nature and its conservation in distantly related plant species indicate that the pSau 3 A 9 family may be associated with centromere function of cereal chromosomes. The absence of DNA sequences homologous to pSau 3 A 9 in dicot species suggests a faster divergence of centromere-related sequences compared with the telomere-related sequences in plants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAsparagine is an {{important}} nitrogen storage and transport molecule, but its accumulation as a free amino acid in crops has implications for food safety because free asparagine is a precursor for acrylamide formation during cooking and processing. Asparagine synthesis occurs by the amidation of aspartate, catalysed by asparagine synthetase, and this study concerned the expression of asparagine synthetase (TaASN) genes in wheat. The expression of three genes, TaASN 1 - 3, was studied in different tissues {{and in response to}} nitrogen and sulphur supply. The expression of TaASN 2 in the embryo and endosperm during mid to late grain development was the highest of any of the genes in any tissue. Both TaASN 1 and TaASN 2 increased in expression through grain development, and in the grain of field-grown plants during mid-development in response to sulphur deprivation. However, only TaASN 1 was affected by nitrogen or sulphur supply in pot-based experiments, showing complex tissue-specific and developmentally-changing responses. A putative N-motif or GCN 4 -like regulatory motif was found in the promoter of TaASN 1 genes from several cereal species. As the study was completed, a fourth gene, TaASN 4, was identified from recently available genome data. Phylogenetic analysis showed that <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species</b> have similar asparagine synthetase gene families to wheat...|$|E
40|$|Background Cellulose from {{grasses and}} cereals makes {{up much of}} the {{potential}} raw material for biofuel production. It is not clear if cellulose microfibrils from grasses and cereals differ in structure from those of other plants. The structures of the highly oriented cellulose microfibrils in the cell walls of the internodes of the bamboo Pseudosasa amabilis are reported. Strong orientation facilitated {{the use of a}} range of scattering techniques. Results Small-angle neutron scattering provided evidence of extensive aggregation by hydrogen bonding through the hydrophilic edges of the sheets of chains. The microfibrils had a mean centre-to-centre distance of 3. 0 nm in the dry state, expanding on hydration. The expansion on hydration suggests that this distance between centres was through the hydrophilic faces of adjacent microfibrils. However in the other direction, perpendicular to the sheets of chains, the mean, disorder-corrected Scherrer dimension from wide-angle X-ray scattering was 3. 8 nm. It is possible that this dimension is increased by twinning (crystallographic coalescence) of thinner microfibrils over part of their length, through the hydrophobic faces. The wide-angle scattering data also showed that the microfibrils had a relatively large intersheet d-spacing and small monoclinic angle, features normally considered characteristic of primary-wall cellulose. Conclusions Bamboo microfibrils have features found in both primary-wall and secondary-wall cellulose, but are crystallographically coalescent {{to a greater extent than}} is common in celluloses from other plants. The extensive aggregation and local coalescence of the microfibrils are likely to have parallels in <b>other</b> grass and <b>cereal</b> <b>species</b> and to influence the accessibility of cellulose to degradative enzymes during conversion to liquid biofuels...|$|R

Within the phytochemicals, lignans are of increasing interest for their potential anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities. The aim of this work is {{to contribute to the}} updating of food lignan databases by providing the profile and the amount of lignans in cereals, buckwheat and several cereal based foods commonly consumed in human diets.

40|$|The orange wheat blossom midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin), can {{significantly}} reduce wheat yield. Growing resistant wheat cultivars {{is an effective}} way of managing this pest. The assessment of cultivar resistance in field trials is difficult because of unequal pressure of S. mosellana caused by differences in cultivar heading dates relative to the flight period of S. mosellana adult females and huge variations of egg laying conditions from 1 day to another. To overcome these hurdles and to expose all cultivars homogeneously to the pest, an assessment method of cultivar resistance was developed under semi-field conditions. In 2015, the resistance of 64 winter wheat cultivars to S. mosellana was assessed. Few or no larvae developed in the ears of resistant cultivars, but in susceptible cultivars, large numbers of larvae developed. Seventeen cultivars proved to be resistant, whereas 47 were susceptible. The identification of new resistant cultivars offers more opportunities to manage S. mosellana. The phenotyping method is easy, cheap, efficient and reliable. It {{can be used to}} guide the breeding of new resistant wheat cultivars.

40|$|Maize (corn) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely grown cereal crops globally. Fungal {{diseases}} of maize cause significant economic damage by reducing maize yields and by increasing input costs for disease management. The most sustainable control of maize diseases is through the release and planting of maize cultivars with durable disease resistance. The wheat gene Lr 34 provides durable and partial field resistance against multiple fungal diseases of wheat, including three wheat rust pathogens and wheat powdery mildew. Because of its unique qualities, Lr 34 became a cornerstone in many wheat disease resistance programmes. The Lr 34 resistance is encoded by a rare variant of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that evolved after wheat domestication. An Lr 34 -like disease resistance phenotype has not been reported in <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species,</b> including maize. Here, we transformed the Lr 34 resistance gene into the maize hybrid Hi-II. Lr 34 -expressing maize plants showed increased resistance against the biotrophic fungal disease common rust and the hemi-biotrophic disease northern corn leaf blight. Furthermore, the Lr 34 -expressing maize plants developed a late leaf tip necrosis phenotype, without negative impact on plant growth. With this and previous reports, it could be shown that Lr 34 is effective against various biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic diseases that collectively parasitize all major cereal crop species...|$|E

Differences within Australian B. sorokiniana populations were revealed by cluster analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms in genomic DNA of 48 B. sorokiniana isolates collected from the northern grain-growing region of Australia. Isolates collected from SB infections clustered apart from isolates collected from CRR infections. A subset of 31 B. sorokiniana isolates was assessed for their abilities to cause SB infections on barley leaves using a differential set of 15 barley genotypes and three <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species.</b> The pathogen samples included 14 isolates from CRR infections of either wheat or barley and 14 isolates from SB infections of barley.

In contrast, isolates from CRR infections produced significantly less SB disease on inoculated barley leaves. Cluster analysis of the phenotypic infection response scores grouped isolates into three pathogenicity clusters demonstrating low, intermediate or high pathogenicity.

We have studied several seed-specific cereal promoters to investigate if promoter strength and specificity is maintained from a homologous to a heterologous system. Transgenic rice, wheat and barley were generated to study promoters of the bifunctional alpha-amylase subtilisin inhibitor gene (Isa) form barley, the Em gene from wheat and a number of storage protein promoters from barley, rice and wheat. The isa promoter from barley show differential control of reporter gene expression in grains of transgenic wheat and rice. The wheat Em promoter shows comparable reporter gene expression in transgenic wheat, barley and rice. The seed-specific promoters from wheat, barley and rice directed seed-specific reporter gene expression in a homologous system. However, in a heterologous system the storage protein promoters either maintained seed-specific reporter gene expression, or showed differential control of reporter gene expression, or failed to direct any reporter gene expression.

There is relatively high diversity in the intron region of HsDhn 3 compared to the two exon regions. We have found subtle differences in K segments led to changes in amino acids chemical properties. Predictions for protein interaction profiles suggest the presence of a protein-binding site in HsDHN 3 that coincides with the K 1 segment. Comparison of DHN 3 to closely related cereals showed that all of them contain a nuclear localization signal sequence flanking to the K 1 segment and a novel conserved region located between the S and K 1 segments [E(D/T) DGMGGR].

Fatty acids were extracted from flour samples with n-hexane, and derivatized into volatile methyl esters, using TMSH (trimethylsulfonium hydroxide) in methanol. Soluble sugars were extracted from defatted and dried samples of barley flour with 96 % ethanol, and further derivatized into the corresponding trimethylsilyl (TMS) oximes, using hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution and BSTFA (N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl) -trifluoroacetamide).

Therefore, multivariate analysis was applied to numerical values of automatically integrated areas of the identified fatty acid methyl esters and TMS oximes of soluble sugars. The application of hierarchical cluster analysis showed a great similarity between the investigated flour samples of barley cultivars, according to their fatty acid content (0. 96).

40|$|Modifications to {{the gaseous}} {{envelope}} by callus during culture in Petri dishes {{were shown to}} reduce growth and promote necrosis of several rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars. Incubating callus under a continuous flow of gas mixtures of known composition suggested that the inhibition of growth {{was caused by the}} accumulation of ethylene, the depletion of oxygen and, to a lesser extent, the accumulation of carbon dioxide. In order to evaluate the importance of ethylene accumulation aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) and silver nitrate (AgNO 3), were added to the nutrient medium and ethylene measurements performed during callus culture. Ethylene restricted callus growth particularly under high (35 degrees C) as compared to moderate (25 degrees C) temperatures and under illuminated as compared to darkened incubation. Under illuminated incubation at 25 degrees C AVG (5 mmol m(- 3)) and AgNO 3 (50 mmol m(- 3)) significantly improved callus growth (100 and 60 %, respectively) while ACC (200 mmol m(- 3)) significantly decreased growth (40 %). AVG and AgNO 3 were less effective under dark incubation at 25 degrees C where ethylene production was lower. Furthermore, callus growth was significantly better in large as compared to small culture vessels since the ethylene concentration was diluted and more oxygen was available for respiration. Better control of ethylene and increased oxygen availability could be a way of producing healthy callus for the formation of embryogenic tissues of otherwise recalcitrant cultivars of rice (e. g.

Hulless barleys (HB) are good sources of β-glucans and the content is quite variable among varieties. In order to evaluate the potential of HB as functional feeds, an in vitro experiment was carried out to study the fermentation characteristics of 6 HB varieties varying in their β-glucan contents (36 - 99 g/kg DM) in comparison to 3 hulled barleys and 5 oats. After a pepsin-pancreatin hydrolysis, the ingredients were incubated in a buffer solution containing minerals and pig feces as inoculum. The accumulated gas production, proportional to the amount of fiber fermented, was measured for 48 h and modeled. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and ammonia concentration were measured in the fermented solutions. A cereal type effect (P < 0. 05) was observed on the fermentation kinetics parameters. Rates of degradation and total gas productions were higher in HB than in oats (P < 0. 05) but no difference was observed between HB varieties. On the contrary, differences were found between HB for lag time and rate of degradation. The production of SCFA was also higher with HB (6. 1 mMol/g DM incubated; P < 0. 05) than with hulled barleys and oats (4. 9 and 2. 9 mMol/g DM incubated respectively).

The Fat sequence was not present in oats and in two barley species, Hordeum vulgare and Hordeum spontaneum, that we investigated. Only very low amounts of the Fat element were detected on the chromosomes of two other barley species, Hordeum geniculatum and Hordeum chilense, with different genome compositions. The chromosomes of <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species</b> exhibited distinct hybridisation patterns with the Fat probe, and labelling intensity varied significantly depending on the species or genome. The highest amount of hybridisation was detected on chromosomes of the D genome of Aegilops and Triticum and on chromosomes of the S genome of Agropyron. Despite the bioinformatics analysis of several BAC clones that revealed the tandem organisation of the Fat element, hybridisation with the Fat probe produces uneven, diffuse signals in the proximal regions of chromosomes. In some of the genomes we investigated, however, it also forms distinct, sharp clusters in chromosome-specific positions, and the brightest fluorescence was always observed on group 4 chromosomes.

In contrast, oat generated higher ammonia (Pb 0. 05) production (1. 4 mMol/g DM incubated, on average) than both hB and HB (1. 0 mMol/g). In conclusion, hB are better fermented, produce more beneficial (SCFA) and less harmful (ammonia) metabolites and have a better potential than <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species</b> to modulate gut microbiota and improve gut health.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a rice (Oryza sativa) genome annotation database (Osa 1) that provides structural and functional annotation for this emerging model species. Using the sequence of O. sativa subsp. japonica cv Nipponbare from the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project, pseudomolecules, or virtual contigs, of the 12 rice chromosomes were constructed. Our most recent release, version 3, represents our third build of the pseudomolecules and is composed of 98 % finished sequence. Genes were identified using a series of computational methods developed for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that were modified for use with the rice genome. In release 3 of our annotation, we identified 57, 915 genes, of which 14, 196 are related to transposable elements. Of these 43, 719 nontransposable element-related genes, 18, 545 (42. 4 %) were annotated with a putative function, 5, 777 (13. 2 %) were annotated as encoding an expressed protein with no known function, and the remaining 19, 397 (44. 4 %) were annotated as encoding a hypothetical protein. Multiple splice forms (5, 873) were detected for 2, 538 genes, {{resulting in a total}} of 61, 250 gene models in the rice genome. We incorporated experimental evidence into 18, 252 gene models {{to improve the quality of}} the structural annotation. A series of functional data types has been annotated for the rice genome that includes alignment with genetic markers, assignment of gene ontologies, identification of flanking sequence tags, alignment with homologs from related species, and syntenic mapping with <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>species.</b> All structural and functional annotation data are available through interactive search and display windows as well as through download of flat files. To integrate the data with other genome projects, the annotation data are available through a Distributed Annotation System and a Genome Browser. All data can be obtained through the project Web pages at [URL]...|$|E
