40|$|W. Luo has {{investigated}} the distribution <b>of</b> <b>zeros</b> <b>of</b> the derivative of the Selberg zeta function associated to compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. In essence, the main results in Luo's article involve {{the following three}} points: Finiteness for the number <b>of</b> <b>zeros</b> in the half plane {{to the left of}} the critical line; an asymptotic expansion for the counting function measuring the vertical distribution of zeros; and an asymptotic expansion for the counting function measuring the horizontal distance <b>of</b> <b>zeros</b> from the critical line. In the present article, we study the more complicated setting <b>of</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>zeros</b> <b>of</b> the derivative of the Selberg zeta function associated to a non-compact, finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surface. There are numerous difficulties which exist in the non-compact case that are not present in the compact setting, beginning with the fact that in the non-compact case the Selberg zeta function does not satisfy the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. To be more specific, we actually study the <b>zeros</b> <b>of</b> the derivative of ZH, where Z is the Selberg zeta function and H is the Dirichlet series component of the scattering matrix, both associated to an arbitrary finite-volume hyperbolic Riemann surface.
