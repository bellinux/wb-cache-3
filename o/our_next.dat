25|$|In {{my career}} when I prosecute {{the worst of}} the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only {{appropriate}} punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. <b>Our</b> <b>next</b> congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.|$|E
25|$|More subtly, {{we should}} be able to {{determine}} <b>our</b> <b>next</b> action based on the results of previous actions. To do this, Haskell has an operator >>= (pronounced bind) with type IO a → (a → IOnbsp&b) → IOnbsp&b. That is, the operand on the left is an I/O action that returns a value of type a; the operand on the right is a function that can pick an I/O action based on the value produced by the action on the left. The resulting combined action, when performed, performs the first action, then evaluates the function with the first action's return value, then performs the second action, and finally returns the second action's value.|$|E

25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does <b>our</b> <b>next</b> generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but {{this is the only way}} they can get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E

500|$|After {{being dropped}} from Epic Records {{shortly after the}} reissued edition of Apartment Life (1997), Ivy began {{recording}} new material for their upcoming studio album. However, the recording process halted after a fire closed down the New York City studio where they regularly recorded.

Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to {{imagine what it would be}} like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for <b>our</b> <b>next</b> film." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Edge of the Ocean" [...] {{was written}} by Ivy band members Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase. Production of the track was handled by Schlesinger and Chase. In a 2011 {{interview}} with Magnet, Chase stated that while writing [...] "Edge of the Ocean", they tried [...] "to go 100 percent" [...] with creating a lyrical balance that [...] " [...] from a specific place and yet remain general, even vague, enough that they can apply to anyone". In a previous interview with Spinzone, Chase and Durand said that they hoped that [...] "Edge of the Ocean" [...] would prove commercial enough to [...] "mean the difference between making <b>our</b> <b>next</b> album or not".|$|E
500|$|In 1991 they {{released}} their first full-length album, 13-Point Program to Destroy America on Dischord Records. [...] This was followed {{a year later}} by Plays Pretty for Baby, also on Dischord. [...] During the recording of the band's follow-up to Plays Pretty for Baby, Steve Kroner left the band. [...] The remaining quartet continued to record, but eventually dissolved in 1992.

500|$|Due to {{the success}} of [...] "Give it Away", the band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would {{ultimately}} be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's <b>our</b> <b>next</b> single.'" [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magiks second single.

He co-starred {{in his first}} comedic role in the romantic comedy-drama Crazy, Stupid, Love, with Steve Carell and Emma Stone. Gosling took cocktail-making classes at a Los Angeles bar in preparation {{for his role as}} a smooth-talking ladies' man. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said his [...] "seductive command presence suggests we may have found <b>our</b> <b>next</b> George Clooney". Peter Travers declared him [...] "a comic knockout" [...] while Claudia Puig of USA Today felt he reveals a [...] "surprising" [...] "knack for comedy." [...] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was a box office success, grossing over $142 million worldwide. With adjustments for inflation, it is the second most successful of Gosling's career.|$|E
500|$|Mary {{turned her}} {{attention}} to finding a new husband from the royalty of Europe. However, when her uncle, the Cardinal of Lorraine, began negotiations with Archduke Charles of Austria without her consent, she angrily objected and the negotiations foundered. Her own attempt to negotiate a marriage to Don Carlos, the mentally unstable heir apparent of King Philip II of Spain, was rebuffed by Philip. Elizabeth attempted to neutralise Mary by suggesting that she marry English Protestant Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (Sir Henry Sidney's brother-in-law and the English queen's own favourite), whom Elizabeth trusted and thought she could control. She sent an ambassador, Thomas Randolph, to tell Mary that if she would marry an English nobleman, Elizabeth would [...] "proceed to the inquisition of her right and title to be <b>our</b> <b>next</b> cousin and heir". The proposal came to nothing, not least because the intended bridegroom was unwilling.|$|E
500|$|Mike Stagno {{said that}} Youthanasia {{features}} [...] "a more traditional type of metal". He explained {{that even though}} the music on a number of tracks remains quite heavy, it was obvious that the thrash metal is [...] "very scarce" [...] on this record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed that Megadeth have abandoned some of the more experimental, progressive elements in their music. Similarly, Chris Ayers of Exclaim! felt that with Youthanasia, the band [...] "eroded their brilliant thrash to mid-paced chug". According to the band's official website, [...] "Youthanasia marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following the footsteps of their previous album." [...] Speaking about the stylistic direction of the album, then-guitarist Marty Friedman stated: [...] "We pretty much stick to our guns. It's not like we're gonna change <b>our</b> <b>next</b> album to try and follow the trend. We don't really change with the times." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Schlesinger, Ivy then {{signed with}} Nettwerk because [...] "their roster {{was similar to}} Ivy across the board". After being {{released}} prematurely in Japan on November 8, 2000, the album was a quick success. Nettwerk's head of marketing, Marie Scheibert, stated that Long Distance became one of Amazon.com's top imports. The album was released in the United States on July 10, 2001, eight months later. During recording sessions, Durand, Schlesinger and fellow band member Andy Chase decided [...] "to go one hundred percent" [...] {{on one of the}} tracks, which would later become [...] "Edge of the Ocean". Ivy stated that the song, which would later be released as the album's third single, was created in hopes that it would [...] "mean the difference between making <b>our</b> <b>next</b> album or not". Along with [...] "Edge of the Ocean", the trio started writing songs that were [...] "less atmospheric" [...] than those on Apartment Life, but contained more [...] "infectious melodies", which the band preferred.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{achieved}} mainstream {{success in}} the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, Julian, was born in April. During their Royal Variety Show performance that was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at his audience: [...] "For <b>our</b> <b>next</b> song, I'd like to ask for your help. For {{the people in the}} cheaper seats, clap your hands... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery." [...] After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, moviemaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works. The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue {{had written a}} track for Hot Chip. He told NME, [...] "Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our {{management}} to us– it was totally bizarre. It was {{the beginnings of a}} track– I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for <b>our</b> <b>next</b> album, after Made in the Dark." [...] Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear. Goddard said, [...] "We've been telling lots of lies and rumours about it because we found it quite funny." ...|$|E
