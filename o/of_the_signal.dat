40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} automatic recognition {{technique of}} analog modulation scheme and <b>signal</b> waveform detection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signals</b> in a surveillance system. This system consists of array antenna signal processor and automatic signal recognition/demodulation modules. Firstly, directions of arrival (DOA) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>signals</b> are estimated by using super-resolution algorithm. Using these DOA estimates, <b>the</b> respective <b>signal</b> is beamformed while nulling out {{the others and}} thus increase SINR <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. Higher SINR will therefore improve recognition detection per-formance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system.

5|$|Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we have {{a better}} {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> transduction that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. Jasmonic acid is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to wild type plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying methyl jasmonate to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression. The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying fusicoccin, which activates the H+ ATPase inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} of , the antennae of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the same}} spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signal</b> from the array. The antennae may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E
