40|$|Introduction Post-operative {{patients}} with undiagnosed {{obstructive sleep apnea}} {{are at risk of}} sudden respiratory failure after receiving anesthesia because of repressed respiratory and hemodynamic responses [1]. While all patients have their oxygen saturation automatically monitor in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), few have their respiration rate monitored. The goal of our study is to develop algorithms that reliably extract the respiration rate from a standard pulse oximeter signal. The pulse oximeter is an inexpensive and widely available devise that measures the pulsitile waveform, the plethysmogram (PPG), and oxygen saturation. The PPG measured by the pulse oximeter, commonly referred to as the "pleth waveform", is an indirect measurement of blood volume under the sensor. The temporal behavior of this signal is influenced both by the cardiac and respiratory cycles. Respiratory induced variations (RIV) in PPG amplitude have been documented and associated with airway <b>obstru...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} {{excluded}} K n minor theorem of Robertson and Seymour to infinite graphs, and deduce a structural {{characterization of the}} infinite graphs that have no K # 0 minor. The latter is a refinement of an earlier characterization of Robertson, Seymour and the second author. 1. Introduction In both finite and infinite graph theory, there are numerous so-called excluded minor theorems, theorems that describe {{the structure of the}} graphs not containing one or several given graphs as a minor. A classic example is the theorem of Wagner [15] that a graph has no minor isomorphic to K 5 if and only if it can be constructed by piecing together copies of planar graphs and of two specific non-planar graphs W and K in a certain tree-like fashion. (In modern terms: a graph has no K 5 minor if and only if it has a certain tree-decomposition into planar graphs and copies of W and K.) Such characterizations can be useful: we often need to exclude certain minors when they are obvious <b>obstru</b> [...] ...|$|E

However, the potential association between impaired pulmonary function and NAFLD has been less investigated. This study examined the relationship between pulmonary function and hepatic steatosis in 9976 adults participating in a cross-sectional analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NAFLD was defined as hepatic steatosis presented on ultrasound examinations in the absence of other known liver diseases.
