40|$|Reducing {{metamerism}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} goals of spectral printing. There are three fundamental questions to answer in spectral reproduction: 1. What is the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>primaries?</b> 2. Which types <b>of</b> <b>primaries</b> to use? 3. How to find the ink combination that replicates a given spectral reflectance as closely as possible for a given set <b>of</b> <b>primaries?</b> This paper focuses on the first question. We evaluate the extent to which metamerism is reduced as more and more inks are used. The study considers both a realistic printer and a realistic additive displaysr with both idealized and actual ink reflectances...|$|R

40|$|The {{mean number}} <b>of</b> <b>primaries</b> molted by Gray-headed Albatrosses (Diomedea chrysostoma) varied with year and {{previous}} breeding experience independently, {{but was not}} related to individual reproductive success over a longer period. Within each category of breeding experience, birds renewed fewer primaries during the "poor" year of 1994, when subsequent reproductive success was only 27 %, than in 1993 when subsequent reproductive success was 57 %. Inspection of individual feathers indicated that the outer primaries were least likely to be renewed during the period of stress. Within each year, birds that failed in their breeding attempt during the previous year renewed fewer feathers than those which reared a chick two years previously, a difference which was probably partly related to the time available for molting. In 1994 only, the date of failure in the previous year was inversely related to the number <b>of</b> <b>primaries</b> molted by males. The arrival mass of males was positively correlated with the number <b>of</b> <b>primaries</b> molted in two out of four seasons. Males and females molted similar numbers <b>of</b> <b>primaries...</b>|$|R

5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E
