25|$|Mount Diablo has {{inspired}} many artists and writers. Early work centered on exploration, surveying and {{was related to}} the rise and popularization of tourism in the Pacific west. Themes were suggested and heightened by early tourism promoters, the beginnings of the area's preservation and the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement.</b> The focus was accelerated by artists associated with the University of California, Berkeley, the California College of Arts, the actions of the organizations Save Mount Diablo and the Mount Diablo Interpretive Association, and area art centers, galleries, and museums. In modern times Mount Diablo art has been most strongly represented in plein aire painting, especially the group Artists for Action, and photography.|$|E
25|$|After the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> {{in the early}} 1970s intersections among feminists and other social justice movements emerged. The feminists that took interests in these movements explored how oppressions were linked through gender, race, class and ecology, as well as species and ideas of nationhood. They took cues from Green Party politics, peace movements, and direct action movements. These feminists developed texts, such as Women and Nature (Susan Griffin 1978), The Death of Nature (Carolyn Merchant 1980) and Gyn/Ecology (Mary Daly 1978). These texts helped to propel the association between domination by man on women and the domination of culture on nature. From these texts feminist activism of the 1980s linked ideas of ecology and the environment. For example, conferences for women devoted to living on the earth and protests against nuclear testing and other militarism that oppresses femininity.|$|E
25|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> {{lay in the}} {{response}} to increasing levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere during the Industrial Revolution. The emergence of great factories and the concomitant immense growth in coal consumption gave rise to an unprecedented level of air pollution in industrial centers; after 1900 the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. The first large-scale, modern environmental laws {{came in the form}} of Britain's Alkali Acts, passed in 1863, to regulate the deleterious air pollution (gaseous hydrochloric acid) given off by the Leblanc process, used to produce soda ash. An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted smoke, grit, dust and fumes under supervision.|$|E

500|$|In surveys made in Europe and the United States, {{green is}} the color most {{commonly}} associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope and envy. In Europe and the U.S., green is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health, but [...] in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. Because of its association with nature, it {{is the color}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement.</b> Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves {{as part of the}} Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties.
