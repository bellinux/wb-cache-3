5|$|The Institution for the Encouragement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts</b> in Scotland {{was founded}} in 1819 in Edinburgh, to provide an {{opportunity}} for artists to present their work. It came to be dominated by a small aristocratic elite and excluded artists from its committee. This led to the founding of the Royal Scottish Academy of Art in 1826. The resulting competition between the two bodies eventually resulted in a de facto merger. In 1835 the now Royal Institution's building on Princess Street, Edinburgh became the Academy's home for exhibitions. The Academy was granted a Royal Charter in 1837 and its members were instrumental in the foundation of the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh, which opened in 1859. The Scottish National Portrait Gallery {{was founded in}} 1882. The Glasgow Institute was formed in 1861 to provide exhibiting opportunities in the growing city similar to those in Edinburgh. It opened its own gallery on Sauchiehall Street in 1879. It received a Royal charter in 1896 and became the Royal Glasgow Institute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts.</b>|$|E

5|$|The government's {{creation}} of the Imperial Academy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts</b> in the 1820s {{played a pivotal role}} in influencing and expanding the visual arts in Brazil, mainly by educating generations of artists but also by serving as a stylistic guideline. The Academy's origins lay in the foundation of the Escola Real das Ciências, Artes e Ofícios (Royal School of the Sciences, Arts and Crafts) in 1816 by the Portuguese King JoãoVI. Its members—of whom the most famous was Jean-Baptiste Debret—were French émigrées who worked as painters, sculptors, musicians and engineers. The school's main goal was to encourage French aesthetics and the Neoclassical style to replace the prevalent baroque style. Plagued by a lack of funds since its inception, the school was later renamed as the Academy of Fine Arts in 1820, and in 1824 received its final name under the Empire: Imperial Academy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scottish art in {{the nineteenth}} century is the body of visual art made in Scotland, by Scots, or about {{scottish}} subjects.

Art education in Edinburgh focused on the Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh. Glasgow School of Art was founded in 1845 and Grays School of Art in Aberdeen in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on October 9, 1876. His {{earliest}} pattern coins designed {{during his tenure}} at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar. In 1876, Morgan enrolled {{as a student at}} the Pennsylvania Academy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts</b> to prepare to create a new Liberty head design. Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design. For the representation of Liberty, Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek–style figures. Morgan's friend, artist Thomas Eakins, suggested he use Anna Willess Williams of Philadelphia as a model. In total, Morgan had five sittings with Williams; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen.|$|E
