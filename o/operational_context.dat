Rather the German concept of wars of movement and concentrated force were seen in wars of Prussia and the German wars of unification. The first European general to introduce rapid movement, concentrated power and integrated military effort was Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus during the Thirty Years' War. The appearance of the aircraft and tank in the First World War, called an RMA, offered the German military a chance {{to get back to the}} traditional war of movement as practised by Moltke the Elder.

40|$|Purpose – The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are: to identify the key defining elements of a subcontractor plant from an operations management perspective and examine {{whether there are differences}} between the <b>operational</b> <b>contexts</b> of such plants and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) plants; and to examine whether these differences should translate into different operational practices, addressing the specific case of process quality management practices. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a multiple case study involving five plants in the electronics industry representative of the OEM and different subcontractor contexts. Findings – Results suggest that the <b>operational</b> <b>contexts</b> of subcontractor and OEM plants are different and that, as a result, these types of plants should emphasize different sets of process quality management practices. Research limitations/implications – Results are considered to be generalizable to most discrete goods industries. However, future research should ascertain whether these results replicate in industries other than electronics. Practical implications – OEMs, who have a critical role in disseminating best practice within the supply chain, must recognize the differences between OEM and subcontractor environments and avoid pushing one-size-fits-all best practice programs along the chain. Originality/value – Research in outsourcing to date has focused on the outsourcing decision per se and has mainly taken the perspective of the outsourcer firm. This study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the operational implications of outsourcing decisions for subcontractor plants. It also responds to calls for more research linking quality management and supply chain management...|$|R

The approach uses a three-layer architecture that, while similar to previous work, pro-vides several significant improvements.

Unfortunately, there is a down side to this countermeasure in that personnel can suffer from several minutes of grogginess immediately after a nap has ended. This phenomenon is called sleep inertia.
