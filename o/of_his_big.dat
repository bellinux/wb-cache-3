5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>big</b> public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E

25|$|Bhagavata Purana {{depicts the}} birth of the narmad. According to the text, Lord Vishnu in one of his incarnations {{appeared}} as Vaman in the sacrificial arena of Asur King Mahabali. Then in order to measure the universe, he extended his left foot {{to the end of the}} universe and pierced a hole in its covering with the nail <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>big</b> toe. Through the hole, the pure water of the Causal Ocean (Divine Brahm-Water) entered this universe as the Ganges River. Having washed the lotus feet of the Lord, which are covered with reddish saffron, the water of the Ganges acquired a very beautiful pink colour. Because the Ganges directly touches the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu (Narayana) before descending within this universe, it is known as Bhagavat-Padi or Vishnupadi which means Emanating from the lotus feet of Bhagavan (God). It finally settles in Brahmaloka or Brahmapura, abode of Lord Brahma before descending to planet Earth at the request of Bhagiratha and held safely by Lord Shiva on his head to prevent destruction of Bhumi Devi (Mother Earth). Then, the Ganges was released from Lord Shiva's hair to meet the needs of the country according to Hindu mythology. In other legends, Himavan fathered Parvati and Ganga.|$|E

[...] Chicago Tribune writers noted that Ditka got a kick out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>big</b> earring and fashion sense. [...] In the 1987–88 NFL playoffs, although had only one previous start in his two-year career, he started for the Bears in place of five-year veteran Mike Richardson at left cornerback against the Redskins in their January 10, 1988 Divisional playoff game.

In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to The New York Times: [...] "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all.

500|$|Dworsky's {{first major}} {{commission}} was {{to design a}} basketball arena for his alma mater, the University of Michigan. The members of the 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team had reunions with Fritz Crisler every five years in Ann Arbor, {{and it was at}} one of those reunions that Crisler (by then the school's athletic director) gave Dworsky one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>big</b> breaks, asking him to design the arena. Built in 1967, the arena was named Crisler Arena, as a tribute to the coach. Dworsky's design of the arena was well received and was said to demonstrate [...] "his ability to combine majesty of scale with human accessibility". The roof of Crisler Arena is made of two plates, each weighing approximately 160tons. The bridge-like construction allows them to expand or contract given the change of seasons or the weight of the snow. Crisler Arena remains the home of Michigan's basketball team and houses memorabilia and trophies from all Wolverine varsity athletic teams.|$|E
