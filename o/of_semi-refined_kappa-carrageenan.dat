40|$|Carrageenan and {{konjac glucomannan}} mixture is {{synergistic}} in producing a gel with high gel strength, good and elastic texture, {{as well as}} low syneresis. The synergistic effect is a very crucial factor in the utilization of carrageenan and konjac glucomannan mixture extensively for both food and non-food purposes. The use of {{these two types of}} polysaccharides can also reduce dependence on imported gelling agents such as locust bean gum. This study aims to produce such concentration <b>of</b> <b>semi-refined</b> carrageenan and glucomannan mixture as best gelling agents by evaluating the physical properties of the resulted gel mixture in terms of gel strength, hardness, rigidity, syneresis, and gel micro structure. The experimental design used in this study is completely randomized design with two factors to compare namely proportion ratio of gel-forming material and concentration of gel-forming material. Data is then processed using analysis of variance and the Tukey’s test. * Corresponding author...|$|R
40|$|Pearl millet is an underutilized grain crop {{commonly}} used as whole flour for traditional food preparation and hence confined to traditional consumers and {{to people of}} lower economic strata. In this study two commercially available pearl millet varieties (Kalukombu & MRB) obtained from the local market were milled into whole flour, semi refined flour & bran rich fraction. These milling fractions were evaluated for nutrients, antinutrients and mineral bioaccessibility. The bran rich fraction, a by product of flour milling contained significantly (P[*]≤[*] 0. 05) higher ash content (3. 3 & 3. 5 g/ 100 g in K & MRB respectively). Minerals like phosphorus, calcium and antinutrients like oxalates, phytates, were found mainly distributed in the bran fraction. The nutrient content <b>of</b> <b>semi-refined</b> flour was comparable to whole flour except for the fat content (1. 3 %). Due to partial separation of the bran fraction, semi refined flour was low in antinutrients which improved its mineral bioaccessibility making it nutritionally superior...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel {{production}} by methanolysis <b>of</b> <b>semi-refined</b> rapeseed oil was studied over lime based catalysts. In {{order to improve}} the catalysts basicity a commercial CaO material was impregnated with aqueous solution of lithium nitrate (Li/Ca = 03 atomic ratio). The catalysts were calcined at 575 degrees C and 800 degrees C, for 5 h, to remove nitrate ions before reaction. The XRD patterns of the fresh catalysts, including the bare CaO, showed lines ascribable to CaO and Ca(OH) (2). The absence of XRD lines belonging to Li phases confirms the efficient dispersion of Li over CaO. In the tested condition (W-cat/W-oil = 5 %; CH 3 OH/oil = 12 molar ratio) all the fresh catalysts provided similar biodiesel yields (FAME > 93 % after 4 h) but the bare CaO catalyst was more stable. The activity decay of the Li modified samples {{can be related to}} the enhanced, by the higher basicity, calcium diglyceroxide formation during methanolysis which promotes calcium leaching. The calcination temperature for Li modified catalysts plays an important role since encourages the crystals sinterization which appears to improve the catalyst stability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the digestible and metabolizable energy values <b>of</b> <b>semi-refined</b> rice oil (RO) and refined soybean oil (SO) for weanling pigs (Experiment 1), as well as to evaluate how replacing SO with RO in weanling pig diets affects performance, intestinal histology, organ morphometry and the occurrence of diarrhea (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, 21 barrows, averaging 19. 63 ± 0. 37 kg body weight (BW), were used in a randomized complete block design experiment, with seven replications per treatment and one pig per experimental unit (metabolism cage). The treatments consisted of a reference diet and two test diets. The test diets were obtained by using 90 % of the reference diet and 10 % of RO or SO. The experimental period consisted of a 7 days adaptation period, followed by a 5 days collection period of feces and urine. The values of the apparent digestible energy, apparent metabolizable energy and N-corrected apparent metabolizable energy of the oils were, respectively, 26. 24, 25. 78 and 26. 01 MJkg− 1 for RO and 31. 74, 31. 35 and 31. 51 MJkg− 1 for SO. In Experiment 2, 120 weaned pigs, castrated males and females, averaging 6. 74 ± 0. 42 kg BW, were used in a randomized complete block design experiment, with eight replications per treatment and three pigs per experimental unit (pen) to evaluate the effects of five replacement levels of SO with RO in isonutritive weanling pig diets. The treatments were as follows: 4 : 0 —basal diet with 4 % of SO; 3 : 1 —basal diet with 3 % of SO and 1 % of RO; 2 : 2 —basal diet with 2 % of SO and 2 % of RO; 1 : 3 —basal diet with 1 % of SO and 3 % of RO; and 0 : 4 —basal diet with 4 % of RO. No effects of the replacement levels were observed in the weanling pigs' performance, organ morphometry or in their occurrence of diarrhea. However, a quadratic effect on the villus width and a cubic effect on the villus height:crypt depth ratio were observed in the duodenum.

40|$|A otimizaÃÃo do processo de prÃ-tratamento (refino) do Ãleo bruto de algodÃo, para obtenÃÃo de Ãleo semi-refinado, com aplicabilidade na produÃÃo de biocombustÃveis, Ã o {{principal}} objetivo desse trabalho. Este por sua vez Ã motivado pela exploraÃÃo de matÃriasprimas menos processadas e de menor custo para produÃÃo do biodiesel. Portanto, o emprego de Ãleo semi-refinado de algodÃo pode vir a contribuir para a reduÃÃo nos custos de produÃÃo do biodiesel. As variÃveis estudadas no prÃ-tratamento do Ãleo bruto de algodÃo foram escolhidas tendo como referencial o processo de refino convencional (refino quÃmico) com soda cÃustica. Os experimentos foram realizados utilizando planejamento experimental e os resultados foram interpretados de acordo com a metodologia de superfÃcie de resposta. As variÃveis estudadas foram: concentraÃÃo e excesso de soda cÃustica (soluÃÃo de NaOH), temperatura inicial e final. As respostas foram avaliadas em funÃÃo de alguns dos mais importantes parÃmetros de qualidade do Ãleo semi-refinado obtido (cor, acidez e teor de sabÃo) e da quantidade do co-produto de refino (borra) produzido. O excesso de soda cÃustica e a temperatura inicial foram Ãs variÃveis que influenciaram de modo mais significativo as respostas analisadas, dentro do alcance experimental estudado. A eficiÃncia na conversÃo a Ãsteres metÃlicos mostrou-se dependente da qualidade (cor, acidez e sabÃo) do Ãleo semirefinado de algodÃo utilizado. A concentraÃÃo do pigmento gossipol que estÃ diretamente relacionado Ã cor do Ãleo de algodÃo, sugere que o mesmo pode estar influenciando na conversÃo da reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo alcalina, por estar consumindo parte do catalisador. As condiÃÃes Ãtimas determinadas experimentalmente foram: concentraÃÃo e excesso de soda cÃustica 25 % (p/p) e 100 % (p/p), temperatura inicial e final 40 ÂC e 60 ÂC, respectivamente. Nessas condiÃÃes otimizadas o Ãleo semi-refinado obtido alcanÃou conversÃo de 94 % (p/p) a Ãsteres metÃlicos. Entretanto, o Ãleo obtido nas condiÃÃes otimizadas, por apresentar ainda uma elevada concentraÃÃo de sabÃo, foi submetido Ã lavagem com Ãgua, o qual reduziu seu teor de sabÃo. Assim, com esse Ãleo lavado/seco, apÃs reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo, alcanÃouse conversÃo de 96 % (p/p) em metil-ester. Esse biodiesel, submetido a uma segunda reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo conseguiu-se atingir uma conversÃo mÃxima de 98 % (p/p), ficando dentro das especificaÃÃes estabelecidas pela ANP (AgÃncia Nacional de PetrÃleo, GÃs Natural e BiocombustÃveis) The optimization of the pre-treatment (refining) {{of crude}} cottonseed oil, {{in order to}} obtain semi-refined oil, its applicability in the production of biofuels is the main objective of this work. This objective is motivated by the investigation of less processed or cheaper raw materials, for instance, semi-refined cotton oil, {{in order to reduce the}} cost of biodiesel production. The conditions of pre-treatment studied for the cotton crude oil of were chosen based on the conventional caustic soda refining process (chemical refining). The proposed process of biodiesel production was evaluated and the optimal operating conditions range was identified by application of the factorial design and response surface methodology. The studied variables were concentration and the caustic soda excess (solution NaOH), initial and final temperatures. The responses were evaluated according some of the most important quality parameters <b>of</b> <b>semi-refined</b> oil obtained (color, acidity and content of soap) and the amount of co-product of refining (soapstock) produced. The caustic soda excess and initial temperatures are the variables that most significantly influenced the responses analyzed within the experimental range studied. The efficiency of conversion to methyl esters was dependent on the quality (color, acidity and concentration of soap) in the semi-refined cotton oil used. Gossypol concentration was found to be highly correlated with color cottonseed oil,suggesting that it may influence the conversion in the alkaline transesterification reaction,consuming part of the catalyst. The best result for laboratory-scale reactions was 94 % (wt/wt) of ester conversion in optimum conditions, determined experimentally: concentration and caustic soda excess 25 % (wt/wt) and 100 % (wt/wt), initial and final temperatures 40 Â C and 60 Â C, respectively. These conditions the optimized semi-refined oil obtained conversion reached 94 % (wt/wt) of esters. However, the oil obtained under the conditions optimized for present a high concentration of soap, was subjected to washing with water, which reduced its content of soap. Then with the oil washed / dry, after transesterification reaction reached 96 % (wt/wt) of ester conversion. This biodiesel was again transesterificated reaching a conversion of 98 % (wt/wt), which, therefore, is within specifications established by the AN...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Mars Aqueous Processing System (MAPS) is to {{establish}} a flexible process that generates multiple products that are useful for human habitation. Selectively extracting useful components into an aqueous solution, and then sequentially recovering individual constituents, can obtain a suite <b>of</b> refined or <b>semi-refined</b> products. Similarities in the bulk composition (although not necessarily of the mineralogy) of Martian and Lunar soils potentially make MAPS widely applicable. Similar process steps can be conducted on both Mars and Lunar soils while tailoring the reaction extents and recoveries to the specifics of each location. The MAPS closed-loop process selectively extracts, and then recovers, constituents from soils using acids and bases. The emphasis on Mars involves the production of useful materials such as iron, silica, alumina, magnesia, and concrete with recovery of oxygen as a byproduct. On the Moon, similar chemistry is applied with emphasis on oxygen production. This innovation has been demonstrated to produce high-grade materials, such as metallic iron, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, and calcium oxide, from lunar and Martian soil simulants. Most of the target products exhibited purities of 80 to 90 percent or more, allowing direct use for many potential applications. Up to one-fourth of the feed soil mass was converted to metal, metal oxide, and oxygen products. The soil residue contained elevated silica content, allowing for potential additional refining and extraction for recovery of materials needed for photovoltaic, semiconductor, and glass applications. A high-grade iron oxide concentrate derived from lunar soil simulant was used to produce a metallic iron component using a novel, combined hydrogen reduction/metal sintering technique. The part was subsequently machined and found to be structurally sound. The behavior of the lunar-simulant-derived iron product was very similar to that produced using the same methods on a Michigan iron ore concentrate, which demonstrates that lunar-derived material {{can be used in a}} manner similar to conventional terrestrial iron. Metallic iron was also produced from the Mars soil simulant. The aluminum and magnesium oxide products produced by MAPS from lunar and Mars soil simulants exhibited excellent thermal stability, and were shown to be capable of use for refractory oxide structural materials, or insulation at temperatures far in excess of what could be achieved using unrefined soils. These materials exhibited the refractory characteristics needed to support iron casting and forming operations, as well as other thermal processing needs. Extraction residue samples contained up to 79 percent silica. Such samples were successfully fused into a glass that exhibited high light transmittance...|$|R
