40|$|Motivated by {{the entry}} into service of new {{aircraft}} such as the Airbus A 380 {{as well as the}} pressure to operate existing fleets at lower cost, not only in civil but also in military aviation, a new industry paradigm has emerged where MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) service providers or <b>OEMs</b> (<b>Original</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>Manufacturers)</b> supply spare parts to airline operators on a maintenance-by-the-hour basis. As a consequence, the associated logistics networks have reached unprecedented complexity: Component exchange commitments are now made to multiple operators, not only at their main bases but also at outstations. In this setting, the limitations of conventional Initial Provisioning methods can be overcome with high-fidelity simulation-based optimisation techniques. In particular, this paper discusses how value can be unlocked from new logistics policies for spare parts management in aviation. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} statistical methodology {{to construct an}} early automotive warranty issue detection model based on upstream supply chain information. This is contrary to extant methods that are mostly reactive and only rely on data available from the <b>OEMs</b> (<b>original</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>manufacturers).</b> For any upstream supply chain information with direct history from warranty claims, the research proposes hazard rate models to link upstream supply chain information as explanatory covariates for early detection of warranty issues. For any upstream supply chain information without direct warranty claims history, we introduce Bayesian hazard rate models to account for uncertainties of the explanatory covariates. In doing so, it improves both the accuracy of warranty issue detection {{as well as the}} lead time for detection. The proposed methodology is illustrated and validated using real-world data from a leading global Tier-one automotive supplier...|$|R
