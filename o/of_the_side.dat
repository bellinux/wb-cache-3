5|$|A {{right-handed}} opening batsman, Key made {{appearances at}} age-group level for Kent {{from the age}} of eleven, moving up until he made his first-class debut in 1998. He made eight first-class and 4 List A appearances for England's youth sides, and was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> which won the 1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Following a season of heavy run-scoring, Key was called up to the England A side in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{played the}} {{formation}} {{typical of the}} era: two full-backs, three half-backs and five forwards. With Tilson absent from the Manchester City line-up, Alec Herd moved across to Tilson's usual centre-forward position, and Bobby Marshall was selected at inside-right. For Everton, Albert Geldard who was injured for the semi-final was selected at outside right, and Ted Critchley who scored the winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final, was left out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{response}} from the team's management was to suspend four players. The team travelled to Toowoomba, where they defeated the locals 19–0. The Natives included a replacement player {{for only the second}} time, Henry Speakman, after the suspensions reduced the playing strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> The team then travelled back to New Zealand, and arrived in Invercargill on 5 August.|$|E
5|$|This tiling has four-way {{rotational}} symmetry around {{each of its}} squares. When the ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> lengths of the two squares is an irrational number such as the golden ratio, its cross-sections form aperiodic sequences with a similar recursive structure to the Fibonacci word. Generalizations of this tiling to three dimensions have also been studied.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{began taking}} pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010. The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change of the behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data {{and the other for}} 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E
5|$|Aside from football, Bell {{was also}} an {{accomplished}} amateur cricketer; he assisted Burnley Cricket Club between 1899 and 1919, and would often choose to play cricket rather than football when the seasons overlapped. He was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> that won the Lancashire League in 1901 {{and went on to}} captain the team that won three consecutive titles in 1906, 1907 and 1908. Bell won a fifth Lancashire League title with Burnley in the 1913 season. A left-handed batsman, he also bowled slow left arm. Bell represented the Lancashire Second XI on three occasions in 1905 and 1906. He was selected for two matches against the Surrey and Yorkshire second teams during the 1905 season and on 9 July 1906 he played in the Minor Counties Championship draw with Staffordshire at Turf Moor, entering play as a substitute after Herbert Rhodes was injured while fielding.|$|E

5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> trails in the park, {{which has been}} gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs. He {{was in charge of}} West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994, {{managing}} the club for 227 games as the team yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. He guided them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he should be given a chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> for only 53 games.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City {{were formed}} {{following}} {{a series of}} meetings {{during the first half of}} 1903 and replaced the former rugby league club of Manningham, whose Valley Parade ground they used. The club had already signed six players before they were accepted into the league before the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> were later signed by a five-man committee. The board directors appointed Robert Campbell as the club's first manager. Bradford City's first game ended in a 2–0 defeat at Grimsby Town and the first home game resulted in another loss to Gainsborough Trinity. Club captain Johnny McMillan finished the top goalscorer with 14 league and two FA Cup goals.|$|E

5|$|By 1934, the club's average {{attendance}} {{had risen}} to over 23,000, which allowed the club manager, Tom Mather, more transfer funds. Despite this, the core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> consisted of young local players, such as Matthews, Tommy Sale and Freddie Steele. Mathers resigned from his post in May 1935 to take the managerial job at Newcastle United, ending his 12-year tenure. Bob McGrory was appointed as the club's manager shortly afterward; he had previously played for the club for 14 years. In the 1935–36 season, the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division, nine points adrift of champions Sunderland. This was followed by two successive mid-table finishes, in 1936–37 and 1937–38. The club recorded its record league win, 10–3, over West Bromwich Albion in February 1937, in which Steele scored five goals. In April of that year, the club achieved its largest league crowd—51,373 against Arsenal. Steele's 33 league goals in the 1936–37 season remains a club record in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{originally}} {{being told}} by Redknapp he was not of Division One standard, let alone suitable for the Premier League, Primus proved his manager wrong by seizing his chance when other players missed out through injury and suspension. By {{the end of the}} 2002–03 season he had become a vital member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> that won the Division One title, winning the Portsmouth fans' player of the season as well as the PFA accolade for Division One. He scored once that season for Portsmouth in the League Cup against Peterborough United. Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to Christianity after a friend of his wife's invited him to church.|$|E

Stuart Broad has taken more wickets than any other English bowler in T20I, dismissing 65 batsmen with an average of 22.93. Paul Collingwood has captained the side the most on 30 occasions. Alex Hales is the only English batsman to have scored a century and holds the record for the highest score by an England player in T20I cricket, with 116 not out in a six wicket victory over Sri Lanka in March 2014.|$|E

5|$|From {{his debut}} onwards, Carrick {{was a regular}} in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 {{appearances}} {{in his first season}} with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in 2006–07, their first title success in four years. The following season he was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> that won the 2008 Champions League final, playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6–5 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the European Double. He has enjoyed continued success since then, and as of 2017, he is the only English player alongside Wayne Rooney to win the Premier League title, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Europa League and FIFA Club World Cup. In winning the 2016 FA Cup, Carrick completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{spent much}} of the 1934 season troubled by sore throats and back {{problems}} which restricted his appearances for Gloucestershire. His form for his county was good and in all first-class matches, he scored 2,366 runs (average 76.32), although he took fewer wickets at a higher average than the previous season. Awarded a benefit match, which raised just over £2,600, Hammond was idolised by the press and public for his achievements. In Tests, it was a different story; according to Wisden, he failed badly. England lost the Ashes, 2–1, in a series overshadowed at times by the Bodyline controversy. Hammond played in all five Tests against Australia but his top score was 43; he scored 162 runs at an average of 20.25, and took five wickets at an average of 72.80. Although the press and selectors supported him, there were some suggestions he should be left out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> and Hammond felt under great pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> {{stories of the}} war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, {{might have been the}} source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E
