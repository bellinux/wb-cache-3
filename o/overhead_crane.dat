5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded <b>overhead</b> <b>crane.</b> This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E

500|$|Work {{began on}} 221-T and 221-U in January 1944, {{with the former}} {{completed}} in September and the latter in December. The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of {{the high levels of}} radioactivity involved, all work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive. The 224-T and 224-U buildings were completed on 8 October 1944, and 224-B followed on 10 February 1945. The purification methods that were eventually used in 231-W were still unknown when construction commenced on 8 April 1944, but the plant was complete and the methods were selected {{by the end of the}} year.

Besides the energy optimal model, we also propose two other models to optimize time efficiency and safety during trans-portation.

2500|$|Chinook {{winds are}} said to {{sometimes}} cause {{a sharp increase in}} the number of migraine headaches suffered by the locals. At least one study conducted by the department of clinical neurosciences at the University of Calgary supports that belief. They are popularly believed to increase irritability and sleeplessness. In mid-winter over major centres such as Calgary, Chinooks can often override cold air in the city, trapping the pollutants in the cold air and causing inversion smog. At such times, it is possible for it to be cold at street level and much warmer at the tops of the skyscrapers and in higher terrain. In 1983, on the 45th floor [...] of the Petro-Canada Center, carpenters worked shirtless in +12°C, windy conditions (temperature reported to them by <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> operator), but were chagrined to find out the street temperature was still 20°C as they left work at 3:30 that afternoon.|$|E
2500|$|In a BWR, the {{containment}} strategy {{is a bit}} different. [...] A BWR's containment consists of a drywell where the reactor and associated cooling equipment is located and a wetwell. [...] The drywell is much smaller than a PWR containment and plays a larger role. During the theoretical leakage design basis accident the reactor coolant flashes to steam in the drywell, pressurizing it rapidly. [...] Vent pipes or tubes from the drywell direct the steam below the water level maintained in the wetwell (also known as a torus or suppression pool), condensing the steam, limiting the pressure ultimately reached. [...] Both the drywell and the wetwell are enclosed by a secondary containment building, maintained at a slight sub-atmospheric or negative pressure during normal operation and refueling operations. The containment designs are referred to by the names Mark I, Mark II, and Mark III. The Mark I is the oldest, distinguished by a drywell containment which resembles an inverted lightbulb above the wetwell which is a steel torus containing water. The Mark II was used with late BWR-4 and BWR-5 reactors. It is called an [...] "over-under" [...] configuration with the drywell forming a truncated cone on a concrete slab. Below is a cylindrical suppression chamber made of concrete rather than just sheet metal. Both use a lightweight steel or concrete [...] "secondary containment" [...] over the top floor which is kept at a slight negative pressure so that air can be filtered. The top level is a large open space with an <b>overhead</b> <b>crane</b> suspended between the two long walls for moving heavy fuel caskets from the ground floor, and removing / replacing hardware from the reactor and reactor well. The reactor well can be flooded and is straddled by pools separated by gates on either side for storing reactor hardware normally placed above the fuel rods, and for fuel storage. A refueling platform has a specialized telescoping mast for lifting and lowering fuel rod assemblies with precision through the [...] "cattle chute" [...] to the reactor core area.|$|E

The river was very low, and on the dazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat cribs of railway-sleepers, filled within and daubed without with mud, to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up.
