5|$|In the evening, {{after the}} ceremony, {{the royal family}} decided to leave their palace in Athens for Tatoi, but city {{residents}} opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust <b>only.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{the last time that}} Alexander would be in direct contact with his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos and set off into exile.|$|E

It {{was the first}} television broadcast using Dolby Surround Sound and was promoted by Mitsubishi, as Madonna had previously starred in television commercials for their video recorders. On September 4, 1987, Madonna's concert special, Madonna in Concerto, filmed at the Comunale Stadium in Turin, Italy was broadcast live on TV in Italy (RAI), France (TF1), Germany (SAT1), Austria (ORF) and Spain (TVE). Other countries including Australia and The Netherlands broadcast this show in 1987.|$|E

25|$|The Red Arrow Award, {{is similar}} in nature to the Distinguished Service Award, but unlike the more renowned award, the Red Arrow Award is given to non-members <b>only.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> first awarded in 1970.

25|$|When {{the tribe}} reorganized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, some Seminole wanted {{to exclude the}} Freedmen and keep the tribe as Indian <b>only.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not until the 1950s that the Black Seminole were officially {{recognized}} in the constitution. Another was adopted in 1969, that restructured the government according to more traditional Seminole lines. It established 14 town bands, of which two represented Freedmen. The two Freedmen's bands were given two seats each, like other bands, on the Seminole General Council.|$|E

25|$|Two {{motorways}} were planned, the M52 from Liverpool to Salford and the M62 to link Pole Moor {{with the}} Stretford–Eccles Bypass. The {{first part of}} the M62 to be built was the Stretford–Eccles Bypass, which is now the section between Junctions7 to 13 of the M60. Construction started in 1957, and the motorway opened in 1960. It was originally built as a 2-lane motorway <b>only.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> later re-numbered M63. The section between the interchange with the Stretford-Eccles Bypass and Salford is now occupied by the M602 motorway.|$|E
25|$|Also operational, a {{few times}} a year, is an {{original}} steam-powered rotary snowplow, an essential device in the line's commercial service days. (The rotaries were retired in 1964, along with the remaining steam engines that pushed them, and snow clearing was done by caterpillar tractor.) While it is not needed as the tourist season is only in the summer months, it is a spectacle in operation, and the White Pass runs the steam plow for railfan groups once or twice a winter, pushed by two diesel locomotives (in 2000 <b>only,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> pushed by two steam locomotives, Nos.73 and 40).|$|E
25|$|The K class 2-8-0 {{built by}} VR in 1922-23 was a success, {{but with a}} firebox mounted between frames {{engineered}} for broad gauge operation <b>only,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not readily gauge-convertible. Thus when additional branch line locomotives were required, the VR produced a 2-8-2 'Mikado' variant of the K, the first 2-8-2 tender engine in Australia. It retained the same wheels, cylinders, motion, {{and much of the}} frame of the K, but featured a longer boiler with a wider, larger grate, mounted above the frames and supported by a trailing truck. This enabled possible gauge conversion without radical re-engineering of the frames and grate.|$|E

25|$|The {{committee}} {{recommended that}} all benzodiazepine treatment be withdrawn gradually and recommended that benzodiazepine treatment {{be used only}} in carefully selected patients and that therapy be limited to short-term use <b>only.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> noted in the review that alcohol can potentiate the central nervous system-depressant effects of benzodiazepines and should be avoided. The central nervous system-depressant effects of benzodiazepines may make driving or operating machinery dangerous, and the elderly {{are more prone to}} these adverse effects. High single doses or repeated low doses have been reported to produce hypotonia, poor sucking, and hypothermia in the neonate, and irregularities in the fetal heart. The committee recommended that benzodiazepines be avoided in lactation.|$|E
25|$|To {{judge from}} these {{fragments}} the small Ebel contained regulations concerning visitation of the sick, {{treatment of the}} dying, laying out of the corpse, mourning for the dead, arrangement of graves, and collection of the bones ("ossilegium"), which was customary among the Jews as well as among the Greeks. This treatise, which is the oldest collection of halakot on mourning customs, was compiled in Palestine; and, according to Brüll (l.c.), R. Eleazar b. Zadok, who lived in Lydda {{at the time of}} Gamaliel II, prepared the nucleus of it. It was then amplified, enriched, and revised by R. Ḥiyya, but as it was known to a small circle <b>only,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> replaced by the later treatise Ebel Rabbati, which borrowed much from it.|$|E

500|$|The question, [...] "What is Life?" [...] {{lay behind}} {{everything}} I learned....

[...] In a bid to increase sales, Jones wrote a letter to music magazine, Melody Maker, under an alternate name, writing how great the album was.|$|E

500|$|At {{about the}} age of 17 Josephine went through a {{religious}} crisis, which probably stemmed from an incident in which she discovered the body of a suicide while out riding. She became disenchanted with her weekly church attendance, describing the local vicar as [...] "an honest man in the pulpit... taught us loyally all that he probably himself knew about God, but whose words did not even touch the fringe of my soul's deep discontent". Following her crisis, Josephine did not identify with any single strand of Christianity, and remained critical of the Anglican church. She later wrote that she [...] "imbibed from childhood the widest ideas of vital Christianity, <b>only</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Christianity. I have not much sympathy with the Church".
