40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the problem of exploring an initially unknown region to find the minimum cost path from a fixed start position to a fixed goal position. We propose a sequential sampling algorithm to successively select <b>observation</b> <b>locations</b> that maximize the probability of improving the best path. We use Gaussian Process (GP) regression to generate a smooth estimate of the underlying cost field based on past observations. The best path based on the current estimate is then found using a Fast Marching (FM) approach. We evaluate a set of proposed <b>observation</b> <b>locations</b> using a novel FM update method and select the best location based on the likelihood of improving the current best path. Simulated results show that by sequentially selecting <b>observation</b> <b>locations</b> in this way, the resulting path estimate approaches the true optimal path. I...|$|R
40|$|When using optimal linear {{prediction}} {{to interpolate}} point observations of a mean square continuous stationary spatial process, one often {{finds that the}} interpolant mostly depends on those observations located nearest to the predictand. This phenomenon is called the screening effect. However, there are situations in which a screening effect does not hold in a reasonable asymptotic sense, and theoretical support for the screening effect is limited to some rather specialized settings for the <b>observation</b> <b>locations.</b> This paper explores conditions on the <b>observation</b> <b>locations</b> and the process model under which an asymptotic screening effect holds. A series of examples shows the difficulty in formulating a general result, especially for processes with different degrees of smoothness in different directions, which can naturally occur for spatial-temporal processes. These examples lead to a general conjecture and two special cases of this conjecture are proven. The key condition on the process is that its spectral density should change slowly at high frequencies. Models not satisfying this condition of slow high-frequency change should be used with caution.

Localized observations of sea surface temperature (SST), zonal wind speed and thermocline depth are assimilated in the ensemble using sequential importance sampling to adjust the weight of ensemble members.

Efficient <b>observation</b> <b>locations</b> for SST lie in the ENSO pattern, with the optimum located in the eastern and western Pacific for minimizing uncertainty in the NINO 3 and NINO 4 index, respectively. After the assimilation of the observations, we investigate how the weighted ensemble performs as a nine-month probabilistic forecast of the ENSO. Here, {{we focus on the}} spring predictability barrier with observation in the January– March (March–May) period and assess the remaining predictive power in June (August) for NINO 3 (NINO 4). For the ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM ensemble, this yields that SST observations around 110 W and 140 W provide the best predictive skill for the NINO 3 and NINO 4 index, respectively.

40|$|Joint {{inversion}} of surface and three-component borehole magnetic data Yaoguo Li ∗ and Douglas W. Oldenburg‡ The {{inversion of}} magnetic data is inherently non-unique {{with respect to}} the distance between the source and <b>observation</b> <b>locations.</b> This manifests itself as an am-biguity in the source depth when surface data are in-verted and as an ambiguity in the distance between the source and boreholes if borehole data are inverted. Joint inversion of surface and borehole data can help to re-duce this nonuniqueness. To achieve this, we develop an algorithm for inverting data sets that have arbitrary <b>observation</b> <b>locations</b> in boreholes and above the sur-face. The algorithm depends upon weighting functions that counteract the geometric decay of magnetic ker-nels with distance from the observer. We apply these weighting functions to the inversion of three-component magnetic data collected in boreholes and then to the joint inversion of surface and borehole data. Both syn-thetic and field data sets are used to illustrate the new inversion algorithm. When borehole data are inverted directly, three-component data are far more useful in constructing good susceptibility models than are single-component data. However, either can be used effectively in a joint inversion with surface data to produce models that are superior to those obtained by inversion of sur-face data alone...|$|R

The analysis system projects {{an array of}} observations onto the dominant empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) derived from an intermediateresolution (2 ° � 0. 5 °) ocean circulation model. This system produces maps of {{the depth of the}} 20 °C isotherm (D 20), representing interannual variability, and the high-pass-filtered mixed layer depth (MLD), representing intraseasonal variability. The OSSEs are designed to assess the suitability of the proposed Indian Ocean surface mooring array for resolving intraseasonal to interannual variability. While the proposed array does a reasonable job of resolving the interannual time scales, it may not adequately resolve the intraseasonal time scales. A procedure is developed to rank the importance of <b>observation</b> <b>locations</b> by determining the observation array that best projects onto the EOFs used in the analysis system. OSSEs using an optimal array clearly outperform the OSSEs using the proposed array. The configuration of the optimal array is sensitive to the number of EOFs considered.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} adaptive observation locations is demonstrated. This method {{is based on}} optimal estimation (Kalman filter) theory; it determines the <b>observation</b> <b>location</b> that will maximize the expected improvement, which {{can be measured in}} terms of the expected reduction in analysis or forecast variance. This technique requires an accurate model for background error statistics that vary both in space and in time. Here, these covariances are generated using an ensemble Kalman filter assimilation scheme. A variant is also developed that can estimate the analysis improvement in data assimilation schemes where background error statistics are less accurate. This approach is demonstrated using a quasigeostrophic channel model under perfect-model assumptions. The algorithm is applied here to find the supplemental rawinsonde location to add to a regular network of rawinsondes that will reduce analysis errors the most. The observation network is configured in this experiment so there is a data void in the western third of the domain. One-hundred-member ensembles from three data assimilation schemes are tested as input to the target selection procedure, two variants of the standard ensemble Kalman filter and a third perturbed observation (3 DVAR) ensemble.

Regression analysis is a statistical analysis for modeling the relationships between response variable and predictor variable.
