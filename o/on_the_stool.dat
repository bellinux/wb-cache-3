500|$|The {{acoustic}} {{version was}} performed by Gaga at BBC Live & In-Session on April 19, 2009. In the same day, she had her first appearance on Italian TV, on the TV program Quelli che... il Calcio. She also performed [...] "Poker Face" [...] in the United Kingdom on The Paul O'Grady Show. First she played an acoustic version first before going on to the normal version, and a rock version on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. On May 12, 2009, Gaga performed [...] "Poker Face" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show while wearing a gyroscope on her head, designed by theatrical hat designer Nasir Mazhar and playing the piano while standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stool.</b> Gaga referred to the gyroscope as her [...] "Gaga barrier". It prevented Ellen DeGeneres from greeting her {{because of the size}} of the gear. A remixed version of [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "LoveGame" [...] was performed at the 2009 MuchMusic Video Awards, during the indoor-outdoor streetside show. This performance, which included Gaga being trapped in a fake subway car surrounded by fake police officers, was billed as a tribute to New York City. Snippet of the song {{was performed by}} Gaga at the thirty-fifth season of American comedy show Saturday Night Live, while wearing a giant contraption ("The Orbit") of several metallic concentric rings that rotated around her.|$|E

60|$|Carley {{noted that}} her picture and the suit case were {{absolutely}} the only physical evidences of Glenn's connection with his Eastern life. That had an unaccountable effect upon Carley. What had she expected? Then, after another {{survey of the}} room, she began to pester Glenn with questions. He had to show her the spring outside and the little bench with basin and soap. Sight of his soiled towel made her throw up her hands. She sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stools.</b> She lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch. She rummaged into {{the contents of the}} cupboard. She threw wood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fire. Then, finally, having exhausted her search and inquiry, she flopped down <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>stools</b> to gaze at Glenn in awe and admiration and incredulity.|$|R

40|$|Viral {{metagenomics}} {{focused on}} particle-protected nucleic acids was used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stools</b> of South Asian children with nonpolio {{acute flaccid paralysis}} (AFP). We identified sequences distantly related to Seneca Valley virus and cardioviruses that were then used as genetic footholds to characterize multiple viral species within a previously unreported genus of the Picornaviridae family. The picornaviruses were detected in <b>the</b> <b>stools</b> of > 40 % of AFP and healthy Pakistani children. A genetically diverse and highly prevalent enteric viral infection, characteristics similar to the Enterovirus genus, was therefore identified substantially expanding the genetic diversity of the RNA viral flora commonly found in children...|$|R
