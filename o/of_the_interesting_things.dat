500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> for the concept for this video is that {{we knew we had}} to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E

60|$|The {{simple truth}} is that these {{observations}} of mine, though they are all true, do not tell more than a small fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> that wild animals do continually in their native state, {{when they are not}} frightened by dogs and hunters, or when we are not blinded by our preconceived notions in watching them. I have no doubt that romancing is rife just now on the part of men who study animals in a library; but personally, with my note-books full of incidents which I have never yet recorded, I find the truth more interesting, and I cannot understand why a man should deliberately choose romance when he can have the greater joy of going into the wilderness to see with his own eyes and to understand with his own heart just how the animals live. One thing {{seems to me to be}} more and more certain: that we are only just beginning to understand wild animals, and it is chiefly our own barbarism, our lust of killing, our stupid stuffed specimens, and especially our prejudices which stand in the way of greater knowledge. Meanwhile the critic who asserts dogmatically what a wild animal will or will not do under certain conditions only proves how carelessly he has watched them and how little he has learned of Nature's infinite variety.|$|E

The expedition, shepherded by large numbers of Indians, continued their march, now moving eastward toward the Concho River and sending out patrols to look for Apaches. It appears that they saw no Apaches in the flesh, but several horses were stolen during an Apache raid. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> in the narrative is that the Jumano owned horses at this time—one of the earlier mentions in the Spanish records of mounted Indians in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Thankamany(തങ്കമണി [...] ) is {{a village}} at Idukki district, in Kerala state, India. There {{is a small}} town {{associated}} with this village. In regional language thankamany is a name of a lady. It is a belief that an older jungle king gave dowry as land for his three daughters Thankamany, Kamashi, and Neeli. The place got for Thankamany is now known as Thankamany (place name), other nearby places are also known as Kamashi and Neelivayal (means land of Neeli). Thankamany town is located in a valley of three small hills Thamprankunnu, Kattadikavala and Kurishupara respectively. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> is that, even though Kamashi is a different place, <b>the</b> panchayath <b>of</b> thankamany is called Kamashy panchayath and the office is situated in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> thankamany town.Sometimes in official documents thankamany is also written as thankamani.|$|R

5000|$|SKiPPER is {{a domain}} {{specific}} skeleton library for vision applications [...] which provides skeletons in CAML, and thus relies on CAML for type safety. Skeletons {{are presented in}} two ways: declarative and operational. Declarative skeletons are directly used by programmers, while their operational versions provide an architecture specific target implementation. From the runtime environment, CAML skeleton specifications, and application specific functions (provided in C by the programmer), new C code is generated and compiled to run the application on the target architecture. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about SKiPPER is that the skeleton program can be executed sequentially for debugging.|$|E
50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> {{about the}} setting is that a {{different}} flavor of fantasy campaign can be had depending on which region of Yrth one uses. Araterre, for instance, is a seafaring nation inhabited by the descendants of those brought to Yrth from France in the 16th century. Light or no armor, swashbuckling, and courtly intrigue are {{the rule of the}} day. Sahud is the Asian mish-mash country, and would be suitable for a wuxia style game, or even something akin to Legend of the Five Rings. Some countries are almost entirely human-dominated, and others are mixed, while there are still some area completely under the control of Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, or Reptile Men.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardian newspaper's {{television}} reviewer Sam Wollaston {{also gave}} the episode a guarded welcome, although {{he felt that}} the attempts to make Cardiff appear glamorous were a failure. [...] "They've done their best to sex the place up—lots of helicopter shots of that posh bit where Charlotte Church lives, but it still looks like Cardiff, to be honest. No matter—most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> are going on below the ground... It's not yet clear whether Eve Myles as new Torchwood recruit PC Gwen Cooper can fill Billie Piper's boots. Surely not—those boots are two gaping weekend voids that no one can fill. But this looks promising: it's slick, quick and a tiny bit scary. Not much humour yet, which was the lovely thing about Doctor Who. But it's early days; don't jump quite yet." ...|$|E
50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about <b>the</b> Historical Hutchinson {{house is}} the {{architecture}} style. It is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Second Empire” style, which {{is reflected in the}} third Floor exterior walls. The third floor is contained inside the mansard roof. The mansard roof is made of slate. Each slate shingle was cut by hand, and has lasted over a century. The Hutchinson house has been through 100 years of hurricanes, heat and cold, and still remains in excellent condition.|$|R

And {{it is one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> {{connected}} with <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> his art, to watch {{the way in which}} his own strength of English instinct breaks gradually through fetter and formalism; how from Egerian wells he steals away to Yorkshire streamlets; how from Homeric rocks, with laurels at the top and caves in the bottom, he climbs, at last, to Alpine precipices fringed with pine, and fortified with <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> their own ruins; and how from Temples of Jupiter and Gardens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hesperides, a spirit in his feet guides him, at last, to <b>the</b> lonely arches <b>of</b> Whitby, and bleak sands of Holy Isle.|$|R

5000|$|... “I {{could have}} written on reports on crime or {{whatever}} because the substance was not important. The really important issue is the production of democracy textually in government reports because government reports, in whatever field, urban planning or deviance or policing, must {{not be seen as}} biased in any particular way. It was the processes, procedures and practices - how to manage information that was coming into the report - that was important to me. Specifically, I was not interested in anything substantive. I was only interested in the practices of how one actually uses the structure of the text so that it would appear to be unquestionably democratic.” Commenting on his dissertation: “One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> I think most people don’t realize is that those kinds of ethnomethodological work can actually be used for social change.

5000|$|Sir Richard {{has worked}} closely {{with a large number}} of Ministers and took the {{impartiality}} and professionalism of the civil service very seriously. His efforts to communicate the nature of this relationship were not, however, always successful. In his oral evidence to the House of Commons Public Administration Committee on 7 March 2002 (Q346), he said [...] "... one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> about the Civil Service, which I do not think Ministers understand sufficiently clearly, despite our efforts constantly to tell them, {{is that it is a}} fantastically loyal institution to Ministers. What the Civil Service wants, and I always compare it to a rather stupid dog, it wants to do what its master wants and it wants to be loyal to its master and above all it wants to be loved for doing that and I am not sure Ministers understand that. When I said [...] "stupid dog", of course I meant a superbly well-educated dog, particularly those brought up in Nissen huts." [...] He later said that he realised that this analogy was a [...] "tremendous mistake" [...] (Note by Witness, same report).|$|E
50|$|I wish we hadn't {{used all}} the keys on the keyboard. I think one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> is that vi {{is really a}} mode-based editor. I think as mode-based editors go, it's pretty good. One {{of the good things}} about EMACS, though, is its {{programmability}} and the modelessness. Those are two ideas which never occurred to me. I also wasn't very good at optimizing code when I wrote vi. I think the redisplay module of the editor is almost intractable. It does a really good job for what it does, but when you're writing programs as you're learning... That's why I stopped working on it.What actually happened was that I {{was in the process of}} adding multiwindows to vi when we installed our VAX, which would have been in December of '78. We didn't have any backups and the tape drive broke. I continued to work even without being able to do backups. And then the source code got scrunched and I didn't have a complete listing. I had almost rewritten all of the display code for windows, and that was when I gave up. After that, I went back to the previous version and just documented the code, finished the manual and closed it off. If that scrunch had not happened, vi would have multiple windows, and I might have put in some programmability—but I don't know.The fundamental problem with vi is that it doesn't have a mouse and therefore you've got all these commands. In some sense, its backwards from the kind of thing you'd get from a mouse-oriented thing. I think multiple levels of undo would be wonderful, too. But fundamentally, vi is still ed inside. You can't really fool it.It's like one of those pinatas—things that have candy inside but has layer after layer of paper mache on top. It doesn't really have a unified concept. I think if I were going to go back—I wouldn't go back, but start over again.|$|E

5000|$|According to Hugh Nibley, <b>the</b> proverbial {{ancestor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabs is Ishmael. His name is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few Old Testament names {{which is}} also at home in ancient Arabia: [...] "Thus in Lehi's friend [...] "Ishmael" [...] (1 Nephi 7:2) we surely have a man <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desert. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> is that Nephi takes Ishmael (unlike Zoram) completely for granted, never explaining who he is or how he fits into <b>the</b> picture--the act <b>of</b> sending for him {{seems to be the}} most natural thing in the world, as does <b>the</b> marriage <b>of</b> his daughters with Lehi's sons. Since it has ever been the custom among the desert people for a man to marry <b>the</b> daughter <b>of</b> his paternal uncle (bint 'ammi), it is hard to avoid the impression that Lehi and Ishmael were related. There is a remarkable association between <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> Lehi and Ishmael which ties them both to the southern desert, where the legendary birthplace and central shrine of Ishmael was at a place called Be'er Lehai-ro'i." ...|$|R
