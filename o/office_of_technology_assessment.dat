In 1986, the U.S. Congress <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} number of individuals and citizen-based groups in the United States have undertaken activities that contribute to the maintenance of biological diversity, While many do not define their activities in these terms, their contributions—through activities devoted to conservation of ecosystems, wild species, and agricultural crops and livestock—have had significant beneficial impact. Although grassroots efforts are not likely to replace public or national efforts, they form an integral part in the Nation’s efforts to maintain biological diversity, They, however, can accomplish some activities unlikely to be undertaken by government agencies and large national conservation organizations. These individuals and groups commonly have a number of constraints that can limit their effectiveness. This background paper examines the contributions of grassroots organizations and individuals by illustrating the diversity and range of efforts and indicating, where possible, the present and potential impacts of these activities on the overall effort to maintain biological diversity.

40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{assess the}} impact of the 1997 Canadian {{guidelines}} on the methods and presentation of economic evaluations conducted from a Canadian perspective in the published literature. MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted to identify health technology economic evaluations conducted from a Canadian perspective published in peer-reviewed journals between 2001 and 2006. To investigate the impact of the 1997 Canadian Coordinating <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Health <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> guidelines, each included study was assessed against 17 of the 25 recommendations. ResultsOf the 153 included studies, a base set of 9 methodological standards, as outlined by the 1997 guidelines, were followed by over 50 % of the studies including: indications, outcomes for cost utility analysis, outcomes for cost benefit analysis, discounting future cost and outcomes, cost identification and valuation, evaluating uncertainty and disclosing funding relationships. Main divergences from the guidelines were found for analytic technique (38 %), study perspective (23 %), source of preferences (8 %), equity (7 %), and cost measurement (24 %). ConclusionThe current assessment has shown that the 1997 Canadian guidelines have set a minimum methodological standard within the community of “doers” conducting economic analyses from a Canadian perspective. Although there was divergence from some of the recommendations, the majority were reflected as changes in the 2006 Canadian guidelines...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesMiddle-income {{countries}} {{often have}} no clear roadmap for implementation <b>of</b> health <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> (HTA) in policy decisions. Examples from high-income countries {{may not be}} relevant, as lower income countries cannot allocate so much financial and human resources for substantiating policy decisions with evidence. Therefore, HTA implementation roadmaps from other smaller-size, lower-income countries can be more relevant examples for countries with similar cultural environment and economic status. MethodsWe reviewed the capacity building process for HTA implementation in Hungary with special focus {{on the role of}} ISPOR Hungary Chapter. ResultsHTA implementation in Hungary started with capacity building at universities {{with the support of the}} World Bank in the mid 90 's, followed by the publication of methodological guidelines for conducting health economic evaluations in 2002. The Hungarian Health Economics Association (META) - established in 2003 - has been recognized as a driving force of HTA implementation. META became the official regional ISPOR Chapter of Hungary in 2007. In 2004 the National Health Insurance Fund Administration made the cost-effectiveness and budget impact criteria compulsory prior to granting reimbursement to new pharmaceuticals. An <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Health <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> was established for the critical appraisal of economic evaluations submitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers. In 2010 multicriteria decision analysis was introduced for new hospital technologies. ConclusionThe economic crisis may create an opportunity to further strengthen the evidence base of health care decision-making in Hungary. In the forthcoming period ISPOR Hungary Chapter may play an even more crucial role in improving the standards of HTA implementation and facilitating international collaboration with other CEE countries...|$|R

2500|$|In 1986, the U.S. Defense Department funded {{a two-year}} {{study by the}} RAND Corporation, a private {{organization}} with a long and {{close relationship with the}} U.S. government. This study found that the use of the armed forces to interdict drugs coming into the United States would have little or no effect on cocaine trafficking and might in fact raise the profits of cocaine cartels and manufacturers. The 175-page study, [...] "Sealing the Borders: The Effects of Increased Military Participation in Drug Interdiction," [...] was prepared by seven researchers, mathematicians and economists at the National Defense Research Institute. The study noted that seven prior studies in the past nine years, including one by the Center for Naval Research and the <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment,</b> had come to similar conclusions. Interdiction efforts using current armed forces resources would have almost no effect on cocaine importation into the United States, the report concluded.|$|E

The multispectral IR radiometer permitted the acquisistion of 400, 000 ten-channel spectral over the wavelength interval 0. 5 - 2. 35 microns, including rock and soil identifications which are correlated with economically significant geologic materials. The ocean color experiment involved an eight channel optical mechanical scanner to detect ocean water color changes due {{to the presence of}} phytoplankton. Air pollution was measured by radiometer in the 4. 50 - 4. 83 micron regions, and an asymmetry in CO concentration was found between the northern and sourthern hemispheres. Only five seconds of surface and meteorological data were collected by the FILE package, while the one successfully used film cassette on a lightning recording experiment revealed discharges among convective storm systems.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to institute a cost-effectiveness-based reimbursement eligibility and coverage scheme for drugs in the Canadian province of British Columbia. All applications from drug manufacturers requesting Pharmacare (British Columbia government-funded drug insurance plan) coverage were evaluated by the Pharmacoeconomic Initiative (PI) of British Columbia. PI recommendations are according to a majority decision reached by a multidisciplinary volunteer expert committee and {{are based on a}} critical evaluation of pharmacoeconomic studies submitted by manufacturers seeking reimbursement eligibility. Coverage for drugs is universal and completely free for the financially indigent. Others are charged a small copayment and/or a deductible. PI assessments are evidence-based. Published guidelines from the Canadian Coordinating <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Health <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> (CCOHTA) and/or Ontario Ministry of Health guidelines for the economic evaluation of pharmaceuticals are recommended for preparing submissions to the PI. Between January 1996 and December 1996, the PI made recommendations on 21 submissions; 4 of these were cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses; 3 were cost-minimisation analyses; 6 were cost comparisons or cost-consequence analyses; and 8 were provincial formulary budget impact studies. Of the 21 PI recommendations, 18 were accepted by Pharmacare and decisions are pending for 2 others, thus providing a concordance rate of 95 % (18 / 19; kappa = 0. 89). A total of 7 of the 21 products were recommended for formulary inclusion by the PI; 4 were as per drug company requests (i. e. full-benefit status) and 3 were recommended under restricted use. Only 5 of 21 submissions, of which 4 had favourable reviews, complied with either the CCOHTA or the Ontario Ministry of Health guidelines. Most studies were conducted, not from a societal perspective, but {{from the perspective of the}} provincial healthcare system. Most of the analyses were short term and therefore discounting was not applied. Sensitivity analysis was not performed in more than half (52 %) of the submissions, and 48 % of applications used inappropriate comparators. Ontario is the only other Canadian province with a similar process, with cost-effectiveness criteria for reimbursement eligibility. However, analysis in that province during the same approximate time period demonstrated a low concordance between Ontario Drug Benefit and PI decisions (kappa = 0. 07). Currently, the mandated or suggested use <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceuticals with cost effectiveness as the primary end-point is a reality in several countries worldwide. Our results, based on actual experience from implementing such a programme, suggest that while industry is slow to adapt to the new reporting requirements it may also be sceptical about the importance of cost effectiveness and guideline compliance in decision-making.

40|$|The goal <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> is {{to provide}} a larger view of the utility and {{potential}} impact of a class <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> for a set of potential uses. In this paper, the concentration is on technology for training. Some examples are given <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>assessments</b> conducted on behalf of the public by national agencies. This view <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> and its methodology is more global than that <b>of</b> product evaluation. <b>Technology</b> <b>assessment</b> attempts to determine the full range of use, and consequently must address estimates of input, context, and conditions of implementation as well as the outcomes, and multiple measures of major dimensions must be used. An approach of this sort can be called a training technology indicator system. In the operational conduct <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> <b>assessment,</b> both empirical analysis through studies and expert analysis by panels of knowledgeable individuals have a place.
