40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} heat transfer augmentation and friction characteristics of fully developed turbulent flow in a rectangular duct of solar air heater with absorber plate having V-shaped <b>wire</b> <b>ribs</b> as artificial roughness on its underside is carried out.

Duct aspect ratio (W/B) is kept 5 and Reynolds number (Re) is varied from 2, 500 to 8, 500. The heat transfer and friction factor values obtained are {{compared with those of}} smooth duct under similar flow conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Nine beams {{strengthened}} with helical <b>rib</b> steel <b>wire</b> near-surface mounted(NSM) in {{the concrete}} cover under monotonous loads are tested, and cyclic loading, security, delay and bending deformation of reinforced concrete beams are systematically studied. Test results indicate that NSM helical <b>rib</b> steel <b>wire</b> can overcome the peeling of the strengthening material from externally bonded FRP laminates. Compared with non-strengthened beam. The strengthened beams can significantly improve its ultimate capacity, and the increase could {{be as much as}} 130. 92 %.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> and diaphragm is the change in volume of thorax that helps inspiration and expiration. In general, the ribs move around two axes. As the anterior end <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> is about 4 cm lower than the posterior end, the middle part <b>of</b> <b>rib</b> is lower than anterior and posterior ends. Movement at costovertebral joints 7 to 10 about an anteroposterior axis results in raising and lowering the middle <b>of</b> the <b>rib,</b> the Bucket-handle movement.

2500|$|Around this time, various French {{manufacturers}} like Voisin and Farman {{were hoping}} to improve the stability of aircraft against gusts by using wings that were partly flexible like those of birds and the Caudron Types M and N also included this feature. Each wing had two steel tube, wood filled spars, one {{at the leading edge}} and the other [...] aft, a little behind one third chord, with ash <b>ribs</b> and <b>wire</b> bracing. The number <b>of</b> <b>ribs</b> varied between 10, 11 and 12 and they were conventionally rigid between the spars. Behind the rear spar the upper part <b>of</b> each <b>rib</b> was also rigid, ending at about 70% chord; the lower part was completed by a thin, flexible extension strip for about 60% of the chord. The wing was then fabric covered, though the flexible portion was only covered on the upper side. The wings were supported from above by landing wires from a four-legged pylon above the fuselage and by lifting wires from another below, shorter on the Type N than on the Type M. On the latter the tip of the lower pylon was braced by a horizontal, longitudinal strut to the centre of the undercarriage frame. Lateral control was by wing warping.|$|R
