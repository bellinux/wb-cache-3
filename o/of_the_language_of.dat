5|$|Teleology {{in biology}} {{is the use}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> goal-directedness in {{accounts}} of evolutionary adaptation, which some biologists and philosophers of science find problematic. The term teleonomy has also been proposed. Teleology is the principle that some phenomena exist because they result in a goal being fulfilled. Before Darwin, organisms were seen as existing because God had designed and created them; their features such as eyes were taken by natural theology {{to have been made}} to enable them to carry out their functions, such as seeing. Evolutionary biologists often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply natural selection rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed (orthogenesis), and in vitalist versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by natural selection acting on inherited variation, the use of teleology in biology has attracted criticism, and {{attempts have been made to}} teach students to avoid teleological language.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text {{called the}} Changes of Zhou (周易 Zhōu yì). Various modern {{scholars}} suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Based on a comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> the Zhou yi with dated bronze inscriptions, the American sinologist Edward Shaughnessy dated its compilation {{in its current form}} to {{the early decades of the}} reign of King Xuan of Zhou, in the last quarter of the 9th century BC. A copy of the text in the Shanghai Museum corpus of bamboo and wooden slips (recovered in 1994) shows that the Zhou yi was used throughout all levels of Chinese society in its current form by 300 BC, but still contained small variations as late as the Warring States period. It is possible that other divination systems existed at this time; the Rites of Zhou name two other such systems, the Lianshan and the Guizang.|$|E

25|$|Spielrein {{completed}} her medical school dissertation, supervised first by Bleuler then by Jung, on a close study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> {{a patient with}} schizophrenia. It {{was published in the}} Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen, which Jung edited. Freud referenced it in the same volume in his postscript to the Schreber Case; It was the first doctorate ever to appear in a psychoanalytic journal, {{and one of the first}} psychoanalytic case studies of schizophrenia. Her dissertation contributed greatly to the understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> people with schizophrenia. Because her study was one of the first to focus on schizophrenia, the need for more research began and led to more people focusing on the mental illness. It was also the first dissertation written by a woman that was psychoanalytically oriented. She left Zurich the day after her graduation, having resolved to establish an independent career as a psychoanalyst elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} {{unification of}} the region into the state called Kievan Rus', from which modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine trace their origins, occurred approximately a century before the adoption of Christianity in 988 {{and the establishment of}} the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic as the liturgical and literary language. The Old Church Slavonic language was introduced. Documentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> this period is scanty, making it difficult at best fully to determine the relationship between the literary language and its spoken dialects.|$|E
25|$|In his Divina Commedia, however, Dante {{changes his}} view to another that treats the Adamic {{language}} {{as the product}} of Adam. This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (Paradiso XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, El, must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as I.|$|E
