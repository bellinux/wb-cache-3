The measure was opposed by most Democrats, who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations. The income from the lease was used to finance a backlog <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> projects and create a $500 million trust fund to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system.|$|E

5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E

In advance of this, Ashfield resigned from the LPTB at the end of October 1947 and joined the board of the new British Transport Commission which was to operate all of the nationalised public transport systems. At nationalisation, the LPTB was to be abolished and replaced by the London Transport Executive. Lord Latham, a member of the LPTB and the incoming chairman of the new organisation, acted as temporary chairman for the last two months of the LPTB's existence.|$|E

Being a political capital increases {{supply and demand}} <b>of</b> local <b>public</b> <b>transportation,</b> inequality is associated with higher supply, and contracting out reduces supply. Furthermore, our regional analysis allows us capturing the effect of geographical characteristics and different traditions of government intervention.

5|$|In some instances, the {{automotive}} industry and others were directly responsible for the decline <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation.</b> The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued {{that this was a}} deliberate destruction of streetcars {{as part of a larger}} strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia.|$|E
5|$|Minibuses are {{the most}} common type <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> in Mogadishu. The next most {{frequently}} used public vehicles in the city are auto rickshaws (bajaj). They number around 3,000 units and come in various designs. The auto rickshaws represent a lower cost alternative to taxis and minibuses, typically charging half the price for the same distance, with flexible rates. Due to their affordability, capacity to negotiate narrow lanes and low fuel consumption, the three-wheeled vehicles are often appealing investment opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs. They are generally preferred for shorter commutes. In June 2013, two new taxi companies also started offering road transportation to residents. Part of a fleet of over 100 vehicles, Mogadishu Taxi's trademark yellow cabs offer rides throughout the city at flat rates of $5. City Taxi, the firm's nearest competitor, charges the same flat rate, with plans to add new cabs to its fleet.|$|E

The proposed approach executes grey statistics and formulates decisive scenario using key factors of technology selection based on the data collected from the survey respondents. In the process of scenario formulation, the identification <b>of</b> specific advanced <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> systems technology is made when the decision-making group reaches the consensus. In addition to methodology exploration, a comprehensive questionnaire investigation to obtain the estimation of grey statistics samples used for scenario formulation is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of scenario approach. Using the proposed approach, the authors indicate appropriate technology <b>of</b> advanced <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> systems for Taiwan to develop. The significance of the results implies the scenario approach is an effective alternative for planning developmental strategies <b>of</b> advanced <b>public</b> <b>transportation</b> systems {{as well as other}} subsystems...|$|R
