Jointly estimating Stokes images and <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> aberrations involves a large parameter space. A closed-form expression for the estimate of the Stokes images in terms of the aberration parameters is derived and used in a formulation that reduces the dimensionality of the search space to the number of aberration parameters only. We compare the performance of the joint estimator under both quadratic and edge-preserving regularization; we also compare the performance of the reduced parameter search strategy to the full parameter search strategy under quadratic regularization. The joint estimator with edge-preserving regularization yields higher fidelity polarization estimates than with quadratic regularization. With the reduced parameter search strategy, accurate aberration estimates can be obtained without recourse to regularization “tuning. ...|$|R

40|$|Volume {{holographic}} {{data storage}} uses the superposition of image holograms in a suitable medium to pursue large storage capacity and high readout rates. The holographic method of structuring the medium with data, and subsequent readout of those data structures, relies on an <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> with two distinct paths. The object path is typically a 4 F system relaying a high space-bandwidth-product object to an image plane with the storage medium placed near the Fourier plane. <b>Optical</b> <b>system</b> parallelism, measured by space-bandwidth-produce, promotes both storage capacity and readout rate. The reference path is typically a relay with the field stop placed {{near the center of}} the storage material. We will consider how the properties of the <b>object</b> path <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> affect the storage capacity and readout rate. We will demonstrate that the object beam 4 F system can be optimized for the particular requirements of volume holographic storage, and that relatively simple <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> can provide high parallelism.

40|$|In {{the field}} of imaging {{polarimetry}} Stokes parameters are sought and must be inferred from noisy and blurred intensity measurements. Using a penalized-likelihood estimation framework we investigate reconstruction quality when estimating intensity images and then transforming to Stokes parameters (traditional estimator), and when estimating Stokes parameters directly (Stokes estimator). We define our cost function for reconstruction by a weighted least squares data fit term and a regularization penalty. It is shown that under quadratic regularization, the traditional and Stokes estimators can be made equal by appropriate choice of regularization parameters. It is empirically shown that, when using edge preserving regularization, estimating the Stokes parameters directly leads to lower textsc{RMS} error in reconstruction. Also, {{the addition of a}} cross channel regularization term further lowers the textsc{RMS} error for both methods {{especially in the case of}} low textsc{SNR}.

40|$|Non-{{rational}} {{and rational}} parametric interpolators are investigated and developed as mathematical entities for describing the geometric propagation {{of light in}} <b>optical</b> <b>systems.</b> The Bezier interpolator was chosen over other interpolators to describe extended and point objects and their subsequent mathematical propagation through an <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> primarily because of their superior mathematical stability, convex hull property, and endpoint interpolation, which {{is especially important for}} describing wavefront behavior. The limitations of the affine transformation first are exposed for transforming generalized three-dimensional extended Bezier objects ideally or collinearly through an <b>optical</b> <b>system.</b> This limitation necessitated the development of a projective transformation. The perspective projection next was used in a vector derivation of the collinear mapping equations thereby demonstrating that an optical collinear mapping is a special projective transformation. Furthermore, the perspective projection was found to correctly map non-rational and rational Bezier <b>objects</b> through an <b>optical</b> <b>system.</b> Rational Bezier interpolators, because they are inherently projections of n-dimensional functions onto hyperplanes, exist or live in a collinear space and therefore are ideally suited for describing the conjugate relationships found in <b>optical</b> <b>systems.</b> Bezier curves also are shown to describe the behavior of the meridional wavefront as it was refracted and reflected at optical surfaces. Affine maps again proved inadequate for general wavefront propagation necessitating the development of the Bezier ray trace. The Bezier ray trace was developed for both non-rational, rational quadratic, cubic, and piecewise continuous cubic orders by utilizing end control point interpolation and control polygon tangency conditions. In general non-rational quadratic and cubic Bezier curves inaccurately describe wavefront behavior in an <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> whereas their rational counterparts do so accurately. The ability of a rational Bezier curve to accurately describe a meridional wavefront leads to the interpretation that wavefronts and wave aberrations may be considered as projections of n-dimensional functions onto hyperplanes. Finally, the fourth order scalar wave aberration functions were converted into equivalent Bezier representations. This representation leads to a graphical interpretation of individual aberrations in terms of control points, which when uniformly parameterized and degree elevated to the same order, may be added by together to form composite aberrations...|$|R
