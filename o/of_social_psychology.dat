5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause in terms <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>psychology,</b> specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group {{states that the}} name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters {{in his or her}} name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E

25|$|The fields <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>psychology</b> and {{personality}} have merged over the years, and social psychologists {{have developed an}} interest in self-related phenomena. In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place {{a greater emphasis on}} cognitions than on traits. Much research focuses on the self-concept, which is a person's understanding of his or her self. The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component, known as the self-schema, and an evaluative component, the self-esteem. The need to maintain a healthy self-esteem is recognized as a central human motivation in the field <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>psychology.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although {{there were}} some older treatises about social psychology, such as those by Islamic philosopher Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), the {{discipline}} <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>psychology,</b> as its modern-day definition, began in the United States {{at the dawn of}} the 20th century. However, the discipline had already developed a significant foundation. Following the 18th century, those in the emerging field <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>psychology</b> were concerned with developing concrete explanations for different aspects of human nature. They desired to discover concrete cause and effect relationships that explained the social interactions in the world around them. In order to do so, they believed that the scientific method, an empirically based scientific measure, could be applied to human behavior.|$|E

25|$|The goal <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>psychology</b> is to {{understand}} cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but {{the very act of}} observing people can influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize deception to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on.|$|E

25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of reaction}} by numerous neighbors purported to have watched the scene or to have heard Genovese's cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood that someone will step forward and help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others are watching. The Genovese case thus became a classic feature <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>psychology</b> textbooks.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 a study {{conducted}} by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi was published in the Journal <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Psychology,</b> in which they intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.|$|E
