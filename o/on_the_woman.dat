5|$|However, {{during the}} Song period, {{there were many}} {{acclaimed}} court painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the royal family. One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by the Song court was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145), who painted the original Along the River During Qingming Festival scroll, {{one of the most}} well-known masterpieces of Chinese visual art. Emperor Gaozong of Song (1127–1162) once commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> poet Cai Wenji (177–250 AD) of the earlier Han dynasty. The Southern Song dynasty court painters included Zhao Mengjian (趙孟堅, c.1199–1264), a member of the Imperial family, known for popularising the Three Friends of Winter.|$|E

Later, they find another campsite and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a decrepit boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman.</b> Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to observe a bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that they are on the cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E

25|$|Professor Yusuf Al-Qaradawi {{observes that}} he does not promote this type of marriage, {{although}} he has to recognise that it is legal, since it fulfils all the requirements of the usual marriage contract. He states his preference that the clause of renunciation be not included within the marriage contract, but be the subject of a simple verbal agreement between the parties. Islamic scholars like Ibn Uthaimeen or Al-Albani claim, for their part, that misyar marriage may be legal, but not moral. They agree that the wife can at any time, reclaim the rights which she gave up at the time of contract. But, they are opposed to this type of marriage {{on the grounds that it}} contradicts the spirit of the Islamic law of marriage and that it has perverse effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> the family and the community in general.|$|E
25|$|The women deacons {{are also}} {{mentioned}} in a {{passage of the}} Council of Nicea in 325 which implies their hierarchal, consecrated or ordained status; then more clearly at the Council of Chalcedon of 451 which decreed that women should not be ordained deacons until they were 40 years old. The oldest ordination rite for deaconesses {{is found in the}} 5th-century Apostolic Constitutions. It describes the laying on of hands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> by the bishop with the calling down of the Holy Spirit for the ministry of the diaconate. A full version of the rite, with rubrics and prayers, has been found in the Barberini Codex of 780 AD. This liturgical manual provides an ordination rite for women as deacons which is virtually identical to the ordination rite for men as deacons. Other ancient manuscripts confirm the same rite. A careful study of the rite has persuaded most modern scholars that the rite was fully a sacrament in present-day terms.|$|E

25|$|Courtship and {{relationships}} in the Philippines are conservative in nature. The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years; this however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in theirhome, so {{they can have a}} chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best foot forward to create a good impression <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors. Courtship {{and relationships}} remain the same for rural and urban areas despite the modern western influence.|$|E

Mildred McAfee was an experienced and respected academician, whose background would provide a measure of creditability to the idea of women serving in the Navy.|$|E

Called [...] "the orator", the [...] "morning star" [...] and the [...] "heart and soul" [...] of the women's rights movement, Stone influenced Susan B.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote that [...] "Lucy Stone was the first person by whom the heart of the American public was deeply stirred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> question."

500|$|To try {{to change}} the public {{backlash}} related to the alleged 1999 rape, The Birth of a Nations studio hired The Glover Park Group and Don McPherson to give Parker media training and public relations advice.

[...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> {{at the center of the}} charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel guilty about it, but conceded that, from the perspective of a 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E
500|$|Women usually need direct {{clitoral}} stimulation {{in order}} to orgasm, and G-spot stimulation may be best achieved by using both manual stimulation and vaginal penetration. Sex toys are available for G-spot stimulation. One common sex toy is the specially-designed G-spot vibrator, which is a phallus-like vibrator that has a curved tip and attempts to make G-spot stimulation easy. [...] G-spot vibrators are made from the same materials as regular vibrators, ranging from hard plastic, rubber, silicone, jelly, or any combination of them. The level of vaginal penetration when using a G-spot vibrator depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> because women's physiology {{is not always the}} same. The effects of G-spot stimulation when using the penis or a G-spot vibrator may be enhanced by additionally stimulating other erogenous zones on a woman's body, such as the clitoris or vulva as a whole. When using a G-spot vibrator, this may be done by manually stimulating the clitoris, including by using the vibrator as a clitoral vibrator, or, if the vibrator is designed for it, by applying it so that it stimulates the head of the clitoris, the rest of the vulva and the vagina simultaneously.|$|E

500|$|An {{example of}} the {{historical}} novel is La Française du siècle (1886, published in English as The Frenchwoman of the Century in 1887), where Uzanne suggests {{that the effect of}} the Revolution <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> of the period was [...] "lamentable and disastrous": [...] "All French spirit, grace, and finesse seemed to have been submerged in the bloody, deliriums of the crowd." [...] In a couple of chapters of the book he described the France of the late Eighteenth Century, during the French Revolution; some of its pages exhibited the [...] "frivolity of women" [...] during those years. For example, in a chapter on one of the stages of the French Revolution—known as the Directory— he included descriptions of customs such as the bals des victimes: to these dancing assemblies, held at the Hôtel Richelieu, only admitted [...] "aristocrats who could boast a relative guillotined during the Terror"; he wrote that women cut their hair, as if they would be guillotined—some even carried a red ribbon around their neck. Uzanne disclosed that the five Directors who had established themselves at the Luxembourg formed a kind of Court-society, and gave frequent entertainments: the queens of this society were de Staël, Hamelin, Bonaparte and Tallien.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} women and death is evident in stories as early as [...] "Indian Camp". The theme of death {{permeates}} Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] {{was not so much}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a [...] "badly scarred and nervous young man". Hemingway sets the events in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] that shape the Adams persona. Young believes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] holds the [...] "master key" [...] to [...] "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism: if [...] "nothingness" [...] is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity. In his paper The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field, Timo Müller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an [...] "authentic life", and the [...] "soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature".|$|E
500|$|One of the {{political}} pressures, it is suggested by Susan Himmelweit {{is the issue of}} whom to empower. When there are considerations of policies, politicians usually only consider work as paid labor, and do {{not take into account the}} interdependence between unpaid work and paid work. It is also often common to think that women make economic decisions similarly to men. This is typically not the case, because for men, payment is simply a compensation for lost leisure time. However, for women, when they are working in the paid sector, they are still losing money because they have to make provisions for the domestic labor they are unable to do, such as caring for children or making dinner from scratch due to lack of resources such as child care. Her net financial gain is less than the financial gain of a man because she has to spend her earnings on providing for these provisions. In addition, increasing paid work hours in order to have more money may have negative effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> due to the increased total work hours and decreased leisure time. [...] Therefore, policies that give greater power to people who do paid labor, such as cutting back on public expenditure in order to lessen income taxes have an adverse effect on female employment and the effect that the double burden has on females. Such policies give greater power and consideration towards people who work in the paid sector, and less towards people who work in the unpaid sector.|$|E
