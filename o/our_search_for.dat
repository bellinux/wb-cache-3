5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book <b>Our</b> <b>Search</b> <b>for</b> a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E

We should also order the general commandant of the police and police- censors at the five gates to prohibit opium and to search for it at all gates. If they capture any violators, they should immediately punish them and should destroy the opium at once. As to Kwangtung [...] and Fukien , the provinces from which opium comes, we order their viceroys, governors, and superintendents of the maritime customs to conduct a thorough search for opium, and cut off its supply. They should in no ways consider this order a dead letter and allow opium to be smuggled out! ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from several new <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> physics beyond the Standard Model. We {{describe}} a search {{based on the}} scalar sum of the transverse energy of the event, a global quantity nearly independent of the event topology. We summarize <b>our</b> <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> first generation leptoquarks into all three decay channels, eq eq, eq nu q, and nu q nu q, and note {{that this is the}} first time that the triumvirate of decay channels has been searched. We do not find any evidence for production of first generation leptoquarks and set a lower limit on the mass of the leptoquark of 175 GeV/c^ 2, assuming the decay is exclusively into eq eq. We also present results from the first <b>search</b> <b>for</b> a third generation leptoquark with charge = +/- 1 / 3. Again, we find no evidence for its existence for a mass less than 80 GeV/c^ 2. Finally, we discuss one of <b>our</b> <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> supersymmetry, specifically the pair-production of selectrons, sneutrinos, and chi_ 2 ^ 0 where the decay yields final states with two photons plus missing transverse energy. We set limits on the production cross section ranging from 1 pb to 400 fb, depending on the mass. This analysis also sets a model-independent upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio to two photons + missing transverse energy + X of 185 fb at the 95 % CL for transverse energy of the photons > 12 GeV with eta 25 GeV.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Using a {{likelihood}} {{analysis and}} EGRET detections, upper limits and diffuse background measurements, {{we find a}} best-fit luminosity law L ∝ P − 1. 7 B 1. 2 for the gamma-ray pulsar population. We find that roughly 30 of the 170 unidentified EGRET sources {{are likely to be}} pulsars. This is roughly twice the number of known radio pulsars which are plausibly associated with unidentified EGRET sources. We predict that AGILE will detect roughly 70 pulsars as point sources, including 12 which will be able to be detected in blind periodicity searches. GLAST should detect roughly 1200 pulsars (including only 200 currently known radio pulsars), 210 of which will be able to be detected in blind searches. We discuss methods of <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> pulsars in gamma-ray data and present results from <b>our</b> <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> gamma-ray periodicities from new radio pulsars associated with unidentified EGRET sources. 1...|$|R

Next we use the Minahan-Zwiebach tachyon action to find the regular tube solutions with circular or elliptic cross section. With a critical electric field, {{the energy of the}} tube comes entirely from the D 0 and strings, while the energy associated to the tubular D 2 -brane tension is vanishing. We also show that fluctuation spectrum around the tube solution does not contain tachyonic mode. The results are consistent with the identification of the tubular configuration as a BPS D 2 -brane...|$|R
