5|$|Terrain {{played a}} {{significant}} role in operations around Narva. The elevation above sea level rarely rises above 100 meters in the area and the land is cut by numerous waterways, including the Narva and Plyussa Rivers.

The effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> on operations was one of channelization; because of the swamps, only certain areas were suitable for large-scale troop movement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results obtained by the authors {{in the last years}} during their paleomagnetic studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks in the Sikhote-Alin and Mongolia-Okhotsk superterrains, and also <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> attributed to <b>the</b> Amur Plate. These results are compared with the paleomagnetic data available for the North China and Siberian Cratons. Being similar to one another in many respects, the APWPs for the Sikhote-Alin and Mongolia-Okhotsk superterrains and for the North China Craton grew substantially different from the APWP for the Siberian Craton, reflecting <b>the</b> divergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mongolia-Okhotsk and Sikhote-Alin foldbelts, similar to <b>the</b> divergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North China Plate and the Siberian Craton.

5|$|Habré {{selected}} as the first target for his reconquest of northern Chad the well-fortified Libyan communications base of Fada. It was defended by 2,000 Libyans and {{the bulk of the}} Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) militia (Gaddafi's closest Chadian allies), well-provided with armour and artillery. Hassan Djamous, the thirty-year-old FANT commander-in-chief, pitched about 4,000–5,000 men against Fada's Libyan garrison. Taking advantage of his army's superior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrain,</b> which apparently included unknown access points to the base, Djamous avoided a frontal assault and used his forces' high mobility to surround the Libyan positions and then unleashed his troops, destroying the defending garrison. In the battle, 784 Libyans were killed and 100 tanks destroyed, while only 50 FANT soldiers died.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, the French {{utilized}} large column formations {{against the}} rebels, a tactic which the French chief-of-staff of the Army of the Levant, General André-Gaston Prételat, {{found to be}} generally ineffective against small mobile rebel units. Instead, he believed the optimal way to defeat the rebels was to recruit local militias who would share the two main strengths of the rebels: knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> and high mobility. However, the Syrian gendarmerie conscripted by the French military could not defeat the rebels {{because they were too}} small numerically, and not entirely reliable in battles against fellow locals.|$|E
40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on obtaining profiles of rough terrain suitable for vehicle dynamics simulations in a cost-effective manner. Commercially available inertial profilometers {{are unable to}} profile <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> <b>of</b> interest due to their severe roughness. A mechanical profilometer is developed and evaluated by profiling obstacles with known profiles, as well as rough 3 –D test track profiles. A good correlation between the profiled and actual terrains is achieved. Realistic three–dimensional (3 –D) terrain models are generated from <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> profiles. <b>The</b> Displacement Spectral Densities (DSDs) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> profiled <b>terrains</b> are found to contain discrete peaks; a straight line fit {{would not be an}} accurate estimation for <b>the</b> specific rough <b>terrains.</b> Comparisons between <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> defined in <b>the</b> International Roughness Index (IRI) and the present study indicate that <b>the</b> roughness index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> profiled with <b>the</b> mechanical profilometer is significantly higher than <b>the</b> <b>terrains</b> normally profiled by inertial profilometers.

5|$|The 12th SS Panzer Division (by {{the end of}} {{the battle}} the division's {{infantry}} strength had been reduced to that of a battalion)—claimed over the course of two days to have destroyed 103 British and Canadian tanks for the loss of 20. On entering Caen the Anglo-Canadian troops found it in ruins, with four-fifths of the Old City reduced to rubble by the 7 July bombings. The debris that choked the streets made it almost impossible for British armour to manoeuvre through the northern half of the city, preventing Second Army from exploiting I Corps's success. Without possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> flanking the south of the city, no further gains could be made within Caen so by mid-afternoon on 9 July, Operation Charnwood was over.|$|E
5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrain.</b> In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E

5|$|The Romans were {{in front}} of the hill leading to Cannae and hemmed in on their right flank by the Aufidus River, so that their left flank was the only viable means of retreat. In addition, the Carthaginian forces had maneuvered so that the Romans would face east. Not only would the morning sun shine low into the Romans' eyes, but the southeasterly winds would blow sand and dust into their faces as they {{approached}} the battlefield. Hannibal's unique deployment of his army, based on his perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> and understanding of the capabilities of his troops, proved decisive.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{he acted}} {{on the ground}} of his enemy's choosing, not of his own, and {{on the basis of}} meager {{information}} and almost no understanding of the ground, he broke all the military tactical rules of his own devising. He had thrown his infantry into the teeth of gun fire; he compounded this folly by committing his cavalry piecemeal in pointless charges across soft, spongy ground that was divided by streams, requiring them to attack in long, drawn out lines, rather than en masse; of course, he could not send his cavalry en masse because several natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—made this impossible on some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrain.</b>|$|E
