25|$|Sette {{retired from}} U.S. Government service in March 1970, but was {{immediately}} rehired as a paid annuitant {{and continued to}} work in the <b>Ocean</b> <b>Research</b> program until June 1970, when it completed its work and its office at Stanford closed. He then took charge of the Ocean Ecology unit at the Tiburon Laboratory of the National Marine Fisheries Service – an element of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) created along with NOAA in 1970 that replaced the Fish and Wildlife Service′s Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and took over almost all of its functions – in Menlo Park, California. In July 1970, he {{became a member of the}} editorial board of the Fishery Bulletin of the Fish and Wildlife Service, which was renamed the Fishery Bulletin in 1971.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, the Fish and Wildlife Service {{created a}} new program, <b>Ocean</b> <b>Research,</b> and made Sette its director. Again, Sette took charge of a new {{laboratory}} and, from a headquarters {{on the campus of}} Stanford University, pioneered yet another new aspect of fisheries science, namely, an examination of all available data concerning the oceans and development of an understanding of how they relate to the abundance and distribution of fish. He again created a team of biologists, oceanographers, and meteorologists, and they analyzed a mass of data on sea surface temperatures, weather observations, and all known data on the abundance of fish over time. By 1961, Sette had published analysis that demonstrated that abundance in a fishery depended not only fish population size itself, but also on the availability of the fish population to exploitation by fishing vessels, with oceanographic and meteorological factors playing a role in the latter as currents and weather differed from year to year. One of the team′s innovative achievements was the publication of an atlas of 168 monthly mean sea surface temperature charts for the Pacific Ocean north of latitude 20° North covering the years 1949 through 1962.|$|E

2500|$|For {{a number}} of years Regina Maris was docked in Gloucester, Massachusetts and was in the {{possession}} of the <b>Ocean</b> <b>Research</b> and Education Society (ORES)a local non-profit organization. She was used for day sails and short voyages as scientists and students sampled copepods in the Gulf of Maine, observed whales and other marine mammals but mostly for the pleasure of the Captain....... Volunteers could pay for acting as crew on short voyages and sampled life aboard an old wooden sailing vessel, including standing watch, sleeping in narrow bunks and climbing ratlines, the latter optional. [...] When the organization ran out of money trying to keep Regina seaworthy it is believed that she was sold to Anthony Athanas of Boston's Pier Four restaurant for use as a stationary party ship. One severely cold night with a loud crack she sank. [...] Soon after she was purchased and raised by a group from Long Island that hoped to return her to seaworthy condition.|$|E

The deep dredge sampling along the west coast of Florida was the first to be done in a previously unexplored area. Bache left the Gulf for New York, arriving May 23, for repairs before engaging in hydrographic surveys of Georges Bank off Massachusetts where she anchored on August 22 in thick fog to begin current measuring operations. By September 12 soundings were being made off Cape Sable and, at the request of Spencer F. Baird, authorized by Congress to investigate fishing matters, was making biological dredge casts, the first <b>ocean</b> <b>research</b> for the U.S. Fisheries Commission that is now the National Marine Fisheries Service. Operations, including small boat soundings, were conducted into island and coastal waters including Nantucket.|$|E
2500|$|The first whale {{watching}} in Japan {{was conducted in}} the Bonin Islands in 1998 by a group called Geisharen (...) , which was formed by groups of domestic and international people including both domestic and international celebrities and notable cetacean researchers and conservationists such as Roger Payne, Erich Hoyt, Richard Oliver, Jim Darling, John Ford, Kyusoku Iwamoto (cartoonist), Hutoushiki Ueki (science writer), Nobuyuki Miyazaki (head chief of the Atmosphere and <b>Ocean</b> <b>Research</b> Institute of The University of Tokyo), Nobuaki Mochizuki (one of the world's first whale photographers to record a living North Pacific right whale underwater in 1990 in Bonin Islands), Junko Sakuma (freelancer), and so on. During this time until before the group reach the destination, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan) and groups and individuals of anonymous watched the group's movements and threaten them not to conduct the tour. Prior to this movement, those who claimed conserving marine mammals including pinnipeds, or individuals who tried to correct illegal and over-extensive hunts (including C. W. Nicol who was a sympathizer to Japan's whaling industries) or domestic medias that have done reporting assignments in Japan had been discriminated. Some of these including former fishermen who were ostracized in their communities later became whale-watching operators. Several other tours have been operated by former whalers or dolphin hunters such as at Abashiri, Muroto, and so on.|$|E
