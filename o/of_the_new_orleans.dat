5|$|Beauregard's first {{employment}} {{following the}} war was in October 1865 as chief engineer and general superintendent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> Jackson and Great Northern Railroad.

This job overlapped with that of president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> and Carrollton Street Railway (1866–1876), where he invented a system of cable-powered street railway cars. Once again, Beauregard made a financial success of the company, but was fired by stockholders who wished to take direct management of the company.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt to relocate the Timberwolves, the New Orleans Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city. After completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Arena, the Alliance led efforts to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies to the city. The New Orleans bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive to relocate following a failed referendum for a new arena in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} the relocation of the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since the relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979. In November 2002, the Timberwolves made their first trip to New Orleans since the failed relocation efforts of the Top Rank group in 1994.|$|E

5|$|After being {{considered}} for the Detroit Tigers' managerial vacancy that offseason, Peckinpaugh took over as manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-AA American Association for the 1934 season. Out of professional baseball in 1935, Peckinpaugh joined Lew Fonseca on nationwide baseball tours, which involved the viewing of a movie and technical demonstrations. He applied to be manager of the Boston Bees for the 1938 season, but the job was given to Casey Stengel. Peckinpaugh returned to professional baseball as the manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Pelicans of the Class-A1 Southern Association in 1939.|$|E

5|$|The {{refurbishment}} and recommissioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Mint was due {{partly to}} the fact that in 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. had passed the Bland–Allison Act, which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The Treasury Department needed additional facilities to do so. It reopened the New Orleans facility primarily to coin large quantities of silver dollars, most of which were simply stored in the building instead of circulated. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed former Mississippi Senator and governor Henry S. Foote the new superintendent of the mint.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1999 {{season the}} Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins {{had been the}} first-ever draft choice of the {{expansion}} Carolina Panthers and {{in his second season}} led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially when there was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Florida Atlantic {{football}} team finished six wins and six losses in regular season play and {{was invited to}} the Motor City Bowl. The Owls defeated Central Michigan University 24–21, increasing their bowl record to two wins and zero losses. During the previous season, the {{football team}} beat Troy University in {{the final game of}} regular season play to become Sun Belt Co-Champions and receive an invitation to the New Orleans Bowl. In just the seventh year of the football program's history, and the third year playing in Division I, Florida Atlantic set NCAA records by both becoming the youngest program ever to receive an invitation to, and win, a bowl game. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Bowl the university has seen a surge in school spirit.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of an NBA team, {{and led by}} Mayor Mick Cornett, who had successfully lobbied for the previous temporary relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Hornets to Oklahoma City, the voters of that city approved a $120 million renovation of the Ford Center on March 3, 2008, including {{construction of a new}} NBA practice facility. After a tour of downtown Oklahoma City, a subcommittee of three NBA owners recommended that the league approve the move. On March 14, Bennett reached a preliminary agreement with Oklahoma City on a 15-year lease of the Ford Center that was finalized by the Oklahoma City Council and the Sonics’ ownership group two weeks later. The Oklahoma State Legislature later approved a bill to provide tax breaks and other incentives if the team relocated.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of her purchaser is not known, nor are her activities after her sale, but Ozark {{was still in}} service in late 1873 and based at New Orleans. Louisiana governor William Pitt Kellogg used the ship to transport 35 soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment and 25 mounted members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Metropolitan Police to Colfax, Louisiana in October to apprehend the perpetrators of the Colfax Massacre. Due to widespread resistance by local whites, only a few men were arrested and transported to New Orleans by Ozark to stand trial in December.

5|$|The {{great white}} pelican is the {{national}} bird of Romania. The brown pelican {{is the national}} bird of three Caribbean countries—Saint Kitts and Nevis, Barbados and Sint Maarten—and features on their coats of arms. It is also the state bird of the US state of Louisiana, which is known colloquially as the Pelican State; the bird appears on the state flag and state seal. It adorns the seals of Louisiana State University and Tulane University, and is the mascot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Pelicans NBA team, Tulane University, and the University of the West Indies. A white pelican logo {{is used by the}} Portuguese bank Montepio Geral, and a pelican is depicted on the reverse of the Albanian 1 lek coin, issued in 1996. The name and image were used for Pelican Books, an imprint of non-fiction books published by Penguin Books.
