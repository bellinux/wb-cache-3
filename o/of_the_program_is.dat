5|$|Both Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law {{assume that}} the running time of the serial part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> {{independent}} {{of the number of}} processors. Amdahl's law assumes that the entire problem is of fixed size so that the total amount {{of work to be done}} in parallel is also independent of the number of processors, whereas Gustafson's law assumes that the total amount of work to be done in parallel varies linearly with the number of processors.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{opportunities}} in emergency medicine {{are not available}} in many countries, and even when present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program in emergency medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> modeled on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E
5|$|The JD {{program has}} both a {{traditional}} three-year, full-time curriculum or a part-time day program {{that can take}} a maximum of six years. Students' initial enrollment can only begin with the fall term each year. Through a partnership between the College of Law and Willamette's Atkinson Graduate School of Management, a joint degree program is offered to students interested in earning both a JD and an MBA concurrently. The program allows students to earn both degrees in four years instead of five years if completed separately. The business portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>is</b> accredited through the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration, while the law portion, along with the entire law school, is accredited by the American Bar Association.|$|E
