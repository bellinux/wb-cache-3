5|$|Horse rings, {{often made}} of iron or brass, are {{remnants}} from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary mode of transportation. In 1978, The Register-Guard {{suggested that the}} rings might only be as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s. The rings allowed residents to tether their horses to sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger is as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated {{that it was a}} predator; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} {{journal of}} the LSA, Language, is ranked {{as one of the}} top journals in the field. The journal is almost as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Society itself. First published in March 1925 and edited by George Melville Bolling, Aurelio Espinosa, and Edward Sapir, the journal published its 92nd volume in 2016 under the editorship of Gregory Carlson. Dr. Carlson's successor, Andries Coetzee, was elected Editor of Language in 2016 and assumed office in 2017 for a term of seven years. The journal is partially open access, allowing articles to be published open access after a year, or immediately for a fee.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the study of bike {{dynamics}} is nearly as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> bicycle itself. It includes contributions from famous scientists such as Rankine, Appell, and Whipple. In the early 19th century Karl von Drais, credited with inventing the two-wheeled vehicle variously called the laufmaschine, velocipede, draisine, and dandy horse, showed that a rider could balance his device by steering the front wheel. In 1869, Rankine published an article in The Engineer repeating von Drais's assertion that balance is maintained by steering {{in the direction of a}} lean.|$|E

5|$|These two {{populations have}} been {{observed}} in many galaxies, especially massive elliptical galaxies. Both groups are nearly as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> universe itself and are of similar ages, but differ in their metal abundances. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain these subpopulations, including violent gas-rich galaxy mergers, the accretion of dwarf galaxies, and multiple phases of star formation in a single galaxy. In the Milky Way, the metal-poor clusters {{are associated with the}} halo and the metal-rich clusters with the bulge.|$|E
5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} burning up with the imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line is as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with electric traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{origin of}} a breed as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Terrier is obscure and undocumented. The first written records about a dog of similar {{description}} to the Scottish Terrier dates from 1436, when Don Leslie described {{them in his}} book The History of Scotland 1436–1561. Two hundred years later, Sir Joshua Reynolds painted {{a portrait of a}} young girl caressing a dog similar in appearance to the modern-day Scottie. King James VI of Scotland was an important historical figure featuring in the Scottish Terrier's history. In the 17th century, when King James VI became James I of England, he sent six terriers—thought to be forerunners of the Scottish terrier—to a French monarch as a gift. His love and adoration for the breed increased their popularity throughout the world.|$|E

5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years <b>old.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{four types}} of flower parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model of flower development. Each of the {{four types of}} flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as <b>old</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> flowering plants themselves.|$|E
5|$|On paper, the JNA {{seemed a}} {{powerful}} force, with 2,000 tanks and 300 jet aircraft (mainly Soviet or locally produced). However, by 1991, {{the majority of}} this equipment was 30 years <b>old,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> force consisted primarily of T-54/55 tanks and MiG-21 aircraft. Still, the JNA operated around 300 M-84 tanks (a Yugoslav version of the Soviet T-72) and a sizable fleet of ground-attack aircraft, such as the Soko G-4 Super Galeb and the Soko J-22 Orao, whose armament included AGM-65 Maverick guided missiles. By contrast, more modern cheap anti-tank missiles (like the AT-5) and anti-aircraft missiles (like the SA-14) were abundant and were designed to destroy much more advanced weaponry. Before the war the JNA had 169,000 regular troops, including 70,000 professional officers. The fighting in Slovenia brought about {{a great number of}} desertions, and the army responded by mobilizing Serbian reserve troops. Approximately 100,000 evaded the draft, and the new conscripts proved an ineffective fighting force. The JNA resorted to reliance on irregular militias. Paramilitary units like the White Eagles, Serbian Guard, Dušan Silni, and Serb Volunteer Guard, which committed a number of massacres against Croat and other non-Serbs civilians, were increasingly used by the Yugoslav and Serb forces. There were also foreign fighters supporting the RSK, mostly from Russia. With the retreat of the JNA forces in 1992, JNA units were reorganized as the Army of Serb Krajina, which was a direct heir to the JNA organization, with little improvement.|$|E
