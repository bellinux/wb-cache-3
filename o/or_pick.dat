5|$|Basil was no {{more than}} the name of {{bachelor}} uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> a globe artichoke to pieces.... Then came Elizabeth David like sunshine, writing with brief elegance about good food, that is, about food well contrived, well cooked. She made us understand that we could do better with what we had.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{foraging}} birds may feed actively on {{the substrate}} <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> grains {{dropped on the}} ground and these strategies may be chosen according to the situation. Early departures occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity increases. Competition intensity is expected to increase when more scroungers are present or when patches are smaller.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E

5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E
5|$|During the Spanish era Rondalya music, where {{traditional}} string orchestra mandolin type {{instruments were}} used, was widespread. In the Philippines, Rondalya refers to {{any group of}} stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum <b>or</b> <b>pick.</b> Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. Harana and Kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed {{to sleep on the}} wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{the purpose}} of {{altering}} {{the state of the}} ball is to achieve more favourable bowling conditions. Examples of ball tampering would include a fielder applying a substance, such as lip balm or sweetened saliva, to shine one side of the ball <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> the seam of the ball to encourage more swing. Conversely, roughening one side of the ball by use of an abrasive or cutting surface (such as boot spikes or bottle caps) is also ball tampering.|$|E
25|$|The harquebusier {{would usually}} have been {{armed with a}} doglock carbine, hung from a swivel {{attached}} to a baldric, pistols, either wheellock or flintlock, in saddle holsters and a stout, straight-bladed, sword. The 'dog' of the doglock was a type of safety-catch, very useful to prevent the unintentional firing of the carbine when on horseback. Records also indicate that some harquebusiers were also armed with a horseman's poleaxe <b>or</b> <b>pick,</b> these were hafted weapons with axe or hammer heads and armour-piercing spikes.|$|E
25|$|There were {{optional}} {{systems to}} dial the phone <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> it up, {{but these were}} generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used {{on one end of}} the connection or the other. For instance, the autodialler was a system that automated the action of picking up the phone and dialing a number, and was normally implemented as a separate box that connected to another port on the host computer. Such devices were typically expensive and generally used by larger organizations like banks, who might use one to send an end-of-day file to branch offices.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} Oberlin's {{academics}} is the Winter Term {{during the month}} of January. This term was created to allow students to do something outside the regular course offerings of the college. Students may work alone or in groups, either on or off campus, and may design their own project <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> from a list of projects and internships set up by the college each year. Students must complete a winter term project three years out of their four in the College of Arts and Sciences. Projects range from serious academic research with co-authorship in scientific journals, to humanitarian projects, to making avant-garde films about historic Chicago neighborhoods, to learning how to bartend. A full-credit project is suggested to involve five to six hours per weekday.|$|E
25|$|Although Fredericksburg was its own radio {{market and}} the {{ownership}} group believed the city was large enough for a locally focused TV station, the fact remained that WHFV was attempting to enter a very saturated regional television market. There was first the proximity of two well-established NBC stations, WRC-TV Washington and WWBT Richmond, which were available over the air in most of WHFV's coverage area. Second, any reasonably popular syndicated programming {{was likely to be}} already picked up by stations in the larger markets – especially Washington with its two independent stations – leaving WHFV to either duplicate the shows <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> up weaker ones. Third, all other network affiliates in the area were on VHF, so many viewers were not used to tuning to a UHF channel or did not even have the right antenna. WHFV was forced to run advertisements explaining how to tune a UHF channel.|$|E
500|$|McCartney's {{skill as}} a bass player has been {{acknowledged}} by other bassists, including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC. Best known for primarily using a plectrum <b>or</b> <b>pick,</b> McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He {{does not use}} slapping or muting techniques. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, who McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: [...] "because he went to very unusual places". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke.|$|E

500|$|Due {{to their}} low weight {{and the fact}} that they had only one control wire per leg, the puppets were unable to walk convincingly. Therefore, scenes {{involving}} movement were filmed from the waist up, with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a [...] "bobbing" [...] action to simulate motion. Alternatively, dynamic shots were eliminated altogether: in an interview with New Scientist, director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets [...] "appear, for example, to walk through doors (although the control wires make this impossible) <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> up a coffee cup (although their fingers are not in fact jointed)." [...] Live-action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed.|$|E
500|$|Army ants forage {{in a wide}} roving column, attacking any {{animals in}} that path that are unable to escape. In Central and South America, Eciton burchellii is the {{swarming}} ant most commonly attended by [...] "ant-following" [...] birds such as antbirds and woodcreepers. This behaviour was once considered mutualistic, but later studies found the birds to be parasitic. Direct kleptoparasitism (birds stealing food from the ants' grasp) is rare and has been noted in Inca doves which pick seeds at nest entrances as they are being transported by species of Pogonomyrmex. Birds that follow ants eat many prey insects and thus decrease the foraging success of ants. Birds indulge in a peculiar behaviour called anting that, as yet, is not fully understood. Here birds rest on ant nests, <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> and drop ants onto their wings and feathers; {{this may be a}} means to remove ectoparasites from the birds.|$|E
500|$|Chapman had by now perfected Arsenal's ruthless, counter-attacking strategy. He {{employed}} a robust {{front line of}} Lambert supported by David Jack and Alex James as deep-lying inside forwards, filling the gap vacated by {{the movement of the}} centre half into defence; Alex James in particular, with his passing supplying the front men, became celebrated as the engine of the team during the coming decade. Chapman employed Bastin and Hulme as pacy wingers who could cut inside instead of hugging the touchline; they could either shoot for goal themselves <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> each other out if the centre forward was marked out of the game. With the exception of James, keeping and dwelling on the ball and individuality were discouraged in favour of a quick passing game, although Chapman still conceded: [...] "All the men are expected to play to plan, but not so as to stifle individuality." ...|$|E

500|$|Davil Balls of Digital Spy {{described}} the music video as being [...] "cheeky, seductive {{and more than}} a little bit ridiculous" [...] and said that Spears [...] "delivers some killer dance routines". Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly compared the dance in the chair with the music video of [...] "Stronger" [...] and added that [...] "best of all, she actually looks animated in this video and appears to be having fun". James Montgomery of MTV said that after watching the video [...] "you are overcome with the sudden urge to go to the Big Apple Circus. <b>Or</b> <b>pick</b> up some Curious perfume. Or you know, possibly both". The music video won the category of Best Moves at the MTV Australia Awards 2009. It was also nominated for four VMAs at the 2009 awards in the categories of Best Art Direction, Best Choreography, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, but lost of all them. It was also nominated for Best Video in the MTV Europe Music Awards 2009, but lost to Beyoncé's [...] "Single Ladies". The video won Best Video of 2009 in Fuse TV, making Spears the only artist to win two years in a row.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy played {{full-time}} {{with the}} Leafs {{for the first}} time in the 1943–44 season. Although the Leafs had won the Stanley Cup in 1942, at the time of Kennedy's arrival the Leafs were a team decimated by the loss of some of its best players to the war effort. Andy Lytle, Sports Editor of The Toronto Star, wrote of the Leaf team eliminated from the previous season's playoffs, [...] "I do not suppose that Toronto was so weakly represented in the N.H.L. playoffs since the club originated." [...] During training camp, Kennedy read in a newspaper interview of Coach Hap Day speaking about the best new prospects on the Leafs, but he had failed to mention Kennedy. This served to fire up Kennedy to give an even greater effort towards making the team. Toronto's first pre-season exhibition game was against the St. Catharine Saints, a senior team now being coached by Kennedy's former junior coach Nels Stewart. After the game, Kennedy approached Stewart for advice, because he was disappointed he had not scored in the game. Stewart, who was the all-time NHL goal scoring leader until Maurice Richard overtook him in the 1952–53 season, advised when facing the goaltender to [...] "either draw him out, <b>or</b> <b>pick</b> the corner." ...|$|E
