5|$|Events of 1848 in Europe and the Austrian Empire brought {{dramatic}} changes to Croatian society and politics, provoking the Croatian national revival that strongly influenced and significantly shaped {{political and social}} events in Croatia. At the time, the Sabor and Ban Josip Jelačić advocated the severance <b>of</b> <b>ties</b> with the Kingdom of Hungary, emphasising links to other South Slavic lands within the empire. Several prominent Croatian political figures emerged, such as Ante Starčević, Eugen Kvaternik, Franjo Rački and Josip Juraj Strossmayer. A period of neo-absolutism {{was followed by the}} Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement, which granted limited independence to Croatia. This was compounded by Croatian claims of uninterrupted statehood since the early Middle Ages as a basis for a modern state. Two political parties that evolved in the 1860s and contributed significantly to the sentiment were the Party of Rights, led by Starčević and Kvaternik, and the People's Party, led by Janko Drašković, Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski, Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Ivan Mažuranić. They were opposed by the National Constitutional Party, which was in power for most of the period between the 1860s and the 1918, and advocated closer ties between Croatia and Hungary.|$|E

40|$|Tie 2 {{receptor}} is a cell surface {{tyrosine kinase}} receptor expressed {{almost exclusively in}} endothelial cells, where it is mainly studied for its role in angiogenesis. Indeed, Tie 2 has been related to various pathologies with vascular implication such as pulmonary hypertension, diabetes retinopathy and tumour growth. The regulation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 activation and function is complex, involving multiple factors that are still being investigated. For instance, after activation by the agonistic ligand Angiopoietin- 1 (Ang 1), Tie 2 is internalized in cells by an endocytic mechanism {{that has yet to}} be fully characterised. As it has been shown that endocytosis of molecules can play a regulatory role in intracellular signalling in various ways I believe that the endocytosis <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 may also be important in the regulation of its activity and cellular output. Therefore, I decided to characterise the endocytic mechanisms involved in the internalization <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 to determine whether endocytosis can be a regulator <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 signalling. To facilitate the study <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 I created a HeLa cell line with inducible expression <b>of</b> a <b>Tie</b> 2 FLAG receptor that emulates both expression levels and characteristics <b>of</b> endogenous <b>Tie</b> 2 in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells. To study the endocytosis <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 receptor I developed an immunofluorescence-based assay to quantify the amount of internalized agonistic ligand Ang 1 in a high throughput Screening format. I also performed complementary immunofluorescence and western blot analysis to investigate the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 internalization. ...|$|R

Glubb's dismissal {{was met with}} great enthusiasm among Jordan's inhabitants and Arab nationalists in {{and outside of the}} country. However, Abu Nuwar's ascendancy as head of the army was resented by its veteran Bedouin units; he was generally regarded as a competent staff officer, but did not have experience as a commander. As part of his efforts to modernize the army, he mandated that education was a prerequisite for advancement, an act which disproportionately affected Bedouin officers, many of whom lacked formal education. As a result of Abu Nuwar's measure, several senior Bedouin officers were retired or reassigned to non-command posts. To counterbalance opposition to him within the army's ranks, Abu Nuwar established the Fourth Infantry Brigade, which mostly consisted of Palestinians, who he believed would form an integral part of his power base within the military. Abu Nuwar's appointment also contributed to the increasing deterioration <b>of</b> <b>ties</b> between Jordan and the British government.|$|E

Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal <b>of</b> <b>ties,</b> visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E

It finds significant knowledge spillover from new collaborations to repeated collaborations, and proposes a network approach to understand scientific creativity at the egocentric network level beyond the boundary of teams. To understand the network effect (specifically, effects <b>of</b> <b>tie</b> strength) on creativity, it integrates literature on small groups and social networks and adopts a creative-process model. An inverted U-shaped relationship between tie strength and creativity is observed, because of the mixed impacts <b>of</b> <b>tie</b> strength {{at different stages of}} the creative process. Furthermore, it explores the effect <b>of</b> <b>tie</b> configurations and finds that the skewness <b>of</b> <b>tie</b> strength distribution moderates the effect <b>of</b> <b>tie</b> strength. In addition, it also tests two competing explanations for the association between strong tie and low creativity: creativity-decline hypothesis versus cost-reduction hypothesis.

5|$|The Crisis {{caused the}} newly {{independent}} African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, {{it led to the}} division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>ties</b> with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965.|$|E

40|$|A {{functioning}} vasculature {{is critical}} for the supply of nutrients to other systems {{as well as a}} host of physiologic and pathologic processes. Vascular development and maintenance are tightly regulated by a number of signaling processes, among which the Tie proteins are two functioning receptors. Although they have been shown to exhibit essential roles in endothelial cell sprouting and quiescence, the mechanistic details <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> interactions and the effects of their associations with the Angiopoietins have not been elucidated. Studies in this thesis investigated the effects of Ang 2 on Tie 1 activation, signaling, and cellular responses within the context of both native and immortalized endothelial cells. Additionally, we investigated the role of Ang 2 in the cellular reorganization and subsequent downregulation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1. We observed that Ang 2, but not Ang 1, induces phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 in endothelial cells and that the extracellular domain <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 is required for Ang 2 -mediated activation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Tie 1 activation leads to signaling through the Akt axis, and the consequent stimulation of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative cellular effects. Additionally, we demonstrated that Ang 2 induces a concentration and time dependent downregulation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1, and that Tie 2 's role in the process appears to be recruitment of the ligand to the multimeric Tie complexes. Interestingly, although Ang 2 stimulation is necessary, we demonstrated that Ang 2 activation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 receptor complexes is not required for ligand induced downregulation of the receptor. Finally, we characterized the modulatory role <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 with regards to Angiopoietin signaling through Tie 2, and observed that removal <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 from the surface of endothelial cells induces Ang 2 activation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 leading to increases in cell survival signaling cascades. Taken together, these data shed new light on Angiopoietin signaling through the Tie receptors, further characterize the interactions between Tie 1 and Tie 2, suggest novel forms of endothelial cell regulation within developing and mature vasculature, and may have implications in signaling within a host of physiologic and pathologic states.

40|$|AbstractAngiopoietin- 1 (Ang 1) and Ang 2 are ligands for the {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} Tie 2. Structural {{data suggest that the}} two ligands bind Tie 2 similarly. However, in endothelial cells Ang 1 activates Tie 2 whereas Ang 2 can act as an apparent antagonist. In addition, each ligand exhibits distinct kinetics of release following binding. These observations suggest that additional factors influence function and binding of angiopoietins with receptors in the cellular context. Previous work has shown that Ang 1 binding and activation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 are inhibited by Tie 1, a related receptor that complexes with Tie 2 in cells. In this study we have investigated binding of Ang 1 and Ang 2 to Tie 2 in endothelial cells. In contrast to Ang 1, binding of Ang 2 to Tie 2 was found to be not affected by Tie 1. Neither PMA-induced Tie 1 ectodomain cleavage nor suppression <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 expression by siRNA affected the ability of Ang 2 to bind <b>Tie</b> 2. Analysis <b>of</b> the level <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 co-immunoprecipitating with angiopoietin-bound Tie 2 demonstrated that Ang 2 can bind Tie 2 in Tie 2 :Tie 1 complexes whereas Ang 1 preferentially binds non-complexed <b>Tie</b> 2. Stimulation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 ectodomain cleavage did not increase the agonist activity of Ang 2 for Tie 2. Similarly, the Tie 2 -agonist activity of Ang 2 was not affected by siRNA suppression <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 expression. Consistent with previous reports, loss <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 ectodomain enhanced the agonist activity of Ang 1 for Tie 2. Importantly, Ang 2 was still able to antagonize the elevated Ang 1 -activation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 that occurs on Tie 1 ectodomain loss. Together these data demonstrate that Ang 1 and Ang 2 bind differently to Tie 2 at the cell surface and this is controlled by Tie 1. This differential regulation of angiopoietin binding allows control <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 activation response to Ang 1 without affecting Ang 2 agonist activity and maintains the ability of Ang 2 to antagonize even the enhanced Ang 1 activation <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 2 that occurs on loss <b>of</b> <b>Tie</b> 1 ectodomain. This provides a mechanism by which signalling through Tie 2 can be modified by stimuli in the cellular microenvironment...|$|R
5|$|According to {{historian}} Muhammad Adnan Bakhit, {{reliable information}} about the Assafs in the early 16th century is relatively scarce. A certain Emir Assaf from among the Turkmen tribesmen of Keserwan was appointed by Ottoman sultan Selim I as governor of the Keserwan nahiya (subdistrict; pl. nawahi) of the Safad Sanjak (Beirut Sanjak) after the Ottomans {{took control of the}} Levant from the Mamluks in 1516. Sultan Selim I assigned the Assafs as his chief agents in the region between Beirut and Tripoli, confirming their control of Keserwan, and awarding them tax farms in the nawahi of Jbeil and Beirut. While Emir Assaf had lived in Aintoura in the winter and elsewhere along the Nahr al-Kalb ridge prior to the Ottoman conquest, in 1517, he moved his headquarters to Ghazir. The move to the latter village in Keserwan's interior and away from the Turkmen-dominated coastal area likely contributed to a steady deterioration <b>of</b> <b>ties</b> between the Assafs and their fellow Turkmens. At the same time, it brought the Assafs closer to the Maronites who lived in the interior areas of Keserwan. Coiniciding to the Assafs' relocation to Ghazir, Hubaysh ibn Musa moved to the village from Yanouh. The Assaf and Hubaysh clans thereafter developed strong ties, with members of the latter serving as agents of the Assafs and becoming their chief intermediaries with the local Maronites.|$|E

They were opposed by the National Constitutional Party that was in power for most of the period between the 1860s and 1918, which advocated closer ties between Croatia and Hungary. Another significant party formed in this era was the Serb People's Independent Party, which would later form the Croat-Serb Coalition with the Party of Rights and other Croat and Serb parties. This Coalition ruled Croatia between 1903 and 1918. The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), established in 1904 and led by Stjepan Radić, advocated Croatian autonomy but achieved only moderate gains by 1918. In the Kingdom of Dalmatia, two major parties were the People's Party, a branch of the People's Party active in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, and the Autonomist Party, which advocated maintaining the autonomy of Dalmatia, opposing the People's Party's demands for unifying Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia. The Autonomist Party was also linked to Italian irredentism. By the 1900s, the Party of Rights also made electoral gains in Dalmatia. In Dalmatia, the Autonomists won the first three elections held there in 1861, 1864 and 1867, while those from 1870 to 1908 were won by the People's Party. In 1861–1918 there were 17 elections in Croatia-Slavonia and 10 in Dalmatia.|$|E

The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information). In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree. Accordingly, indegree is a count of the number <b>of</b> <b>ties</b> directed to the node and outdegree is the number <b>of</b> <b>ties</b> that the node directs to others. When ties are associated to some positive aspects such as friendship or collaboration, indegree is often interpreted as a form of popularity, and outdegree as gregariousness.|$|E
