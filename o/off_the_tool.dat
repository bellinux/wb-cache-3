50|$|There are {{different}} types of form tools. Insert form tools {{are the most common}} for short- to medium-range jobs (50 to 20,000 pcs). Circular form tools are usually for longer jobs, since the tool wear can be ground <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> tip many times as the tool is rotated in its holder. There is also a skiving tool {{that can be used for}} light finishing cuts. Form tools can be made of cobalt steel, carbide, or high-speed steel.

50|$|This tool uses a 0° reference. This {{means when}} a board is squared <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> reads 0°.The angle derived is {{actually}} a complementary angle. For example a 22.5° angle is actually 67.5°. The sum of the angles equals 90 degrees(22.5° +67.5°= 90°). It is obvious from a visual check that where the instruments displays 22.5° is not 22.5°. Many of the new slide miters and miter boxes display both angles. Some of the new calculators have a 0° and a 90° references to do angular calculations. This can create much confusion if the user does not understand this angular calibration.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{external}} location {{and the use of}} valuable precious metals including platinum, palladium, rhodium, and gold, catalytic converters are a target for thieves. The problem is especially common among late-model trucks and SUVs, because of their high ground clearance and easily removed bolt-on catalytic converters. Welded-on converters are also at risk of theft, as they can be easily cut <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tools</b> with which thieves quickly remove a catalytic converter, such as a portable reciprocating saw, can often damage other components of the car, such as wiring or fuel lines, and thereby can have dangerous consequences.

40|$|Ant-dipping is a tool-use {{behavior}} {{targeted at}} biting and gregarious army ants (Dorylus spp.). Although several wild chimpanzee communities exhibit this behavior, some do not, although army ants are ubiquitous across Africa. This tool-use behavior {{is often cited}} {{as one of the}} best examples of culture in chimpanzees. Nevertheless, recent data emerging from Bossou in southeastern Guinea and detailed entomological analysis of the army ant species available at different chimpanzee study sites, as well as direct observations of this behavior, indicate that the aggressiveness and the density of the ant species influence tool length and the technique employed to consume the ants <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Behavioral differences persist, however, between the communities of Taï, Côte d’Ivoire, and Bossou, where the same species of army ants are consumed by the chimpanzees. A comparative study indicates that these variations in ant-dipping between these two long-term field sites cannot solely be explained on the basis of prey behavior, characteristics, and availability and must therefore be cultural. A longitudinal study of the acquisition of ant-dipping among the chimpanzees of Bossou supports this assertion by revealing the importance of social influences and the role of the mother in the learning process of young chimpanzees. Finally, studies of ant-dipping, especially at Bossou, have demonstrated a narrow interrelationship between ecology, social learning, and culture...|$|E
40|$|Large {{improvements}} in cutting tool design and technology {{have been achieved}} in the last decades. But the problem of improving the tool body material is not adequately studied. In the present study, the different aspects associated with the steel properties as related to the milling cutter body application are reviewed. The working performance of a tool holder depends in particular on the fatigue strength, high temperature properties and machinability of the tool steel used. Rotating tools, tool {{going in and out}} of cutting engagement, impose dynamic stresses and require adequate fatigue strength <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Different publications, as well as internal investigation at Uddeholm Tooling AB show that the working temperatures of milling cutter bodies in the insert pocket vary from 300 to 600 degrees Celsius depending on the cutting conditions and material of the workpiece. As a result, steel for this application needs good hot properties such as high temper resistance, high hot hardness values, etc. Machinability is also essential as machining of steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a milling cutter. Its complex shape with flutes and insert pockets as well as small thread holes and small deep holes for cooling channels require time consuming and advanced machining operations. The essential properties mentioned above were characterized with the emphasis to the steel type, its microstructure and purity, processing and surface treatment and strong interrelations between them...|$|E

40|$|This final {{project was}} aimed {{to build a}} model of Air Conditioning Equipment Pond Fish Spawning ATmega 8 microcontroller-based. This device was {{expected}} to function to assist community fish farmers in fish spawning process that requires setting the water temperature automatically. This tool was developed in several stages namely, (1) Identification of Needs, (2) Needs Analysis, (3) System Design, (4) Hardware Design, (5) Software Design, (6) Technical Operations, and (7) Testing Equipment. The design of this tool is realized by combining several systems of power supply circuit, LM 35 temperature sensor, push button, the LCD 16 x 2 lines, the control circuit and microcontroller ATmega 8 as processing units. Software design as a control program in this ATmega 8 microcontroller used C language and compiler software CVAVR as his. The testing of this tool is by entering the LM 35 temperature sensor into the water. LM 35 sensor output {{was connected to the}} ATmega 8 microcontroller ADC input for processing into digital numbers for controlling the cooling elements and heating elements. If the water temperature is less than the minimum limit has been determined, then the cooling element will be on. If the water temperature is more than the maximum limit specified, then the heating element will be on. If the water temperature between the minimum and maximum temperature within the limits specified temperature, the cooling elements and heating elements will be <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tool</b> also displayed the temperature value into the LCD in accordance detected by the temperature sensor.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} a genetic algorithm as a methodology to choose and improve the motion law governing the movement of a redundant robot. The subject of this research is an innovative system developed to introduce the laser ray technology in the on-line tube cutting. This technique allows a quality improvement in the pipe-cutting sector, thanks to the various goals. Firstly we underline the improvement of the working environment due to the elimination of cutting noise taking <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> changing and the steel shaving creation. Secondarily there is a drastic reduction of the cutting cycle time and an improvement of the productivity accomplished by the use of brushless drives and linear motors. In the robot design, particular attention was dedicated to the masses distributions allowing a good natural machine dynamics. The ability of the robot to avoid the cutting object, the demand to maintain the laser torch orthogonal to the cutting surfaces, as well the necessity to impose a velocity behaviour as constant as possible during the cutting operation, suggested the introduction of a redundant degree of freedom. This aspect gives a lot of opportunities in the choose of movements because there are thousands motion profiles for the joints whichever satisfying the conditions imposed to the end-effector path. In this context, we have proposed the idea to combine the procedure to solve the inverse kinematics problem with the contemporaneous optimization of the trajectory. Literature offers a series of algorithms to solve wellknown inverse kinematics problem of redundant robot. These are based on the inversion of the matrix representing the link between the end-effector co-ordinates and the joints. The presence of redundancy makes this matrix rectangular and requires the use of the pseudo-inverse matrix to solve the problem in several points of the trajectory. The introduction of some weights, one for each joint co-ordinate, allows to obtain a different distribution of the joint movements computing the pseudo-inverse matrix. If we change these weights in a continuous way in time domain, we can supervise the dynamic behaviors of the machine. The new idea we propose here is the use of an adapted multi-objective genetic algorithm to define a several of particular motion laws reducing vibrations and realizing “special harmonies” in the robot motion. The procedure, that will be completely discussed in the full paper, is actually working on a laser pipe cutting machine. This robot awarded the first prize between two thousand competitor at the EMO MILANO 2003 exhibition...|$|E
