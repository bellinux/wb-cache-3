5000|$|Mangoes are juicy {{stone fruit}} (drupe) from {{numerous}} species of tropical trees belonging to <b>the</b> flowering plant <b>genus</b> <b>Mangifera,</b> cultivated mostly for their edible fruit. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> these species {{are found in}} nature as wild mangoes. <b>The</b> <b>genus</b> belongs to <b>the</b> cashew family Anacardiaceae. Mangoes are native to South Asia, from where the [...] "common mango" [...] or [...] "Indian mango", Mangifera indica, has been distributed worldwide to become one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics. Other Mangifera species (e.g. horse mango, Mangifera foetida) are also grown on a more localized basis.|$|R
40|$|Mango (Mangifera indica) is {{regarded}} {{among the five}} most important fruit commodities traded worldwide, along with bananas, apples, grapes and oranges, with over 40 M tonnes produced annually worldwide. <b>The</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Mangifera</b> is believed to contain up to 70 species, with origins in the North‐Eastern Indian subcontinent and South East Asia. Despite this, there is a relatively poor understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedigree, genetic relatedness and <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> domestication of many M. indica cultivars and related species worldwide. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> molecular tools for mango is extremely limited, thus its genes, genetics and genomics remain largely unidentified. Whole genome sequencing and <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> genetic maps of these species are important components in marker assisted breeding and genetic improvement. An international genomics program is being undertaken to build these genetic resources including <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) molecular genetic markers, <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a genetic map for mango, association of phenotypic traits to the genetic map to identify useful individual markers for breeding, assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genetic diversity in mango germplasm collections, and sequencing, assembly and annotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mango genome. These genetic resources will facilitate identification of genetic components with useful agronomic traits for breeding material. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> whole genome sequencing of mango is accelerated progress in <b>the</b> breeding <b>of</b> mango cultivars with improved agronomic traits (eg reduced vigour, disease resistance, fruit colour) {{that could not be}} accomplished by traditional methods...|$|R

This region {{is a prime}} habitat for in situ conservation of genetic diversity of long-lived, largely out-crossing wild/domesticated Tropical Fruit Tree (TFT) species. Wild TFT species in 36 project sites throughout India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were examined with an objective of documenting species richness and understanding their local uses and potential value in plant breeding/ecosystem services. Multiple methods such as participatory rural appraisal, baseline survey, focus group discussion on traditional knowledge documentation, fruit diversity fairs, community fruit catalogues and key informant surveys of custodian farmers were carried out focusing on wild species of Mangifera, Garcinia, Nephelium and Citrus. For <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Mangifera,</b> highest number <b>of</b> wild species (LSQUOsRSQUO) was recorded among <b>the</b> communities <b>of</b> Indonesia (11) and Malaysia (11), while it was 6 in Thailand and only one in India. Communities of Thailand also showed highest LSQUOsRSQUO value for Garcinia (14), while it was 8 for Malaysian, 5 in Indian and 3 for Indonesian communities. For <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Nephelium, 7 species were used in Malaysia, 5 in Indonesia and 5 in Thailand. However, communities of India showed higher species richness of Citrus (8) and it was 2 for communities of Thailand. This study concludes that South and South East Asian countries are stunningly rich in wild fruit tree species diversity. However their principal economic value as genetic resources and the benefits derived from their associated cultural value is seldom demonstrated by public-sector research initiatives. It is also concluded that there are potentials for marketing of wild species of Mangifera viz. M. pajang, M. caesia, M. odorata, M. casturi; of Citrus viz. C. indica, C. macroptera, C. assamensis, C. ichangensis, C. megaloxycarpa (Sour Pummelo); of Garcinia viz. G. cowa, G. atroviridis, G. indica, G. xanthochymus, G. gummi-gutta and of Nephalium viz.
