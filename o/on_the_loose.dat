5|$|John Neville soon emerged, with Warwick, {{as representatives}} of the king's power in the north, which was still {{politically}} turbulent, as there were still {{a large number of}} Lancastrians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>loose</b> attempting to raise rebellion against the new regime. As his brother Warwick became more involved in national politics and central government, it devolved to John to finally defeat the last remnants of Lancastrians in 1464. Following these victories, Montagu, in what {{has been described as a}} high point for his House, was created Earl of Northumberland. At around the same time, however, his brother Warwick became increasingly dissatisfied with his relationship with the king, and began instigating rebellions against Edward IV in the north, finally capturing him in July 1469. At first, Montagu helped suppress this discontent, and also encouraged Warwick to release Edward. Eventually, however, his brother went into French exile with the king's brother George, Duke of Clarence, in March 1470.|$|E
