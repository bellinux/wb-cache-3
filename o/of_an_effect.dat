5|$|Williams {{argued that}} there is a crucial {{distinction}} between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.|$|E

The cycle from spawning to adult form takes approximately 6 months {{during which time}} {{the vast majority of}} larvae die.

25|$|Internationally, where gun {{controls}} are generally stricter {{than in the}} United States, some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt, as alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable.

40|$|Maternal {{effects can}} have {{environmental}} or genetic causes.

25|$|In July 1695, {{the city}} of Namur, {{occupied}} for three years by the French, was besieged by William III of England, {{at the head of}} an allied army. After the death of the Duke of Luxembourg, the French army was led by the Duke of Villeroi, a mediocre strategist but close to the king. The king, irritated at the recent turn of events, urged Villeroi to destroy Bruges or Ghent in a surprise attack.

The first {{district heating}} plant was built in 1961 {{as a means to}} provide effective heating to the newly built suburbs of Novi Beograd. Since then, numerous plants have been built to heat the ever-growing city. They use natural gas as fuel, because it has less <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on the environment. The district heating system of Belgrade possesses 112 heat sources of 2,454MW capacity, over 500km of pipeline, and 4365 connection stations, providing district heating to 240,000 apartments and 7,500 office/commercial buildings of total floor area exceeding 17,000,000 square meters.|$|E

25|$|Bolo punch : Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which {{owes its}} power to the {{shortening}} of a circular arc rather than to transference of body weight; it tends to have more <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> due {{to the surprise of}} the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the Ali shuffle. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former welterweight champions Sugar Ray Leonard, and Kid Gavilan. Middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.|$|E
25|$|From {{a medical}} standpoint, {{physical}} illnesses also improve from positive {{emotional and behavioral}} changes. Anger management style and overall level of anger {{has been associated with}} both acute and chronic pain sensitivity. Blood pressure is another physiological aspect effected by anger, with increased levels of anger being correlated with higher blood pressure. The implications <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on blood pressure for overall health is made evident by the link between high blood pressure and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. An increase in the immune system's efficacy has also been observed {{as a result of the}} increased level of relaxation. Successful anger management could also lead to an overall longer life span due to the decrease in reckless behavior and violent altercations.|$|E

Smirnov won two seats in the elections of February 1990, the 32nd district seat for the city soviet (municipal government) of Tiraspol and the 125th district seat for the Supreme Soviet of MSSR (republican government) in 1990 Moldovan parliamentary election. Once in the city soviet, Smirnov ran for chairmanship of that body. In a dramatic demonstration of how much the Communist Party's power had waned, Smirnov beat his challenger, the First Secretary of the city's Party Committee, Leonid Tsurkan, by a 2-to-1 margin. From this time forward, Tiraspol was an OSTK-controlled city.|$|E

25|$|CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, {{who oversaw}} {{a drop of}} 1% in his party's vote share since the 2011 general election, issued a {{statement}} praising democracy for ousting the AKP majority government from power. Despite the CHP claiming {{that it was because}} of them that the AKP failed to win a majority, media commentators claimed that the decrease in their vote and seat share showed that it was in fact the HDP and MHP that had more <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on the result. CHP spokesperson Haluk Koç stated that the CHP was now in the most likely position to be included in a coalition, with Kılıçdaroğlu allegedly attempting to form a CHP-MHP minority coalition with outside support from the HDP. Kılıçdaroğlu appeared to have refused to consider a coalition with the AKP. In response to a question of whether he would resign after presiding over a decrease in the CHP vote, Kılıçdaroğlu refused to comment but claimed that he was perfectly happy with the election result. Despite this, the President of the Turkish Bars Association and CHP member Metin Feyzioğlu stated that a convention should be called due to the poor election result. The drop in the CHP's vote share was largely attributed to CHP voters tactically voting for the HDP to increase the chances of them surpassing the 10% parliamentary threshold.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{methods of}} opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the {{well-being}} of the embryo and/or blastomere may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on the embryo and/or blastomere. ZD uses a digestive enzyme like pronase which makes it a chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida which makes it a mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the mechanical method of PZD in blastomere biopsies for preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method {{of opening the}} zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo and it is very expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues.|$|E
500|$|Clair {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest mothers in television history by several media publications. Time dubbed Clair [...] "America's favorite TV mom". Peoples Jane Hall hailed the character as America's [...] "No. 1 wife and mom" [...] while crowning Rashad [...] "TV's Reigning Mom" [...] in 1987. Hayley Krischer of Salon agreed that Clair is [...] "everyone’s favorite" [...] and [...] "undoubtedly the best TV mom", despite being [...] "too calm, too gorgeous, too successful" [...] to be realistic. The Daily Beast wrote, [...] "Clair Huxtable was not only the perfect mom, but also a great role model as someone who never sacrificed either her career as a high-power lawyer or her family life." [...] Praising the character for transcending both racial and generational barriers, Patrice Evans of Jezebel described Clair as [...] "the perfect professional mom". The author went on to claim that while other famous television mothers such as June Cleaver, Carol Brady and Edith Bunker have gradually suffered a loss in [...] "potency" [...] over time, Clair instead remains a relevant maternal figure every television mother created since can only aspire to be like. As a [...] "family-balancing professional African American woman", Clair has had a profound influence on The Cosby Shows viewers. According to Susan Douglas, author of The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women, Clair was [...] "the first African American mother on television ... with whom white women identified and wanted to emulate." [...] US Weekly recognized Clair as [...] "one of TV's first working mothers", while NewNowNext's Brian Juergens credits the character with making the 1980s a [...] "boom time for great sitcom moms" [...] by [...] "breaking the mold in an essential way". SheKnows contributor Cynthia Boris recognized Clair as a mother television audiences had [...] "never seen before -- a beautiful, successful, working mom who was an African American" [...] and [...] "a positive role model ... every young woman could aspire to." [...] Sharifa Daniels of Vibe concluded [...] "No other TV mom has left such <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> on viewers as Clair Huxtable ... an exemplary example of a wife, mother, and friend" [...] in an article recognizing [...] "10 Life Lessons Clair Huxtable Taught You".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} whether {{immigration}} can mitigate the Dutch disease effects associated with booms in natural resource sectors. We first derive predicted {{changes in the}} size of the non-tradable sector from a small general-equilibrium model 0 la Obstfeld-Rogoff, supplemented by a resource income and a varying labour supply. Using data for Canadian provinces, we test for the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mitigating <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> immigration in terms <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increase {{in the size of}} the non-tradable sector triggered by the positive resource shock in booming regions. We find evidence <b>of</b> such <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> for the aggregate inflow of migrants. Disentangling those flows by type of migrants, we find that the mitigation effect is due mostly to interprovincial migration and temporary international migration. There is no evidence <b>of</b> such <b>an</b> <b>effect</b> for permanent international immigration. Nevertheless, interprovincial migration also results in <b>a</b> spreading <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> Dutch disease from booming to non-booming provinces...|$|R
