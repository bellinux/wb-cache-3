Treatment of S. epidermidis infection is problematic because the organism is usually resistant to many antibiotics.

The aims of this thesis were to investigate and evaluate the susceptibility of isolates of S. epidermidis from various infections to chlorhexidine (CHX) and to <b>other</b> <b>disinfectants</b> such as benzalkonium chloride (BKC), triclosan (TLN) and povidone-iodine (PI). In addition, the mechanisms of resistance of S. epidermidis to chlorhexidine (the original isolates and strains adapted to chlorhexidine by serial passage) were examined and co-resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics investigated. In 3 of the 11 S. epidermidis strains passaged in increasing concentrations of chlorhexidine, resistance to the disinfectant arose (16 -fold). These strains were examined further, each showing stable chlorhexidine resistance. Co-resistance to <b>other</b> <b>disinfectants</b> such as BKC, TLN and PI and changes in cell surface hydrophobicity were observed. Increases in resistance were accompanied by an increase in the proportion of neutral lipids and phospholipids in the cell membrane. This increase was most marked in diphosphatidylglycerol.

Turbidity caused by inorganic minerals is undesirable because its abrasiveness can erode a plumbing sys-tem’s {{pipes and fittings}} and score its valve seats and washers. Turbidity caused by suspended organic mat-ter is objectionable because it can stain sinks and fix-tures and discolor laundered fabrics. Suspended mat-ter can also carry pathogens.

Maintenance and cleaning the denture by brushing and immersing in disinfectant solution is done to eliminate microorganisms. Thermoplastic nylon is widely used as material of choice in constructing partial or full denture instead of acrylic resin heat-cured material. This material is superior due to good esthetic, thinner denture base compared with acrylic resin denture base, and alternative material for patient allergic to acrylic monomer. Based on the findings, immersion in disinfectant solution for 24 hours can increase the rigidity of nylon denture base material. Refer to those, a research was done to discover the effect of chlorhexidine gluconate 0. 2 % and sodium hypochlorite 1 % disinfectant solution to flexural strength of thermoplastic nylon material, bearing in mind that those solution are available abundantly in less price. In this research, it is concluded that flexural strength of thermoplastic nylon is increased in sodium hypochlorite 1 % immersion compared to chlorhexidine gluconate 0. 2 %, aquades immersion, and control group.
