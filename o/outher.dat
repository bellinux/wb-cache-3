This paper considers a vector autoregresslon subject to penodtc structural changes The parameters of a vector autoregress~on are modelled as the outcome of an unobserved d~screte Markov process with unknown transmon probabflmes. The unobserved regmaes, one for each time point, together with the regmae transmon probabilities, are determined m addmon to the vector autoregress~on parameters within each regime A Bayesmn Markov Chain Monte Carlo estlmatmn procedure is developed which efficiently generates the posterior joint density of the parameters and the regimes The complete hkehhood surface ~s generated at the same tnne, cnabhng estnnatlon of posterior model probabdlttes for use in non-nested model selection.

40|$|Most {{stochastic}} corporate models examine only resultant output (specif-ically the surplus), {{and thereby}} divorce the model results from key input model assumptions, {{such as the}} term structure of interest rates. A simple relationship of the economic rate scenarios to the surplus could be a multi-variate regression. However, one drawback of using ordinary least squares regression (OLSR) is that the regression is on {{the mean of the}} surplus results. With insolvency we are concerned with the tail of the distribution of surplus results (i. e., relatively infrequent extreme values) or where the surplus is neg-ative, which may be far from the mean. The second drawback to multivariate regression is that it is very sensitive to outliers. The values of the associated coefficients are severely distorted when an extreme outlier is used within the regression. Koenker and Basset [13] resolve both of these difficulties when they introduce Quantile Regression (QR). As the name implies, QR allows one to conduct a regression on specific conditional quantiles. These specific conditional quantiles can be chosen so that they are located near the region of interest. Also, QR is a robust regression method t. hat reduces or removes the influence of <b>outhers</b> on the regression coefficients.

40|$|Carex humilis is a Eurasian sedge {{extending}} from France {{in the west}} to Manchuria in the east, and from Spain, central Italy and Greece in the south to Poland and central Russia in the north. It is absent from Scandinavia. It is a plant of fully exposed and comparatively dry slopes, preferring a southerly aspect but by no means exclusively so, and in this respect is more akin to C. ornithopoda Willd. than to C. digitata L. (the three are grouped in Section Digitatae Fries). In Britain its headquarters are the chalk downlands where the counties of Wiltshire, Hampshire and Dorset meet, with <b>outhers</b> to the west and north-west on the Carboniferous limestone of the Mendips and of the Avon and Wye gorges. There is a single record, not recently confirmed, from the oolite at Bathampton. As may be seen, C. humilis is always strongly calcicolous, the pH as so far measured in Britain ranging between 7. 3 and 7. 9, with one reading (Crook Peak) at 6. 4. It is difficult to explain why this sedge is absent from the eastern downs. Coombe (1954) has suggested that the pattern is partly dictated by ancient clearances. Wells (1975) conjectures that the plant colonised arable land centuries ago when more favourable climatic cond itions enabled it to set seed more readily than it does now.

50|$|Although the hangings can be legitimately {{traced back}} to actual {{historic}} events, the story most commonly repeated is of less certain origins. The tale goes {{that there was an}} elderly witch called Mother Roades, who lived just outside the neighbouring village of Ravensthorpe. Before she could be arrested and tried for her crimes of sorcery, she died. Her final words told of her friends riding to see her, but that it did not matter because they would meet again in some other place before the month was <b>out.Her</b> friends were thus apprehended riding {{on the back of a}} sow between Guilsborough and Ravensthorpe and were taken into custody and hanged, thus they were all reunited in death. The problem with this story is that, although Agnes Brown remains a constant upon the pig's back, her companions swap names depending on the version being read. Three witches were on the pig, but the potential riders, other than Agnes Brown (who appears as one of the riders in all versions), are: Kathryn Gardiner, Alice Abbott, Alice Harrys and Ioan/Joan Lucas. It would appear from records that all of these accused stood trial together, however the reporting only covers the hangings of one day in 1612, so the fates of the others are not known.|$|E

Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a nightingale, whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as Aëdon's lamentations about her child.

The oocyte development of zebrafish was divided into four stages (primary growth, cortical alveolus-previtellogenic, vitellogenic and mature oocyte). Zebrafish follicles contain only a single layer of granulosa cells that are separated from the oocyte by the vitelline envelope (zona radiata). The follicular epithelium and theca of oocytes in zebrafish differentiates during the primary growth phase. Histological analysis revealed that the zona radiata is formed during the vitellogenic growth stage.
