5|$|The {{bacterium}} can {{be grown}} and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years.

E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species in the fields <b>of</b> <b>biotechnology</b> and microbiology, where it {{has served as the}} host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA.

5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use <b>of</b> <b>biotechnology</b> to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E
