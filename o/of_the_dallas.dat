5|$|Each {{county is}} run by a commissioners' court, {{consisting}} of four elected commissioners (one from each of four precincts drawn based on population) and a county judge elected from all the voters of the county. In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties, the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners' court. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners' court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan; the one exception is the board of trustees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> County department of education (the Harris County trustees were elected on a nonpartisan basis until 1984).|$|E

5|$|In {{his rookie}} season, Nash only managed 10.5 minutes a game, {{but in his}} second season, his playing time {{increased}} significantly and he was even ranked 13th in the league for three-point field-goal percentage. Nevertheless, the Canadian's tenure with the Suns did not last. Nelson had just taken a job as assistant general manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Mavericks under his father, Don Nelson, and convinced him to acquire the under-utilised Nash. Following the 1998 NBA draft, Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange for Martin Müürsepp, Bubba Wells, the draft rights to Pat Garrity and a first-round draft pick (who later {{turned out to be}} future Phoenix teammate Shawn Marion).|$|E

For Nieuwendyk, {{at the time the}} General Manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Stars, the chance to participate in the game was important enough that he chose to overlook the chronic pain in his back when he is on skates. Immensely popular forward Craig Conroy, who retired only {{a few weeks before the}} game, also took part for Calgary.|$|E

5|$|Lewisville {{is served}} mainly by media from the Dallas area, {{but a number}} of niche {{publications}} focus on local news. The Lewisville Enterprise merged with The Lewisville Leader in 1962. The paper's publisher and editor at the time, U.O. Clements, was a staunch conservative, but vociferously supported the racial integration of Lewisville Independent School District, for which he received many anonymous threats from members of the Ku Klux Klan. Clements sold the paper to Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers in 1971. Star Newspapers, which owned the Leader, was purchased by 1013 Communications in 2012. The newspaper is based in Plano, Texas. In 2011, the Lewisville City Council designated the Lewisville portion of Neighborsgo, a weekly section <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Dallas</b> Morning News, as the city's official newspaper of record.|$|E
5|$|Rand's {{contemporary}} admirers included fellow novelists, such as Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L.

Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart of Rush. Rand provided a positive view of business, and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work. John Allison of BB and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas, while Mark Cuban, owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Mavericks, and John P. Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, among others, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had led the}} {{kidnapping}} and torture {{of a black man}} while leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Klan, as Imperial Wizard he publicly discouraged vigilante actions, fearing that they would hinder his attempts to gain political influence. In 1923, Evans presided over the largest Klan gathering in history, attended by over 200,000, and endorsed several successful candidates in 1924 elections. He moved the Klan's headquarters from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., and organized a march of 30,000 members—the largest march in the organization's history—on Pennsylvania Avenue. Evans' efforts notwithstanding, the Klan was buffeted by damaging publicity in the early 1920s, partially because of leadership struggles between Evans and his rivals, which hindered his political efforts. In the 1930s, the Great Depression significantly decreased the Klan's income, prompting Evans to work for a construction company to supplement his pay. He resigned his position with the Klan in 1939, after disavowing anti-Catholicism. He was succeeded by his chief of staff, James A. Colescott. The next year, Evans faced accusations of involvement in a government corruption scandal in Georgia; he was fined $15,000 after legal proceedings.|$|E

5|$|Iginla has {{recorded}} several Gordie Howe hat tricks – a fight, a goal and an {{assist in the}} same game – and as {{it is not an}} official statistic, The Hockey News estimated that as of 2012, he was the active leader with nine. His fights, including one with Tampa Bay Lightning star Vincent Lecavalier in the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, have had a motivating effect on his play and that of his teammates. Iginla has suffered injuries {{as a result of his}} fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with Bill Guerin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Stars. His physical style of play also leads to a greater risk of persistent injuries and penalties. Iginla's truculent style of play has gained approval from hockey commentator Don Cherry.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published on the front page <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and {{is believed to be the}} last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart.|$|E
