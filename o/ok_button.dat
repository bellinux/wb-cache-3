2500|$|The OK and Cancel {{buttons on}} most of the Japanese PlayStation games are {{reversed}} in their North American and European releases. In Japan, the [...] button (maru, right) is used as the <b>OK</b> <b>button,</b> while the [...] button (batsu, wrong) is used as Cancel. North American and European releases have the [...] button or the [...] buttons as the <b>OK</b> <b>button,</b> while either the [...] or the [...] button is used as Cancel (some titles like Xenogears used the [...] button for cancelling actions and selections, along with the PlayStation 2 system browser and the XrossMedia Bar on the PlayStation 3 and the PSP). However, a few games, such as Square's Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VII (which used the [...] button as cancel) and Final Fantasy Tactics, Namco's Ridge Racer Type 4, and Konami's Metal Gear Solid, use the Japanese button layout worldwide. Some other games, like the Japanese version of Gran Turismo, had used different controls that are similar to North American games. These Japanese button layouts still apply to other PlayStation consoles. This is because in the early years Sony America (SCEA), Sony Europe (SCEE), and Sony Japan (SCEJ) had different development and testing documents (TRCs) for their respective territories.|$|E
50|$|Such a {{requirement}} describes {{an interaction between}} an external agent (the user) and the software system. When the user provides input to the system by clicking the <b>OK</b> <b>button,</b> the program responds (or should respond) by closing the dialog window containing the <b>OK</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{the user}} clicks the <b>OK</b> <b>button,</b> the dialog is {{closed and the}} focus is {{returned}} to the main window in the state it was in before this dialog was displayed.|$|E
50|$|State {{management}} {{refers to}} {{the management of the}} state of one or more user interface controls such as text fields, <b>OK</b> <b>buttons,</b> radio buttons, etc. in a graphical user interface. In this user interface programming technique, the state of one UI control depends on the state of other UI controls. For example, a state managed UI control such as a button will be in the enabled state when input fields have valid input values and the button will be in the disabled state when the input fields are empty or have invalid values.|$|R
50|$|The term {{allegedly}} {{received its}} name from a programmer who had coded a modal dialog box in Microsoft Access without either an <b>OK</b> or Cancel <b>button,</b> thereby disabling the entire program whenever the box came up.|$|R
5000|$|Changes to {{this system}} are {{controlled}} by GConfd, a daemon. GConfd watches out for changes to the database, {{and when they are}} changed, it applies the new settings to applications using it. This technology is known as [...] "auto-apply", compared to [...] "explicit-apply", which requires users to press an <b>OK</b> or Apply <b>button</b> to make changes come into effect. The term [...] "instant-apply" [...] is sometimes used, compared to plain [...] "apply".|$|R
50|$|Newer models {{such as the}} LaserJet 600 series {{now include}} a full color LCD display. Two {{directional}} arrow buttons and a <b>Ok</b> <b>button</b> replace the multiple menu navigation buttons of the 4000 series. A numeric keypad and other specialized buttons are also included for job storage, copy, and fax usage on models with those features.|$|E
50|$|The buttons include four corner buttons (Left option, right option, Call, and Return), and a wheel. The {{four sides}} of the wheel behave like a {{direction}} pad in most applications. In the music player, they work as scroll up/down, and next/previous track. The <b>OK</b> <b>button</b> {{in the center of}} the wheel doubles as Pause/Play in the music player.|$|E
5000|$|On {{computer}} keyboards, the {{enter key}} (or the return key on Macs and most Sun Workstations) {{in most cases}} causes a command line, window form, or dialog box to operate its default function. This is typically to finish an [...] "entry" [...] and begin the desired process, and is usually an alternative to pressing an <b>OK</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E

50|$|The W385's {{navigation}} array and keypad buttons take {{cues from}} the Motorola KRZR, {{but instead of}} metal, the controls are covered in a soft-touch material similar to the phone's exterior covering. There is a four-way toggle with a central <b>OK</b> <b>button,</b> two soft keys, a clear button, and the Talk and End/Power controls. There is also a camera shortcut, and the toggle can be programmed to give one-touch access to four user-defined functions. Both the navigation array and the keypad buttons are backlit.|$|E
50|$|Jaguar Land Rover: Driver Condition Monitor and Driver Fatigue Alert, both {{evaluate}} driving {{technique for}} signs of driver fatigue. When the feature determines if the driver is fatigued, the message center displays the warning, TAKE A BREAK!, for 1 minute, accompanied by an audible chime. When driving continues for more than 15 minutes after the first warning, without taking a break, a further warning is given. The warning continues until the <b>OK</b> <b>button</b> {{on the steering wheel}} menu control is pressed.|$|E
50|$|The phone {{also has}} the {{capability}} to display four different themes which may change button styles, background colors, and general style of the phone. These themes are the Classic view, having the red and white menu screen when the <b>OK</b> <b>button</b> is pressed, the Slick Black theme, with a more digital, and of course, black look. There is also the Wall theme, with the menu and other features looking like a concrete wall. The last theme is the wave, a rounded and dark look.|$|E

50|$|On some devices, {{movement}} {{is achieved by}} pressing the phone keys in ordinal directions. Other devices also support touching the screen to move the creature. Certain iPods use the click wheel as an input method, and users of the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPod Nano may use the accelerometer. Creatures are eaten by attacking with the mouth (if the creature has one); group-eating combos can be achieved with the <b>OK</b> <b>button</b> or center button on the wheel. A section is completed after the player eats {{a certain amount of}} DNA material from other life forms.|$|E
5000|$|In the deluxe {{version of}} the first game, the penguin throws up on impact when the player hits him {{high in the air}} and holds down the left or right arrow key. The {{animation}} lasts longer than the time it takes for the sign saying the score, [...] "replay", [...] "highscores" [...] and [...] "OK" [...] to pop up. If you click the <b>OK</b> <b>button</b> before the vomiting animation is complete, the penguin will vomit on impact next time no matter what. Then if you play the replay, the penguin will not vomit on impact with the ground and keep flying unguided.|$|E
5000|$|OK is used {{to label}} buttons in modal dialog boxes such as error {{messages}} or print dialogs, indicating that the user must press the button to accept {{the contents of the}} dialog box and continue. When a modal dialog box contains only one button, it is almost always labeled [...] "OK" [...] by convention and default, usually rendered to the screen in upper case without punctuation: OK, rather than O.K., Okay, or Ok. The <b>OK</b> <b>button</b> can probably be traced to user interface research done for the Apple Lisa. The inspiration was likely the -ok parameter in Unix.|$|E
50|$|The SGH-t639 has a 1.3 {{megapixel}} camera/camcorder {{with a small}} rectangular self-portrait mirror. It has 30 megabytes (MB) {{of phone}} storage and a microSD memory card slot. It operates on T-Mobile, a GSM network, and has a SIM card, {{which can be found}} by removing the battery case. It has a numerical keypad and an <b>OK</b> <b>button</b> surrounded by four navigational arrow keys (which double by leading to call records, voice notes recording, contact list, and new text message respectively), and two soft keys, along with T-Zones (T-Mobile's web browser), call, end/power, clear, and shortcut keys. The customizable shortcut key with the square icon can lead to or open any feature, application, or menu on the phone. On the left side the phone has two up/down volume rocker keys and the combination charger/headphone jack, and on the right has a key that accesses camera mode as well as the microSD memory card slot.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{educational}} software called Eccentric loading is introduced. Eccentric loading, is a user-friendly and yet {{powerful tool for}} the analysis and design of riveted and bolted joints that are subjected to eccentric loads. The user starts the application by specifying his case as compound shear if the load is in {{the plane of the}} fasteners, eccentric loading if the applied load is not in the plane of the rivet or bolts, and general loading if the loading is of amore general type. In all three cases, the user is prompted to select his objective either as Determining the factor of safety, or to find the diameter of the fastener. Fulfilling some of the objectives, further requires the description of the Geometry of the joint, and the specification of the materials, unless the use of the default material is acceptable. Invoking next, the Solve command, which is equivalent to invoking the <b>OK</b> <b>button,</b> the software carries out a series of tedious computations, after which, it presents a comprehensive Report comprising a summary of stresses, joint efficiency and factors of safety, and a detailed summary of the joint geometry and. properties. 1...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{discusses the}} creation of a Javascript bookmarklet {{that can be used in}} any browser to execute a search of library resources from any web page. Many user searches begin with searches on the internet, often in Google and Wikipedia. For users to search the library resources, they first need to locate the library website, find the appropriate search tool or database, and then execute their search. The library at Stevens Institute of Technology is currently undergoing a trial of the Ebsco Discovery service, a federated search tool which integrates library catalog data. To make it easier for students to search the library resources, we created a Javascript bookmarklet that eliminates the step of having to go to the library website first before searching. The bookmarklet provides an important bridge between common search behaviors (especially among undergraduates), and the 2 ̆ 2 deep web 2 ̆ 2 content located in library-funded, proprietary databases, thus easing their transition into scholarly research. The bookmarklet can be dragged-and-dropped into any browser, after which a search can then be initiated from any webpage the user visits. When the bookmarklet is clicked, the search terms default to the title of the page, and a prompt is displayed that allows the user to change the terms. When they press the <b>OK</b> <b>button,</b> the search is automatically executed in the Discovery tool and the results are displayed in a new browser window.
