5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> are alleged.|$|E

5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is an {{exception}} to the general rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to a precedent fact may be regarded as a form of illegality.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{generally}} known facts in litigation with review on some viewpoints accepted in Austrian, German and Croatian jurisprudence and legal practice on this topic. First starting theoretical viewpoint in this research is that the establishment <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> by rules on generally known <b>facts</b> is one <b>of</b> methods for establishment <b>of</b> <b>facts.</b> Regular method for establishment <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> is proving, but it has subordinate nature. Other methods for establishment <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> are application <b>of</b> rules on recognition, on legal presumptions and on burden of proof. Second starting theoretical viewpoint is that the law on establishment <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> has dual legal nature: it has legal protective and procedural aspect. Author discusses on various problems with regard to notion, legal basis and characteristics <b>of</b> generally known <b>facts</b> and on implementation of rules on their establishment in litigation...|$|R

Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E

The simultaneous presence <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and fiction and the cycle of reversal of fortunes presents characters as functional variants of each other. Through frequent use of metonymy, whereby a part replaces a whole, for example, referring to soldiers as uniformes (uniforms), Carpentier shifts the focus from individuals to the collective.|$|E

A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction that Germany would win the war.|$|E

5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> determines did occur.|$|E

40|$|Facts {{are once}} again put to work in {{philosophical}} enterprises. The discussion in this paper is conducted under the presumption that we for this reason need to examine the nature <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> anew. To some extent it has been taken for granted {{that the question of}} properties and particulars is the primary problem to solve, and that the question <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> is secondary. This approach naturally leads to many of the old problems <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> and complexes. By taking facts as truly basic, we should see how we can construct the particulars and universals we still have need for. In order to further this idea, I suggest that facts may be though of as tropes or once-for-all occurrent properties. However, this characterisation <b>of</b> <b>facts</b> is acceptable only if tropes manage without substances or "thin" particulars for their instantiation...|$|R
