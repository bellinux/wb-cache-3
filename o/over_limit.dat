5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an <b>Over</b> <b>Limit</b> meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area of effect. Four Artes can be assigned to each character, and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E

25|$|Law 13: Innings. Before the game, {{the teams}} agree {{whether it is}} to be over one or two innings, and whether either or both innings are to be limited by time or by overs. In practice, these {{decisions}} are likely to be laid down by Competition Regulations, rather than pre-game agreement. In two-innings games, the sides bat alternately unless the follow-on (Law 14) is enforced. An innings is closed once all batsmen are dismissed, no further batsmen are fit to play, the innings is declared or forfeited by the batting captain, or any agreed time or <b>over</b> <b>limit</b> is reached. The captain winning the toss of a coin decides whether to bat or to bowl first.|$|E

25|$|The Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{requires}} that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting {{this as a}} benefit as it may avoid {{the possibility of a}} future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees. Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved <b>over</b> <b>limit</b> transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills {{how long it would take}} them to pay off the balance.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, two batsmen always bat in partnership, {{although}} only one is on strike at any time. The partnership between two batsmen will {{come to an end}} when one of them is dismissed or retires, or the innings comes to a close (usually due to victory being achieved, a declaration, a time or <b>over</b> <b>limit</b> being reached, or the match being abandoned in mid-innings for inclement weather or, exceptionally, dangerous playing conditions). Various statistics may be used to describe a partnership, most notably the number of runs scored during it (either by the batsmen or as extras), the duration of the partnership both in time (usually quoted in minutes) and number of deliveries (balls) faced. Partnerships are often described as being for a particular wicket (for example, a [...] "third wicket partnership", also called a [...] "third wicket stand"—in this context, the [...] "opening partnership" [...] between the two opening batsmen is the [...] "first wicket partnership"). This has the anomalous result that a partnership may be between more than two batsmen, if one of the original batsmen retires hurt but not out, since the particular numbered wicket will not have fallen yet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{score of}} a cricket team whose innings is in {{progress}} is given {{as the number of}} runs they have scored [...] "for" [...] the number of wickets their opponents have taken. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets has a score of [...] "one hundred for three", written 100–3 (also 100/3); The exception to this is in Australia, where it is conventional to reverse the wickets and runs scored, so that what would be written 100–3 elsewhere in the world is written and said 3–100 (or 3/100) in Australia. A team that is dismissed having scored 300 runs is said to have a score of [...] "three hundred all out", rather than [...] "three hundred for ten"; the score for the innings is then simply written 300. However, if a team declare their innings closed (in a First-class match) or reach an <b>over</b> <b>limit</b> (in a limited-overs match), the number of wickets is included in their score for the innings, for example 275–7. A declaration is noted by appending a [...] "d" [...] or [...] "dec" [...] to the score (for example 300–8d); such a score is spoken in the standard form with the word [...] "declared" [...] appended (example: [...] "300 for 8, declared").|$|E
