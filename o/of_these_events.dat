50|$|Another <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>event</b> is the Trans March which {{describes}} annual marches, protests or gatherings {{that take place}} around the world, often taking place {{during the time of}} the local pride week. <b>These</b> <b>events</b> are frequently organized by transgender communities to build community, address human rights struggles, and create visibility.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it would}} seem {{appropriate}} that {{the arrival of a}} volume would be a MediaArrival and the arrival of a non-volume a DeviceArrival, none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>Event</b> types are used for volumes at all (See EventHandler (volume)).|$|R
5|$|Ship – Ships {{can be used}} as {{hospital}} ships, mostly {{operated by}} national military services, although some ships are operated by charities. They can meet the definition of ambulances as they provide transport to the sick and wounded (along with treatment). They are often sent to disaster or war zones to provide care for the casualties <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E
5|$|Szabó {{survived by}} hiding at an orphanage, {{but his father}} died of {{diphtheria}} shortly after the German defeat. Memories <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> would later appear in several of his films.|$|E
5|$|The Amak Volcano has erupted {{three times}} in {{historical}} times: circa 2550 BC, from 1700–1710, and in 1796; the first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> was identified with tephrochronology. Each eruption has been characterized by lava flows, and the two most recent eruptions included a crater eruption.|$|E

5|$|The colonies, {{in spite}} of their differences, united {{themselves}} as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> granting the Second Continental Congress (predecessor to the modern U.S. Congress) sufficient authority and funding to conduct the revolution as a unified whole, including funding and outfitting the military forces that formed {{as a result of this}} campaign.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} of these appearances, on October 28, 1893, Tchaikovsky {{conducted}} the premiere of his Sixth Symphony, along with his First Piano Concerto with Adele aus der Ohe as soloist. Tchaikovsky did not live to conduct the other three concerts, as he died on November 6, 1893. Rimsky-Korsakov stood in for him at the second <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> an all-Tchaikovsky concert in memory of the composer, on December 12, 1893. The program included the Fourth Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, Marche Slave and some solo piano works played by Felix Blumenfeld.|$|E
2500|$|The sports clubs on the {{territory}} of the Town of Kolárovo organise year by year mass sporting events like [...] "Sporting Day of the Town of Kolárovo" [...] and [...] "International Sporting Day of Sister Cities of Kolárovo - Kisbér". The Committee of Sports of the Municipal Parliament is a co-ordinator <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>event</b> organization.|$|R

5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. His understanding <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> was, as he explained, similar to the experiences of biblical prophets. In the commentary to A Vision of the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A Vision of the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 to the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E
30|$|Typical {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>event</b> deposits {{included the}} following: a thickness {{in the order}} of 20 – 25 cm, a wide range of grain sizes and poor sorting, in contrast to underlying and overlying sediments, the presence of several layers, marine sand alternating with poorly sorted mud with terrigenous and anthropogenic components, representing different hy-drodynamic conditions (run-up and backwash phase).|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{codes are}} part of the CEA standard for receiver decoders, but are not listed as being in use by any agencies in the United States. Environment Canada lists these codes as being [...] "for future implementation". None <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>event</b> codes are being implemented in Mexico, as Mexico's network is for seismic and volcanic alerts at this time.|$|R

5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) {{occurs in the}} late summer, and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being born the following spring to summer. The seasonality <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} struck Galveston, destroying {{much of the}} city. That and another storm in 1915 shifted much of the focus from investors away from Galveston and toward nearby Houston, which {{was seen as a}} safer location for commercial operations. Because <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> the coming oil boom became heavily centered on the city of Houston both as a port and a commercial center.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> both the Spartans and their opponents {{prepared}} for more serious fighting to come. In late 395 BC, Corinth and Argos entered {{the war as}} co-belligerents with Athens and Thebes. A council was formed at Corinth to manage the affairs of this alliance. The allies then sent emissaries {{to a number of}} smaller states and received the support of many of them.|$|E

5|$|Mirroring {{the role}} that track and field events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is {{featured}} within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among {{some of the first}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{transient}} lunar phenomena {{range from}} foggy patches to permanent {{changes of the}} lunar landscape. Cameron classifies these as (1) gaseous, involving mists {{and other forms of}} obscuration, (2) reddish colorations, (3) green, blue or violet colorations, (4) brightenings, and (5) darkening. Two extensive catalogs of transient lunar phenomena exist, with the most recent tallying 2,254 events going back to the 6th century. Of the most reliable <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> at least one-third come from the vicinity of the Aristarchus plateau.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years. This is much higher than the actual observed rate, implying that a portion <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>events</b> have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that can observe across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event will almost certainly be detected.|$|E
