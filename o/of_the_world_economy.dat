25|$|Under British rule, India's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>economy</b> {{declined}} from 24.4% in 1700 down to 4.2% in 1950.

At the same time, the United Kingdom's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>economy</b> rose from 2.9% in 1700 up to 9% in 1870. The British East India Company, following their conquest of Bengal in 1757, had forced open the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed, while in Britain protectionist policies such as bans and high tariffs were implemented to restrict Indian textiles from being sold there, whereas raw cotton was imported from India without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton and sold {{them back to the}} Indian market. British economic policies gave them a monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources. India served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a large captive market for British manufactured goods.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> term <b>of</b> deglobalization has {{derived from}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very {{profound}} change in many developed nations, where trade as {{a proportion of}} total economic activity went down between 1914 and 1970s.

25|$|As {{the world}} becomes more closely linked through economics, politics, technology, and culture (a process called globalization), cities {{have come to}} play {{a leading role in}} {{transnational}} affairs, exceeding the limitations of international relations conducted by national governments.

Today the information economy based on high-speed internet infrastructure enables instantaneous telecommunication around the world, effectively eliminating the distance between cities for the purposes of stock markets and other high-level elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>economy,</b> as well as personal communications and mass media.|$|E
25|$|U.S. President George H. W. Bush responded {{cautiously}} for {{the first}} several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets. On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region. The invasion immediately triggered fears that the world's price of oil, and therefore control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>economy,</b> was at stake. Britain profited heavily from {{billions of dollars of}} Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who {{happened to be in the}} U.S. at the time.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1940s, the Soviet economy had become {{relatively}} self-sufficient; {{for most of}} the period until the creation of Comecon, only a very small share of domestic products was traded internationally. After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly. Still the influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>economy</b> on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade. Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s. During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the Third World. Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{experience}} of economic instability throughout the 1990s, and {{the implementation of a}} free travel agreement with the EU, a great number of Romanians emigrated to Western Europe and North America, with particularly large communities in Italy and Spain. In 2008, the Romanian diaspora was estimated to be at over twomillion people. The cyclical nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>economy</b> and economic disparities between Romania and advanced European economies has fueled further emigration from the country. The emigration has caused social changes in Romania, whereby the parents would leave for Western Europe to escape poverty and provide a better standard of living for their children, who have been left behind. Some children are left {{to be taken care of}} by grandparents and relatives; and some live alone, if the parents deem them to be reasonably self-sufficient.

500|$|Large {{volumes of}} Arab petrodollars were {{invested}} directly in US Treasury securities {{and in other}} financial markets of the major industrial economies, often directed discreetly by government entities now known as sovereign wealth funds. Many billions of petrodollars were also invested through the major commercial banks of the US and Europe. In fact, the process contributed {{to the growth of}} the Eurodollar market as a less-regulated rival to US monetary markets. As the recessionary condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>economy</b> made investment in corporations less attractive, bankers and well-financed governments lent much of the money directly to the governments of developing countries, especially in Latin America such as Brazil and Argentina as well as other major developing nations like Turkey. The 1973 oil crisis had created a vast dollar shortage in these countries; however, they still needed to finance their imports of oil and machinery. In early 1977, when Turkey stopped heating its prime minister's office, opposition leader Suleyman Demirel famously described the shortage as: [...] "Turkey is in need of 70cents." [...] As political journalist William Greider summarized the situation: [...] "Banks collected the deposits of revenue-rich OPEC governments and lent the money to developing nations so they could avoid bankruptcy." [...] In subsequent decades, many of these developing nations found their accumulated debts to be unpayably large, concluding that it was a form of neocolonialism from which debt relief was the only escape.|$|E
