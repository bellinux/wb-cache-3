5|$|The Big Bang as {{the origin}} of the {{universe}}: <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was {{the origin of}} the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E

5|$|John Slade was a grain merchant, {{who claimed}} that Humphrey Morley had agreed to buy a crop of wheat and rye from him, paying £16, and had reneged on the agreement. He brought the case before the Assizes in 1596, where it was heard by two judges; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> Pleas, {{and one of the}} King's Bench. It was heard under assumpsit, and the jury found that Morley indeed owed Slade money. Before a {{judgment}} could be issued, Popham had the case transferred to an older version of the Court of Exchequer Chamber, which, sitting in Serjeant's Inn, allowed the King's Bench judges to sit.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the atomic}} radii (e.g. in Fig. 4) are only {{slightly}} less than the distance between bonded atoms, the iconic spheres intersect, and in the CPK models, this was achieved by planar truncations along the bonding directions, the section being circular. When raster graphics became affordable, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> approaches was to replicate CPK models in silico. It is relatively straightforward to calculate the circles of intersection, but more complex to represent a model with hidden surface removal. A useful side product is that a conventional value for the molecular volume can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|First, {{he points}} to {{economic}} freedom. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> threads of logic in aid is that countries need to develop economically in order to rise from poverty. On this, {{there is not a}} ton of debate. However, Sachs contends that Easterly, and many other neo-Liberal economists believe high levels of economic freedom in these emerging markets is almost a necessity to development. Sachs himself does not believe this. He cites the lack of correlation between the average degrees of Economic Freedom in countries and their yearly GDP growth, which in his data set is completely inconclusive.|$|E

25|$|One {{of the few}} {{elements}} to survive from the mid-12th-century church, the Portail royal was integrated into the new cathedral built after the 1194 fire. Opening on to the parvis (the large square {{in front of the}} cathedral where markets were held), the two lateral doors would have been the first entry point for most visitors to Chartres, as it remains today. The central door is only opened for the entry of processions on major festivals, of which the most important is the Adventus or installation of a new bishop. The harmonious appearance of the façade results in part from the relative proportions of the central and lateral portals, whose widths are in the ratio 10:7 – <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> medieval approximations of the square root of 2.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> {{misconceptions about}} United States history {{prior to the}} Civil War {{is that all the}} {{citizens}} of the northern states were against slavery. In fact, many Northerners were all for slavery, especially in states closer to the Confederacy like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Delaware. There were more than a few abolitionists in Pennsylvania: Enos Hawley, a Quaker citizen of Muncy, {{was one of the most}} prominent abolitionists in Lycoming County. Hawley, a tanner by trade, was like most Quakers a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery. Hawley invited the now-unknown speaker to come to Muncy to speak against slavery. This speaker arrived in April 1842. His arrival and coinciding speech set off a tremendous riot that led to the near destruction of a local schoolhouse and the controversial pardoning of the rioters by Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter.|$|E
25|$|Nakula and Sahadeva {{are said}} to be skilled swordsmen in Mahabharata. Sword-{{fighting}} is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> Indian fighting arts. Varieties include the curved single-edge sword, the straight double-edge sword, the two-handed longsword, the gauntlet-sword, and the urumi or flexible sword. Techniques differ from one state to another but all make extensive use of circular movements, often circling the weapon around the user's head. The flexible nature and light weight of Indian swords allows for speed but provides little defensive ability, so that the swordsman must instead rely on body maneuvers to dodge attacks. Entire systems exist focusing on drawing the sword out of the opponent's body. Stances and forms traditionally made up the early training before students progress to free sparring with sticks to simulate swords in an exercise called gatka, although this term is more often used in English when referring to the Panjabi-Sikh fighting style. A common way to practice precision-cutting is to slice cloves or lemons, eventually doing so while blindfolded. Pairing two swords of equal length, though considered impractical {{in some parts of the}} world, is common and was considered highly advantageous in South Asia.|$|E

Lindenmueller had more than one million of his one-cent tokens struck and placed into circulation in 1863. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> uses for the token was for streetcar fare. The Third Avenue Railroad company of New York, which had willingly accepted a large quantity of the Lindenmueller tokens in lieu of actual currency, asked Lindenmueller to redeem them.
