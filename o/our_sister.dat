The majority of scholars argue {{that the use of}} any stereotype, whether positive or negative, is a hindrance to the advancement of the targeted group. Scott B. Vickers wrote, [...] "the use of any stereotype in the portrayal of Indians is considered... to be contributory to their dehumanization and deracination." [...] The national organizations representing several academic disciplines, after reviewing the research done on the issue, have passed resolutions calling for the end of all Native American mascots and images in sports. These include the Society of Indian Psychologists (1999), the American Counseling Association (2001), the American Psychological Association (2005), the American Sociological Association (2007). and the American Anthropological Association (2015). The executive board of the nation's leading organization of scholars of U.S. history approved a resolution in April 2015: [...] "The Organization of American Historians hereby adds its voice to the growing demands by Native American organizations, <b>our</b> <b>sister</b> disciplines, and conscientious people of all ethnic backgrounds, to change the name and logo of the Washington 'Redskins'." ...|$|E

[...] Hutchinson was accused of numerous theological errors of which only four were covered during the first day, so the trial was scheduled to continue the following week, when Wilson took an active part in the proceedings. [...] During this second day of interrogation a week later, Hutchinson read a carefully written recantation of her theological errors. [...] Had the trial ended there, she would have likely remained in communion with the church, with the possibility of even returning there some day. [...] Wilson, however, did not accept this recantation, and he re-opened a line of questioning from the previous week. [...] With this, a new onslaught began, and when later given the opportunity, Wilson said, [...] "... your errors...is the slightinge of Gods faythfull Ministers and contenminge and cryinge down them as Nobodies." [...] Hugh Peter chimed in, followed by Thomas Shepard, and then Wilson spoke again, [...] "I cannot but reverence and adore the wise hand of God...in leavinge <b>our</b> <b>sister</b> to pride and Lyinge."
