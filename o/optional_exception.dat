The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, {{as they were in}} IEEE 754-1985.|$|E

The press release says Fiji {{supported}} China’s proposition, both countries agree that for sovereignty and maritime rights, parties should {{be committed to}} peaceful settlement and <b>optional</b> <b>exceptions</b> of the Convention should be respected.

China made declaration {{in accordance with}} the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in 2006 not to accept any of the procedures provided for in section 2 of Part XV of the Convention. Many countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, France, Canada, and Spain made similar declarations to reject any of the procedures provided for in sections 2 of Part XV of the Convention with respect to the different categories of disputes.|$|R

50|$|When {{goods are}} {{imported}} into the EU from a non-EU territory, {{they are generally}} subject to a VAT (currently 20% in the UK for most goods). However, {{as a result of}} EU Council Directive 2009/132/EC, an <b>optional</b> <b>exception</b> is allowed on shipments of a low value to speed up the transit of low value goods which might otherwise be delayed by customs and also reduce the cost of tax collection where it might not be practicable. This administrative relief is known as low-value consignment relief (LVCR). Member states which allow the relief must ensure that it does not cause competitive distortion or allow VAT abuse.|$|E

5000|$|Valencian and Spanish are the {{official}} languages of Valencia. Spanish is {{the official}} language of the Spanish state, while Valencian is the language considered by the Statute of Autonomy as llengua pròpia ("own language" [...] or [...] "language proper" [...] to the territory). Valencian is traditionally spoken in the densely populated coastal areas rather than inland, where many places have Spanish as their traditional language, also those areas incorporated into the provinces of Alicante and Valencia at their creation in 1833 and which did not form part of the historical Kingdom of Valencia. Consequently, the 1984 Law on the [...] "Use and Education of Valencian" [...] defines certain municipalities as [...] "predominantly Spanish-speaking", and allows them some few <b>optional</b> <b>exceptions</b> as to official use of Valencian, even though {{the right to use}} and to receive education in Valencian is guaranteed by the Statute of Autonomy (Art. 6.2) anywhere in Valencia.|$|R

40|$|UNCLOS (UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} constitutive instruments in international law. It represents the creation and codification of a substantial body of law that impacts on a variety of economic, political, military, and social interests of States, international organizations, companies, and individuals. Every State, landlocked or coastal, relies on the oceans as a supply of resources as well as for communication and security, and can thus benefit from the way that this global resource is regulated. The rights and obligations embodied in UNCLOS affect the decisions and relationships of all States. While the Convention is firmly grounded in traditional principles of the law of the sea, it also marks important developments in ocean use (the clearest examples being the institution of the EEZ, the creation of the transit passage regime, and a special international regime for the exploration and exploitation of the deep seabed). This book has focused on one particularly unusual feature in UNCLOS: the inclusion of a compulsory dispute settlement system as an integral feature of the Convention. When States become parties to the Convention, as over 140 States are, they also take the unique step of agreeing to mandatory jurisdiction for certain disputes relating to the interpretation and application of this instrument.

25|$|European {{directives}} {{are generally}} not directly enforceable in EU member states. They first have to be transposed into local law, generally {{by an act of}} the legislature of the member state. While they give a general framework and impose some options they may leave significant leeway: in the case of EUCD, for instance, the directive gives a list of <b>optional</b> copyright <b>exceptions,</b> and mandates appropriate legal protection for DRMs, without defining what constitutes an appropriate protection. Member states have to transpose directives within reasonable delays, or they face action by the European Commission. There may be subsequent litigation before the European Court of Justice if subsequent the implementation is deemed to be inadequate.|$|R
