5|$|Frank Williams was recaptured and {{was sent}} to a new camp without news of Judy's survival. However, stories began being told of a dog helping {{drowning}} men reach pieces of debris on which to hold, and others recalled how the dog would bring them flotsam to keep them afloat. The dog would also allow men to hold <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> while swimming them to safety. She had been found in the water by other survivors of the sinking, and once again hidden from the Japanese. Upon arrival at a dock, she was found by Les Searle who tried to smuggle her onto a truck with him. However, she was discovered by a Japanese Captain who threatened to kill her – whose order was countermanded by the newly arrived former Commander of the Medan camp and she was allowed to travel with Searle onto the new camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Edge, and Triple H. As the match began, Edge chose to stand outside the ring, hoping that Cena and Triple H would simply fight the match themselves. Cena and Triple H, however, teamed up and turned against Edge. One spot in the match saw Edge catapult Triple H into the steel ringpost, which made Triple H bleed. Afterwards, Edge executed an Edgecution onto an announce table on Triple H and then focused on Cena. Cena, however, locked Edge in the STFU, but was broken when Triple H hit Cena {{in the head with}} a microphone. Triple H then went after Edge and hit him with a chair, sending him over the security wall and into the audience. Lita, who accompanied Edge, entered the ring with a chair to hit Triple H, but Triple H reversed it into a Spinebuster, a move where the wrestler lifts the opponent, turning 180°, and then tosses her forward <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> Near the end of the match, Cena attempted an FU on Edge but Triple H delivered a low blow to Cena, which made Cena drop Edge out of the ring and attempted to execute a Pedigree. Cena, however, countered it into a jackknife roll-up. Cena won the match and successfully retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Triple H hit Cena, Edge, and the referee with a sledgehammer, and performed his signature taunt until performing his signature DX cross chops, receiving a standing ovation from the audience, closing the show.|$|E

50|$|A handstand {{variation}} {{can also}} be used. With the opponent seated on the top turnbuckle facing the ring, the wrestler performs a handstand on the bottom turnbuckle, wrapping his or her shins or feet {{around the neck of}} the opponent. The wrestler then bends his or her legs forward towards the ring, pulling the opponent over and flipping him or her down to the mat <b>onto</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> Former WWE wrestler Trish Stratus used this variation of the move as one of her signatures, calling it the Stratusphere.|$|R

Shozaburo falls in love with Orui and elopes with her to the countryside, leaving behind his fiancee, Okita.|$|E
50|$|The {{timing of}} the {{breeding}} season among jaguarundis is unclear; they breed all year round. Oestrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and spraying urine. After a gestation period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover.|$|E

The mother will raise her forelegs to facilitate the release of the young, which will then climb <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> where they will remain until the first moult (approximately six days). After that, the scorplings will start to wander around the surrounding area but will remain together close to the hiding place for a few days. The young scorpions will reach adulthood after one or two years.|$|E
50|$|Luke Kenny {{decided to}} focus the {{downtime}} into compiling all the footage he had recorded of the band, producing a DVD titled The Principles and Practices of The Berzerker. This DVD ended up being over four hours long, consisting of one professionally shot show, another concert-worth of assorted bootleg footage, backstage recordings, band rehearsals, and touring. Also included was documentary-style footage of the recording of both albums (including many unflattering incidents), full interviews with band members, {{the making of the}} masks and artwork, and contributions from fans, including one who had tattooed the dragon logo <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> The DVD was recommended by Kerrang! for aspiring metal bands.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{motorcade}} {{turned the corner}} onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard what she {{thought to be a}} motorcycle backfiring and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent Clint Hill later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of her husband's skull that had been blown off. Hill ran to the car and leapt <b>onto</b> it, directing <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to <b>her</b> seat. As Hill stood on the back bumper, Associated Press photographer Ike Altgens snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world. She would later testify that she saw pictures [...] "of me climbing out the back. But I don't remember that at all".|$|R

50|$|The ropes or {{chains are}} {{threaded}} through {{holes in the}} table and the ends given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and hold them that way throughout the illusion. The assistant is thus pulled down <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and secured in that position. Two halves of a large box are presented and fixed in place over the assistant, covering her completely. Side panels are opened to show the assistant is still in place lying flat on her back. The assistant is then divided into two. Sometimes the division is accomplished merely by pushing two metal dividing panels into slots near where the two halves meet.|$|E
50|$|Merida has long, wild, curly, red hair, blue eyes, {{pale skin}} and a slender body. Her main outfit is a dark teal {{traditional}} gown, made of cotton, with stylish slits for movement during archery. When the Lords arrive for the games, she {{is dressed in a}} Medieval-style turquoise silk gown with long arms, gold trimmings, and gold beading, teamed with a white wimple to hold in her hair.

She loaded up a sled with the few {{supplies}} she had, bundled her infant <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> and began the 40 mile walk to Padlei with the children. After a few days she met Yahah, Hallow's brother, and she followed him to his camp. She waited there while her brother-in-law went to Padlei. After five days, without food, and no sign of Yahah, she and the children resumed the trek. After a few more days, {{she was unable to}} continue with all the children and left Annecatha and Nesha, both under age 10, wrapped in caribou skin, in an igloo she made with a frying pan.|$|E
5000|$|During the night, Anita teaches Red {{that her}} blackouts {{are caused by}} her belief that the wolf is an invader; by instead {{recognizing}} the wolf as herself, she can retain control. In the morning, Red remembers the entire experience {{and is no longer}} afraid. Snow later arrives, having tracked Red. Red persuades Anita that Snow is not a threat, and informs Snow that she's going to stay with her [...] "pack" [...] and her mother, a decision Snow regretfully accepts. However, the queen's men then arrive and kill Quinn before being killed by the werewolves. Anita holds Snow responsible and tells Red to kill her. When Red refuses, Anita turns into a wolf in order to do it herself. Red also transforms and inadvertently kills Anita by knocking <b>her</b> <b>onto</b> a skewer. Snow places the red cloak <b>onto</b> Red, changing <b>her</b> <b>back</b> into <b>her</b> human form. Red apologizes to her mother, who says Red chose Snow, but Red explains that she chose herself and is not a killer. Red and Snow bury Anita, and Red tells Snow that she didn't lose her family; she protected it, because Snow was the only person who truly accepted both aspects of her dual nature.|$|R
50|$|A newborn {{pangolin}} {{weighs about}} 93 g, its length is about 45 cm. The Chinese pangolin reproduces in April and May {{when the weather}} warms. The young also have scales; however, they remain very soft {{for at least two}} days, then harden. Although the young pangolin can walk on its first day, the mother carries it on <b>her</b> <b>back</b> or tail. If the mother feels threatened, she immediately folds <b>her</b> baby <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> belly {{with the help of her}} tail. Male pangolins have been observed allowing the female and baby to share his burrow.|$|R
50|$|A male courts {{a female}} by dancing side-to-side, {{forequarters}} held high, displaying his elongated antennae and vibrating his elongated forelegs. A receptive female responds by spreading her forelegs {{to contact the}} male's long forelegs. The male somersaults over her forequarters and flips over to land on <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and lock <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> genitals. After several minutes of copulation, the female ejects {{a large part of}} the semen and swallows it. Such behaviour seems to correlate with the success of fertile egg production. Given such elaborate behavioural and morphological adaptations, waltzing flies are of interest as a model system for studying of the evolution of sexual dimorphism.|$|R
5000|$|Su-kyoung {{meanwhile}} has locked herself {{inside her}} room {{for days and}} refuses to see anyone. Her mother calls Yoon-hee and Hyeon-su to come and help. Su-kyoung lets Hyeon-su in and she tells her {{that there is something}} wrong with her face and that she can't help wanting to mess it up. Su-kyoung hears a voice say [...] "pretty" [...] and fearfully forces Hyeon-su out. The ghost girl appears and evilly says [...] "I'll make you pretty." [...] Su-kyoung's face begins to violently cut open. Hyeon-su and the other women manage to enter the room after Su-kyoung's screaming stops. Hyeon-su finds the dead Su-kyoung face down and flips her <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> revealing her face, now cut off on one side.|$|E
50|$|In Bath, {{a middle-aged}} woman's fourth husband falls ill during sex and dies soon after. The wife quickly decides {{to marry a}} young student, {{literally}} running from her late husband's funeral in one wing of a cathedral to her wedding in another wing. On their wedding night, the wife of Bath's fifth husband reads to her from a book denouncing the evils of women. The wife of Bath demands that he not tell her about her own business, and destroys the book. Her husband pushes her away, and she falls <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> and moans on the floor. When he leans over to comfort her, however, she bites his nose. This episode {{is derived from the}} prologue to the Wife of Bath's Tale rather than the tale itself.|$|E
5000|$|Indris reach sexual {{maturity}} {{between the ages}} of 7 and 9. Females bear offspring every two to three years, with a gestation period around 120-150 days. The single infant is usually born in May or June. The mother is the primary caregiver, though the father assists, remaining with his mate and offspring. [...] Infants are born mostly or completely black and begin to show white coloration (if any) between four and six months of age. The infant clings to its mother's belly until it is four or five months old, at which time it is ready to move <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> The indri begins to demonstrate independence at eight months, but it will not be fully independent from its mother until it is at least two years old.|$|E
2500|$|The {{woman can}} lie on <b>her</b> <b>back</b> with <b>her</b> hips {{on the edge}} of a {{platform}} such as a bed, table, kitchen bench, desk, etc. while the man penetrates her while standing. The woman can move her body freely. She can dangle her legs over the edge or raise them to any height or manner mentioned above. The woman can rest her legs on the man or he can hold them or separate them. The woman has a greater ability to move her pelvis and to arch <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> and the man can raise, support or [...] restrict the movement of her pelvis. The woman is not weighed down by the man's weight. This position, sometimes called the butterfly position, adds variety to the angle and depth of penetration and generally enables the man to withdraw and then fully thrust the penis, with faster and more forceful thrusts. The downside of this position is that the angle of penetration results in reduced clitoral stimulation, and the woman may need direct clitoral fingering, either by herself or by the man, to achieve orgasm. Alternatively, the woman may either arch <b>her</b> <b>back</b> or raise <b>her</b> torso <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> elbows or arms to reduce the angle and enhance clitoral stimulation. Also, prior to and after the man's orgasm, the man may need to lie down on the woman.|$|R
5000|$|Heartbroken, Tippy sniffles, {{but then}} angrily demands from Treble and Bass a {{replacement}} coin {{for the one}} they made her lose. When both musicians come up empty handed, Tippy insists she take one of Treble's violins and Bass's iron cup {{in an attempt to}} get <b>her</b> money <b>back</b> by playing solo. She then tunes the violin and begins to play it like a true virtuoso, prompting a passing pedestrian to drop a large bag of gold coins <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> cup.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> arrival <b>back</b> on Earth {{had been}} noticed: Jade and Kabala {{contacted}} her psychically, telling her of {{their intention to}} kill her, and Rath too began to track her. Realising she {{was too weak to}} fight them, Purgatori stowed away on a freighter and made <b>her</b> way <b>back</b> to Alexandria, hoping to confront her enemies on home turf. She was ambushed by Jade, who mindprobed her to find out what both she and Kabala wanted to know - why they had been made into vampires. Purgatori managed to force an image of Lucifer <b>onto</b> <b>her,</b> a vision that horrified Jade and knocked her off-guard. Purgatori drank her blood but lost it almost immediately when Rath chose that very moment to attack, draining her of her newly acquired power and taking her to be interrogated.|$|R
50|$|During {{breeding}} season, usually {{during the}} warmer months, a male pigeon will court the female by puffing out his chest, bobbing {{his head and}} strutting in circles around her, all the while cooing his affections. If she accepts, she will allow him <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> in order to copulate. After mating, the male will build a nest out of gathered sticks in a suitable crevice, while the female watches and makes changes. Urban birds will gladly use a roof on a building. The female will usually lay two eggs. The first egg would be laid late in the evening, and the other egg forty hours after, which will hatch in 17 to 20 days, depending on the weather. Both parents aid in rearing the nestlings. Fledglings usually leave the nest around four to five weeks after hatching.|$|E

50|$|Banes' first work, A Day in the Life of the Mind: Part 2, {{was created}} in {{collaboration}} with dancer Ellen Mazer. It was a day-long performance beginning at the lagoon in Hyde Park and ending at a popular local bar, Jimmy's. The audience followed the performers from the lagoon and down 57th Street while listening to a Charlie Parker record on repeat and having soy beans thrown at them. On the way, the performance traveled through Banes' apartment, conveniently located on 57th Street, where they were greeted by her grandmother. They exited <b>onto</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> porch and continued on. When it became dark nightgown-clad dancers appeared in the large lighted windows of the Regenstein Library as the performance continued to its end at Jimmy's. This work {{was meant to be}} a celebration of Hyde Park as well as the blurring lines between everyday life and art.|$|E
