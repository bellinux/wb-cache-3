5|$|Born to Irish immigrants, Talbot was {{minimally}} educated, {{working in}} textile mills {{from an early}} age. He entered into a partnership with his brother, founding the Talbot Mills of Billerica in 1857. He became politically active, partly due to issues with the mills, and served two terms as Lieutenant Governor, acting as Governor {{for part of the}} second term after Governor William B. Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his veto <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race. He was more successful in 1878 against divided opposition, serving a single lackluster term.|$|E
5|$|Castles remain highly popular attractions: in 2009 nearly 2.4million people {{visited the}} Tower of London, 1.2 million visited Edinburgh Castle, 559,000 visited Leeds Castle and 349,000 visited Dover Castle. Ireland, which {{for many years}} had not {{exploited}} the tourist potential of its castle heritage, began to encourage more tourists in the 1960s and 1970s and Irish castles are now a core part of the Irish tourist industry. British and Irish castles are today also {{closely linked to the}} international film industry, with tourist visits to castles now often involving not simply a visit to an historic site, but also a visit to the location <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> film.|$|E

5|$|The kabosy (or kabosa) is a four to six-stringed simple guitar {{common in}} the {{southern}} Highlands moving toward the east, particularly among the Betsimisaraka and Betsileo ethnic groups. The soundbox, which is typically square or rectangular today, was originally circular in form, first made from a tortoise shell and later from wood carved into a rounded shape. Mandolina and gitara are the Antandroy names <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> Southern chordophone similar to the kabosy but with nylon fishing line for strings and five or seven movable frets that facilitate modification of the instrument's tuning.|$|E

5|$|Between 1913 and 1916, Gerhard Heilmann {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society, all heavily illustrated and dealing with the question of the origin of birds. He first proposed the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> treatise on bird evolution in 1912 to Otto Helms, the editor of the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society. Helms supported the idea but recommended that Heilmann first seek professional advice on the topic. Despite the lack of formal training in zoology, Heilmann succeeded in amassing his research with the help of several others, including the expert in prehistoric animals at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, Adolf Herluf Winge, and the biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson of the University of Dundee. Winge, though initially showing interest in Heilmann's work, later proved {{to be a source of}} frustration by refusing to engage Heilmann in depth on various scientific queries. Heilmann eventually broke off contact, expressing some bitterness at the apparent change of heart, which Heilmann later ascribed to Winge's belief in Lamarckism.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of the 19th century, Madagascar was largely {{under the control of the}} Kingdom of Imerina, with its royal palaces at its capital in Antananarivo. Although the kingdom had existed since the early 16th century, it {{expanded}} its control beyond its traditional borders in the 1820s under King Radama I, who the British government officially recognized as the sovereign over the entire island of Madagascar. After several failed attempts to impose its authority over the island, France used military force to capture the royal palace in September 1894 and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony upon officially colonizing the island in February 1895. Queen Ranavalona III was allowed to remain as a figurehead until the emergence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> uprising, termed the Menalamba rebellion, for which the queen was held responsible. The rebellion was harshly crushed and the queen was exiled in 1897.|$|E

5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros called Saavedra and Martín Rodríguez, and {{requested}} their military {{support in the}} case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> rebellion. They refused to give such support, and Saavedra argued that Cisneros should resign because the Junta of Seville that had appointed him did not exist anymore. As a result, Cisneros gave in to the request of Juan José Castelli: to celebrate an open cabildo, an extraordinary meeting of the noteworthy peoples of the city, and discuss the situation. The next day an armed mob, led by Antonio Beruti and Domingo French, occupied the Plaza to demand {{the making of the}} open cabildo, doubting that Cisneros would actually allow it. Saavedra addressed the crowd and assured them that the Regiment of Patricians supported their claims.|$|E
5|$|Diary of a Camper {{is a short}} American film {{made using}} id Software's 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake, {{released}} in 1996. It was created by United Ranger Films, then a subdivision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> group of video game players, or clan, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the Internet as a non-interactive game demo file. The video is generally considered the first known example of machinima—the art of using real-time, virtual 3D environments, often game engines, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone camper, a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces {{five members of the}} Rangers clan in a deathmatch, a type of multiplayer game in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years {{as shown by the}} numerous scarabs bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.|$|E
5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{if there was}} a {{formally}} established constitution dictating the laws, organization, and divisions of power in ancient Macedonia's government, although some tangential evidence suggests this. The king (basileus) served as the head of state and was assisted by his noble companions (hetairoi) and royal pages. The Macedonian kings had command over certain natural resources such as gold from mining and timber from logging. They were also expected to serve as high priests of the nation, using their wealth to sponsor various religious cults. The ancient Macedonian army arguably exercised its authority in matters such as the royal succession when there was no clear heir apparent. The army upheld some of the functions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> assembly, a democratic institution which otherwise existed in only a handful of municipal governments within the Macedonian commonwealth, the Koinon of Macedonians. The Macedonian kings served as the commanders-in-chief of Macedonia's armed forces, while it was common for them to personally lead troops into battle.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power was}} {{considered}} an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation of electricity and was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent. In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing nuclear power.|$|E
5|$|Okay Africa {{wrote that}} by its second year, the fair had become Europe's {{foremost}} contemporary African art fair, and Naomi Rea of Artnet News {{called it a}} necessary visit during the London Frieze Art Fair. In New York, Ben Davis of Artnet wrote that 1:54 NY was a highlight of the city's art fair week. Critics had typically questioned whether art fairs with narrow geographic scope like 1:54 highlight or ostracize minority artists. A gallery owner from Seattle saw the fair as a route for further integration into larger markets. Artnet Davis expressed distaste at the art fair trend of lumping artists by their geographic region and generalizing trends based on its parts, but nonetheless considered important 1:54's representation of Africa. Critics initially noted the fair's lack of African gallery representation, but cited justification including the African art scene's nascent state and the continent's history of political instability, which affects both overseas trade and gallery security. At the 2015 New York show, reviewers noted elements including the predominantly white gallery exhibition staff and the marquee display <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>popular</b> artist at a fair for marginal artists.|$|E
