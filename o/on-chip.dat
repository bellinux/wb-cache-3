25|$|USB {{mass storage}} {{controller}} a small microcontroller {{with a small}} amount of <b>on-chip</b> ROM and RAM.|$|E
25|$|Chip or FPGA based designs {{sometimes}} use SPI {{to communicate}} between internal components; <b>on-chip</b> real estate {{can be as}} costly as its on-board cousin.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the need}} for high {{programming}} and erasing voltages, virtually all flash chips today require only a single supply voltage, and produce the high voltages using <b>on-chip</b> charge pumps.|$|E
25|$|In {{spacecraft}} {{and other}} high-radiation environments, the <b>on-chip</b> charge pump {{is the first}} part of the flash chip to fail, although flash memories will continue to work in read-only mode at much higher radiation levels.|$|E
25|$|By {{combining}} nanotechnology with landscape ecology, {{a habitat}} landscape can be nanofabricated <b>on-chip</b> {{by building a}} collection of nanofabricated bacterial habitats, and connecting them by corridors in different topological arrangements and with nano-scale channels providing them with the local ecosystem service of habitat renewal. These landscapes of MHPs {{can be used as}} physical implementations of an adaptive landscape: by generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in space and time. The patchy nature of these fluidic landscapes allows for the study of adapting bacterial cells in a metapopulation system operating <b>on-chip</b> within a synthetic ecosystem. The metapopulation biology and evolutionary ecology of these bacterial systems, in these synthetic ecosystems, can be addressed using experimental biophysics.|$|E
25|$|By this point, the four-year-old Athlon EV6 bus {{architecture}} had scaled to its limit. To maintain or exceed {{the performance of}} Intel's newer processors would require a significant redesign. The K7 derived Athlons were replaced in March 2003 by the Athlon 64 family, which featured an <b>on-chip</b> memory controller and a completely new HyperTransport bus to replace EV6.|$|E
25|$|The later {{evolution}} of the 68000 focused on more modern embedded control applications and <b>on-chip</b> peripherals. The 68EC000 chip and SCM68000 core expanded the address bus to 32 bits, removed the M6800 peripheral bus, and excluded the MOVE from SR instruction from user mode programs. In 1996, Motorola updated the standalone core with fully static circuitry, drawing only 2µW in low-power mode, calling it the MC68SEC000.|$|E
25|$|The {{memory access}} pattern of AI {{calculations}} differs from graphics: a more predictable but deeper dataflow, benefiting {{more from the}} ability to keep more temporary variables <b>on-chip</b> (e.g. in scratchpad memory rather than caches); GPUs by contrast devote silicon to efficiently dealing with highly non-linear gather-scatter addressing between texture maps and frame-buffers, and texture filtering, as is needed for their primary role in 3D rendering.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{improved}} performance is in microarchitecture techniques exploiting {{the growth of}} available transistor count. Out-of-order execution and <b>on-chip</b> caching and prefetching reduce the memory latency bottleneck {{at the expense of}} using more transistors and increasing the processor complexity. These increases are described empirically by Pollack's Rule, which states that performance increases due to microarchitecture techniques are square root of the number of transistors or the area of a processor.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it had a}} 32-bit {{internal}} bus, the V60 {{had only}} a 16-bit external data bus and a 24-bit address bus. Its architecture was carried largely intact to the V70 (μPD70632) model, which had external 32-bit buses and was released in 1987. Launched in 1989, the V80 (μPD70832) {{was the culmination of}} the series having <b>on-chip</b> caches, a branch predictor, and less reliance on microcode for complex operations. The V60-V80 architecture did not enjoy much commercial success.|$|E
25|$|The EIB is a {{communication}} bus internal to the Cell processor which connects the various <b>on-chip</b> system elements: the PPE processor, the memory controller (MIC), the eight SPE coprocessors, and two off-chip I/O interfaces, {{for a total}} of 12 participants in the PS3 (the number of SPU can vary in industrial applications). The EIB also includes an arbitration unit which functions as a set of traffic lights. In some documents IBM refers to EIB participants as 'units'.|$|E
25|$|Finally, if CKE {{is lowered}} {{at the same}} time as an auto-refresh command is sent to the SDRAM, the SDRAM enters self-refresh mode. This is like power down, but the SDRAM uses an <b>on-chip</b> timer to {{generate}} internal refresh cycles as necessary. The clock may be stopped during this time. While self-refresh mode consumes slightly more power than power-down mode, it allows the memory controller to be disabled entirely, which commonly more than makes up the difference.|$|E
25|$|The Mac Mini G4 used {{single-core}} 32-bit PowerPC processors with 512KB of <b>on-chip</b> L2 cache. The processor accessed memory {{through the}} front-side bus, which was clocked at 167MHz. The chips in these models of Mac Mini ran at either 1.25, 1.33, 1.42, or 1.5GHz. It {{also had an}} ATI Radeon 9200 graphics processor with 32MB of DDR SDRAM in the standard editions, which was upgraded to 64 MB VRAM in the high-end version of the final Mac Mini G4 in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The K8 {{was a major}} {{revision}} of the K7 architecture, with the most notable features being {{the addition of a}} 64-bit extension to the x86 instruction set (called x86-64, AMD64, or x64), the incorporation of an <b>on-chip</b> memory controller, and the implementation of an extremely high performance point-to-point interconnect called HyperTransport, as part of the Direct Connect Architecture. The technology was initially launched as the Opteron server-oriented processor on April 22, 2003. Shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop PCs, branded Athlon 64.|$|E
25|$|V60-V80 had a {{built-in}} MMU that divide the 4 GB virtual address space into in four 1-GB sections, each section further divided in 1,024 1-MB areas, each area composed of 256 4-KB pages. On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and page tables entries (PTE) {{are stored in}} RAM (off-chip). The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both <b>on-chip</b> with only the PTE entries stored in RAM, allowing for a faster execution of TLB misses by eliminating one memory read.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} Athlon, the Thunderbird, debuted on June 5, 2000. This {{version of the}} Athlon shipped in a more traditional pin-grid array (PGA) format that plugged into a socket ("Socket A") on the motherboard (it also shipped in the slot A package). It was sold at speeds ranging from 600MHz to 1.4GHz (Athlon Classics using the Slot A package could clock up to 1GHz). The major difference, however, was cache design. Just as Intel had done when they replaced the old Katmai-based Pentium III with the much faster Coppermine-based Pentium III, AMD replaced the 512kB external reduced-speed cache of the Athlon Classic with 256kB of <b>on-chip,</b> full-speed exclusive cache. As a general rule, more cache improves performance, but faster cache improves it further still.|$|E
25|$|All models {{feature a}} Broadcom {{system on a chip}} (SoC), which {{includes}} an ARM compatible {{central processing unit}} (CPU) and an <b>on-chip</b> graphics processing unit (GPU, a VideoCore IV). CPU speed ranges from 700MHz to 1.2GHz for the Pi3 and on board memory range from 256MB to 1GB RAM. SecureDigital (SD) cards are used to store the operating system and program memory in either the SDHC or MicroSDHC sizes. Most boards have between one and four USB slots, HDMI and composite video output, and a 3.5mm phono jack for audio. Lower level output is provided by a number of GPIO pins which support common protocols like I²C. The B-models have an 8P8C Ethernet port and the Pi3 and Pi ZeroW have on board Wi-Fi 802.11n and Bluetooth.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{multi-core}} CPUs became commercially available. Content-addressable memory (CAM) {{has become}} inexpensive {{enough to be}} used in networking, and is frequently used for <b>on-chip</b> cache memory in modern microprocessors, although no computer system has yet implemented hardware CAMs for use in programming languages. Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS logic gates developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a CMOS gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states, except for leakage.|$|E
25|$|Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS): The ISS is {{a remote}} sensing {{instrument}} that captures most images in visible light, {{and also some}} infrared images and ultraviolet images. The ISS has taken {{hundreds of thousands of}} images of Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The ISS has a wide-angle camera (WAC) that takes pictures of large areas, and a narrow-angle camera (NAC) that takes pictures of small areas in fine detail. Each of these cameras uses a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as its electromagnetic wave detector. Each CCD has a 1,024 square array of pixels, 12μm on a side. Both cameras allow for many data collection modes, including <b>on-chip</b> data compression. Both cameras are fitted with spectral filters that rotate on a wheel—to view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 1.1μm.|$|E
25|$|Intel Corporation saw {{the massive}} {{potential}} of the invention and introduced the first commercial NOR type flash chip in 1988. NOR-based flash has long erase and write times, but provides full address and data buses, allowing random access to any memory location. This makes it a suitable replacement for older read-only memory (ROM) chips, which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated, such as a computer's BIOS or the firmware of set-top boxes. Its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an <b>on-chip</b> flash memory, to a more typical 10,000 or 100,000 erase cycles, up to 1,000,000 erase cycles. NOR-based flash was the basis of early flash-based removable media; CompactFlash was originally based on it, though later cards moved to less expensive NANDflash.|$|E
25|$|The {{first few}} {{generations of the}} Alpha chips {{were some of the}} most {{innovative}} of their time. The first version, the Alpha 21064 or EV4, was the first CMOS microprocessor whose operating frequency rivalled higher-powered ECL minicomputers and mainframes. The second, 21164 or EV5, was the first microprocessor to place a large secondary cache on chip. The third, 21264 or EV6, was the first microprocessor to combine both high operating frequency and the more complicated out-of-order execution microarchitecture. The 21364 or EV7 was the first high performance processor to have an <b>on-chip</b> memory controller. The unproduced 21464 or EV8 would have been the first to include simultaneous multithreading, but this version was canceled after the sale of DEC to Compaq. The Tarantula research project, which most likely would have been called EV9, would have been the first Alpha processor to feature a vector unit.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} speed of modern CPUs, parallel flash devices are often much {{slower than the}} memory bus of the computer they are connected to. Conversely, modern SRAM offers access times below 10ns, while DDR2 SDRAM offers access times below 20ns. Because of this, it is often desirable to shadow code stored in flash into RAM; that is, the code is copied from flash into RAM before execution, so that the CPU may access it at full speed. Device firmware may be stored in a serial flash device, and then copied into SDRAM or SRAM when the device is powered-up. Using an external serial flash device rather than <b>on-chip</b> flash removes the need for significant process compromise (a process that is good for high-speed logic is generally not good for flash and vice versa). Once it is decided to read the firmware in as one big block {{it is common to}} add compression to allow a smaller flash chip to be used. Typical applications for serial flash include storing firmware for hard drives, Ethernet controllers, DSL modems, wireless network devices, etc.|$|E
500|$|These filters can be {{made using}} the {{standard}} semiconductor industry photolithography manufacturing techniques. [...] Consequently, they are suitable for incorporating into <b>on-chip</b> integrated circuits, as is PPWG technology in general.Avetisyan et al., p.331 ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{innovation}} of the Fairchild μA741 was {{the introduction}} of frequency compensation via an <b>on-chip</b> (monolithic) capacitor, simplifying application of the op amp by {{eliminating the need for}} external components for this function.|$|E
2500|$|The Xeon [...] "Dunnington" [...] {{processor}} (CPUID Family 6, model 29) {{is closely}} related to Wolfdale but comes with six cores and an <b>on-chip</b> L3 cache and is designed for servers with Socket 604, so it is marketed only as Xeon, not as Core 2.|$|E
2500|$|The current non-server Mac Mini is {{available}} in two versions, one with a mobile dual-core 64-bit Intel Core i5 processor that runs at 2.5GHz and one {{with a choice of}} a mobile quad-core Intel Core i7 2.3GHz or a quad-core Core i7 2.6GHz; the server model has a choice of the same processors as the faster non-server model. The CPU in the slower non-server model has a 3 MB <b>on-chip</b> L3 cache, and the CPUs available for the faster non-server model and the server model have a 6 MB <b>on-chip</b> L3 cache; the cache is shared between the cores and GPU (if in use). Prior revisions used a [...] "Penryn" [...] Intel Core 2 Duo processor, [...] "Merom"-based Core 2 Duo and [...] "Yonah"-based Core Duo and Solo chips.|$|E
2500|$|The 286 was {{the first}} of the x86 CPU family to support {{protected}} virtual-address mode, commonly called [...] "protected mode". In addition, it {{was the first}} commercially available microprocessor with <b>on-chip</b> MMU capabilities (systems using the contemporaneous Motorola 68010 and NS320xx could be equipped with an optional MMU controller). [...] This would allow IBM compatibles to have advanced multitasking OSes for the first time and compete in the Unix-dominated server/workstation market.|$|E
2500|$|Such HDR imaging is used {{in extreme}} dynamic range {{applications}} like welding or automotive work. Some other cameras designed for use in security applications can automatically provide two or more images for each frame, with changing exposure [...] For example, a sensor for 30fps video will give out 60fps with the odd frames at a short exposure time and the even frames at a longer exposure time. Some of the sensor may even combine the two images <b>on-chip</b> so that a wider dynamic range without in-pixel compression is directly available to the user for display or processing.|$|E
2500|$|SDRAM {{designed}} for battery-powered devices offers some additional power-saving options. One is temperature-dependent refresh; an <b>on-chip</b> temperature sensor reduces the refresh rate at lower temperatures, rather than always running {{it at the}} worst-case rate. [...] Another is selective refresh, which limits self-refresh to {{a portion of the}} DRAM array. The fraction which is refreshed is configured using an extended mode register. The third, implemented in Mobile DDR (LPDDR) and LPDDR2 is [...] "deep power down" [...] mode, which invalidates the memory and requires a full reinitialization to exit from. This is activated by sending a [...] "burst terminate" [...] command while lowering CKE.|$|E
2500|$|The smaller {{storage size}} of ROM {{cartridges}} limited {{the number of}} available textures. As a result, many games which utilized much smaller 8 or 12MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces. [...] Compounded by a limit of 4,096 bytes of <b>on-chip</b> texture memory, the end-result is often a distorted, out-of-proportion appearance. Many titles that feature larger 32 or 64MB cartridges avoided this issue entirely, notable games include Resident Evil 2, Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth, and Conker's Bad Fur Day as they feature more ROM space, allowing for more detailed graphics by utilizing multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|Since RFID tags can be {{attached}} to cash, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns. These concerns resulted in standard specifications development [...] addressing privacy and security issues. [...] ISO/IEC 18000 and ISO/IEC 29167 use <b>on-chip</b> cryptography methods for untraceability, tag and reader authentication, and over-the-air privacy. ISO/IEC 20248 specifies a digital signature data structure for RFID and barcodes providing data, source and read method authenticity. [...] This work is done within ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 31 Automatic identification and data capture techniques. Tags {{can also be used}} in shops to expedite checkout, and to prevent theft by customers and employees.|$|E
2500|$|The P5 {{microarchitecture}} {{was designed}} by the same Santa Clara team which designed the 386 and 486. [...] Design work started in 1989; [...] the team decided to use a superscalar architecture, with <b>on-chip</b> cache, floating-point, and branch prediction. [...] The preliminary design was first successfully simulated in 1990, followed by the laying-out of the design. [...] By this time, the team had several dozen engineers. [...] The design was taped out, or transferred to silicon, in April 1992, at which point beta-testing began. [...] By mid-1992, the P5 team had 200 engineers. [...] Intel at first planned to demonstrate the P5 in June 1992 at the trade show PC Expo, and to formally announce the processor in September 1992, but design problems forced the demo to be cancelled, and the official introduction of the chip was delayed until the spring of 1993.|$|E
2500|$|The V80 (μPD70832) was {{launched}} {{in the spring of}} 1989. Incorporating <b>on-chip</b> caches and a branch predictor, it was declared NEC's 486 by Computer Business Review. The performance of the V80 was two to four times that of the V70, depending on the application. For example, unlike its V70 predecessor, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier reducing integer multiplication to 9 cycles compared to 23 cycles in the V70. (For more such differences, see next section.) The V80 was manufactured in a 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a die area of [...] consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged as a 280-pin PGA and operated at 25 or 33MHz with a claimed peak performance of 12.5 and respectively 16.5 MIPS. The V80 had separate 1KB on-die instruction and data caches and a 64-entry branch predictor; the performance gains attributed to the latter was about 5%. The launch prices if the V80 were cited as equivalent to $1200 for the 33MHz and $960 for the 25MHz version. Supposedly a 45MHz version was scheduled for 1990, but this did not materialize.|$|E
