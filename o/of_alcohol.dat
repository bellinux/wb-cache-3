5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> {{to obtain}} ketones, aldehydes or carboxylic acids {{is a fundamental}} transformation in organic synthesis and many reagents are known for these conversions. However, {{there is still a}} demand for mild and selective reagents for the oxidation <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> in the presence of other functional groups. As an alternative, the nitroxyl radical TEMPO (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) has been demonstrated to be a useful reagent for the transformation <b>of</b> <b>alcohols.</b> The oxidation <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> using TEMPO is often efficient, fast, selective, made in mild conditions and can tolerate sensitive functional groups.

40|$|Even though various {{reagents}} {{for coupling}} <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> with carboxylic acids and transesterification of esters have been developed, 1 {{there is still}} a great demand for a process by using acyl chlorides for the acylation <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> in the case of substrates having steric hindrance or low reactivity.

40|$|Acylation {{reactions}} {{continue to}} be one of the most employed reactions for the protection <b>of</b> <b>alcohols.</b> In particular, protection <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> into the corresponding acetate esters has attracted much attention due to the ease of preparation and high stability of acetate esters. 1 - 2 Acetylation <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> are commonly carried out by the reaction <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> with acetic anhydride or acid chloride in the presence of bases such as pyridine, 3 4 -(dimethylamino) -pyridine, 4 and KF-Al 2 O 3. 5 It also have been reported that a number of acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid 6 and montmorillonite clays 7 could facilitate the <b>alcohol</b> acetyl-ations.
