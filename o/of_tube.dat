5|$|The {{matter of}} {{cooperation}} {{had to be}} taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada.

The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project.

40|$|Abstract. The {{behaviour}} of turbulent flows past a row <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> equal {{diameter and}} regularly spaced was experimentally studied in a wind tunnel assembly using hot wire anemometry and a pressure transducer. Flows past a row <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> are observed in many engineering fields, like energy and process industies and oil prospecting. In heat exchangers, the undisturbed incident flow is {{set by the}} first row <b>of</b> <b>tubes,</b> generating the flow structures that travel through the bank until the fully turbulence dominates. Traditional Fourier analysis and the more recent wavelet analysis were used to characterize the flow phenomena. This paper presents the characterization of the flow just next a row <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>of</b> pitch to diameter ratio of 1. 26, considered in the literature as a transition geometry where the behaviour of the flow can be unstable...|$|R

5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task <b>of</b> <b>Tube</b> Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{next step}} was to broach the matter with the Canadians. The Lord President, Sir John Anderson, as the {{minister}} responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British High Commissioner to Canada, Malcolm MacDonald, who had been involved in Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding Eldorado's uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director <b>of</b> <b>Tube</b> Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal.

5|$|The {{promoters}} of the HStP {{were inspired by}} the recent success of the City and South London Railway (C), the world's first deep-tube railway. This had opened in November 1890 and had seen large passenger numbers {{in its first year}} of operation. Bills for three similarly inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 legislative session, and, to ensure a consistent approach, a Joint Select Committee was established to review the proposals. The committee took evidence on various matters regarding the construction and operation of deep-tube railways, and made recommendations on the diameter <b>of</b> <b>tube</b> tunnels, method of traction, and the granting of wayleaves. After preventing the construction of the branch beyond Euston, the Committee allowed the HStP bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration. The rest of the route was approved and, following a change of the company name, the bill received royal assent on 24 August 1893 as the Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Act, 1893.|$|E
