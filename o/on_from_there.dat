5|$|Michel's {{older brother}} Albert had already become a patissier (pastry chef), and Roux {{followed}} him into this field {{at the age of}} fourteen. He became an apprentice to Camille Loyal in Belleville, working seventy-hour weeks. Michel's tasks at the pâtisserie included making up to sixty Galette des Rois over the course of three days for Epiphany. Albert found Michel further employment as his apprenticeship ended. As Albert was working at the British Embassy in Paris as a sous chef, Michel joined him there as the pastry chef for the Embassy. He moved <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to become a chef in Philippe de Rothschild's service, while Albert moved to England to work there. Between 1960 and 1962, Michel served his French National Service. He was first stationed at the Palace of Versailles, but was later posted overseas in Béchar, Algeria. He was awarded the Médaille commémorative des opérations de sécurité et de maintien de l'ordre en Afrique du Nord.|$|E

25|$|In Lancashire's second innings, Ottis Gibson got {{two quick}} wickets as Lancashire fell to 22 for 3 shortly before stumps {{on the second}} day, but Australians Stuart Law and Andrew Symonds batted well {{together}} with a 111-run partnership before Law was out to Henderson. Symonds powered <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there,</b> bludgeoning 17 fours in his 121, and Glen Chapple and Warren Hegg made season-best scores of 60 and 77 respectively as they added for 121 for the eighth wicket. Lancashire declared on 368 for 9, not bothering to send in James Anderson to bat, thinking he might be better use with the ball. Indeed, he was - he took three for 39 before stumps on day three, as Leicestershire collapsed to 78 for 5 in chase of 399. There wasn't much respite {{on the fourth day}} either - after Dinesh Mongia and Habib had added 27, Anderson came back with two quick wickets, finishing with five for 79. Dominic Cork and debutant leg-spinner Simon Marshall wrapped up the Leicestershire chase as they were all out for 164.|$|E
25|$|The trams in Southampton had {{consistently}} {{made good}} profits for Southampton Corporation, but the profits {{went into the}} rate relief fund instead of being re-invested into the Tram system. Consequently, {{by the end of}} the Second World War, the whole system needed modernisation – the trams, the power supply and the track. It was decided that buses were a better alternative. The first line to close was Bitterne Park – St. Mary's – Docks, which closed on 15 May 1948. Swaythling – Portswood – Lodge Road – Stag Gates closed on 30 October 1948. Swaythling – Burgess Road – Bassett Crossroads – Avenue Junction closed on 5 March 1949. Floating Bridge – Shirley, Holy Rood – High Street – Royal Pier and Roberts Road – Millbrook all closed on 31 December 1949. The last movement of a tram in Southampton was on 4 February 1950 when cars No.21 and No.101 were moved from Shirley depot to Portswood depot under their own power. After closure, some dome-topped trams were sold to Leeds, but the majority were sent to A F Harris's scrapyard at Bevois Valley for scrapping. A few were sold <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to be used as sheds or summer houses, which enabled the preservation of three vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{intended}} for {{service in the}} Middle East, Carey and 135 Squadron were diverted to Burma in December. Most of the squadron boarded transport ships on 6 December {{the day before the}} Empire of Japan attack on Pearl Harbor, which started the Pacific War and brought the United States into the conflict. At Free Town, Sierra Leone, Carey boarded a Douglas DC-2 and flew to Takoradi in Ghana with the senior staff, leaving the rest of the squadron to sail <b>on.</b> <b>From</b> <b>there,</b> they flew in a Douglas DC-3 to Khartoum. On the way across Carey flew the aircraft but became the butt of a practical joke when the men kept moving up and down the aircraft to upset its centre of gravity which forced an irritated Carey to keep trimming the elevators. From there a flight in a Short Empire to Cairo was taken in order to report to Air Force Headquarters. Staging through Dubai and Calcutta Carey reached Burma. On 19 December the squadron reached Durban, South Africa and on 24 December set sail for Bombay, India arriving on 6 January 1942. The squadron finally reached Rangoon, Burma on 19 January 1942 {{in the middle of an}} air raid.|$|E

25|$|Cook had {{his first}} taste of {{international}} cricket playing the U15 World Cup in 2000. Three years later Cook was called up to the England Under-19 team for their tour of South Africa. After it was decided Samit Patel had enough responsibility batting and bowling, Cook was appointed captain of the team the following year, 2004. His first call of duty was the U19 World Cup in the West Indies where he guided England through the group stages and on past the Super League stage, including an unbeaten century-each partnership with Patel against New Zealand, and continued a 100% win record with 87 over eventual winners Pakistan before falling short in the semi-final against the West Indies. He went <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to captain them in a U19 Test win over Bangladesh before taking the One-Day series too. His career with the Under 19 team was cut short when Kevin Pietersen was called up to replace Andrew Flintoff in the main team, leaving a spot in England A tour of Sri Lanka for Cook. After the 2005 domestic season {{he was part of}} the intake for the ECB National Academy, but this was interrupted as he flew to Pakistan to cover the squad for Michael Vaughan's knee injury. After not being used in the first XI he travelled back with the Academy to the West Indies in the new year scoring 101 in a two-day match against Antigua before youth cricket came to an abrupt halt for Cook.|$|E
25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E

500|$|Davis {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to a lawyer father and {{psychologist}} mother. He began his acting career {{as a child in}} 1949, in radio drama and summer stock theatre. His cousins Murray and Donald Davis ran the Straw Hat Players in Ontario in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and rehearsed in the basement of Davis' house. When they needed a boy they gave William his first professional acting job. He went <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to have a career as a boy actor on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio before his voice broke. [...] In 1955 he enrolled in the University of Toronto to study philosophy, but actively pursued a career as an actor alongside future actor Donald Sutherland. In 1959, he graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. While at university he switched his attention from acting to directing and with his partner, Karl Jaffary, took over and ran the Straw Hat Players for four years.|$|E
500|$|The CW {{was looking}} to create a female-driven action series.

Silverstein wanted to follow Nikita after she left the agency, as that chapter was yet to be told in the previous incarnations. He also believed it {{would have done the}} original story justice. Also, he wanted to include a highlight of Nikita's original story in the pilot to earn the title, and then move <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> Silverstein described Nikita's transition in a Collider interview; [...] "It's a dark fairytale. This girl is taken from one life, her identity is erased, she's put in another life and she's transformed. It's like Alice in Wonderland. She's told, [...] "Eat this, drink that, steal this, kill that," [...] and she's not told why. And, she begins to find her own identity through that. It's just a great story." ...|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Meades ate at The Restaurant for The Times in late 1993, {{and noted}} the {{evolution}} of some dishes and sauces from White's days at Harveys. These included making the pig's trotter dish more [...] "delicate", and only using the white part of the leeks in a pressed leek and langoustine starter. Meades also noticed that White had [...] "tempered" [...] the sauces served with meat and fish, referring to their previous versions as [...] "assault courses". He praised a new roasted salmon and tapenade dish, calling it [...] "of breathtaking quality", {{and the work of}} pastry chef Roger Pizey. Meades later listed The Restaurant as the second best in the country at the end of 1994, placed only behind Phil Vickery, having recently taken over from Gary Rhodes, at the Castle Hotel, Taunton. He gave both restaurants an equal nine stars out of ten. When celebrity chef Keith Floyd listed his five favourite restaurants for The Guardian in September 1994, he included The Restaurant in third place, saying [...] "The food is exquisite. He's a difficult bastard, but I like him. He came through le Gavroche, through Albert Roux, and he's developed <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> Along with Albert, I think he's one of the finest cooks in the country.

500|$|The {{importance}} of rehearsal to Monteux was shown when, in 1923, Diaghilev {{asked him to}} conduct Stravinsky's new Les noces with no rehearsal, as the composer would already have conducted the first performance, Monteux following <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> Monteux told the impresario [...] "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, but I {{have to do what}} ze composer 'as written." [...] Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of The Nation, B. H. Haggin, while admitting that Monteux was generally {{regarded as one of the}} giants of conducting, wrote of his [...] "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity". [...] Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 Carleton Smith wrote, [...] "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three'– the Boston, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic orchestras." [...] In his 1967 book The Great Conductors, Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Monteux, [...] " [...] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world. The word 'loved' is used advisedly." [...] Elsewhere, Schonberg wrote of Monteux's [...] "passion and charisma". When asked in a radio interview to describe himself (as a conductor) in one word, Monteux replied, [...] "Damned professional".|$|E
500|$|Under the {{government}} of the 5,000 and under the democracy that replaced it in 410 BC, Theramenes served as a general for several years, commanding fleets in the Aegean Sea and the Hellespont. Shortly after the rise of {{the government}} of the 5,000, Theramenes set sail to the Hellespont to join Thrasybulus and the generals elected by the army at Samos. After the Athenian victory at Abydos, he took thirty triremes to attack the rebels on Euboea, who were building a causeway to Boeotia to provide land access to their island. Unable to stop the construction, he plundered the territory of several rebellious cities, then travelled around the Aegean suppressing oligarchies and raising funds from various cities of the Athenian Empire. He then took his fleet to Macedon, where he assisted the Macedonian king Archelaus in his siege of Pydna, but, with that siege dragging on, he sailed on to join Thrasybulus in Thrace. The fleet soon moved <b>on</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> to challenge Mindarus' fleet, which had seized the city of Cyzicus. Theramenes commanded one wing of the Athenian fleet in the resulting Battle of Cyzicus, a decisive Athenian victory. In that battle, Alcibiades (who had been recalled from exile by the fleet at Samos shortly after the coup) led a decoy force that drew the Spartan fleet out into open water, while Thrasybulus and Theramenes, each commanding an independent squadron, cut off the Spartans' retreat. Mindarus was forced to flee to a nearby beach, and vicious fighting ensued on land as the Athenians attempted to drag off the Spartan ships. Thrasybulus and Alcibiades kept the Spartans occupied while Theramenes joined up with the nearby Athenian land forces and then hurried to the rescue; his arrival precipitated a total Athenian victory, in which all the Spartan ships were captured. In the wake of this victory, the Athenians captured Cyzicus and constructed a fort at Chrysopolis, from which they extracted a customs duty of one tenth on all ships passing through the Bosporus. Theramenes and another general remained at this fort with a garrison of thirty ships to oversee the collection of the duty. At Athens, meanwhile, {{the government of}} the 5,000 was replaced by a restored democracy within a few months of this battle; Donald Kagan has suggested that the absence of Theramenes, [...] "the best spokesman for the moderates", paved the way for this restoration.|$|E
