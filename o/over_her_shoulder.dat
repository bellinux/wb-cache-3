The regular edition cover shows {{her from the}} waist up, whereas the US special edition shows the cover art in its entirety, with Alison wearing a long plume of peacock feathers and golden platform shoes. In late 2005, the album ranked number eight on the annual Best Art Vinyl poll.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is polygynandrous, {{although}} the dominant male in the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. Fighting is most common during the breeding season. A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her backside, lifting her tail {{and looking at}} the desired male <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Males may inspect the female's genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.|$|E
5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins in}} its {{principal}} setting with Swift and two backup musicians atop {{a stage in}} a crowded barn. Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted pastel sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and the upright bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring out from a red car into the street, Brody swinging from a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

Emmet's hand is on her hip and she looks <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> at the audience.|$|E

500|$|The Warrior's Husband {{proved to}} be Hepburn's {{breakout}} performance. Biographer Charles Higham states that the role was ideal for the actress, requiring an aggressive energy and athleticism, and she enthusiastically involved herself with its production. The play opened March 11, 1932, at the Morosco Theatre on Broadway. Hepburn's first entrance called for her to leap down a narrow stairway with a stag <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> wearing a short silver tunic. The show ran for three months, and Hepburn received positive reviews. Richard Garland of the New York World-Telegram wrote, [...] "It's been many a night since so glowing a performance has brightened the Broadway scene." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also {{added to the}} setlist of The Monster Ball Tour. During the 2009 leg of the tour, she {{performed}} it as the second song of the list. After the opening song [...] "Dance in the Dark", she strapped on a portable silver jewelled keyboard and started performing [...] "Just Dance" [...] while inside a white cube from which she emerged from the top, and the video screen came up. She was raised on a platform with a keytar <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> as eight dancers in white bodysuits locked into steps below her. During the revamped Monster Ball shows, in 2010-11, Gaga wore a futuristic [...] "glitter ball suit", and started the performance by playing on a keyboard hidden inside {{the hood of a}} Rolls Royce. In May 2011, Gaga performed the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria. She also made her debut performance on Irish TV screens performing Just Dance, on the Irish talk show Tubridy Tonight in January 2009.|$|E
500|$|To {{one side}} of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto {{designed}} by Bernardo Buontalenti. The lower façade was begun by Vasari [...] but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by [...] "dripping" [...] pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo's four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna's Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> at the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills {{applying}} red lipstick, {{in a car}} mirror, while the instrumental of the song plays. She leaves the car and passes by a man, who is afterwards seen standing between two women wearing plastic masks of Kills' face. The music mutes {{and the sound of}} footsteps is heard repeatedly as Kills approaches a cracked mirror. After hearing a noise behind her, she looks <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> as her reflection looks to her as well. Kills is dragged into the mirror, and the title card of the first act, [...] "Vanity". During the section, a metal skull is shown while Kills lip-synchs the song in front of a mirror. The visual transitions to its second act, dubbed [...] "Control", in which she holds an axe while standing on top of a glass box. A man is seen inside the box, filming her as she moves around it. The video then shifts to act three, named [...] "Sex", in which Kill is depicted singing to a skull. Towards the end of the video, Kills is seen handcuffed and chained while sitting on the floor, and seducing a blindfolded man.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna {{performed}} [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] for {{the first}} time at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show alongside [...] "Diamonds", on November 7, 2012. During the performance she wore a pink sheer lingerie. The show aired on December 4, 2012 on CBS. During the seven days prior to the release of the album, Rihanna embarked on the 777 Tour, a seven-date promotional tour where she performed seven concerts in seven different cities in seven different countries across North America and Europe. [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] was included on the set list at the first concert in Mexico City, at the second concert in Toronto. Rihanna performed the song again at the third concert in Stockholm. Jack Rosenthal for Rolling Stone commented that performing the song appeared to be an [...] "uphill climb" [...] for Rihanna during the first two dates in Mexico City and Toronto, but felt that she looked more comfortable performing on the third date in Stockholm, writing [...] "she sings it looking <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> a breezy afterthought." [...] She also included the song in her setlist for her Diamonds World Tour.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{arriving}} at a polo mansion. She comes out from the car wearing a vest, jeans and showing her midriff. She starts singing while her boyfriend welcomes her. They walk past a barn, where a polo player is sitting. They {{look at each other}} briefly and she starts to sing in a balcony, watching the second man with a pair of binoculars. At {{the end of the first}} chorus, her boyfriend comes and puts a studded necklace around her neck, as a surprise gift. Until the end of the second chorus, we see scenes of Spears singing and watching the polo player as he gets ready. When the bridge begins, Spears arrives at a match wearing a white dress and a large hat. She looks at the polo player <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> and sings the lines [...] "I got my eye on you / And I can’t let you get away". When the match ends, she leaves and the second man follows her. They flirt inside a hallway and leave. Her boyfriend notices her absence, walks into the hallway and sees her necklace on the floor. The video ends with Spears and the second man walking into the sunset.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] {{was released on}} 10 October 2015. The video takes place at a school dance, where {{a professor in the}} hall (the same man who appeared in their previous single's video [...] "Black Magic") tells everyone that it is the last dance. Jade, Leigh-Anne, Jesy and Perrie are waiting for their dates to arrive. Scenes of the girls waiting for their date are intercut throughout the video of them sitting at a table while all of the other couples are dancing. Unbeknownst to them, the man, played by Hector David Junior, has invited each of them to go to the dance after meeting them in different situations prior to that night. He asked Jade by picking her up in his car to go on a date. As she gets in, he invites her to be his date at the dance and presents her with a corsage to wear on her wrist on the night. He mets Leigh-Anne at a high school basketball game, where she and her girlfriends were watching him and some other boys play on the court. He sees that she is infatuated by how good he is at the sport, walks up to her, and asks her to be his date by giving her a corsage. He asked Jesy to be his date while they were at the cinema as they shared a bucket of popcorn. As he gives her the corsage, she throws the bucket <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> and eagerly jumps on his lap, causing them to fall off the chair.|$|E
500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> and it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was {{and looks up at}} both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E
