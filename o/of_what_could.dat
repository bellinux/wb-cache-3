I still mourn the loss <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> have been, but I also feel deep gratitude for those who stood by me, for the lesson that we must never be afraid to ask for help, and for the feeling of summer that still remains.|$|E
5|$|When President Kennedy first {{chartered}} the Moon landing program, {{a preliminary}} cost estimate of $7 billion was generated, but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> {{not possibly be}} determined precisely, and James Webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to $20 billion before giving it to Vice President Johnson.|$|E
5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was once used to churn butter. The foundations <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> have been a mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E

5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> happen to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.|$|E
5|$|Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren were early {{opportunities}} for the Germans to learn lessons about the challenges their poorly equipped and often substandard occupation troops faced fighting in the difficult terrain and weather conditions of Bosnia. However, these lessons were to be repeated many more times in the following years as German commanders persisted with their encirclement tactics and unreasonable expectations <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> be achieved in a given time and space.|$|E
5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} {{that global warming is}} unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> happen to different animals more vulnerable to global warming.|$|E

The deceleration of the region's economy from 6.03% in 1999 to 5.42% in 2000 {{was attributed to}} the slowdown of the agriculture, fishery and forestry (AFF) and services sectors. The improved performance of the Industry sector, from 5.69% in 1999 to 6.69% in 2000, cushioned the effects <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> have been a slowdown of the region's economy.|$|E
25|$|Justus Lipsius {{invented a}} {{specific}} terminology to distinguish different forms <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> {{be called a}} cross or crux. His basic twofold distinction was between the crux simplex (a simple stake) and the crux compacta (a composite of two pieces of wood). The victim could be affixed to the crux simplex or could be impaled on it. Lipsius then subdivided the crux compacta into three types: the crux decussata (X-shaped), crux commissa (T-shaped) and crux immissa (†-shaped).|$|E

25|$|Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} a separate opinion privilege existed against libel.

25|$|The party {{came close}} to expressing support for the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War – on grounds of {{supporting}} defence of democracy (some writers initially took Spain as an example <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> happen if the capitalists class tried {{to use force to}} overturn the result of a socialist electoral revolution). This led to a debate within the party and resulted in an official statement that fell short of supporting the pro-capitalist republican government, but offering general support to workers in their struggle for democracy.|$|E
