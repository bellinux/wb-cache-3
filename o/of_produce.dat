Maeser continued his teaching career {{when he arrived in}} Utah. He taught at the Deseret Lyceum, an academy established in Salt Lake City in November 1860. The teachers at the Lyceum constructed school slates and performed janitor duties because conditions were so poor. When students' families could not afford to pay tuition, Maeser often collected payments <b>of</b> <b>produce</b> via wheelbarrow.|$|E
5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type <b>of</b> <b>produce.</b> There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E

5|$|In Naju, the country's largest {{producer}} of pears, approximately 1,400hectares (3,460acres) of pear trees, or 60% {{of the total}} crop, was destroyed. Agriculture as a whole suffered significantly from the storm, {{with a total of}} 9,000hectares (22,000acres) of apple and pear plantations being destroyed. As a result, the price <b>of</b> <b>produce</b> across the nation jumped substantially. In Yesan alone, a town where more than 1,500 families relies on their apple orchards for a living, losses to the orchards reached ₩300billion (US$265.4million). The prices of spinach, cabbage, and lettuce rose by 124%, 72%, and 26% respectively in just one day. Total losses throughout the country were estimated at ₩420billion (US$374.3million). More than 500 people were left homeless as a result of Bolaven, mostly in South Jeolla Province. Additionally, economic losses to airlines related to the typhoon reached ₩17billion ($15million). Korean Air and Asiana Airlines suffered the greatest losses of the affected companies.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance <b>of</b> <b>produce,</b> of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and zinc ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. From the time of the Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} were first made in 1870. Routes via Verdal and Røros were soon {{discarded}} and the Meråker Line was approved on 5 June 1873. The first revenue services ran in 1879 {{and the line}} was officially opened on 22 July 1882. The line gave a boom to the local economy, allowing for same-day transport <b>of</b> <b>produce</b> to Trondheim. The line has been upgraded several times to increase the axle load. During World War II, the line {{was the scene of}} both the Hommelvik train disaster and the Meråker train disaster. Steam trains were in use until 1971, following the introduction of diesel locomotives in 1961. From 1900 to 2005 Meraker Smelteverk was a major customer, using the line to haul carbide, and later microsilica, from their mill at Kopperå to the port at Muruvik. The Norwegian National Rail Administration plans to have electrified and installed centralized traffic control by 2023.|$|E

5|$|Taxes were levied on {{mining and}} forest products, and {{additional}} income was raised through tolls {{for the use}} of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and agricultural produce (black pepper, paddy, spices, betel leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax assessment was based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type <b>of</b> <b>produce.</b> Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.|$|E

30|$|The most {{important}} issue {{in the production of}} energy from aquifers is the necessity <b>of</b> reinjection <b>of</b> <b>produced</b> brine into the same aquifer, which provides pressure maintenance that leads to much higher energy recovery and resolves the issue <b>of</b> disposing <b>of</b> <b>produced</b> brine. The disadvantage of reinjection is the amount of required energy for pumping the reinjected brine in comparison with the amount <b>of</b> <b>produced</b> energy. Two important questions about the reinjection strategy are the rate and start time of injection.|$|R

25|$|During the 1980s, {{especially}} in Britain, the farming community received large monetary incentives to reduce production of certain crops.
