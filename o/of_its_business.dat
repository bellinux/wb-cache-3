5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>business</b> plan.

Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the M-76 {{designation}} was decommissioned in 1973, most of the overall highway had been converted to freeway. It started southwest of Standish at an interchange with US23 in southern Arenac County. The freeway ran northward through fields to a junction with M-61 where it turned northwesterly. M-76 passed to the southwest of Sterling and over {{a tributary of the}} Tittabawassee River as the freeway approaches Alger through a forested area. In Ogemaw County, the trunkline ran south and west of Greenwood and continued to the West Branch area. There, M-76 met the southeastern end <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>business</b> loop that ran north into downtown. The freeway bypassed the town to the southwest, passed over M-30 without an interchange and then met the northwestern end of the business loop. While M-76 was still an active highway designation, this second business loop junction marked the end of the freeway in the area. M-76 turned west, merging onto M-55 to run concurrently along a two-lane highway.|$|E

5|$|The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a {{court that}} dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal {{principles}} based on natural law and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the curia regis, or King's Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the curia during the 1190s, to sit as an independent, central court. The Court of Chancery's reputation for tardiness and expense resulted in much <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>business</b> transferring to the Exchequer. The Exchequer and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years, until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts was unnecessary. As a result, the Exchequer lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the Exchequer was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council of 16December 1880.|$|E
