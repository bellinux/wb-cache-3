5000|$|Addressing modes include Immediate (operand in instruction), Direct or [...] "Symbolic" [...] (<b>operand</b> <b>address</b> in instruction), Register (operand in {{workspace}} register), Register Indirect (<b>operand</b> <b>address</b> in workspace register) with {{or without}} auto-increment, Indexed (<b>operand</b> <b>address</b> in instruction indexed with workspace register content), and Program Counter Relative.|$|E
50|$|A {{specification}} exceptionPoOps {{is recognized}} when an instruction has a length or register field with values not permitted by the operation, {{or when it}} has an <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> that does not satisfy the alignment requirements of the opcode, e.g., a LH instruction with an odd <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> on a machine without the byte alignment feature.|$|E
50|$|Instructions had a 6-bit {{operation}} code and two 15-bit <b>operand</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An index {{register}} in a computer's CPU is a processor register used for modifying <b>operand</b> <b>addresses</b> during {{the run of}} a program, typically for doing vector/array operations.|$|R
50|$|To {{obtain the}} <b>operand's</b> <b>address</b> an {{indirect}} indexed instruction required three memory cycles (the index register being in memory) while the direct access instruction required only one.|$|R

50|$|A Change Address Mode (CAM) {{instruction}} switched between 2-, 3- and 4-character {{address mode}}s.The address mode specified {{the number of}} characters needed for each <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> in instructions.|$|E
50|$|The TMS9900 has 69 {{instructions}} {{which are}} one, {{two or three}} words long and always word-aligned in memory. The instruction set is fairly orthogonal, meaning that with few exceptions, instructions can use all methods of accessing <b>operands</b> (<b>addressing</b> modes).|$|R
50|$|Fixed-point numbers had a one-bit {{sign and}} a 35-bit value, with {{negative}} values represented in ones' complement format. Floating-point numbers had a one-bit sign, an eight-bit characteristic, and a 27-bit mantissa. Instructions had a six-bit operation code and two 15-bit <b>operand</b> <b>addresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CPU had 15 index registers, a four-bit field (x) allowed {{selection}} of one index register {{as the base}} register. <b>Operand</b> <b>addresses</b> were determined by adding {{the contents of the}} selected base register and the 10-bit displacement field (m). Instructions that modified or stored index registers used a four-bit field (xo) to select that index register.|$|R
5000|$|The 6000-series machine's basic {{instruction}} set {{had more than}} 185 single-address one-word instructions. [...] The basic instructions were one word. The addresses pointed to operand descriptors which contained the actual <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> and additional information.|$|E
5000|$|Instructions were {{represented}} as 30-bit {{words in the}} following format: f 6 bits function code [...] j 3 bits jump condition designator [...] k 3 bits partial word designator [...] b 3 bits which index register to use [...] y 15 bits <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> in memory ...|$|E
50|$|For {{modification}} types R, RI, and IR the tag designator {{contains a}} register {{to be used}} for indexing (X0-X7,AU,AL,QU,QL,IC). Other TD values indicated that Y should be used as an immediate operand. Direct addressing was a special case where Y was used as the <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> with no modification.|$|E
40|$|A {{virtual address}} cache memory, whose {{operation}} is controlled explicitly by software, is presented. Ad-hoc hardware mechanisms, including new machine instructions {{and a new}} <b>operand</b> <b>addressing</b> mode, reduce the complexity of cache management logic in favour of {{the capacity of the}} cache, and solve the major problem of virtual address cache organization: two or more virtual addresses mapping into the same real address...|$|R
50|$|Out-of-order {{execution}} in stack machines seems {{to reduce or}} avoid many theoretical and practical difficulties. The cited research shows that such a stack machine can exploit instruction-level parallelism, and the resulting hardware must cache data for the instructions. Such machines effectively bypass most memory accesses to the stack. The result achieves throughput (instructions per clock) comparable to RISC register machines, with much higher code densities (because <b>operand</b> <b>addresses</b> are implicit).|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{belt machine}} code is less compact than for stack machines, which use no <b>operand</b> <b>addresses,</b> but often must {{introduce}} stack-manipulation instructions unneeded on a belt machine. The instructions for accumulator or memory-to-memory machines are not padded out with multiple register fields. Instead, they use compiler-managed anonymous variables for subexpression values. These temps need extra memory reference instructions which take more code space {{than for the}} belt machine. Thus, they produce compact code when used for small memory address spaces, but have no advantage over belt encoding in larger spaces.|$|R
50|$|LVDC {{instruction}} {{words were}} split into a 4-bit opcode field (least-significant bits) and a 9-bit <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> field (most-significant bits). This left it with sixteen possible opcode values {{when there were}} eighteen different instructions: consequently, three of the instructions used the same opcode value, and used two bits of the address value to determine which instruction was executed.|$|E
5000|$|Instructions were {{represented}} as 30-bit words, {{in the following}} format: f 6 bits function code [...] j 3 bits jump condition designator [...] k 3 bits partial word designator [...] b 3 bits which seven index register to use (B0=non used) [...] s 2 bits which S (5bits) register to use S0,S1,S2,S3(P(17-13)) y 13 bits <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> in memory memory address=Bb+Ss+y=18bit(262144Words) ...|$|E
5000|$|... 128 {{high-speed}} index registers (B-lines) {{that could}} be used for address modification in the mostly double-modified instructions. The register address space also included special registers such as the extracode <b>operand</b> <b>address,</b> the exponent of the floating-point accumulator. Three of the 128 registers were program counter registers: 126 was supervisor control, 125 was extracode control, and 127 was user control. Register 0 always held value 0.|$|E
50|$|SAPO was {{designed}} between 1950 and 1956 {{by a team}} led by Czechoslovak cybernetics pioneer Antonín Svoboda. Svoboda had experience from building in the United States, where he worked at MIT until 1946. It was an electromechanical design with 7,000 relays and 400 vacuum tubes, and a magnetic drum memory with capacity of 1024 32-bit words. Each instruction had 5 <b>operands</b> (<b>addresses)</b> - 2 for arithmetic operands, one for result and addresses of next instruction in case of positive and negative result. It operated on binary floating point numbers.|$|R
25|$|A {{relatively}} obscure {{design in}} the West, it was {{a radical departure from}} NEC's previous V-series CPUs—the NEC V20-V50 series—, which were based on the Intel x86 model, although it retained the ability to emulate them. According to NEC's documentation, the architectural change was made due to the increasing demand and diversity of programs, calling for a processor with both power (the 32-bit internal bus) and flexibility, having large numbers of general-purpose registers—a common feature of RISC architectures and a benefit to the emerging high-level languages. The V60 architecture retained however CISC features (which its manual describe as mainframe-based) like variable-length instructions, memory-to-memory operations including string manipulation, and fairly complex <b>operand</b> <b>addressing</b> schemes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} for {{creating}} instruction level energy models for pipelined processors is introduced. This method {{is based on}} measuring the instantaneous current drawn by the processor during {{the execution of the}} instructions. An appropriate instrumentation set up was established for this purpose. According to the proposed method the energy costs (base and inter-instruction costs) are modeled in relation to a reference instruction (e. g. NOP). These costs incorporate inter-cycle energy components, which cancel each other when they are summed to produce the energy consumption of a program resulting in estimates with high accuracy. This is confirmed by the results. Also the dependencies of the energy consumption on the instruction parameters (e. g. <b>operands,</b> <b>addresses)</b> are studied and modeled in an efficient way. ...|$|R
5000|$|Since most {{instructions}} were 16 bits long, {{there was no}} room in an instruction for both a full 15-bit memory address and a meaningful instruction code. Memory was therefore addressed in terms of [...] "pages" [...] of 1,024 words each. Instructions that reference memory had 10 bits for a page offset (supporting values from 0 through 1023 decimal) and a single bit for a [...] "zero/current" [...] page indicator. If the page indicator bit was set the 10 bits were interpreted as an offset within the page that contained the instruction being executed; in other words, the high five bits of the <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> were taken from the P-register, the program counter. If the page indicator bit was clear, the offset represented an address within page zero. Thus 2,048 words could be addressed at once: 1,024 of them within page zero and another 1,024 within the same page as the instruction performing the reference. If necessary to access other memory locations the instruction could have its high bit set, denoting indirect addressing as described previously; the location addressed by the instruction would then contain the full 15-bit <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> (unless it too had its indirect bit set, etc.).|$|E
50|$|An {{instruction}} {{consisted of}} a one-character op-code, up to two operand addresses and an optional single character variant. Usually the op-code character would be word-marked, confirming {{the end of the}} previous instruction. An item-marked op-code would be handled differently from normal, and this was used in the emulation of IBM 1401 instructions that were not directly compatible. The first three bits of an <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> could designate one of six index registers that occupied the first 32 addressable memory locations. The other two possible bit patterns indicated no indexing, or indirect addressing.|$|E
50|$|Basic mode {{is another}} whole form of {{instruction}} formats and addressing. Basic mode provides compatibility with previous systems {{back to the}} 1108. For all practical purposes, the hardware architecture defines the rules by which addresses and instructions are converted to the above forms. The most obvious difference in basic mode {{is the lack of}} explicit B registers in instructions. Instead there are four implicitly used B registers (B12-B15). There is a complex algorithm using the limits of the banks represented by those B registers, the <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> and the B register within which the current instruction is found.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{patterns}} for this first half-byte indicated a 2-operand instruction."0000" [...] meant both <b>operands</b> were <b>addressed</b> by their direct 16-bit address."0100": operand 1 uses reg 1 as its base; operand 2 uses direct addressing."0110": operand 1 uses reg 1 as its base, operand 2 uses reg 2.And so on.|$|R
50|$|Because each drop of {{a result}} moves the prior belt content along to later {{positions}} in the queue, a given operand continually changes its position (and hence address) {{as a result of}} later execution. In effect, an access to the operand at position zero is a request for the most recent value dropped to the belt, while (for example) a reference to position five is to the sixth most recent drop. Thus the <b>addresses</b> of belt <b>operands</b> reflect the belt history over time. This is temporal addressing. It is hard for human programmers to keep track of belt contents, and hence <b>operand</b> <b>addresses,</b> when writing assembly code for a belt machine. However, it is easy for a compiler to track the changing contents and emit the correct position addresses in generated code.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the Orion's {{instruction}} set used a three-address form, with sixty-four 48-bit accumulators. Each program {{had its own}} private accumulator set which were the first 64 registers of its address space, which was a reserved contiguous subset of the physical store, defined by {{the contents of a}} [...] "datum" [...] relocation register. <b>Operand</b> <b>addresses</b> were relative to the datum, and could be modified by one of the accumulators for indexing arrays and similar tasks. A basic three-address instruction took a minimum of 64 µs, a two-address one 48 µs, and any index modifications on the addresses added 16 µs per modified address. Multiplication took from 156 to 172 µs, and division anywhere from 564 to 1,112 µs, although the average time was 574 µs. The Orion 2, having a core store with a much shorter cycle time, was considerably faster.|$|R
50|$|Microcode was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} simpler method of developing the control logic for a computer. Initially, CPU instruction sets were hardwired. Each step needed to fetch, decode, and execute the machine instructions (including any <b>operand</b> <b>address</b> calculations, reads, and writes) was controlled directly by combinational logic and rather minimal sequential state machine circuitry. While very efficient, the need for powerful instruction sets with multi-step addressing and complex operations (see below) made such hard-wired processors difficult to design and debug; highly encoded and varied-length instructions can contribute to this as well, especially when very irregular encodings are used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smallest}} addressable unit {{of memory}} was a 16-bit word (unlike the later PDP-11, which was addressable by byte), and the maximum possible address was 32,767, which would {{fit in a}} word with one bit left over. The most significant bit of any memory-reference instruction indicated indirect addressing: The word addressed by the instruction, instead of being the operand, contained the <b>operand</b> <b>address.</b> The most significant bit of that word could be set to indicate an additional level of indirect addressing, and this could be iterated any number of times, potentially in an infinite loop {{that could not be}} interrupted.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{instruction}} set architectures, such as Intel x86 and IBM/360 and its successors, have a Load effective address instruction.This performs a {{calculation of the}} effective <b>operand</b> <b>address,</b> but instead of acting on that memory location, it loads the address {{that would have been}} accessed into a register. This can be useful when passing the address of an array element to a subroutine. It may also be a slightly sneaky way of doing more calculations than normal in one instruction; for example, using such an instruction with the addressing mode [...] "base+index+offset" [...] (detailed below) allows one to add two registers and a constant together in one instruction.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{implement}} a Motorola 68008 op-code compatible mi-croprocessor capable of functioning on an FPGA. The CPU is to be specified fully in VHDL and is designed to emulate the functionality of the MC 68008 in terms of in-struction set decoding, <b>operand</b> <b>addressing</b> and bus operation. The ultimate target device is a custom designed FPGA-Board used in education of Computer Science and Engineering Students in TCD. As {{a result of this}} a large emphasis has been placed on structured, correct design flow and specification as well as readability of the code.

50|$|If {{a memory}} <b>address</b> <b>operand</b> is not 16-byte-aligned, a general {{protection}} exception (#GP) will be raised. This can cause strange interoperability bugs when ordinary code calls an external code that was compiled {{with the assumption}} of a 16-byte-aligned stack frame boundary.|$|R
50|$|A {{machine code}} {{instruction}} set may have all instructions {{of the same}} length, or it may have variable-length instructions. How the patterns are organized varies strongly with the particular architecture and often also {{with the type of}} instruction. Most instructions have one or more opcode fields which specifies the basic instruction type (such as arithmetic, logical, jump, etc.) and the actual operation (such as add or compare) and other fields that may give the type of the <b>operand(s),</b> the <b>addressing</b> mode(s), the addressing offset(s) or index, or the actual value itself (such constant operands contained in an instruction are called immediates).|$|R
