25|$|On 1 December 2002, the Sunday Times printed {{an extract}} {{of a speech}} made by Minister of State for Health, Balaji Sadasivan, an ethnically Indian {{neurosurgeon}} who was fluent in Mandarin. He said, 'Research has also shown that the brain of homosexuals is structurally different from heterosexuals. It is likely therefore that the homosexual tendency is imprinted in the brain in utero and homosexuals must live with the tendencies that they inherit {{as a result of}} the structural changes in their brain.

The marquis ultimately prevailed, adhering closely to his grandfather José Joaquim de Lima's steadfast loyalty to the Crown {{and respect for the}} law. By the time of his death, Francisco de Lima, a senator in his own right, had long since lost his former influence and had not held any office of importance for years. Nevertheless, Caxias and Francisco de Lima maintained a loving and respectful relationship to the very end, as may be seen in the few surviving letters between them. His relationship with other family members, however, was marred by resentment, as he told his wife years later: [...] "We are placed in the foreground <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>society,</b> causing even envy to your relatives and to mine as well." ...|$|E

500|$|Later, Rose {{explained}} his intent further in The Washington Post: [...] "The cartoonists treated Islam {{the same way}} they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>society,</b> not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims." [...] The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket ('The Threat from [...] the Darkness) condemning Islamic spiritual leaders [...] "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire." [...] In October 2005, Politiken, another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said {{they would be willing to}} draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.|$|E

At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>society.</b> To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." [...] A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said [...] "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Sentient animals, Cochrane argues, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed. Whether these prima facie rights translate into concrete rights depends on the situation in question. Cochrane explores the consequences of the account in his Animal Rights Without Liberation, arguing that, with very few exceptions, nonhuman animals have a concrete rights not to be killed or made to suffer in animal testing, animal agriculture, in entertainment, for environmental purposes and in cultural practices. Despite this, because Cochrane does not posit a right against use for nonhuman animals, his account is highly permissive when contrasted with other animal rights accounts. In a 2016 article, Cochrane extended his interest-based rights approach to include labour rights for nonhuman animals, on the basis that working animals are members <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>society</b> and workers. These rights include a right to representation in a union, a right to [...] "just and favourable remuneration", a right to safe and healthy conditions of work, and a right to time off from work.|$|E

In light of the challenges and complexities <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>societies</b> the tone is not celebratory nor evangelical. It is substantially empirical and hard-nosed in that it asks what prospects there are for re-engaging civil society to tackle the tough issues of youth offending, neighbourhood safety, antisocial behaviour, economic regeneration and conflict between civic groups. The malaise in civil society is seen as a key to understanding antisocial behaviour, the weaknesses of regeneration schemes and the divisions and antagonisms <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>societies.</b> Yet the resources and skills hidden away in civil society, if they could be unlocked, are seen as the key to effective intervention. The book concludes that citizens can be re-engaged providing the incentive structures and broader framing of the policy are put together in an effective manne...|$|R

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, rated [...] "Max" [...] an A−. VanDerWerff was unconvinced that the episode, along with [...] "Tempus Fugit", merited being stretched over two parts; however, {{he felt that}} the character of Fenig was [...] "a simultaneous paean to the many, many lives lost in this fictional war and a very real story about someone who could very well live on the edges <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>society,</b> driven mad by visions that are only real to himself, visions the rest of us would immediately disregard as unbelievable and surreal". Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Max" [...] one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's visual effects; however, s{{he felt that the}} two parts of the story would have better served as [...] "a taut one-hour episode". Vitaris also felt that the episode's final act, featuring Mulder on an airplane, saw Mulder uncharacteristically putting civilians at risk and was an example of [...] "out and out bad writing". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, describing it as [...] "tighty, satisfying, witty and touching". Shearman noted that the second half of two-part episodes in the series tended to [...] "drop the ball", but felt that the story arc of [...] "Tempus Fugit" [...] and [...] "Max" [...] was [...] "very solid", calling them [...] "the most satisfying [...] "event" [...] multiparter that The X-Files has ever done".|$|E
500|$|Following [...] "The Puppy Episode", Ellen was renewed {{for another}} season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental {{advisory}} warning. DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It was like this voice like you're entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you don't think that's going to affect ratings?" [...] DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series The Drew Carey Show and Spin City which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). [...] "There's no disclaimer on [...] at all, because it's two heterosexual men, and they're making fun of heterosexuality... because neither (Michael J. Fox nor Michael Boatman) is really gay in real life." [...] Episodes after [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] dealt with Ellen's coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and learning more about the LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including Chaz Bono, formerly known as Chastity Bono, who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, [...] " [...] is so gay it's excluding a large part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>society.</b> A lot of the stuff on it is somewhat of an inside joke. It's one thing to have a gay lead character, but it's another when every episode deals with specific gay issues." [...] Bono would later say that the comments were taken out of context. Ellen was canceled after its fifth season.|$|E
