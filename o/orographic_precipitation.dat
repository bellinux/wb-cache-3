In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic Oscillation, {{also known}} as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode is the main factor in tropospheric {{circulation}} variability south of 20oS and is characterized by pressure anomalies with one situated in the Antarctic and one situated in a band at around 40–50oS around the globe. It mainly affects middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the north–south displacement of the westerly wind belt that circle around Antarctica. Such variation in the position of the westerly wind belt affects the intensity and position of cold fronts and mid latitude storm systems and is partly responsible for variation in precipitation in the southern parts of Argentina. The Antarctic Oscillation is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. A positive phase is when the westerly wind belt is displaced to the south. The positive phase occurs when there is increased surface pressure over the southern parts of the South American continent and decreased pressure in Antarctica. This results in stronger westerly winds in the southern parts of the country while preventing cold fronts from penetrating inland, producing more stable conditions. Furthermore, the positive phase leads to warmer conditions south of 40oS, particularly during the summer in areas between 40–60oS. Precipitation is lower due to less frontal and <b>orographic</b> <b>precipitation</b> resulting from reduced westerly wind flow between 40–60OS. Opposite conditions occur in the negative phase when the westerly wind belt is shifted equatorward. Cold fronts moving northwards from the south penetrate more frequently, leading to more precipitation and cooler temperatures during the negative phase. The major effect of negative phase of the Antarctic Oscillation occurs in spring when it increases precipitation over southeastern South America.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSoil {{inventories}} of anthropogenic radionuclides were investigated in altitudinal transects in 2 French regions, Savoie and Montagne Noire. Rain was negligible in these 2 areas {{the days after}} the Chernobyl accident. Thus anthropogenic radionuclides are coming hypothetically only from Global Fallout following Atmospheric Nuclear Weapon Tests. This is confirmed by the isotopic signatures (238 Pu/ 239 þ 240 Pu; 137 Cs/ 239 þ 240 Pu; and 241 Am/ 239 þ 240 Pu) close to Global Fallout value. In Savoie, a peat core age-dated by 210 Pbex confirmed that the main part of deposition of anthropogenic radionuclides occurred during the late sixties and the early seventies. In agreement with previous studies, the anthropogenic radionuclide inventories are well correlated with the annual precipitations.

30|$|Landslide {{dams and}} other natural river {{blockages}} such as moraine dams and glacier-ice dams are formed in narrow valleys bordered by oversteepened slopes. Active geological processes in these settings such as erosion and weathering often lead to the availability of highly fractured and hydrothermally altered bedrock which constitute source materials for hillslope processes and landslide dam formation (Costa and Schuster 1988; Clague and Evans 1994; Korup et al. 2010). These potentially dangerous natural phenomena occur mostly in seismically-active regions where high <b>orographic</b> <b>precipitations</b> on rugged mountain terrain associated with frequent earthquakes and snowmelt contribute to several geological processes that lead to mass wasting and river-damming landslides (Korup and Tweed 2007; Allen et al. 2011; Evans et al. 2011; Crosta et al. 2013). Failure of landslide dams could trigger the sudden release of stored water masses from lakes created by these damming events. This consequently produces catastrophic outburst floods and debris flows that inundate the downstream areas, causing loss of lives and infrastructural damage (O'Connor and Costa 2004; Bonnard 2011; Plaza et al. 2011). For example, the worst recorded case of landslide dam disaster occurred during the 1786 Kangding-Luding earthquake in Sichuan Province, southwest China (Dai et al. 2005). The earthquake triggered a huge landslide which dammed the Dadu River but failed ten days later and generated a catastrophic outburst flood that drowned more than 100, 000 people. Similarly, Chai et al. (2000) presented a comprehensive account of the catastrophic failure of three landslide dams (Dahaizi, Xiaohaizi, and Deixi), triggered by the August 1933, Ms 7.5 earthquake in Diexi town, Sichuan Province, China. These landslide dams failed two months later, triggering catastrophic outburst floods that traveled more than 250  km downstream, and claimed about 2, 423 lives. Therefore, timely evaluation of landslide dams is important for prevention of catastrophic dam failures and mitigation of disasters caused by downstream flooding of the released water masses.|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of ice-rafted sediments in deep-sea cores recovered from northeast Greenland, in the Fram Strait, {{and south of}} Greenland indicated the more or less continuous {{presence of}} either an ice sheet or ice sheets covering significant parts of Greenland for the last 18 million years. From about 11 million years ago to 10 million years ago, the Greenland Ice Sheet was greatly reduced in size. The Greenland Ice Sheet formed in the middle Miocene by coalescence of ice caps and glaciers. There was an intensification of glaciation during the Late Pliocene. Ice sheet formation occurred in connection to uplift of the West Greenland and East Greenland uplands. The Western and Easter Greenland mountains constitute passive continental margins that were uplifted in two phases, 10 and 5 million years ago, in the Miocene epoch.

Beyond the first slopes of the Andes into the valleys, the air descends, warming adiabatically, and becoming drier than on the eastern slopes.

40|$|Exhumation of the {{southern}} Tibetan plateau margin reflects interplay between surface and lithospheric dynamics within the Himalaya–Tibet orogen. We report thermochronometric data from a 1. 2 -km elevation transect within granitoids of the eastern Lhasa terrane, southern Tibet, which indicate rapid exhumation exceeding 1 km/Ma from 17 – 16 to 12 – 11 Ma followed by very slow exhumation to the present. We hypothesize that these changes in exhumation occurred in response {{to changes in the}} loci and rate of rock uplift and the resulting southward shift of the main topographic and drainage divides from within the Lhasa terrane to their current positions within the Himalaya. At ∼ 17 Ma, steep erosive drainage networks would have flowed across the Himalaya and greater amounts of moisture would have advected into the Lhasa terrane to drive large-scale erosional exhumation. As convergence thickened and widened the Himalaya, the <b>orographic</b> barrier to <b>precipitation</b> in southern Tibet terrane would have strengthened. Previously documented midcrustal duplexing around 10 Ma generated a zone of high rock uplift within the Himalaya. We use numerical simulations as a conceptual tool to highlight how a zone of high rock uplift could have defeated transverse drainage networks, resulting in substantial drainage reorganization. When combined with a strengthening <b>orographic</b> barrier to <b>precipitation,</b> this drainage reorganization would have driven the sharp reduction in exhumation rate we observe in southern Tibet...|$|R

This implies that multifractal diagnostics of moist processes for these simulations are fundamentally transient, exhibiting complex nonlinear behavior depending on atmospheric conditions and terrain forcing at each location. A particularly robust behavior found here is the transition of the multifractal parameters between stable and unstable cases, which has a clear physical correspondence to the transition from stratiform to organized (banded and cellular) convective regime. This result is reinforced by a similar behavior in the horizontal spectral exponent.

This analysis has been recently extended to the entire French radar network so as to implement a nationwide, three-dimensional reflectivity and wind field mosaic to be eventually delivered to forecasters and modellers, as well as automatic nowcasting systems for air traffic management purposes. In this composite analysis, data collected by all 24 radars of the French radar network are collected, pre-processed and combined in real time at intervals of 15 minutes to retrieve the complete wind vector (u,v,w) and reflectivity fields at a horizontal resolution of 2. 5 km within a domain of approximately 1000 × 1000 × 12 km 3.

The characteristics of these flow regimes are 1) regime I: flow with an upstream-propagating convective system and an early, slowly moving convective system over the mountain; 2) regime II: flow with a long-lasting orographic convective system over the mountain peak, upslope, or lee slope; 3) regime III: flow with an orographic convective or mixed convective and stratiform precipitation system over the mountain and a downstream-propagating convective system; and 4) regime IV: flow with an <b>orographic</b> stratiform <b>precipitation</b> system over the mountain and possibly a downstream-propagating cloud system.

40|$|The Mediterranean area {{concentrates}} {{the major}} natural risks {{related to the}} water cycle, including heavy precipitation and flash-flooding during the fall season. The capability to predict such high-impact events remains weak because of the contribution of very fine-scale processes and their non-linear interactions with the larger scale processes. These societal and science issues motivate the HyMeX (Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment, [URL] experimental programme.

The observation strategy of HyMEX is organized in a long-term (4 years) Enhanced Observation Periods (EOP) and short-term (2 months) Special Observation Periods (SOP). HyMEX has identified 3 main Mediterranean target areas: North-West (NW), Adriatic (A) and South-East (SE). Within each target area several hydrometeorological sites for heavy rainfall and flash flooding have been set up. The hydrometeorological sire in Central Italy (CI) is interested by both western and eastern fronts coming from the Atlantic Ocean and Siberia, respectively. <b>Orographic</b> <b>precipitations</b> play an important role due to the central Apennine range, which reaches nearly 3000 m (Gran Sasso peak). Moreover, convective systems commonly develop in CI during late summer and beginning of autumn, often causing localized hailstorms with cluster organized cells. Western fronts may heavily hit the Tiber basin crossing large urban areas (Rome), whereas eastern fronts can cause flash floods along the Adriatic coastline. Two major basins are involved within Cl region: Tiber basin (1000 km long) and its tributary Aniene and the Aterno-Pescara basin (300 km long). The first HyMeX SOP 1. 1 was carried out from Sept. till Nov. 2012 in the NW target area The Italian SOP 1. 1 was coordinated by the Centre of Excellence CETEMPS, University of L'Aquila, a city located in the CI heart. The CI area was covered by a uniquely dense meteorological instrumentation thanks to a synergy between Italian institutions and NASA-GSFC. The following RADARs were operated: a Doppler single-polarization C-band radar located at Mt Midia; the Polar 55 C Doppler dual-polarization C-band radar located in Rome; a Doppler C-hand polarimetric radar located at Il Monte (Abnazo); a polarimetric X-band mini-radar in L' Aquila; a polarimetric X-hand portable mini-radar in Rome; a single-polarization X-band mini-radar in Rome. DISDROMETERs were also deployed: 4 Parsivel optical disdrometers in Rome (at Sapienza, CNR-ISAC and CNR-INSEAN); 1 2 D-video disdrometer in Rome; 3 Parsivels optical disdrometer respectively in L'Aquila (Abnazo), Avezzano (Abruzzo) and Pescara (Abnazo).
