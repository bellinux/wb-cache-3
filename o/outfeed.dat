40|$|The {{scope of}} this work is in {{simulating}} an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) and validating that the system works as expected. AS/RSs can be complex systems and development project of an AS/RS can last for several years. Therefore, there is need for a solution that helps the stakeholders to validate that the designed system works as expected. The solution offered in this work is discrete-event simulation of an AS/RS. The simulated example AS/RS consists of stacker cranes moving on aisles, high bay racking, industrial robots, conveyor system, AGV connection, and packing stations. The amount of devices and high capacity requirements make the simulated system complex. The simulated system is under development during the thesis writing process {{so most of the}} details about the system functionality are available. However, some uncertainty causing assumptions are required to simulate the AS/RS. The goal of this work is divided in three research questions. The first research question is concerning the requirements for simulation platform to simulate an AS/RS. The identified requirements are general flexibility and usability requirements; ability to model required devices, warehouse management system, and material flow; and ability to gather the required performance measurements. The second research question deals with the material flow simulations. The material flow simulations present that the example AS/RS can fill the required maximum infeed amounts but <b>outfeed</b> amounts cannot be filled. The reason for this is too low capacity of industrial robots. The third research question is about sensitivity analysis. Firstly, the results present that the realized <b>outfeed</b> amounts are sensitive for variation in robot movement times. If times increase, the realized <b>outfeed</b> amounts decrease significantly. Secondly, the realized infeed amounts are slightly sensitive for total delay of stacker cranes. If delay increases, the realized infeed amount drops a bit. Thirdly, the example AS/RS is not sensitive for variation in storage utilization. This is the benefit of random storage strategy. Based on the results of this work, the industrial robots are the bottleneck of the example AS/RS. On average, the utilization ratios of industrial robots are 97 % during the maximum infeed and <b>outfeed</b> amount simulations. With better routing of the piles, also the rest of the capacity could be utilized that would lead to higher realized infeed and <b>outfeed</b> amounts. However, then the system would be quite unreliable. Based on the results of this work, the industrial robots require more capacity if designed capacity of the system is required to be filled...|$|E
30|$|Technological {{developments}} in measurements, communication, control and monitoring of power grids {{have brought a}} paradigm shift in the protection philosophy of transmission lines. The reliability of power system has been enhanced by early detection of wide-area disturbances and optimal utilization of assets. Some of the protection methodologies based on Synchrophasor measurements are discussed here. Lin et al. [13] demonstrated the performance of PMU based fault location algorithm on MTLs. Faults are identified and located using synchronized positive sequence voltage and current phasors. Further, for accurate fault detection and location in MTLs, Brahma [14] has employed time-stamped voltage and current phasors obtained from all the terminals. Ting Wu et al. [15] have formed a novel fault location technique for multi-section non-homogeneous transmission lines. However, the accuracy of [14, 15] may be lost in case of medium and long MTLs. For decades, the distance protection is widely employed {{for the protection of}} transmission lines as it is simple and fast. The distance protection can protect most of the protected line, and it is virtually independent of the source impedance. However, the performance and the reliability of the distance protection are influenced by infeed and <b>outfeed</b> currents in MTLs [16 – 18].|$|E

The aim of the thesis was to show the basic differences in providing PEC by the Army of the Czech Republic in comparison with the system of emergency medical services of the Czech Republic and then {{to find out what the}} specific qualifications for a paramedic´s profession are. I tried to demonstrate this knowledge both by the practical part of the thesis and by its theoretical part. The theoretical part deals with the problems of reaching the paramedic post of the ACR either the Combat Medic or Combat Lifesaver, by required education and necessary courses. Then the thesis deals with providing PEC in the battlefield, up to Role 1, when the wounded person is given the first aid by paramedics. The practical part meant the qualitative research in the form of semi-structured interview and research questions. There I managed to achieve particular aims of the thesis thanks to the interviews with the respondents of the medical personnel of the ACR and the respondents of emergency medical services. All the inverviewed medical personnel of the ACR had to participate in at least one foreign mission. Among the respondents were both the CLS trained soldiers, Combat Medics, and even one medical corps doctor. The thesis is a contribution to the paramedics of the ACR and paramedics in general who could learn more about the problems of providing PEC in extreme circumstances or possibly consolidate the knowledge they have. The research showed that the basic differences in providing PEC between the interviewed groups (it means the military paramedics and paramedics) are above all external factors, the terrain, and material or even the kind of wound or the hierarchy of the medical personnel of the foreign mission. The research also outlines the specifics necessary for exercising an ACR paramedic´s profession, and those are the courses they take before a foreign mission...|$|E
40|$|Collar forming is a {{tractive}} compressive forming {{technique to}} turn up a closed component border, often a circular hole in a sheet metal or sheet metal component. Today, high-strength steel materials with a reduced deformation capability compared to a smoother deep drawing grade are used increasingly in collar forming due to developments in lightweight body production. This is {{at the expense of}} the constructive claim for preferably high collar heights. In many applications collar shapes requiring an expansion close to the maximum expansion possibility of the sheet metal component are produced. Negative influences on material ductility caused by batch deviations and further process deviations while handling the components can cause undesirable and irregularly appearing cracking during the collar forming process. Visual supervision by the staff at the <b>outfeed</b> conveyor is a limited possibility depending on the cracking type and size and further circumstances in the processing environment. If crack-containing components are not identified and sorted out early in the process chain, they can be joined to the shell or even be delivered to the customer in the corresponding assembly. The project's objective was to develop and validate a non-destructive test method to detect cracks in collar forming respectively components containing a collar automatically. The suitability of the considered test methods has been evaluated in terms of this application. Non-destructive post-process methods and an in-process method were used. Besides inductive thermal imaging, eddy current testing and electromagnetic ultrasound, noise emission analysis has been performed. Laboratory samples containing a collar of high-strength steel materials and an aluminium alloy have been consulted as objects of investigation. Samples with a wide range of both natural and artificial cracks were used to validate the test methods. Parts from serial processes have also been included. Two test concepts based on the investigations realized were created with regards to the process accompanying and integrated application of crack detection. The first concept uses an EMUS test system whose sensory components can be integrated into the transfer press' space. In the simple case, the EMUS test can be integrated into the transfer press as an own test step at the end of the process chain. The integration of the EMUS sensors directly to the collar forming tool is basically possible. In every case the sensors have to be tailored to the height and diameter of the collar geometry. The collar geometry testable with EMUS brings specific requirements. In the second test concept based on inductive thermal imaging any collar geometry can be tested if optically accessible. The necessary demand of space for mounting such a test system is significantly higher than with EMUS. Therefore this test concept cannot be integrated into the transfer press or even into the tool. The thermal imaging test system can be installed at the conveyor as a continuous inline test method. The objective of the project was achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{scarcity of}} surface area around airports can cause {{conflicts between the}} various stakeholders {{if one of the}} stakeholders likes to expand. In order to use the available area as efficient as possible, air cargo companies such as KLM Cargo must find a sustainable solution to remain competitive in the market. Combining two separate manual sorting and storing processes in the Mail and Express (Equation) products may provide this sustainable solution. When a design has been made for a combined automated sorter with regard to a roughly expected growth in demand, the expected effects on an operational level of combining the two processes is still largely unknown. As the complex in- and outflow processes of various commodities might encounter certain constraints in the system, since it is not as flexible as in the current situation. When a constrained in the system has been reached, this can cause the performance of the system to decrease, possibly resulting in a lower quality of the products handled. In order to have an indication at which moment the constraints of the combined automated sorting system have been reached an extensive data analysis and modelling study has been performed on the performance of the combined automated air cargo sorting system. By first analyzing the current demand patterns and then using various future scenarios to vary these scenarios, the input for the models is obtained. Also, the KPI’s for the new system are determined. Next, the performance-critical processes are determined regarding the determined KPI’s using the Theory of Constraints, literature and experts. These processes will now further be analyzed regarding the various future scenarios in a discrete-event simulation study and a static model. The simulation study resulted in the localization of the bottleneck in the system and how this effects the system given the uncertain future demand patterns in 2035. It was found that in high overall demand patterns and peak days, the system was not able to process the demand. Various solution strategies have been tested and implemented in the model, such as a configuration change and the implementation of a nightshift in order to process the higher loads and mitigate the found constraints, resulting in a functional system during these demand scenarios. The effects of combining can generally be seen as a consideration between lower costs and a decrease in product differentiation. Mail products can now be handled more ergonomically and more efficient, Equation products will have a decline in quality as the less flexible in- and <b>outfeed</b> may result in longer cut-off times. The study provides a stepwise approach into analyzing the expected performance of similar combined automated air cargo hubs. It also shows the limitation of the Goldratt’s TOC, which cannot be applied directly to a complex input-output system with multiple interacting (contra) flows. A discrete-event simulation study provides a powerful tool to assess the performance and pinpoint the most constraining process in these complex input-output systems.

40|$|Electric {{power systems}} {{are among the}} most complex man made systems on the world. Most of the time, they operate under quasi-steady state. With the ever {{increasing}} load demand and the advent of the deregulated power market recently, the power systems are pushed more often to operate close to their design limits and with more uncertainty of the system operating mode. With the increasing complexity and more interconnected systems, power systems are operating closer to their performance limits. As a result, maintaining system security and facilitating efficient system operation have been challenging tasks. Transmission systems are considered the most vital components in power systems connecting both generating/substation and consumer areas with several interconnected networks. In the past, they were owned by regulated, vertically integrated utility companies. They have been designed and operated so that conditions in close proximity to security boundaries are not frequently encountered. However, in the new open access environment, operating conditions tend to be much closer to security boundaries, as transmission use is increasing in sudden and unpredictable directions. Transmission unbundling, coupled with other regulatory requirements, has made new transmission facility construction more difficult. Unfortunately these transmission lines are frequently subjected {{to a wide variety of}} faults. Thus, providing proper protective functions for them is essential. Generally the protection of Extra High Voltage (EHV) and Ultra High Voltage (UHV) transmission lines are carried out by the use of distance relays in view of the fact that they provide fast fault clearance and system coordination. Transmission line relaying involves detection, classification and location of transmission line faults. Fast detections of faults enable quick isolation of the faulty line from service and hence, protecting it from the harmful effects of fault. Classification of faults means identification of the type of fault and faulted line section, and this information is required for finding the fault location and assessing the extent of repair work to be carried out. Accurate fault location is necessary for facilitating quick repair and restoration of the line, to improve the reliability and availability of the power supply. Generally, the protection system using conventional distance relaying algorithm involves three zones. The first zone (Z 1) of the relay is set to detect faults on 80 % 90 % of the protected line without any intentional time delay. The second zone (Z 2) is set to protect the remainder of the line plus an adequate margin. Second zone relays are time delayed for 1530 cycles to coordinate with relays at remote bus. The settings of the third zone (Z 3) ideally will cover the protected line, plus all of the longest line leaving the remote station. Z 3 of a distance relay is used to provide the remote backup protection in case of the failure of the primary protection. Since Z 3 covers an adjacent line, a large infeed (<b>outfeed)</b> from the remote terminal causes the relay to underreach (overreach). Thus, a very large load at the remote terminal may cause distance relays to mal-operate. Settings for conventional distance relays are selected to avoid overreach/underreach operation under the worst case scenarios. Studies of significant power system disturbances reported by North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) indicate that protective relays are involved, one way or another, in 75 % of the major disturbances and the most troublesome ones are backup protection relays. With their limited view of the interconnected network based on their locally measured inputs, conventional backup protection relays generally take actions to protect a localized region of the network without considering the impact on the whole network. Relay mal-operations or unintended operations due to overload, power swing, and relay hidden failure are the main factors contributing to the blackouts. Most of the problems are associated with relays tripping too many healthy lines. Since a relay makes the decision automatically to remove a component from the system according to its internal mechanism, the relay mal-operation or unintended operation can make an effective influence on the system stability. Approaches to reduce the relay misbehavior need to be identified. Real time monitoring tools to assess the relay misbehavior are needed, providing the system operator, the accurate information about unfolding events. Existing transmission line protection scheme still has drawbacks. Advanced fault analysis mechanism to enhance the system dependability and security simultaneously is desirable. Relay settings play a significant role in major blackouts. So correct settings should be calculated and coordinated by suitable studies. Attempts are to be made to employ highly accurate AI techniques in protective system implementation. The research work focussed on developing knowledge based intelligent tools for the improving the transmission system security. A process to obtain knowledgebase using SVMs for ready post-fault diagnosis purpose is developed. SVMs are used as Intelligent tool for identifying the faulted line that is emanating from a substation and finding the distance from the substation. The approach uses phasor values of the line voltages and currents after the fault has been detected. The approach is particularly important for post-fault diagnosis of any mal-operation of relays following a disturbance in the neighboring line connected to the same substation. This may help in improving the fault monitoring/diagnosis process and coordination of the protective relays, thus assuring secure operation of the power systems. The approach based on SVMs, exploits the first part of this goal. For comparison, a classifier and regression tools based on the RBFNNs was also investigated. The RBFNNs and SVM networks are introduced and considered as an appropriate tool for pattern recognition problems. Results on a practical 24 Bus equivalent EHV transmission system of Indian Southern region and on IEEE 39 bus New England system are presented to illustrate the proposed method. In a large connected power network, the number of generators are more in number and their set patterns number will be large. As the line flows are sensitive to generator set patterns, it is difficult to consider all the combinations of generators while simulating the training and testing patterns as input to SVMs. To simulate the training and testing patterns corresponding to possible changes in line flows to meet the load in the present deregulated environment, line flow sensitive generators set to be identified/merit-listed. In this regard, to identify the most sensitive generators for a particular line of interest, a method from the literature is adopted and developed a software program based on the graph theory concepts. Case studies on generator contributions towards loads and transmission lines are illustrated on an equivalent 33 bus system, a part of Indian Northern grid with major part of Uttar Pradesh and also with an equivalent 246 bus system of practical Indian Southern grid. A distance relay coordination approach is proposed using detailed simulation studies, taking into account various operating conditions and fault resistances. Support Vector Machines as a pattern classifier is used for obtaining distance relay coordination. The scheme uses the apparent impedance values observed during fault as inputs. SVMs are used to build the underlying concept between reach of different zones and the impedance trajectory during fault. An improved performance with the use of SVMs, keeping the reach when faced with different fault conditions as well as line flow changes are illustrated with an equivalent 246 bus system of practical Indian Southern grid and also with an equivalent 265 bus system of practical Indian Western grid. A strategy of Supportive System is described to aid the conventional protection philosophy in combating situations where protection systems are mal-operated and/or information is missing and provide selective and secure coordination. Highly accurate identification/discrimination of zones plays a key role in effective implementation of the region-wide supportive system. This typically requires a multiclass SVM classifier to effectively analyze/build the underlying concept between reach of different zones and the apparent impedance trajectory during fault. Different multiclass methods are compared for their performance with respect to accuracy, number of iterations, number of support vectors, training and testing time. The performance analysis of these methods is presented on three data sets belonging to the training and testing patterns of three supportive systems for a region, part of a network, which is an equivalent 265 bus system of practical Indian Western grid...|$|E
