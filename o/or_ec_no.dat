40|$|Vène wood (Pterocarpus erinaceus Poir.) is {{currently}} the favorite wood for manufacture of xylophone in Mali. A dynamic analysis method with free boundary conditions, known as BING, {{was used to determine}} the main acoustic properties: specific dynamic modulus (EL/?), damping coefficient or internal friction (tan ?), sound radiation coefficient (SRC) and peak response (PR). The aim was to investigate the acoustic properties of vène wood (1) along three radial locations (internal: IHW, median: MHW, external: EHW); (2) related to two geographic origins (Guinean and Soudanian areas); and (3) to investigate the effect of ring width (RW), basic density (Db) and extractive content (EC) on these properties. High correlations were shown between tan ? with EL/? and EC. tan? decrease with increasing EL/? <b>or</b> <b>EC.</b> <b>No</b> significant difference of SRC was found between the geographic areas and the radial locations. No correlation between RW and acoustic properties was observed. EL, EL/? and PR were significantly higher for wood from the Guinean area than from the Soudanian area and also higher for EHW and MHW than for IHW. tan? follows inverse trends. These results could explain why the Malian xylophone makers empirically use only the wood from EHW and MHW. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
30|$|The {{geometric}} {{means of}} half-lives of CPY in soils, sediments, and surface waters {{were less than}} the thresholds for classification of a compound as being persistent in soils, sediments, and water under the SC <b>or</b> <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No.</b> 1107 / 2009. These conclusions {{are the same as}} those reached in an assessment of all the data on persistence in the earlier assessment by Mackay et al. [15].|$|R
3000|$|While both CPY and CPYO are {{classified}} as [...] "toxic", based on the assessment of persistence and bioaccumulation, all the lines of evidence suggest that neither would be classified as persistent or bioaccumulative under the SC <b>or</b> <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No.</b> 1107 / 2009. Based on the analysis of LRT, neither CPY nor its most toxic transformation product, CPYO, would be transported at sufficiently great concentrations to cause adverse effects in humans or the environment in remote areas. Based on the simple criterion for toxicity in <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No.</b> 1107 / 2009, CPY (and by extension, CPYO) would be classified as toxic; however, when a more refined assessment of ‘risk' is considered instead of ‘hazard,' it does not present unacceptable risks to humans or organisms in the environment. Based on {{the wording of the}} SC, CPY and CPYO do not present a significant adverse risk to humans and the environment. These conclusions are based on the selection of higher quality data but are similar to those reached by inclusion of all the data [15].|$|R
40|$|Here, we {{demonstrate}} that the metabolism of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) to nitric oxide (NO) occurs not only in bovine aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) but also in endothelial cells (ECs) and that this biotransformation is enhanced by pretreatment with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Two bioassay systems were used: inhibition of platelet aggregation and measurement of cGMP after stimulation by NO of guanylate cyclase in SMCs <b>or</b> <b>ECs.</b> In addition, <b>NO</b> produced from GTN by cells was measured as nitrite (NO 2 -), one of its breakdown products. Indomethacin (10 microM) -treated SMCs <b>or</b> <b>ECs</b> enhanced the platelet inhibitory activity of GTN. This effect was abrogated by coincubation with oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb; 10 microM), indicating release of NO from GTN. LPS (0. 5 microgram/ml; 18 h) enhanced at least 2 - to 3 -fold the capacity of SMCs <b>or</b> <b>ECs</b> to form <b>NO</b> from GTN, and this enhancement was attenuated when cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) was incubated together with LPS. Furthermore, when incubated with GTN (200 microM) SMCs <b>or</b> <b>ECs</b> treated with LPS (0. 5 microgram/ml; 18 h) released more NO from GTN than nontreated cells as indicated by a much higher (8 - to 9 -fold) increase in the levels of cGMP. Exposure of SMCs to GTN (600 microM) for 30 min led {{to an increase in}} the levels of NO 2 - dependent on cell numbers, which was enhanced when SMCs were treated with LPS. Incubation of nontreated or LPS-treated cells with NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (300 microM; 60 min) did not influence the metabolism of GTN to NO. SMCs failed to enhance the antiplatelet activity of sodium nitroprusside. Anesthetized rats treated with an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (20 mg/kg) 18 h beforehand showed enhanced hypotensive responses to GTN (0. 25 - 1 mg/kg). These effects were blocked by methylene blue (10 mg/kg) but not by indomethacin (3 mg/kg). LPS did not alter the hypotensive responses induced by phentolamine, verapamil, or SIN- 1. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo, LPS induces the enzyme(s) metabolizing GTN to NO...|$|R
30|$|A {{characteristic}} of POPs is biomagnification or trophic transfer in food chains, and this provides {{another line of}} evidence to assess CPY. Only one study was found on movement of CPY in food webs. Several current-use pesticides were measured in a terrestrial food web in the Canadian Arctic [97], and CPY was detected frequently in moss and mushrooms (83 % to 86 %) but at lesser frequency in lichens, willow, and grass (44 % to 50 %). Concentrations ranged from 0.87 ng/g l. ms. in moss to 0.07 ng/g l. ms. in lichen. Concentrations in caribou muscle and total body burden provided BMFs of 7.8 and 5.1 compared to lichen; however, the BMF from caribou to wolf was < 0.10 (based on concentrations < MDL). Trophic magnification factors for the lichen-caribou-wolf food chain were all < 1 for muscle, liver, and total body burden. That small concentrations of CPY {{were found in the}} Arctic is indicative of some long-range transport, but the lack of BMF between caribou and wolf and TMFs of < 1 are indicators of no significant trophic magnification of CPY in the food chain. These additional lines of evidence support the laboratory and microcosm data, which indicate that CPY does not trigger the criterion for bioaccumulation under the SC <b>or</b> <b>EC</b> Regulation <b>No.</b> 1107 / 2009.|$|R
