5|$|As news of Gen. Robert E. Lee's {{surrender}} on April 9, 1865, {{reached the}} department, soldiers deserted the Confederacy in droves. On April 19, Smith consolidated the District of Arkansas with the District of West Louisiana; the combined district was put under Buckner's command. On May 9, Smith made Buckner {{his chief of}} staff. Rumors began to swirl in both Union and Confederate camps that Smith and Buckner would not surrender, but would fall back to Mexico with soldiers who remained loyal to the Confederacy. Though Smith did cross the Rio Grande, he learned on his arrival that Buckner had traveled to New Orleans on May 26 and arranged terms <b>of</b> <b>surrender.</b> Smith had instead instructed Buckner to move all the troops to Houston, Texas.|$|E

5|$|Daud Khan, who {{launched}} his invasion starting from Patna on 3 April 1660, attacked south of Gaya district and finally {{arrived at the}} Palamu Forts on 9 December 1660. The terms <b>of</b> <b>surrender</b> and payment of tribute were not acceptable to the Chiros'; Daud Khan wanted complete conversion of all Hindus under the Chiro rule to Islam. Following this, Khan mounted a series of attacks on the forts. Chiros defended the forts but ultimately both forts were occupied by Daud Khan, and the Chiros fled to the jungles. Hindus were driven out, the temples were destroyed, and Islamic rule imposed.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Berlin (16 April 1945– 2 May 1945), Hitler and {{his staff}} lived in the {{underground}} Führerbunker while the Red Army approached. On 30 April, when Soviet troops were one or two blocks away from the Reich Chancellery, Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide in the Führerbunker. On 2 May, General Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov. Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor. Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide the next day after murdering their six children. On 4–8 May 1945, {{most of the remaining}} German armed forces surrendered unconditionally. The German Instrument <b>of</b> <b>Surrender</b> was signed 8 May, marking the end of the Nazi regime and the end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the signing}} of the {{instrument}} <b>of</b> <b>surrender,</b> many further surrender ceremonies took place across Japan's remaining holdings in the Pacific. Japanese forces in Southeast Asia surrendered on September 2, 1945, in Penang, September 10 in Labuan, September 11 in Kingdom of Sarawak and September 12 in Singapore. Taiwan's Retrocession Day (October 25), marked the end of Japanese rule of Taiwan and the subsequent rule by the Republic Of China government. It was not until 1947 that all prisoners held by America and Britain were repatriated. As late as April 1949, China still held more than 60,000 Japanese prisoners. Some, such as Shozo Tominaga, were not repatriated until the late 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In January 1945, {{elements}} of the Corps participated in the German capture of Travnik, part of Operation Lawine. Afterwards, they withdrew to Slovenia. On 30 April, Shteifon was killed while passing through Zagreb. Colonel Anatoly Rogozhin then took over as commander. On 12 May, Rogozhin surrendered to the British near Klagenfurt. Members of the Corps were allowed to resettle in the West once hostilities had ceased. At the time <b>of</b> <b>surrender,</b> the Corps consisted of 3,500 men, according to Vertepov. Timofejev writes that the Corps consisted of 5,584 men {{by the end of}} the war. Between 1941 and 1945, 6,709 of its members were killed, wounded or went missing. In total, 17,090 men served in its ranks over the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 7 May, Dönitz gave the order for all German {{military}} forces to unconditionally surrender, and on 8 May the German Instrument <b>of</b> <b>Surrender</b> was delivered to General Böhme. The Germans were to withdraw from all Norwegian towns and the Swedish border and gradually redeploy to areas pre-designated for disarmament; simultaneously, all senior Nazi party officials and security personnel were to immediately be arrested. Force 134 would be greatly outnumbered during its task; a total of 30,000 Allied troops would have to supervise the disarmament of more than 350,000 German troops. There were fears that the German forces might refuse to surrender and instead resist the Allied occupation forces, and there were particular concerns about what the large detachment of Kriegsmarine personnel at the port of Trondheim might do.|$|E
5|$|Morotai was {{the scene}} of a number <b>of</b> <b>surrender</b> ceremonies {{following}} the surrender of Japan. About 660 Japanese troops on Morotai capitulated to Allied forces after 15 August. The 93rd Division also accepted the surrender of the 40,000 Japanese troops at Halmahera on 26 August after the Japanese commander there was brought to Morotai on a US Navy PT boat. On 9 September 1945, Australian General Thomas Blamey accepted the surrender of the Japanese Second Army at a ceremony held on the I Corps' sports ground at Morotai. Private Teruo Nakamura, the last confirmed Japanese holdout on Morotai or elsewhere, was captured by Indonesian Air Force personnel on 18 December 1974.|$|E

5|$|On 11 December, Ali messaged the United Nations {{requesting}} a cease-fire, {{but it was}} not authorized by the President Yahya Khan and the fighting continued. Following several discussions and consultations, and subsequent attacks by the Indian forces, Khan decided to stop the war in order to save the lives of Pakistani soldiers. The actual decision to surrender was taken by Niazi on 15 December and was conveyed to Manekshaw through the United States Consul General in Dhaka (then Dacca) via Washington. But Manekshaw replied that he would stop the war only if the Pakistani troops surrendered to their Indian counterparts by 9:00a.m. on 16 December. Later the deadline was extended to 3:00p.m. of the same day at Niazi's request. The Instrument <b>of</b> <b>Surrender</b> was formally signed on 16 December 1971.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Emperor's speech varied–many Japanese simply listened to it, then went {{on with their lives}} as best they could, while some Army and Navy officers chose suicide over surrender. At a base north of Nagasaki, some Japanese Army officers, enraged at the prospect <b>of</b> <b>surrender,</b> pulled some 16 captured American airmen out of the base prison and hacked them to death with swords. A large, weeping crowd gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, with their cries sometimes interrupted by the sound of gunshots as military officers present committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Reinforced by {{aircraft}} from Sweden, United Nations peacekeepers {{completed the}} first phase of the operation, securing the Katangese capital, Élisabethville, and destroying much of the Katangese Air Force by the end of the year. In early January the United Nations forces turned their attention towards remaining strongholds in southern Katanga. Indian peacekeepers surpassed their orders and crossed the Lufira River ahead of schedule, generating panic behind the Katangese lines and embarrassing the United Nations leadership. Tshombe, realising that his position was untenable, sued Thant for peace. On 17January 1963, he signed an instrument <b>of</b> <b>surrender</b> and declared the Katangese secession to be over. The central government reorganised the provincial administration of Katanga to weaken its political structure. Tshombe initially participated but feared his arrest and fled to Europe.|$|E
