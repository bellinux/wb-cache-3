5|$|Fragments <b>of</b> <b>Him</b> <b>is</b> an indie {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Sassybot and released for PC and Xbox One on 3 May 2016 and 1 June 2016, respectively. A PlayStation 4 version is planned for release in 2017.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
5|$|Fragments <b>of</b> <b>Him</b> <b>is</b> a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around the world, with the player triggering snippets of narration by clicking on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, clicking on them will sometimes result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location to give the impression of them walking.|$|E

5|$|In 1560 the new Confession of Faith {{was adopted}} and ten dioceses were created anew, with the Isles shared between Ross and Argyll. Monro {{converted}} to Protestantism and {{was admitted to}} the new ministry for the parish of Kiltearn, to which he later added the adjacent Lemlair and Alness. He is said to have lived at Castle Craig, commuting across the Cromarty Firth to preach on Sundays. At Lammas 1563 he became one of three special Commissioners under the Bishop of Caithness responsible for creating new kirks. The duties were arduous but he retained his position for 12 years, despite occasional criticism by the General Assembly. The last record <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> dated 1574 and it is assumed he had died by 1576 when new ministers were appointed for Kiltearn, Lemlair and Alness. He never married and no extant stone marks his burial at Kiltearn, his written work being his sole monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Fragments <b>of</b> <b>Him</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} {{the life and death}} of Will, a man who dies early in the game. The player controls four characters throughout the game; Will, his ex-girlfriend, his boyfriend at the time when he died, and his grandmother. As the game progresses, it becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also on those of the other characters, and how they cope with his death. The game relies heavily on its narrative which, although the player controls the game in the first-person, is described by the developer as being viewed in a second-person perspective, i.e. where the player is not directly controlling a character but instead indicates what the characters should interact with next.|$|E

25|$|Eilmer was a monk of Malmesbury Abbey and {{is known}} to have written on astrology. All that is known <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> told in the Gesta regum Anglorum (Deeds of the English Kings), written by the eminent medieval {{historian}} William of Malmesbury in about 1125. Being a fellow monk of the same abbey, William almost certainly obtained his account directly from people who knew Eilmer himself when he was an old man.|$|E
25|$|Constantine's rule is hard {{to assess}} due to the {{shortness}} of his reign. As a Despot, he had shown ability, but {{the fall of the}} Empire to the Turks was by his time inevitable, no matter how able and energetic an Emperor sat on the throne. What is most remembered <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> the stubborn defence of his city against the odds, and his death in battle, through which he entered popular legend. Despite his Catholic confession, he is viewed as a saint by many Orthodox, and many legends were created about the ultimate fate of the last Constantine.|$|E
25|$|Jacob (Jacobus; {{sometimes}} James) Metius (after 15711624/1631) was a Dutch instrument-maker and {{a specialist}} in grinding lenses. He was born and died in Alkmaar and was the brother of Adriaan Adriaanszoon (simply called Metius). He {{is one of three}} people associated with the invention of the telescope, the other two being Hans Lippershey and Zacharias Janssen. Not much <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> known besides his 1608 patent application for the invention. He died in Alkmaar between 1624 and 1631. Metius may have made many inventions but kept them secret. Before his death he destroyed them all to prevent anyone else from claiming them.|$|E

25|$|Lakshmi, the Hindu {{goddess of}} wealth, fortune and {{prosperity}} (both material and spiritual), is {{the wife and}} active energy of Vishnu. She is also called Sri or Thirumagal because she {{is the source of}} eight auspicious strengths for Vishnu. When Vishnu incarnated on the Earth as the avatars Rama and Krishna, Lakshmi incarnated as his respective consorts: Sita (Rama's wife) and Rukmini (Krishna's wife). Lakshmi and Padmavati are wives of Lord Vishnu at Tirupati. In Hinduism, Lord Vishnu had incarnated as Lord Venkatachalapathi at Tirupati, although this grand form <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> not counted as one of the dasavatars.|$|E
25|$|Of all the {{classical}} philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally {{considered the most}} important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has {{very little to do with}} the historical figure of the same name. The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the Socratic problem.|$|E
500|$|A {{character}} in Somerset Maugham's 1930 novel Cakes and Ale, Alroy Kear, a sycophantic hack novelist, was widely interpreted by contemporaneous readers as a thinly veiled characterization of Walpole. [...] In {{response to a}} letter from Walpole, Maugham denied it: [...] "I certainly never intended Alroy Kear to be a portrait of you. He {{is made up of}} a dozen people and the greater part <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> myself." [...] Nine years after Walpole's death, however, Maugham admitted in an introduction to the 1950 Modern Library edition of Cakes and Ale that Walpole was indeed the model for his Kear character.|$|E

500|$|The ad was {{conceived}} {{by the agency}} Wieden+Kennedy. Copywriters Derek Barnes and Paul Renner were in a shopping mall when they noticed many of the youths around them wearing Air Jordan shoes, despite Jordan having retired in 2003: [...] "Just one look around the food court, you knew kids still waved his flag." [...] The creative directors were Kevin Proudfoot and Todd Waterbury. Waterbury explained, [...] "We thought {{of the fact that}} a version <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> alive in everyone that loves basketball. And there are moments in Jordan's career where you just say the move, or the game, and people who love the man, and love the sport, immediately can imagine that scene. Here, we were just taking advantage of those incredible moments." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{invited to}} Jack's office, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is asked {{whether or not}} she would mind having her former boyfriend, Dennis, appear on TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictional sketch comedy series. Since they last met, Dennis saved somebody's life at a subway station and has become a local celebrity. Liz and Dennis meet up where she agrees to let him appear on the show. Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is wary and warns Liz not to let herself fall in love with Dennis again. When Liz realizes she does still have {{feelings}} for him, an excuse to get rid <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> presented when Dennis' [...] "15 minutes of fame" [...] are up and Liz revokes her invitation. Liz later follows him to 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center subway station where he tries to regain his subway hero title by throwing her onto the tracks of an oncoming train.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1893 {{he married}} his distant cousin Marianne Schnitger, later a feminist activist and author {{in her own}} right, who was {{instrumental}} in collecting and publishing Weber's journal articles as books after his death, while her biography <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>is</b> an important source for understanding Weber's life. They would have no children and it is usually acknowledged that their marriage was never consummated. The marriage granted long-awaited financial independence to Weber, allowing him to finally leave his parents' household. The couple moved to Freiburg in 1894, where Weber was appointed {{professor of economics at}} the university, before accepting the same position at the University of Heidelberg in 1896. There Weber became a central figure in the so-called [...] "Weber Circle", composed of other intellectuals such as his wife Marianne, Georg Jellinek, Ernst Troeltsch, Werner Sombart and Robert Michels. Weber also remained active in the Verein and the Evangelical Social Congress. His research in that period was focused on economics and legal history.|$|E
