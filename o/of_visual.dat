40|$|All {{visual art}} must obey the laws <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> system. The first law {{is that an}} image <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> world is not {{impressed}} upon the retina, but assembled together in the visual cortex. Consequently, many <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> phenomena traditionally attributed to the eye actually occur in the cortex. Among these is visual motion. The second law {{is that of the}} functional specialization <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> cortex, by which we mean that separate attributes <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> scene are processed in geographically separate parts <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> cortex, before being combined to give a unified and coherent picture <b>of</b> the <b>visual</b> world...|$|R
