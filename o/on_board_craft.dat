6000|$|... "I do in {{a vessel}} of {{ordinary}} size, sir. I was so often <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>craft</b> {{that were in}} my father's hands for repair that I learned {{a good deal about}} them, and at any rate can trust myself to go aloft." ...|$|E
60|$|Nowhere does time pass {{more heavily}} than with most men-of-war's-men <b>on</b> <b>board</b> their <b>craft</b> in harbour.|$|R
60|$|Harry. Anything you like. (Proudly.) Sailor {{enough to}} be worth my salt <b>on</b> <b>board</b> any <b>craft</b> that swims the seas.|$|R
50|$|<b>On</b> <b>board</b> small <b>craft</b> (e.g. trawlers) to {{stop the}} {{occupant}} from rolling out of bed when the boat rolls in heavy weather. Here they are fixed, and lower than the hospital variety.|$|R

60|$|There {{could be}} no {{question}} but that the men were intending to break camp, and, uncertain as to what he should do, Jet watched until all the camp equipage had been stowed <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the <b>craft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: American troops <b>on</b> <b>board</b> {{a landing}} <b>craft</b> {{going in to}} land at Oran. November 1942.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who? I!" [...] He {{lifted his}} head so quickly as to startle her. [...] "I {{have nothing to say}} to him; and I'll never put my foot <b>on</b> <b>board</b> this <b>craft.</b> I've been told to go. That's enough." ...|$|R
60|$|Brigs and schooners, being {{light and}} handy craft, are {{generally}} used by pirates and smugglers {{in the prosecution}} of their lawless pursuits, and many a deed of bloodshed and horror has been done <b>on</b> <b>board</b> such <b>craft</b> by those miscreants.|$|R
6000|$|Burke {{shook his}} head. [...] "You may be sure if I {{considered}} {{it safe to}} run the two vessels together I would have been <b>on</b> <b>board</b> that <b>craft</b> long ago! But we couldn't do it,--certainly not with Mrs. Cliff on the yacht!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo, that's {{better than}} nothing," [...] he told himself, and righted the canoe, {{although}} not without difficulty. There {{was also a}} paddle on the beach, and soon he was <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the <b>craft</b> and paddling southward with all the skill he could command.|$|R
60|$|It was in January, {{three weeks}} after the first watch had been set, when {{one of the men who}} had been placed to watch the {{entrance}} to one of the monasteries leaped <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the <b>craft</b> and shook Cuthbert by the shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|... : Spike-ER {{missiles}} {{mounted in}} Typhoon MLS-ER Weapon Stations <b>on</b> <b>board</b> Multi-purpose Attack <b>Craft</b> (MPAC) Mk. 3, and Spike-NLOS for AW-159 Wildcat naval helicopters ...|$|R
5000|$|The Army Air Forces also {{issued a}} Balloon Observer Badge {{for those who}} served as co-pilots and support crew <b>on</b> <b>board</b> {{military}} balloon <b>craft.</b>|$|R
60|$|Not {{wishing to}} meet the lumber dealer again, now that they had made Lush Barrock a prisoner, Snap {{directed}} his chums to row out {{of the lake and}} on to the river. The boys pulled a good stroke and, despite the load <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the <b>craft,</b> made fair progress.|$|R
60|$|For half an {{hour the}} man {{continued}} his futile efforts {{to attract the attention}} of someone <b>on</b> <b>board</b> either <b>craft,</b> but to his dismay he saw them grow smaller and smaller until in a few hours they passed over the rim of the world, disappearing from his view forever.|$|R
6000|$|... “I thank you, sir. Will {{you please}} say that Stephen Embleton is <b>on</b> <b>board</b> this <b>craft,</b> that I am alone, and for certain reasons cannot leave it, and pray him either to come himself or {{to send a}} trusted officer with a party of sailors {{to take charge of}} it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A loose sail <b>on</b> <b>board</b> {{a racing}} <b>craft</b> is a {{dangerous}} thing," [...] he said, [...] "for there is no telling how much damage it will do." ...|$|R
50|$|Ramón Martín Huerta, {{his deputy}} and seven others crashed in cloud-shrouded {{mountains}} outside Mexico City on Wednesday September 21, 2005 killing everyone <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The <b>craft,</b> a Bell 412 helicopter, {{crashed into a}} wooded mountaintop about 11,200 feet (3700 m) high at a spot about 20 miles (30 km) outside Mexico City.|$|R
60|$|Were it not, that <b>on</b> <b>board</b> {{of other}} vessels, I myself had many a time dozed at the helm, {{spite of all}} struggles, I would have been almost {{at a loss to}} account for this heedlessness in my comrades. But {{it seemed as if the}} mere sense of our situation, should have been {{sufficient}} to prevent the like conduct in all <b>on</b> <b>board</b> our <b>craft.</b>|$|R
60|$|As we {{were walking}} down {{the end of the}} wharf towards the ship, Queequeg {{carrying}} his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals <b>on</b> <b>board</b> that <b>craft,</b> unless they previously produced their papers.|$|R
60|$|As the {{schooner}} {{moved off}} Dave’s heart sank within him. <b>On</b> <b>board</b> of the <b>craft</b> was Jasniff, and the rascal had the larger {{portion of the}} Carwith jewels in his possession.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike work suits, [...] "quick don" [...] {{survival}} suits are not normally worn, but are stowed in an accessible location <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the <b>craft.</b> The operator {{may be required}} to have one survival suit of the appropriate size <b>on</b> <b>board</b> for each crew member, and other passengers. If a survival suit is not accessible both from a crew member's work station and berth, then two accessible suits must be provided.|$|R
50|$|If {{the player}} does not rescue Mary but escapes with the science logs, Hawking is still {{attacked}} by Dr. Annar. The player can still kill him, and be brought <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the rescue <b>craft.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Tom {{turned away}} with {{something}} of a groan. [...] "Dick must be <b>on</b> <b>board</b> of that <b>craft,</b> along with the Baxters. Oh, what luck we are having! Now what ought I to do next?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{they would}} be without plenty of hands, but you see {{we have a great}} many more men in {{proportion}} here than there are <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a merchant <b>craft.</b> Will you go up higher?" ...|$|R
50|$|The slave trader {{who buys}} Tighe takes {{him on a}} long journey across the wall, {{intending}} to sell him in a large city. Before arriving at the city, they again encounter the silvery flying object. The pilot {{is a man who}} speaks Tighe's native language, and looks very like his grandfather. He kills the slave trader and takes Tighe <b>on</b> <b>board</b> his <b>craft.</b> Tighe's mother is <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> but in a nonresponsive mental state.|$|R
60|$|So {{astonishing}} was {{the spectacle}} of three lightly-clad men, appearing suddenly <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a <b>craft</b> moored out on the river, that the three boatmen sat immovable, in the attitudes {{in which they had}} been sitting at the entry of these strange visitors, without uttering a word. Superstitious by nature, they doubted whether there was not something supernatural in the appearance of the three strangers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure of that, Dick; {{there are}} craft going every day to Antwerp and Flushing, and for {{anything}} we know {{some of them may}} be <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a <b>craft</b> already dropping down like ourselves by this tide. But even if we had twelve hours' start, by landing, say at Flushing, they would have time to cross by land to Amsterdam and get there before us." ...|$|R
60|$|When the tempest {{was at its}} height, {{and after}} the attacking party had succeeded in getting <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> the little <b>craft</b> must have been {{literally}} blown down, until the water, rushing into the open hatches, had caused her to completely upset.|$|R
50|$|If {{the player}} rescues Mary and escapes the ship with the science logs, Hawking is {{attacked}} <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the escape shuttle by Annar, who doesn't want {{knowledge of his}} experiments to leak out. By firing their weapon at the right time, the player can shoot and kill Dr. Annar; <b>on</b> <b>board</b> the rescue <b>craft,</b> Hawking is reunited with Mary.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Tom had shoved out the rowboat Dick had {{mentioned}} -- a neat craft {{belonging to a}} farmer living near. A pair of oars lay in a locker on the lake bank; and, securing these, Tom leaped <b>on</b> <b>board</b> of the <b>craft,</b> and soon Dick came after.|$|R
50|$|To {{explain their}} staying power, {{they point out}} to their “distinct support base who follow our music all the time”, and whose {{feedback}} they take <b>on</b> <b>board</b> to <b>craft</b> their sound.This strong fan base declaredly allows them to avoid rushing for commercial success and experiment with different sounds.Similarly, this connection to the mainstream public is said to help them “keep in touch, as does deejaying around the SADC region” which means {{they are able to}} notice recent trends before the rest of the industry catches up.|$|R
6000|$|... "They say as much aboard, here," [...] {{returned}} the old tar, drawing nearer {{to the person}} of his captain, under an impulse of strong curiosity; [...] "though crone presume {{to be acquainted with}} the particulars. I am not one of those who ask impertinent questions, more especially under Her Majesty's pennant; for the worst enemy I have will not say I am very womanish. One would think, however, that there was neat work <b>on</b> <b>board</b> a <b>craft</b> that is so prettily moulded about her water-lines?" ...|$|R
5000|$|A vessel may be {{designated}} as [...] "self-righting" [...] {{if it is}} designed to be able to capsize then return to upright without intervention (with or without crew <b>on</b> <b>board).</b> Most small <b>craft</b> intended as lifeboats with rigid (rather than inflatable) hulls designed since about the middle of the twentieth century are self-righting.|$|R
5000|$|Maritime mobile-satellite service (MMSS, or {{maritime}} mobile-satellite radiocommunication service) is - {{according to}} Article 1.29 of the International Telecommunication Union's Radio Regulations (RR) - [...] "A mobile-satellite service in which mobile earth stations are located <b>on</b> <b>board</b> ships; survival <b>craft</b> stations and {{emergency position-indicating radiobeacon}} stations may also participate in this service".|$|R
