5|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} remodelled since the National Trust {{took over the}} property in 1966, to accommodate visitors and to enable the display {{of a large number}} of Churchillian artefacts. In particular, a number of guest bedrooms have been amalgamated, to allow the construction of the Museum room and the Uniform room. Nevertheless, the majority of the principal rooms have been reconstructed and furnished as they were in the 1920s–30s and are open to the public, with the current exception of Churchill's <b>own</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|E
25|$|Better {{known is}} the European trip of Shen Fo-tsung in 1684–1685, who was {{presented}} to king Louis XIV on September 15, 1684, and also met with king James II, becoming the first recorded instance of a Chinese man visiting Britain. The king was so delighted by this visit that he had his portrait made hung in his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Later, another Chinese Jesuit Arcadio Huang would also visit France, and was an early pioneer {{in the teaching of}} the Chinese language in France, in 1715.|$|E
25|$|McGlaughlin {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his unusual accent stems from his Philadelphia {{childhood}} {{and the influence of}} his Scottish-American grandfather, with whom he lived during his early childhood and late teens. Bill absorbed the music of opera at a very young age, as his draftsman father listened while in his at-home workshop. When Bill was 6, his father gave him a harmonica, and together they enjoyed playing their favorite opera melodies by ear. His father also had many instrumental classical albums, which Bill enjoyed listening to in his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Bill's mother, a high-school English teacher, was also a music lover.|$|E

25|$|Snowed in, Lockwood is grudgingly {{allowed to}} stay and is shown to a bedchamber where he notices books and {{graffiti}} left by a former inhabitant named Catherine. He falls asleep and has a nightmare in which he sees the ghostly Catherine trying to enter through the window. He cries out in fear, rousing Heathcliff, who rushes into the room. Lockwood is convinced that what he saw was real. Heathcliff, believing Lockwood to be right, examines the window and opens it, hoping to allow Catherine's spirit to enter. When nothing happens, Heathcliff shows Lockwood to his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom</b> and returns to keep watch at the window.|$|E
25|$|The {{night the}} King collapsed, {{she refused to}} be left alone with him and {{successfully}} insisted that she be given her <b>own</b> <b>bedroom.</b> When the doctor, Warren, was called, she was not informed and was not given the opportunity to speak with him. When told by the Prince of Wales that the King was to be removed to Kew, but that she should move to Queens House or Windsor, she successfully insisted that she accompany her spouse to Kew. However, she and her daughters were taken to Kew separately from the King and lived secluded from him during his illness. They regularly visited him, but the visits tended to be uncomfortable, as he had a tendency to embrace them and refuse to let them go.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Wright {{described}} Strang as [...] "a very mild-spoken, kind man to his family, {{although his}} word was law." [...] She wrote that while each wife had her <b>own</b> <b>bedroom,</b> they shared meals and devotional time together with Strang and that life in their household was [...] "as pleasant as possible." [...] On the other hand, Strang and Phoebe Wright's daughter, Eugenia, wrote in 1936 that after only {{eight months of}} marriage, her mother had [...] "begun to feel dissatisfied with polygamy, though she loved him [...] devotedly all her life." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} into {{who could do}} such a thing, and for what purpose, takes an unexpected twist when Bonnie's son Chris Pritchard becomes a prime suspect in the case.

50|$|Seasonworkers for {{the above}} {{mentioned}} companies generally get {{to live in}} a tent for the summer. While this may sound bad the tents are big and have their <b>own</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> There is a least one tent that is used as the Live Tent. A Live tent is used for cooking and general socialising. This can be hard too depending on the location of the toilet blocks and water supplies. Some companies provide mobile homes for their couriers but not all.|$|R
500|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, Burges having {{avoided the}} error {{that he had}} made at the McConnochie House when he placed a vast central staircase {{in the middle of the}} building. At The Tower House, the stair is consigned to the conical tower. The ground floor contains a drawing room, dining room and library, while the first floor holds bedroom suites and a study. If Burges shunned exterior decoration at The Tower House, he more than compensated internally. Each room has a complex iconographic scheme of decoration: that of the hall is Time, in the drawing room, Love, in Burges's bedroom, the Sea. Massive fireplaces with elaborate overmantels were carved and installed, a castle in the Library and mermaids and sea-monsters of the deep in his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom.</b> His brother-in-law, Pullan, wrote that [...] "Chaucer and Tennyson's poems were Mr Burges' chief text-books when engaged in designing these decorations." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your <b>own</b> <b>bedroom</b> , {{but when you get}} on set you have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor brought the U.S. into the war. Vonnegut {{was a member}} of Reserve Officers' Training Corps, but poor grades and a satirical article in Cornell's {{newspaper}} cost him his place there. He was placed on academic probation in May 1942 and dropped out the following January. No longer eligible for a student deferment, he faced likely conscription into United States Army. Instead of waiting to be drafted, he enlisted in the army and in March 1943 reported to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for basic training. Vonnegut was trained to fire and maintain howitzers, a type of artillery, and later received instruction in mechanical engineering at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee as part of the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP). In early 1944, the ASTP was canceled due to the Army's need for soldiers to support the D-Day invasion, and Vonnegut was ordered to an infantry battalion at Camp Atterbury, south of Indianapolis in Edinburgh, Indiana, where he trained as a scout. He lived so close to his home that he was [...] "able to sleep in [...] <b>own</b> <b>bedroom</b> and use the family car on weekends". On May 14, 1944, Vonnegut returned home on leave for Mother's Day weekend to discover that his mother had committed suicide the previous night by overdosing on sleeping pills.|$|E

5000|$|In modern times, Woody Allen's A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982) {{presents}} {{aspects of}} the bedroom farce. Michael Frayn's 1977 play Donkeys' Years is a classic bedroom farce; Frayn parodied the genre in his 1982 play Noises Off via its play-within-the-play, [...] "Nothing On." [...] Alan Ayckbourn's play, entitled Bedroom Farce, looks at the lives of three couples seen in their <b>own</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> the stage being split into three sets for this purpose. There is much humour in the play, although few {{if any of the}} usual conventions of farce are observed.|$|R

2500|$|A false {{awakening}} is one {{in which}} the subject believes he/she has woken up, whether from a lucid or a non-lucid dream, but is in fact still asleep. [...] Sometimes the experience is so realistic perceptually (the sleeper seeming to wake in his or her <b>own</b> <b>bedroom,</b> for example) that insight is not achieved at once, or even until the dreamer really wakes up and realises that what has occurred was hallucinatory. [...] Such experiences seem particularly liable to occur to those who deliberately cultivate lucid dreams. [...] However, they may also occur spontaneously and be associated with the experience of sleep paralysis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{is next to}} the main (Moulsecoomb) campus of the University of Brighton. [...] In 1993, the university submitted a plan to buy Moulsecoomb Place and its grounds, build accommodation for 163 students on the former plant nursery to the rear, and convert the building itself and the old tithe barn into the headquarters of its Student Services division and a children's nursery. [...] Permission for this was granted in the same year. [...] The student residences consist of flats accommodating six to eight people, each with their <b>own</b> <b>bedroom</b> but with shared bathroom and laundry facilities. [...] Breakfast and evening meals are provided on site. [...] As of 2012, rent was £142 per week or £5,538 for a 39-week academic year tenancy.|$|E

5000|$|Chase Lisbon {{started the}} site with little {{knowledge}} of web design or photography, and originally featured {{a small group}} of models- mostly friends and acquaintances. Lisbon's concept of artfully done photographs of amateur models, some with piercings and tattoos, diverged from the typical porn sites of the time. Supercult's female-friendly and [...] "hipster" [...] aesthetic quickly caught on, and sites such as Suicide Girls and Burning Angel launched shortly after. Early photo sets on Supercult featured models in their <b>own</b> <b>bedrooms</b> with their <b>own</b> clothing and props. Some sets focused around a theme which was often humorous, such as models posing with Star Wars figures and Memorabilia, or dressed as a (sexy) French mime.|$|R
2500|$|On August 8, 1905, Cobb's mother {{fatally shot}} his father {{with a pistol}} {{that his father had}} {{purchased}} for her. Court records indicate that Mr. Cobb had suspected his wife of infidelity and was sneaking past his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom</b> window to catch her in the act. She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband. Mrs. Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906. Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father, saying, [...] "I did it for my father. He never got to see me play... but I knew he was watching me, and I never let him down." ...|$|E
2500|$|His first boyfriend {{introduced}} Lockhart, then 17 years old, {{into the}} gay pornographic industry, {{at a time}} when Lockhart felt he had no money or prospects.

Lockhart agreed to perform in filmed sex scenes with the Cobra Video owner in six [...] "action video scenes" [...] and one [...] "non-action" [...] video scene in consideration for a used Volkswagen Jetta, a set of tires and rims, transportation costs, vehicle insurance, and money for gasoline. A sexual relationship developed between Lockhart and the director. Lockhart was under 18 when their relationship began, and it ended before his 18th birthday.|$|E
2500|$|Fangio {{was taken}} to three {{separate}} houses. His captors allowed him {{to listen to the}} race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom</b> but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of Stockholm Syndrome, admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: [...] "Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it." [...] Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} was thereafter {{the seat of}} the locally important Tillstone family for more than a century, and was the centrepiece of an estate extending to [...] [...] A wide verandah was added to the house at ground-floor level by 1810, and the hall house was converted into stables. [...] A regular visitor around this time was the Prince Regent (later King George IV), a friend of the family. [...] He had his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom</b> above the drawing room, and a dovecote near the house was adapted into a summer house, in which the prince would sit and practise playing a silver flute he had received from Tillstone. [...] The dovecote was accordingly known as Prince's Tower, but was vandalised beyond repair in 1942. [...] Three [...] "huge mahogany doors" [...] in the house were given by the prince in return; they may have come from the demolished Grove House at Old Steine, where the prince stayed when he first visited Brighton in 1783. [...] More work was carried out on the building in 1906 or 1913, when a further two bays were added to {{the south side of the}} seven-bay façade.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that when Emperor Taizong first took the throne, {{he was looking for}} ways to improve his reign. [...] As he {{believed}} that Wei had great abilities in governance, he often invited Wei into his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom</b> to converse with him. [...] Wei had the fortitude to speak up for what he saw to be right, and Emperor Taizong often gladly accepted his suggestions. [...] In 627, when it was rumored that Feng Ang (馮盎), a former Sui official who had submitted to Tang several years prior, had started a rebellion, and Emperor Taizong wanted to send forces to attack Feng, Wei advised against it, pointing out that Feng did not advance outside his own territories and appeared to be simply fearful that he had been accused of treason. [...] Under Wei's suggestion, Emperor Taizong sent the official Li Gongyan (李公淹) to comfort Feng; Feng then showed his submission by sending his son Feng Zhidai (馮智戴) to follow Li Gongyan to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Taizong. [...] Pleased, Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "Wei had me send a messenger, and as a result the Lingnan region was pacified, better than if 100,000 men were sent. [...] He must receive an award." [...] He awarded Wei with silk. [...] Around that time, he also made Wei a deputy head of the executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng).|$|E
2500|$|The {{first known}} {{adaptation}} of The Taming of the Shrew was The Woman's Prize, or The Tamer Tamed, a sequel written by John Fletcher c.1611. In Fletcher's play, Katherina has died, and Petruchio has remarried, to an equally fiery woman named Maria. Attempting to tame {{her in a}} similar manner to Katherina, Petruchio finds his tactics failing, and Maria refusing to consummate their marriage until Petruchio changes his ways. She bands together with other women who are also refusing to consummate their marriages. In an effort to elicit her sympathy, Petruchio pretends to be sick, but his plan backfires when Maria has him walled up in his <b>own</b> <b>bedroom,</b> telling everyone he has the plague. Upon breaking out, he finds her dressed like a prostitute and flirting with his friends. Vowing the marriage is over, he announces he is going to travel abroad, but Maria responds by wishing him well. Eventually, Petruchio decides to pretend to be dead. Maria begins to cry, but reveals she is doing so not because she is sad at her lose, but because it upsets her that Petruchio was such a pathetic person who wasted his life. He reveals he is not dead, and, impressed with the ruse, Maria decides to end her [...] "taming". The play ends with them agreeing to live a life of mutual respect. When the two plays were performed at court in November 1633, Master of the Revels Henry Herbert recorded Shrew was [...] "likt" [...] but Tamer Tamed was [...] "very well likt".|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Naome reveals she became a target for homophobia after her picture was published in the newspaper. Later, David sees a copy of Rolling Stone falsely accusing homosexuals of aiding and abetting terrorist organizations such as the Lord’s Resistance Army, Allied Democratic Forces and Al-Shabaab during the July 2010 Kampala attacks.
