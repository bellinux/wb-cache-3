In this security notion, we consider an adversary, A, that takes two stages, denoted find and guess.

40|$|Let E be a public-key {{encryption}} system and let (pk i, ski) be public/private key pairs for E for i = 0, [...] ., n. A natural {{question is whether}} E remains secure once an adversary obtains an encryption cycle, which consists of the encryption of ski under pk (i mod n) + 1 for all i = 1, [...] ., n. Surprisingly, even strong notions of security such as chosen-ciphertext security appear to be insufficient for proving security in these settings. Since encryption cycles come up naturally in several applications, it is desirable to construct systems that remain secure {{in the presence of}} such cycles. Until now, all known constructions have only be proved secure in the random oracle model. We construct an {{encryption system}} that is circular-secure under the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption, without relying on random oracles. Our proof of security holds even if the adversary obtains an encryption clique, that is, encryptions of ski under pk j for all 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n. We also construct a circular counterexample: a <b>one-way</b> secure <b>encryption</b> scheme that becomes completely insecure if an encryption cycle of length 2 is published. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a public-key encryption system that remains secure even encrypting messages {{that depend on}} the secret keys in use. In particular, it remains secure under a “key cycle ” usage, {{where we have a}} cycle of public/secret key-pairs (pk i, ski) for i = 1, [...] ., n, and we encrypt each ski under pk (i mod n) + 1. Such usage scenarios sometimes arise in key-management systems and in the context of anonymous credential systems. Also, security against key cycles plays a role when relating “axiomatic security ” of protocols that use encryption to the “computational security ” of concrete instantiations of these protocols. The existence of encryption systems that are secure in the presence of key cycles was wide open until now: on the one hand we had no constructions that provably meet this notion of security (except by relying on the random-oracle heuristic); on the other hand we had no examples of secure encryption systems that become demonstrably insecure in the presence of key-cycles of length greater than one. Here we construct an encryption system that is circular-secure against chosen-plaintext attacks under the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption (without relying on random oracles). Our proof of security holds even if the adversary obtains an encryption clique, that is, encryptions of ski under pk j for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. We also construct a circular counterexample: a <b>one-way</b> secure <b>encryption</b> scheme that breaks completely if an encryption cycle (of any size) is published. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} novel access control scheme which is {{implemented}} {{based on a}} Hierarchical and Hybrid Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HHECC) to fulfill the efficiency and security requirements in Cloud. Cloud is a state-of-the-art technology to build a storage platform for data backup, resource sharing, file synchronization, etc. Since accessed by various users, the Cloud storage services should enhance its security facility for access control, according to the confidential protocol and privacy policy. To satisfy these requirements, we present the hierarchy feature of the scheme is achieved by an one-way hash function on the level key, merged by the hybrid feature which denotes the combination of <b>one-way</b> hash, Advanced <b>Encryption</b> Standard (AES) and ECC for the fine grained access control. The theoretical security proof of the whole scheme is figured out through logic induction with the basis on the security of ECC. The simulation experiments’ results show that in comparison with RSA, HHECC facilitates to achieve much securer performance for hierarchical access control with higher efficiency for the encryption and decryption of Cloud data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We provide {{methods for}} {{transforming}} an encryption scheme susceptible to decryption errors into {{one that is}} immune to these errors. Immunity to decryption errors is vital when constructing non-malleable and chosen ciphertext secure encryption schemes via current techniques; in addition, it may help defend against certain cryptanalytic techniques, such as the attack of Proos [33] on the NTRU scheme. When decryption errors are very infrequent, our transformation is extremely simple and efficient, almost free. To deal with significant error probabilities, we apply amplification techniques translated from a related information theoretic setting. These techniques allow us to correct even very weak encryption schemes where in addition to decryption errors, an adversary has substantial probability of breaking the scheme by decrypting random messages (without knowledge of the secret key). In other words, under these weak encryption schemes, the only guaranteed difference between the legitimate recipient and the adversary is {{in the frequency of}} decryption errors. All the above transformations work in a standard cryptographic model; specifically, they do not rely on a random oracle. We also consider the random oracle model, where we give a simple transformation from a <b>one-way</b> <b>encryption</b> scheme which is error-prone into one that is immune to errors. We conclude that error-prone cryptosystems can be used in order to create more secure cryptosystems. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{study the}} {{parallel}} time-complexity of basic crypto-graphic primitives such as one-way functions (OWFs) and pseudorandom generators (PRGs).

Despite previous efforts in this direction, {{there has been no}} significant theoretical ev-idence supporting this possibility, which was posed as an open question in several previous works. We essentially settle this question by providing overwhelming positive evidence for the possibility of cryptog-raphy in NC 0. Our main result is that every &quot;moderatelyeasy &quot; OWF (resp., PRG), say computable in NC 1, canbe compiled into a corresponding OWF (resp., low-stretch PRG) in NC 04, i. e. whose output bits each depend on at most 4 input bits. The existence of OWF and PRG in NC 1 is a rel-atively mild assumption, implied by most number-theoretic or algebraic intractability assumptions commonly used incryptography. Hence, the existence of OWF and PRG in NC 0 follows from a variety of standard assumptions. A sim-ilar compiler can also be obtained for other cryptographic primitives such as <b>one-way</b> permutations, <b>encryption,</b> com-mitment, and collision-resistant hashing. The above results leave a small gap between the possi-bility of cryptography in NC 04 and the known impossibilityof implementing even OWF in NC 02.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{proposes a}} privacy-protection {{framework}} for an important application called outsourced media search. This scenario involves a data owner, a client, and an untrusted server, where the owner outsources a search {{service to the}} server. Due to lack of trust, {{the privacy of the}} client and the owner should be protected. The framework relies on multimedia hashing and symmetric encryption. It requires involved parties to participate in a privacy-enhancing protocol. Additional processing steps are carried out by the owner and the client: (i) before outsourcing low-level media features to the server, the owner has to one-way hash them, and partially encrypt each hash-value; (ii) the client completes the similarity search by re-ranking the most similar candidates received from the server. <b>One-way</b> hashing and <b>encryption</b> add ambiguity to data and make it difficult for the server to infer contents from database items and queries, so the privacy of both the owner and the client is enforced. The proposed framework realizes trade-offs among strength of privacy enforcement, quality of search, and complexity, because the information loss can be tuned during hashing and encryption. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and the flexibility of the framework...|$|R
