40|$|The Geoscience Literacy Exam (GLE), {{designed}} by the InTeGrate project, assesses Earth, climate, atmospheric, and <b>ocean</b> science <b>literacy</b> as defined in documents developed by those communities. The GLE includes three levels of questions: single-answer multiple choice, multiple-answer multiple choice, and short essay. While the multiple choice questions had been validated and are in use, the essay questions had been pilot-tested but the answers not analyzed for validity. The goal of this project was to examine 364 student responses to an essay about complex systems {{to see if the}} question is valid and to better define a rubric for scoring. Students in online (n = 45) and face-to-face (n = 150) versions of an introductory Earth Science class for non-majors at the University of Akron were given the question in two exams. Responses were scored and analyzed in an Excel spreadsheet using a four-point rubric that addressed all components of the question. In addition to scoring student responses, misconceptions, understanding of the question, and additional details were noted. In both exams and both classes, a consistent bimodal pattern appears in the score distribution, with one mode near 2. 5 and the other at 0. We interpret this to suggest that a large percentage of students (who contribute to the 0 mode) didn’t understand the question. Two common misconceptions were equating 2 ̆ 2 system 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 cycle 2 ̆ 2 and including the exosphere as one of the major Earth systems. In conclusion the question should be revised to give students a better opportunity to answer the question well...|$|R

From a human perspective, climate change may profoundly influence civilization. To make responsible decisions about adaptations to climate change including sustainability, the public must understand climate change. The trouble with gaining this understanding is two-fold.

From a public perspective, one needs to learn enough about the complex climate change processes to ensure human life remains sustainable.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{ocean is}} one of the Earth's {{defining}} features; it provides our world with variety of beneficial services like regulating climate, providing food, and is a source of wonder and inspiration. However, despite its size and powerful nature it is not immune to degradation. One of the greatest risks to our ocean is a general lack of understanding amongst the public of basic ocean processes and how an individual's actions contribute to environmental harm. In the United States, a low level of ocean-centered education in the K- 12 classroom contributes to the lack of <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy.</b> This study presents a review of current levels of <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy</b> in the United States and highlights the benefits of increased levels of ocean science education. Barriers, challenges, and potential solutions for the increased implementation of <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy</b> in the classroom are identified.

40|$|The ocean {{provides}} countless {{goods and}} services supporting economic human activities. These {{goods and services}} are under threat {{as a consequence of}} a continuously increasing human population with limited knowledge of the ocean. It is important for citizens to take an active responsibility for ocean conservation, and therefore they need to develop <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy.</b> One challenge is that the knowledge is mainly held by scientists, often admonished for their lack of ability to communicate with the public. The online social media have become common resources for learning, sharing of knowledge and communicating with others. This constitutes a unique opportunity and a challenge for scientists to promote <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy.</b> This study takes a socio-cultural perspective of learning and argues that participation and interest are key components of the learning process. This study investigates the potential of Facebook for scientific communication and develop best practices to maximize its benefits. Quantitative (Facebook statistics analysis) and qualitative (interviews and discourse analysis) methods were used to scrutinize the Facebook page from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). From a quantitative point of view, the best strategy to optimize the reach and the followers’ interactions is to post daily and use picture or movies. From a qualitative point of view, MBARI’s fans seem to learn from MBARI’s stories to a certain extent, but this study indicates that Facebook pages do not offer the appropriate social context to foster participation since it has {{only a few of the}} features of an arena where such practices could develop. However, the context might be more favorable for participation when the fans share MBARI’s stories with their own friends. Moreover, MBARI’s stories hold the potential to develop people’s personal interest in marine science, supporting the learning process and enhancing their <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy.</b> In conclusion, social media can facilitate the development of user’s interest in the ocean and their <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy.</b> However, it is essential for scientists to increase their social media literacy in order to manage their pages in a more appropriate and timeefficient way, to benefit from the potential opportunities offered by online social medi...|$|E

40|$|Ocean {{issues with}} {{conceptual}} ties {{to science and}} a global society have captured the attention, imagination, and concern of an international audience. Climate change, over fishing, marine pollution, freshwater shortages and alternative energy sources are a few ocean issues highlighted in our media and casual conversations. From the life-giving rain that nourishes crops and our bodies, to life-saving medicines; from the fish that come from the ocean, to the goods that are transported on the sea 2 ̆ 7 s surface-the ocean {{plays a role in}} our life in some way every day (NOAA, 1998). However, a disconnect exists between what scientists know and the public understands about the ocean. Although standards for science teaching and literacy are established, the fundamental role of the ocean is not emphasized. This was an exploratory study of 30 females, 13 - 14 years old, during an extended ocean learning experience, the Oceanography Camp for Girls, which included direct experiences in natural environments. Teens were engaged in a series of ocean learning and stewardship activities. A mixed-methods approach was used to develop three quantitative instruments: the Survey of <b>Ocean</b> <b>Literacy</b> and Engagement (SOLE), Survey of Ocean Stewardship (SOS) and Scenarios of Ocean Environmental Morality (SOEM). Three ocean socioscientific issues (OSSI) case studies were analyzed qualitatively. Participants reasoned and expressed positions in writing and verbally following OSSI embedded activities. Research questions examined what understanding teen girls currently hold about the ocean (content), how they feel (environmental attitudes and morality) toward the ocean environment, and how these feelings and understanding are organized when reasoning about ocean issues. Results from SOLE and SOS revealed that content knowledge and environmental attitudes significantly contribute to <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy.</b> Analysis of SOEM demonstrated that biocentric environmental reasoning was most important to teens in solving specific ocean dilemmas. Analysis of OSSI from interview responses revealed three patterns of informal reasoning (rationalistic, emotive and intuitive).

This study was conducted as a formative program assessment during the third year of this partnership. Small group (2 - 4 person) interviews were conducted with 20 SMILE high school teachers during a professional development workshop in February, 2007. Interview questions focused on usage and understanding of select framing and content terms: <b>ocean</b> <b>literacy,</b> remote sensing and satellite oceanography. Responses from these interviews, as well as individual interviews with a SMILE staff member, former SMILE graduate assistant, and representative from CIOSS, were analyzed for emerging themes.
