5|$|In 324, Constantine I chose Byzantium {{to be the}} {{new capital}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Roman</b> <b>Empire,</b> {{renaming}} it New Rome.

This empire, which would later be branded by historians as the Byzantine Empire, ruled most of the territory of present-day Turkey until the Late Middle Ages; although the eastern regions remained in firm Sasanian hands up to the first half of the seventh century. The frequent Byzantine-Sassanid Wars, as part of the centuries long-lasting Roman-Persian Wars, fought between the neighbouring rivalling Byzantines and Sasanians, took place in various parts of present-day Turkey and decided much of the latter's history from the fourth century up to the first half of the seventh century.|$|E
