40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) contributes to the protective effect of neurohypophysial hormone oxytocin (OT) in heart preconditioning. Methods Sprague-Dawley male rats were subjected to 25 min regional ischaemia and 120 min reperfusion and were divided into eight groups. Oxytocin or an equivalent volume of saline was administrated intraperitoneally, 30 min before ischaemia. The OT receptor antagonist (atosiban), ANP receptor antagonist (anantin) and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) were injected 10 min before <b>OT.</b> In <b>other</b> groups, atosiban, anantin and L-NAME were only administered 40 min prior to ischaemia. Results Compared with the ischaemia/reperfusion group (I/R), alterations in infarct size, biochemical parameters LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), CK-MB (creatine kinase-MB), MDA (malondialdehyde) plasma levels] and severity of ventricular arrhythmia due to I/R injury were attenuated and VF was abolished by OT treatment. These OT effects were eliminated by OT and ANP receptor blockers and nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, but anantin did not reverse the effect of OT in lipid peroxidation. Conclusions These findings demonstrate an important contributory role of ANP in the OT induced protection in myocardial ischaemia reperfusion.

Each dog participated in two testing sessions. On one visit saline was administered nasally and on another OT was administered nasally. Condition order was counterbalanced. Following a 30 -minute wait period after administration of solutions, dog-owner pairs participated in a short attachment test consisting of three two-minute phases: (1) Baseline- the owner was present, dogs were able to freely explore the testing room (2) Alone- dogs were left alone in the testing room (3) Return- owners re-entered the room and were reunited with their dog. In each phase the behavior of the dog was evaluated for behaviors associated with different styles of attachment, including contact seeking, exploration, and avoidance behaviors. Although OT was expected to increase owner-directed proximity and contact seeking behavior, this effect was not observed.
