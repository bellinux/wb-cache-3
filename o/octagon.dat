5|$|In 1999, Thornton {{introduced}} {{the character of}} Dr. Dooom on the album First Come, First Served (1999). The album featured a track in which the character murdered Dr. <b>Octagon.</b> In 2002, Thornton announced The Resurrection of Dr. <b>Octagon,</b> a proposed sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character. The resulting album, The Return of Dr. <b>Octagon</b> released in 2006, was largely produced without Thornton's involvement, based upon three completed vocal tracks and reconstructed outtakes. Thornton later produced Dr. Dooom 2 in response to The Return of Dr. <b>Octagon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Return of Dr. <b>Octagon</b> is {{the tenth}} studio album by American rapper Keith Thornton, {{better known as}} Kool Keith. Released in the United States on June 27, 2006, it is his second studio album under the Dr. <b>Octagon</b> alias, {{following}} Dr. Octagonecologyst. The album revives the character of Dr. <b>Octagon,</b> who was killed off on Thornton's 1999 release First Come, First Served. Production for the album began in 2002 under the title The Resurrection of Dr. <b>Octagon</b> with producer Fanatik J.|$|E
5|$|The {{top section}} of Princes Street, from the <b>Octagon</b> to the Exchange, {{has long been}} the hub of Dunedin's public {{transport}} system. Buses from the north of the city largely pass along George Street and into the <b>Octagon,</b> those from the south pass into the southern end of Princes Street, and those from the hill suburbs arrive at the <b>Octagon</b> via Stuart Street or at the Exchange via High and Rattray Streets. Almost all of these use upper Princes Street between the Exchange and the <b>Octagon</b> as part of their route.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the third}} paper dealing with the {{classification}} of the dense near <b>octagons</b> of order (3, t). Using the partial classification of the valuations of the possible hexes obtained in [12], {{we are able to}} show that almost all such near <b>octagons</b> admit a big hex. Combining this with the results in [11], where we classified the dense near <b>octagons</b> of order (3, t) with a big hex, we get an incomplete classification for the dense near <b>octagons</b> of order (3, t) : There are 28 known examples and a few open cases. For each open case, we have a rather detailed description {{of the structure of the}} near <b>octagons</b> involved...|$|R

The junction with two <b>octagons</b> presents two degenerate localized states at Fermi energy (EF). The reconstructed junction has only one state near EF, indicating that these localized states are related to the octagonal defects. The inclusion of Coulomb interaction splits the localized states in the junction with two <b>octagons,</b> yielding an antiferromagnetic system...|$|R
5|$|Between {{the first}} and second falls, Barr began to mockingly perform jumping jacks in the ring, showing how little {{physical}} exertion it took to win the first fall. This was followed by Guerrero once again mocking the Mexican crowd by pretending to be swimming to infuriate the crowd. Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out the second fall as they had the first, locking up {{in the center of the}} ring. When <b>Octagón</b> entered the ring, Guerrero dropped to his knees, feigning an apology for a moment, before poking <b>Octagón</b> in the eye to gain the advantage. Later on, Hijo del Santo entered the ring and all four men ended up in the ring at the same time, until the tecnico team sent La Pareja del Terror to the floor, followed by a double Topé Suicida (Suicide dive headbutt) by Hijo del Santo and <b>Octagón.</b> Later in the match, Guerrero performed a Huracanrana with Hijo del Santo sitting on the top rope and gained a pinfall, leaving <b>Octagón</b> at a disadvantage in the second fall. Barr and Guerrero double-teamed <b>Octagón,</b> with Barr throwing <b>Octagón</b> up on the air, thinking Guerrero caught him for a move. Instead, <b>Octagón</b> rolled up Guerrero for the pinfall as Barr celebrated, mistakenly thinking Guerrero got the pinfall. Moments later, the unsuspecting Barr was rolled up into Octagón's trademark submission hold La Escalera and was forced to submit, tying the match at one fall each.|$|E
5|$|Guerrero and Barr {{focused on}} Hijo del Santo and <b>Octagón,</b> using Los Gringos as backup {{whenever}} they needed them. On November 5, 1993, Hijo del Santo and <b>Octagón</b> defeated La Pareja del Terror {{to become the}} first team to hold the AAA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

40|$|Weakly {{relational}} numeric domains express restricted {{classes of}} linear inequalities that {{strike a balance}} between what can be described and what can be efficiently computed. Popular weakly relational domains such as bounded differences and <b>octagons</b> have found application in model checking and abstract interpretation. This paper introduces logahedra, which are more expressiveness than <b>octagons,</b> but less expressive than arbitrary systems of two variable per inequality constraints. Logahedra allow coefficients of inequalities to be powers of two whilst retaining many of the desirable algorithmic properties of <b>octagons...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although it did {{not sell}} enough copies to reach the {{mainstream}} music charts, the album was well received with positive reviews and recognition. Thornton's lyrics and Nakamura's production were highly praised, as was DJ Qbert's innovative scratching. Dr. Octagonecologyst has since been ranked {{as one of the}} best hip hop albums of the 1990s. The character of Dr. <b>Octagon</b> has appeared in multiple works by Thornton, including First Come, First Served (1999) and Dr. Dooom 2 (2008), both of which contain tracks in which <b>Octagon</b> is murdered by Dr. Dooom.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>Octagon,</b> Princes Street {{initially}} rises as {{it passes}} through a commercial district formerly {{commonly known as the}} Top 100, crossing the outer <b>Octagon</b> of Moray Place before descending through the original cutting of Bell Hill towards the Exchange. The Top 100 theoretically takes its name from the 100 retail businesses which line Princes Street from the <b>Octagon</b> to the Exchange, although the actual number of businesses is not one hundred. This part of the city is sometimes seen as the creative heart of Dunedin, with numerous art galleries, video production companies, and the city's professional theatre (the Fortune Theatre) all being based in the area from Moray Place to Rattray Street.|$|E

5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before <b>Octagón</b> saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise <b>Octagón</b> and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin <b>Octagón</b> to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by <b>Octagón</b> being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to <b>Octagón.</b> The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E
