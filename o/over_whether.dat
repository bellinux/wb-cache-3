5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. In 2005, there was internal conflict {{about whether or not}} a gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.|$|E

5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees {{to avoid the}} draft. The ACLU board was deeply split <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E

Disputes then arose <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains.|$|E

5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage.

5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E
