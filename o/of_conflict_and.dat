40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> in the work unit <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> management styles in the work unit, and workplace bullying. First, we assume a positive relationship between the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>and</b> bullying; <b>and</b> that the <b>conflict</b> management styles 'fighting', 'avoiding' and 'yielding' associate positively and 'problem solving' associates negatively with bullying. Second, we expect that the work unit's conflict management styles moderate {{the relationship between the}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>and</b> bullying. Results ('N'  = 942) revealed a positive association between the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>and</b> bullying, as well as between fighting and bullying. Problem solving related negatively with bullying. Unexpectedly, we found no moderation. Our findings suggest that particularly the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> relate to bullying, which may be owed to a strong negative connotation associated with (many) conflicts at work or to its negative impact on the work unit's social climate. Organisations may also encourage problem solving and discourage fighting to prevent bullying. </span...|$|R

25|$|Some Cubans jubilantly left Tampa {{for their}} homeland, eager {{to enjoy the}} fruits of their long-fought revolution. However, most of these would {{eventually}} return.

As a group, they overwhelmingly choose to put down roots and settle in Ybor City for the long term, though some migration for family and work reasons continued.|$|E

Additionally, the volcanic aquifers consist mainly of interstratifications of gaps and fissures which allow for high permeability and infiltration.

Consequently, growing signs <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> competition for water use between sector needs are being observed in some regions.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, Norwegian {{sociologist}} Johan Galtung first {{created the}} term peacebuilding through his promotion of systems {{that would create}} sustainable peace. Such systems needed to address the root causes <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution. Galtung's work emphasized a bottom-up approach that decentralized social and economic structures, amounting to a call for a societal shift from structures of coercion and violence to a culture of peace. American sociologist John Paul Lederach proposed a different concept of peacebuilding as engaging grassroots, local, NGO, international and other actors to create a sustainable peace process. He does not advocate {{the same degree of}} structural change as Galtung.|$|E
25|$|Rome won the First Punic War after 23 years <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> {{in the end}} {{became the}} {{dominant}} naval power of the Mediterranean. In {{the aftermath of the}} war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted. Corsica, Sardinia and Africa remained Carthaginian, but they had to pay a high war indemnity. Rome's victory was greatly influenced by its persistence. Moreover, the Roman Republic's ability to attract private investments in the war effort to fund ships and crews was one of the deciding factors of the war, particularly when contrasted with the Carthaginian nobility's apparent unwillingness to risk their fortunes for the common war effort.|$|E
