25|$|Apart {{from losing}} its stained glass, the church survived the London Blitz largely intact, though bombs did damage the <b>open-work</b> lantern tower. The church was damaged {{again on the}} 24/25 March 1944, during Operation Steinbock, a late war and lower {{intensity}} attack on London. The building was largely restored in 1950. An appeal {{to raise money to}} install a new ring of bells in the tower, replacing those removed in 1969, was successfully completed in 2012 with the dedication and hanging of 10 new bells.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1957 Flaminia, Lancia cars {{switched}} {{from the traditional}} vertical split grille to an horizontal, full-width one. The logo was therefore moved inside the grille opening, and changed to a more stylized chromed metal <b>open-work</b> design; shield and steering wheel became chrome frames, the only remaining enameled surface being the blue field of the flag. This new metal logo was used on most models with some exceptions, namely Zagato-bodied Lancia Fulvias and Flavias, the Lancia 2000 Berlina (which reprised the traditional upright grille and the round enameled badge) and the Stratos HF (whose ornaments lacked the triangular shield).|$|E
500|$|The di Suvero exhibit {{was removed}} {{at the end}} of October 2008. [...] In March 2009, the park {{announced}} its plans to install four large-scale contemporary outdoor works by Chinese sculptors in Boeing Galleries from April 9 – October 2010. [...] The exhibition, entitled [...] "A Conversation With Chicago: Contemporary Sculpture From China", complements [...] "The Big World: Recent Art From China" [...] exhibition hosted at the Chicago Cultural Center beginning April 25, 2009 but was conceived independently and is a distinct body of work. [...] Chen Wenling's [...] "Valiant Struggle No. 11," [...] symbolizes Chinese society. The <b>open-work</b> sculpture [...] "Windy City Dinosaur," [...] created by Sui Jianguo stamped with the phrase [...] "Made in China" [...] is a critique on the cheap mass-produced goods that are building the Chinese export economy. [...] "Kowtow Pump," [...] is a caricature of the oil rigs by Shen Shaomin that will have limited Thursday active display times from June 11 through Aug. 27. [...] Zhan Wang's [...] "Jia Shan Shi No. 46" [...] is considered the most abstract and depicts the scholar's rock in stainless steel.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Smirke was magnificently dressed, and as {{he turned}} out his toes, he showed a pair of elegant <b>open-worked</b> silk {{stockings}} and glossy pumps. His white cravat was arranged in a splendid stiff tie, and his gold shirt studs shone on his spotless linen. His hair was curled round his fair temples. Had he borrowed Madame Fribsby's irons to give that curly grace? His white cambric pocket-handkerchief was scented with the most delicious eau-de-Cologne.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{formation}} of a carbon-coated honeycomb ternary Ni-Mn-Co-O inverse opal as a conversion mode anode material for Li-ion battery applications. In order to obtain high capacity via conversion mode reactions, a single phase crystalline honeycombed IO structure of Ni-Mn-Co-O material was first formed. This Ni-Mn-Co-O IO converts via reversible redox reactions and Li 2 O formation to a 3 D structured matrix assembly of nanoparticles of three (MnO, CoO and NiO) oxides, that facilitates efficient reactions with Li. A carbon coating maintains the structure without clogging the <b>open-worked</b> IO pore morphology for electrolyte penetration and mass transport of products during cycling. The highly porous IO was compared in a Li-ion half-cell to nanoparticles of the same material and showed significant improvement in specific capacity and capacity retention. Further optimization of the system was investigated by incorporating a vinylene carbonate additive into the electrolyte solution which boosted performance, offering promising high-rate performance and good capacity retention over extended cycling. The analysis confirms the possibility of creating a ternary transition metal oxide material with binder free accessible <b>open-worked</b> structure to allow three conversion mode oxides to efficiently cycle as an anode material for Li-ion battery applications...|$|R
500|$|Only a small {{proportion}} of Harrison's work was on churches. [...] In 1804 he re-faced the south side of StPeter's Church in Chester, and he carried out further alterations to the church in 1813. [...] Between 1805 and 1806 he redesigned the nave of StJohn the Baptist's Church in Whittington, Shropshire, which had been badly damaged in a storm. [...] He did design one new church, the Wesleyan Methodist Church in StJohn Street, Chester, which was built in 1811. [...] Although his design was used for the exterior, the internal decoration and fittings were planned by his main contractor, William Cole, and the church has been much altered since. [...] In 1810 came the commission for what is described as [...] "without doubt his [...] best work at a church", to rebuild the steeple of the Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool. [...] Earlier that year the spire on the medieval tower had collapsed, destroying the tower in the process. [...] The work was completed in 1815 at a cost of over £22,000 (...) [...] [...] The steeple has a height of , its buttresses rising above the top of the tower as pinnacles, the <b>open-work</b> spire being supported by flying buttresses. [...] Harrison also designed a domed ceiling for StPaul's Church in Liverpool, but this has since been demolished.|$|E
2500|$|Cross House, Little Torrington, Devon, {{in which}} exists the ornately carved wooden grand {{staircase}} from Stowe, of three flights around a square well. The balustrades are formed in <b>open-work</b> carving {{in the style}} of Grinling Gibbons of tumbling putti entwined in scrolls of [...] foliage and flowers.|$|E
2500|$|The screen {{known as}} the iconostasis {{separating}} the sanctuary from {{the main body of}} the church is one of the main features of any Coptic church. The Coptic iconostasis is usually less completely composed of icons than the Eastern Orthodox one, although there will always be several. It is very often an <b>open-work</b> screen, usually made of ebony and sometimes inlaid with ivory like that in Saint Mary Church (Harat Zewila). [...] These may be in geometrical patterns comparable to the secular screens which are a feature of traditional Egyptian houses.|$|E
60|$|She made a {{movement}} {{as though to}} close the door. It is possible that Deane would have taken the hint and departed, but for that last searching look which he threw at her. He thrust his boot against the door, and resumed his place {{on the inner side}} of the threshold. From there he looked at her once more. He was right. There were traces of powder on her cheeks, and her eyebrows were certainly not natural. Underneath her trim black skirt he had caught a glimpse of brown <b>open-worked</b> stockings, and tan shoes with a large bow and high heels. Instinctively he felt that no ordinary servant would have been allowed to go about like this.|$|R
50|$|During {{building}} {{work on the}} Autobahn A 61 (Ludwigshafen-Koblenz), an Iron Age burying {{ground was}} unearthed, and in 1971 a dig was conducted there. The burying ground itself {{is a group of}} 13 individual barrows arranged along a trail leading across the Hunsrück and in places the heights along the Rhine, which was expanded in Roman times. For some of the cremations, the barrow was raised right over the charred funeral pyre. Among the grave goods that were worthiest of note were an <b>open-worked</b> belthook and an iron belt ring. The ceramics that were preserved, among them a thrown clay bottle, date the burying ground to the later Hunsrück-Eifel Culture (eras IIA to IIB), or the second fourth of the 5th century BC to the earlier half of the 3rd century BC.|$|R
5000|$|The wagon {{consists}} of a square-shaped, <b>open-worked</b> base plate with four spoked wheels. A female figure approx. 32 cm high holding a bowl-shaped object in upraised hands stands {{in the center of}} the wagon. The bowl is also held on the sides by two scissor-shaped supports. Recent restoration work and examination by experts has concluded that the bowl attributed to the wagon up to now cannot be conclusively proven to originally have been part of the cult wagon [...] In addition to the kettle bearer, numerous other figures in the form of both standing and mounted people as well as animals similar to deer and to horses are present on the wagon. The depicted scene is interpreted as a sacrifice. The wagon presumably served as a cult object for the consumption of a libation.|$|R
2500|$|The library has a crypt above {{which the}} {{building}} has two unequal storeys giving the impression of three. The ornate Deansgate facade has an embattled parapet with <b>open-work</b> arcading under which is a central three-bay entrance resembling a monastery gatehouse. Its two-centred arched portal has doorways separated by a trumeau and tall windows on either side. Above the doors are a pair of small canted oriel windows. Surfaces are decorated with lacy blind tracery and finely-detailed carving. The carving includes the [...] "J. R." [...] monogram, the arms of Rylands, the arms of Rylands' native town, St Helens, and those of five English, two Scottish and two Irish universities and those of Owens College.|$|E
2500|$|The clock has {{a face on}} each of {{its four}} sides, and is {{supported}} on an <b>open-work</b> wrought iron pavilion on pylons with a round arch on each side. [...] Its plinth is inscribed on each face. [...] The inscription {{on the east side}} reads [...] "THIS CLOCK TOWER WAS ERECTED IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 60TH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF VICTORIA, QUEEN AND EMPRESS", on the west side [...] "ANTIQUI COLANT ANTIQUUM DIERUM: B.C. ROBERTS, MAYOR 1897; J.C. HOLMES, MAYOR 1898", on the south side [...] "THIS CLOCK WAS ERECTED BY EDWARD EVANS-LLOYD CITIZEN AND FREEMAN 1897", and on the north side [...] "ERECTED BY PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION & COMPLETED A.D. 1899 H. STOLTEFORTH MAYOR". [...] Beneath each clock face in gilt is the date 1897, and above each face, again in gilt, the initials [...] "VR". [...] Over the clock is a copper ogee cupola which is surmounted by a weather vane with lions rampant or on gules background.|$|E
2500|$|The cup was [...] "perhaps made in Alexandria" [...] or Rome {{in about}} 290-325 AD, and {{measures}} [...] [...] From its excellent condition {{it is probable}} that, like several other luxury Roman objects, {{it has always been}} preserved above ground; most often such objects ended up in the relatively secure environment of a church treasury. [...] Alternatively it might, like several other cage cups, have been recovered from a sarcophagus. [...] The present gilt-bronze rim and foot were added in about 1800, [...] suggesting {{it was one of the}} many objects taken from church treasuries during the period of the French Revolution and French Revolutionary Wars. [...] The foot continues the theme of the cup with <b>open-work</b> vine leaves, and the rim has leaf forms that lengthen and shorten to match the scenes in glass. [...] In 1958 the foot was removed by British Museum conservators, and not rejoined to the cup until 1973. [...] There may well have been earlier mounts.|$|E
50|$|The women's tunic {{was longer}} than the men's; a leather or metal belt (sometimes a chain) was tied round the waist. The {{regional}} variation in fashion (as well as differences based on age and class) were {{more complex than the}} simple tunic. The boldly patterned dresses seen on vases from Sopron in Pannonia were cut like a kind of knee-length maternity dress from stiff material with bells and fringes attached. Tight-waisted skirts with bells {{in the shape of a}} crinoline are also depicted. An overdress with a V-shaped cut which was fixed at the shoulders with fibulae was found in Noricum. The chain around the waist had hooks for length adjustments, the leftover chain was hung on a chain-link in a loop. The links of this chain-belt could be round, figure-8 shaped, with cross-shaped or flat intermediate links, doubled, tripled, or more with enamel inlays (see Blood enamel). The so-called Norican-Pannonian belt of Roman times was decorated with <b>open-worked</b> fittings. A pouch was often hung from the belt on the right side.|$|R
6000|$|If Barbot's map {{have any}} claim to correctness, the {{southern}} shore has changed greatly since A.D. 1700. A {{straight line from}} Cape Padrão to Chapel Point, now Shark Point, was {{more than double the}} breadth of the embouchure. It is vain to seek for the [...] "Island of Calabes" [...] mentioned by Andrew Battel, who was [...] "sent to a place called Zaire on the River Congo, to trade for elephants' teeth, wheat, and palm oil." [...] It may be a mistake for Cavallos, noticed in the next chapter; but the [...] "town on it" [...] must have been small, and has left, they say, no traces. After a scramble through the surf, we were received at Shark Point, where, at this season, the current is nearer five than three knots, by Mr. Tom Peter, Mafuka, or chief trader, amongst these [...] "Musurungus." [...] He bore his highly respectable name upon the frontal band of his [...] "berretta" [...] alias [...] "corôa," [...] an <b>open-worked</b> affair, very like the old-fashioned jelly-bag night cap. This head-gear of office made of pine-apple fibre-- Tuckey says grass--costs ten shillings; it is worn by the kinglets, who now distribute it to all the lieges whose fortunes exceed some fifty dollars.|$|R

6000|$|Lucile {{went over}} to the mirror and picked up, from among the {{trinkets}} beneath, a tiny <b>open-work</b> miniature of Frona. [...] "This is you? How old were you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some thicker {{stockings}}, or, if not thicker, stockings {{without that}} <b>open-work</b> stuff about them," [...] Burton continued earnestly, warming now to his task. [...] "You see, the <b>open-work</b> places have all spread into little holes, and one can't help noticing it, especially as your shoes {{are such a}} bright yellow. That stuff that looks like lace {{at the bottom of}} your petticoat has got all draggled. I should cut it off and throw it away. Then I'd empty all that scent down the drain, and wear any sort of gloves except those kid ones you have had cleaned so often." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted her}} skirts a little, {{and laughed at}} the inappropriateness of her thin shoes and <b>open-work</b> stockings. Andrew de la Borne held out his strong hand, and she sprang lightly on to the broad seat.|$|E
6000|$|His {{brother in}} Northern India may live behind a front of time-blackened <b>open-work</b> wood, but ... I {{do not think}} he would grow {{anything}} save tulsi[10] in a pot, and that only to please the Gods and his womenfolk.|$|E
6000|$|... "You med ha' {{give it to}} me!" [...] {{said the}} widow. [...] "It do make my heart ache to see such pretty <b>open-work</b> as that a-burned by the flames--not that {{ornamental}} night-rails can be much use to a' ould 'ooman like I. My days for such be all past and gone!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had come}} across and an egg-cup had been upset. Then he had been scolded, and they sat {{together}} laughing upon the sofa. When he had finished admiring her little, shining, patent-leather, Louis shoes and the two charming curves of <b>open-work</b> black stocking, she reminded {{him that he had}} asked for her advice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will take}} them and the pencils and the white note-book,' said the lama, 'as a sign of {{friendship}} between priest and priest--and now--' He fumbled at his belt, detached the <b>open-work</b> iron pincers, {{and laid it on}} the Curator's table. 'That is for a memory between thee and me--my pencase. It is something old--even as I am.' ...|$|E
60|$|Klara--arrayed in fashionable town garments, {{with a huge}} hat {{covered in}} feathers, a tight modern skirt that forced her to walk with mincing steps, high-heeled shoes, <b>open-work</b> {{stockings}} and gloves reaching to the elbow--was indeed a curious apparition in amongst these peasant girls, with their bare heads and high red-leather boots and petticoats standing round them like balloons.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher's drawing-room {{furniture}} {{was enough for}} him. When Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, {{said to have been}} forgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer's enthusiasm, which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising those things most which were most in need of praise. The fender was of polished steel, with much lancet-shaped <b>open-work</b> and a sharp edge.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{meet with}} an {{adventure}} such as I have had," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{would never go}} to bed at all. I have been nearly drowned, and rescued by a most marvellous person. He brought me back to safety in a flat-bottomed punt, and I am quite sure from the way he stared at them that he had never seen <b>open-work</b> stockings before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hanging from a peg {{the four}} {{visitors}} behold {{a pale blue}} dress cut in the fashion of the 'seventies, a copious 'chignon' of fair hair, large earrings, and on the marble bench a pair of <b>open-work</b> stockings and other articles of feminine apparel. A tall mirror hangs opposite these garments, and in a little recess convenient to the hand are the dusty and decaying materials for a hasty 'make-up.' ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} both inside the door was fastened, and they all three entered a large court, {{surrounded}} by an <b>open-work</b> gallery. At {{one end of the}} court was a platform, and on the platform stood an amber throne supported by four ebony columns, garnished with pearls and diamonds. In the middle of the court stood a marble basin filled with water from the mouth of a golden lion.|$|E
60|$|With {{wonderful}} quickness {{the metal}} <b>open-work</b> {{was put in}} its place, and fitted together, forming a frame of coral branches intermingled with dolphins, Nereids, and Tritons. Four gigantic Cyclops then approached, staggering {{under the weight of}} a circular slab of green marble, polished to a perfect mirror, which they placed on the framework. The Graces wreathed its circumference with garlands of sea-weed, shells, and corallines, and the mimic sea was complete.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Business first!' said Maude primly, and so {{proceeded}} {{to save her}} sixpence on the gloves. As she was tempted, however ('such a civil obliging shopman, Frank!'), to buy four yards of so-called Astrakhan trimming, a frill of torchon lace, six dear little festooned handkerchiefs, and four pairs of <b>open-work</b> stockings--none of which were contemplated when she entered the shop--her sixpenny saving was not as brilliant a piece of finance as she imagined.|$|E
60|$|That {{window was}} empty; but the other, which looked {{out into the}} street, had {{cushions}} laid on the sill, an <b>open-work</b> stone ledge beyond, and little looking-glasses on either side. Leaning over this sill there was seated a little maiden in a white frock, but with a black lace veil fastened by a rose into her jet-black hair, and the daintiest, prettiest-shaped little feet imaginable in white satin shoes, which could be plainly seen as she knelt on the window-seat.|$|E
60|$|Dear little men and women, {{looking as}} if they had stepped off of wedding cakes and bonbons, went about in their gay sugar clothes, {{laughing}} and talking in the sweetest voices. Bits of babies rocked in <b>open-work</b> cradles, and sugar boys and girls played with sugar toys in the most natural way. Carriages rolled along the jujube streets, drawn by the red and yellow barley horses we all love so well; cows fed in the green fields, and sugar birds sang in the trees.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a strange}} thing, if a man covers his face, and speaks with his eyes blinded, how {{significant}} and poignant he becomes. The ghost of this Hamlet was very simple. He was wrapped down to the knees in a great white cloth, and over his face was an <b>open-work</b> woollen shawl. But the naïve blind helplessness and verity of his voice was strangely convincing. He seemed the most real thing in the play. From the knees downward he was Laertes, because he had on Laertes' white trousers and patent leather slippers. Yet he was strangely real, a voice out of the dark.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Grandfather’s chair {{stood in}} its {{customary}} {{place by the}} fireside. The bright blaze gleamed upon the fantastic figures of its oaken back, and shone through the <b>open-work,</b> so that a complete pattern was thrown upon {{the opposite side of}} the room. Sometimes, for a moment or two, the shadow remained immovable, as if it were painted on the wall. Then, all at once, it began to quiver, and leap, and dance, with a frisky motion. Anon, seeming to remember that these antics were unworthy of such a dignified and venerable chair, it suddenly stood still. But soon it began to dance anew.|$|E
