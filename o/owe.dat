5|$|He {{was a most}} {{delightful}} man, {{a bizarre}} hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used to rap my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough.... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I <b>owe</b> him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I <b>owe</b> my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E

50|$|The {{duty of care}} <b>owed</b> to a rescuer is {{separate}} from that <b>owed</b> to those he is rescuing. Where individuals trespassed onto a railway line, putting themselves in danger, they were not <b>owed</b> a duty of care; however, the stationmaster who attempted rescue and was fatally injured was <b>owed</b> a duty of care, as it was foreseeable he would attempt a rescue. Equally, a duty of care may arise where an individual imperils himself, and a rescuer is injured, despite the individual clearly <b>owing</b> himself no duty of care.|$|R

5|$|Although Wales {{has its own}} {{traditional}} food, and has absorbed much of {{the cuisine}} of England, Welsh diets now <b>owe</b> more to the countries of India, China and the United States.

50|$|This case {{involved}} three parties: Harris, Balk, and Epstein. Harris <b>owed</b> Balk money and Balk <b>owed</b> Epstein money. Thus, {{there was no}} debt relationship between Harris and Epstein. Harris and Balk lived in North Carolina while Epstein lived in Maryland. Harris traveled to Maryland. While he was there, Epstein attached the debt Harris <b>owed</b> Balk in order for Epstein to obtain jurisdiction over Balk. Through this, Epstein hoped to obtain the debt that Balk <b>owed</b> him by accessing the debt Harris <b>owed</b> Balk. Consequently, Epstein obtained a judgment against Balk which directed Harris to pay Epstein instead of Balk.|$|R

5000|$|The {{identity}} of the creditors of the bank gives a vivid sense of how significant the bank’s failure was: Lord Fitzwilliams was <b>owed</b> £999 and his wife £675; Sir John Holt (Lord Chief Justice) of King’s Bench, was <b>owed</b> £500; Viscount Lanesborough was <b>owed</b> £2,100; Earl Lorraine was <b>owed</b> £5,919; the Duke of Marlborough was <b>owed</b> £1,268; the Duke of Norfolk was <b>owed</b> £872; the Duke of Newcastle was <b>owed</b> £1,570, and the list of proved debts goes on, running to 217 names and totalling £54,079. A broken man, John Coggs died shortly afterwards. [...] John Dann was astute enough {{to cooperate with the}} bank’s trustees over the years in liquidating the banks assets. For this he and family received small payments from time to time from the estate. He died in 1722. Sir Francis Child, (1642-1713) of the bankers Messrs. Child & Co. with whom Coggs & Dann kept a clearing account, took over most of the business.|$|R

5|$|People who <b>owe</b> 3,800,000 Lebanese Pounds ($2,500) or more {{in child}} support, are not {{eligible}} to receive a Lebanese passport.

All questions about their child support arrears or {{the status of a}} payment should be directed to the appropriate child support enforcement agency.|$|E
50|$|The {{legal defense}} of set-off (above) was {{originally}} introduced {{to prevent the}} unfair situation whereby a person ("Party A") who <b>owed</b> money to another ("Party B") could be sent to debtors' prison, {{despite the fact that}} Party B also <b>owed</b> money to Party A. The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court. Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum <b>owing</b> (e.g. If Party A <b>owes</b> Party B 100 and Party B <b>owes</b> Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A).|$|R

5|$|The moral {{systems of}} religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our {{kids in a}} {{religious}} way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in.

5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we <b>owe</b> duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We <b>owe</b> a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E
