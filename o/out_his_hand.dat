5|$|The {{following}} week, the Jets faced their division rivals, the Patriots. Despite a second-half lead by New England, {{the game}} was tied {{at the end of}} regulation forcing overtime. Following a Patriots field goal, Sanchez had the ball knocked <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> by linebacker Rob Ninkovich who recovered the fumble and sealed the Patriots' victory. This was Sanchez's best overall performance to that point in the season as he completed a career record 68% of his passes when attempting 40 or more passes. Sanchez's struggles continued in the following two games against Miami and Seattle; in Seattle, Sanchez completed 9-of-22 passes for 124 yards while throwing his fourth red zone interception of the year and was the fifth game of the season where he completed under 50% of his pass attempts.|$|E

However, on the next lap, Patrese spun {{and he could not}} select full gears then. He went to the pits and retired. At the same time, Prost passed Berger to take third. Mansell now began to hound Senna and went all directions to get ahead.|$|E
25|$|David {{gathered}} {{together all the}} chosen men of Israel — 30,000 in all — and went to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant from Baale-judah. They brought the Ark {{out of the house}} of Abinadab and set it on a new cart. Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart, with Ahio going before the Ark. David and the Israelites played with all manner of instruments — harps, psalteries, timbrels, sistra, and cymbals. When they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah put <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to the Ark. In anger, God smote Uzzah for his error, and Uzzah died by the Ark.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that the majority}} were completed by Jan, from an overall design by Hubert, who probably oversaw the construction {{of most of the}} frames. A number of difficulties present themselves, not least that there is no surviving work confidently attributed to Hubert, and it is thus impossible to detect his style. Instead, art historians have resorted to comparing individual passages to known works by Jan, looking for stylistic differences that might indicate the work of another hand. Advances in Dendrochronology have for example established that parts of the wing panels were felled around 1421. Allowing a seasoning time of at least 10 years, we must assume a completion date well after Hubert's death in 1426, thus ruling <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> from large portions of the wings.|$|E

500|$|Alf made no real {{attempt to}} contact John {{again until the}} height of Beatlemania (claiming {{he did not know}} who the Beatles were). He was working as a kitchen porter at the Greyhound Hotel at Hampton Court, in Middlesex, when someone pointed out a {{photograph}} of John Lennon in a newspaper and asked whether he was related to him. Alfred and Charlie visited one of the Beatles' Christmas shows at the Finsbury Park Empire in London. When the Beatles were filming a scene for A Hard Day's Night in the Scala Theatre in Soho in April 1964, Alf walked into Brian Epstein's NEMS office in Argyle Street with a journalist. [...] "I'm John Lennon's father", he explained to the receptionist. When Epstein was informed, he [...] "went into a panic", and immediately sent a car to bring John to NEMS office. Alf was shabbily dressed, with his unkempt, thinning grey hair greased back. He stuck <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> but John did not take it, saying [...] "What do you want?". Alf placated John somewhat by saying, [...] "You can't turn your back on your family, no matter what they've done." [...] Their conversation did not last long, as John soon ordered Alf and the journalist out of the NEMS office. The Beatles' personal stories were kept out of the newspapers—by agreement with journalists who were offered exclusive stories in return—but one day John opened a copy of the Daily Express and saw a photo of his father.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses to stretch <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and God sent thunder and hail, which struck down all exposed in Egypt, but did not strike Goshen. Pharaoh confessed his wrong, agreed to let the Israelites go, and asked Moses and Aaron to pray to end the hail. Moses told Pharaoh that he would do so, and the hail would end so that Pharaoh would know that the earth is God's, but Moses knew that Pharaoh and his servants would not yet fear God. The hail had destroyed the flax and the barley, but not the wheat and the spelt, which ripened later.|$|E
2500|$|Pius XI {{was also}} a very {{demanding}} individual, {{certainly one of the}} stricter pontiffs at that time. He held very high standards and did not tolerate any sort of behaviour that was not up to that standard. In regard to Angelo Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII, a diplomatic blunder in Bulgaria, where Roncalli was stationed, led Pius XI to make Roncalli kneel for 45 minutes as a punishment. However, it should also be indicated that when in due course Pius learnt that Roncalli had made the error in circumstances for which he could not fairly be considered culpable, he apologized to him. Aware of the implied impropriety of a Supreme Pontiff's going back on a reprimand in a matter concerning Catholic faith and morals, but also deeply conscious that on a human level he had failed to keep his temper in check, he made his apology [...] "as Achille Ratti" [...] and in doing so stretched <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in friendship to Monsignor Roncalli.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God {{directed}} Moses to tell Israel's elders what God had promised, and predicted {{that they would}} heed Moses and go with him to tell Pharaoh that God had met with them and request that Pharaoh allow them to go three days' journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to God. God knew that Pharaoh would not let them go unless forced by a mighty hand, so God would strike Egypt with wonders, and then Pharaoh would let them go. God would make the Egyptians view the Israelites favorably, so that the Israelites would not leave empty handed, but every woman would ask her neighbor for jewels and clothing and the Israelites would strip the Egyptians. Moses predicted {{that they would not}} believe him, so God told him to cast his rod on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from it. God told Moses to take it by the tail, he did so, and it became a rod again. God explained that this was so that they might believe that God had appeared to Moses. Then God told Moses to put his hand into his bosom, he did, and when he took it <b>out,</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> was leprous, as white as snow. God told him to put his hand back into his bosom, he did, and when he took it out, it had returned to normal. God predicted that if they would not heed the first sign, then they would believe the second sign, and if they would not believe those two signs, then Moses was to take water from the river and pour it on the land, and the water would become blood. Moses protested that he was not a man of words but was slow of speech, but God asked him who had made man's mouth, so Moses should go, and God would teach him what to say. Moses pleaded with God to send someone else, and God became angry with Moses. God said that Moses' well-spoken brother Aaron was coming to meet him, Moses would tell him the words that God would teach them, he would be Moses' spokesman, and Moses would be like God to him.

2500|$|At {{the time}} when Antiochus {{approached}} Ptolemy and meant to occupy Pelusium, Caius Popilius Laenas, the Roman commander, on Antiochus greeting him from a distance and then holding <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> handed to the king, as he had it by him, the copy of the senatus-consultum, {{and told him to}} read it first, not thinking it proper, as it seems to me, to make the conventional sign of friendship before he knew if the intentions of him who was greeting him were friendly or hostile. But when the king, after reading it, {{said he would like to}} communicate with his friends about this intelligence, Popilius acted in a manner which was thought to be offensive and exceedingly arrogant. He was carrying a stick cut from a vine, and with this he drew a circle round Antiochus and told him he must remain inside this circle until he gave his decision about the contents of the letter. The king was astonished at this authoritative proceeding, but, after a few moments' hesitation, said he would do all that the Romans demanded. Upon this Popilius and his suite all grasped him by the hand and greeted him warmly. The letter ordered him to put an end at once to the war with Ptolemy. So, as a fixed number of days were allowed to him, he led his army back to Syria, deeply hurt and complaining indeed, but yielding to circumstances for the present. Popilius after arranging matters in Alexandria and exhorting the two kings there to act in common, ordering them also to send Polyaratus to Rome, sailed for Cyprus, wishing to lose no time in expelling the Syrian troops that were in the island. When they arrived, finding that Ptolemy's generals had been defeated and that the affairs of Cyprus were generally in a topsy-turvy state, they soon made the Syrian army retire from the country, and waited until the troops took ship for Syria. In this way the Romans saved the kingdom of Ptolemy, which had almost been crushed out of existence: Fortune having so directed the matter of Perseus and Macedonia that when the position of Alexandria and the whole of Egypt was almost desperate, all was again set right simply owing to the fact that the fate of Perseus had been decided. For had this not been so, and had not Antiochus been certain of it, he would never, I think, have obeyed the Roman behests.
