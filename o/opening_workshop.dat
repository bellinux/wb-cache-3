5000|$|After graduating, Menken's {{plan was}} to become either a rock star or a {{recording}} artist. His interest in writing musicals increased {{when he joined the}} Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) Musical Theatre Workshop and was mentored by Lehman Engel. From 1974 to 1978, he showcased various BMI workshop works, such as Midnight, Apartment House (lyric by Muriel Robinson), Conversations with Pierre,Harry the Rat and Messiah on Mott Street (lyrics by David Zippel). According to Menken, during this period, he [...] "worked as a ballet and modern dance accompanist, a musical director for club acts, a jingle writer, arranger, a songwriter for Sesame Street and a vocal coach. He performed his material at clubs like The Ballroom, Reno Sweeny and Tramps." [...] In 1976, John Wilson reported for The New York Times that members of Engel's BMI Workshop began performing as part of the [...] "Broadway at the Ballroom" [...] series: [...] "The <b>opening</b> <b>workshop</b> program ... featured Maury Yeston and Alan Menken, both playing their piano accompaniment and singing songs they have written for potential musicals." [...] Wilson reviewed a performance at the Ballroom in 1977 where Menken accompanied a singer: [...] "In the current cabaret world, a piano accompanist is no longer expected to merely play piano for a singer. More and more, pianists can be heard joining in vocally, harmonizing with the singer, creating a background of shouts and exclamations or even doing brief passages of solo singing." ...|$|E

40|$|Janet Kupperman, FACSM, Rachel Mead, Shelby McNealy. Rockhurst University. Kansas City, Missouri Workplace falls {{result in}} {{significant}} medical and legal costs. Regardless of financial concern, Rockhurst’s established value of “CuraPersonalis,” {{care of the}} whole person, places high priority on the welfare of Rockhurst’s campus members. PURPOSE: The current investigation was undertaken to examine fall risk factors, the pattern of Rockhurst falls, and general and Rockhurst fall prevention strategies and to implement a fall prevention program consistent with findings. METHODS: A campus-wide safety audit was performed using a previously published checklist. The most common issue was electrical cords on floors that could pose a tripping hazard. Fall prevention initiatives on the Rockhurst campus mainly related to communication. Information about falls reported to Campus Security from September 2014 to July 2015 was categorized based on location and individuals involved. While the number and severity of reported falls did indicate that an exercise-based intervention program was warranted, an informational campaign was considered useful. Investigators staffed a table with brochures, a computer displaying an educational video, and a poster during the initial part of the all-employee university <b>opening</b> <b>workshop.</b> They engaged interested individuals in conversation about fall prevention and offered to provide tripping hazard signage. Copies of three different brochures were distributed and displayed in eight offices on campus, and the tripping hazard signs were made available. RESULTS: Few individuals took initiative to view materials at the <b>opening</b> <b>workshop.</b> Those who approached investigators engaged them in conversation about falls, often describing unreported falls. Investigators distributed brochures to each individual on entering the meeting room. With respect to brochures distributed to campus offices, after ten days, no brochures remained at four locations, and seven to nine brochures remained at four other locations. Repeating the audit at that time revealed many {{but not all of}} the same tripping hazards. CONCLUSION: The level of concern displayed by the administrator who initiated interest in the project was inconsistent with the data on reported falls. Since anecdotal evidence suggested that fall underreporting, especially falls that did not result in major injuries, may be prevalent, ongoing informational efforts may be both helpful and aligned with Rockhurst values...|$|E
40|$|PREFACE In early America most quilts {{were made}} for {{utilitarian}} purposes. Later, when time and fabrics became more plentiful, quilt making developed into an art form which flourished during the 19 th century and continues to do so today. Within the broad definition of 2 ̆ 2 patchwork, 2 ̆ 2 three types are represented in this exhibition-pieced, applique and crazy. Pieced quilts are made from materials cut in geometric shapes and put together in pattern blocks. These blocks are repeated to form the quilt top. The designs were often of political, historical or religious events, but many also were associated with abstract visual ideas and images. 2 ̆ 2 Rocky Road to California 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Lincoln Quilt 2 ̆ 2 are examples of the first category; 2 ̆ 2 Indiana Puzzle 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Log Cabin 2 ̆ 2 the second; 2 ̆ 2 Star of Bethlehem 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Jacobs Ladder 2 ̆ 2 the third. Names, however, varied for the identical pattern in different localities. Applique quilts are made by cutting patterns and sewing them to a base cloth. Usually these were not made for regular household use, but rather tended to be the 2 ̆ 2 pretty 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 quilts and had flowers, trees, birds or fruit as motifs. Crazy quilts are made of odd-shaped {{bits and pieces of}} material put together in a random pattern. These reached their artistic height in the Victorian era when fabrics such as silks and velvets replaced cottons and flannels. Creative stitchery fills in certain patches and lines the edges of others. Crazy quilts were often used as decorative throws on couches. All the quilts in this exhibition belong to either museums or individuals in Nebraska and many were made by native Nebraskans. Of special note are the five quilts created by Mrs. Grace Snyder of North Platte. Almost three hundred examples were assembled for consideration and from this number fifty-five were selected solely on their merits as works of art. Their patterns, colors and materials illustrate the wide range quilting provides for individual creativity. Considerations relating to workmanship, condition and age were not used as criteria of primary importance. From this selective sampling {{it can be seen that}} 2 ̆ 2 quilt making 2 ̆ 2 is an art form of quality and importance. INTRODUCTION A quilt is a bedcover, that 2 ̆ 7 s for sure, but it is not a coverlet nor is it a counterpane. It is usually made of two thicknesses of fabric, the top or front pieced together from a variety of materials in a number of colors; the back or lining is generally of one piece in one color, the two frequently but not invariably sandwich a layer of soft padding and the whole thing is stitched through from front to back in a pattern which may conform tei the pieced design or may, on the contrary, follow its own pattern in a kind of visual counterpoint. The pattern can be further embellished with needlework of various kinds, ornamental or commemorative, and, after generations of practice and invention, quilt making has achieved an iconography of its own reflecting the domestic inspirations of uncounted, anonymous, female artists. One has only to recite the names of the traditional patterns to sense the interplay of skill and imagination which makes a quilt into a work of art. At their functional level they have kept the sleeper warm. In addition they have filled the role of social coordinator. They have been the inspiration of virtuoso needlework as well as creative invention. They have been valued elements in a dowry and part of an inheritance handed down through the generations of a family. At their most extraordinary levels of accomplishment they have been status symbols, entirely divorced from the vulgarity of use. Nowadays they are apt to hang on a wall like a painting and to even hang on the walls of an art gallery, their apotheosis achieved. All these considerations have come into play in the organization of this exhibition and it is more than a pleasure to acknowledge the hard work of the members of the Lincoln Quilters Guild and the staff of the Sheldon Gallery in bringing to public attention the achievements of this traditional anonymous art as it exists in the public and private collections of Nebraska. Fortunately, some of the makers are known to us, some of them are giving the art its contemporary form, and we are happy to give them the recognition they deserve. As a gallery-community collaboration it is a pleasure to acknowledge in particular Mrs. Velda Coffey, who first brought the idea of the exhibition to our consideration, Mrs. Mary Ghormley, Mrs. Louise Howey, Mrs. Jean Harnsberger, Mrs. Sally Campbell all of whom provided the knowledge, energy and enthusiasm which is so necessary to the realization of such projects. Our thanks as well to Mrs. Imelda DeGraw of the Denver Museum, who brought a trained curatorial eye to the selection of examples to be shown, to Jon Nelson whose installation took full advantage of the visual amenities of the Sheldon Gallery and to Mrs. Beth Gutcheon who brought to the <b>opening</b> <b>workshop</b> the essential warmth of the creative process itself. Lastly, the catalogue which provides a permanent record of the event, is in no small way the result of the fastidious professionalism of Kaz Tada and Paul Bateman...|$|E

5000|$|The Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) {{had been}} {{established}} in 1845 {{with the aim of}} building a railway to connect Aberdeen with Inverness. Although authorised in 1846, construction did not begin until 1852, with the first section of line being opened in 1854. While the line was still under construction, it became necessary to consider the provision of locomotives in time for the <b>opening.</b> <b>Workshops</b> at Kittybrewster for the repair of locomotives were under construction, and Clark was appointed Superintendent of the Locomotive Works in October 1853. For the opening of the line, he designed two basically similar classes of 2-4-0 tender locomotives, one with driving wheels 5 ft in diameter for passenger service, and the other, for goods trains, having 5 ft driving wheels. Seven passenger engines and five goods were ordered from William Fairbairn & Sons of Manchester, since Kittybrewster Works was not intended for locomotive construction: no new engines were built there until 1887. The first section of the line (from [...] to [...] ) was opened for traffic on 12 September 1854, but by October only five of the passenger engines had been delivered, and just two more had arrived by the time of his resignation; the five goods engines arrived a few months later.|$|R
