40|$|AbstractChild-Resistant Packagings (CRPs) {{have emerged}} as a {{solution}} to prevent poisoning accidents involving children, however these packagings end up becoming an obstacle in the opening process, for youth, adults and especially the elderly. In this type of packaging is common for the <b>opening</b> <b>instructions</b> be arranged on top of the cap, but there is no pattern for how this information is presented. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the visualization and comprehension of <b>opening</b> <b>instructions</b> in squeeze-and-turn CRPs. The study had the participation of 10 adult subjects and 12 elderly subjects, which were equally divided between men and women. Three different packaging of mouthwashes were used. Data was tabulated in electronic spreadsheets. The results show that the packaging with the largest diameter and the most simple and objective image showed the best visualization and comprehension levels...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{packaging}} {{was designed}} to preserve and protect the goods it contained and catch {{the eye of a}} consumer. In order to achieve these objectives, strong, tight seals were often used, and <b>opening</b> <b>instructions</b> were kept to a minimum. This meant that there were numerous types of packaging that many consumers found difficult t...|$|R
5000|$|Another hazard {{in the use}} of {{overwing}} exits is {{them being}} improperly opened (usually a result of passengers in these seats not paying attention to the verbal briefing provided pre-departure, or not observing the <b>opening</b> <b>instructions</b> on the safety card and on the exit). The majority of overwing exits involve the passenger physically removing the hatch from its frame and disposing of it outside on the wing without blocking the exit. Research conducted at the Cranfield Institute in the UK [...] showed that many passengers are prone to leaving the exit hatch on the seat next to the exit, thereby hindering other passengers' egress through the exit.|$|R
50|$|The term {{refrigerate}} after <b>opening</b> is an <b>instruction</b> {{on commercial}} preserved food products {{to cool the}} container {{after it has been}} opened and the contents exposed to open air.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, {{child safety}} locking {{mechanisms}} {{have been required}} by law since 1970 on all containers for potentially dangerous medicines and household cleaning products. These laws are enforced by the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These locking mechanisms may take several forms, but the most common is a design that requires a tab to be pressed firmly as the lid is twisted. Great strength and dexterity {{are not required to}} open the bottle, but the process is deliberately made to be unintuitive, and the children who might recklessly eat pills are unable to decipher the <b>opening</b> <b>instructions.</b> Parents and guardians are firmly admonished [...] to keep all such containers {{out of the reach of}} children anyway, as no locking device is foolproof. It has become common practice in households to keep medicines and pills in high cabinets (sometimes locked) for safety. Cleaning agents, however, are still generally kept under sinks, where they are accessible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first song}} {{to be played}} on air, George Benson's [...] "Breezin'," [...] was played at the wrong speedfor a few bars by the station's first presenter, John Amies. Amies {{suggested}} {{this was due to}} repeated rehearsals of the station <b>opening</b> on <b>instruction</b> from studio manager Gary Collins, who was allegedly fussing around him in the studio right before the station went on air.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study that includes some basic concepts about the weather, how some children misunderstand these concepts, and possible reasons for the misunderstandings. Student misconceptions can provide an <b>opening</b> for <b>instruction.</b> When teachers know what their students are thinking about a topic they can tailor experiments and activities which challenge the students' thinking. This list of topic-related misconceptions is made available to teachers so they can review the list prior to instruction in order to prepare lessons which challenge students' preconcieved notions about weather. Educational levels: Graduate or professional...|$|R
50|$|Kernspecht invited Leung Ting to Germany in 1975 and had {{years of}} private <b>instruction,</b> <b>opening</b> the first office of EWTO in 1979. Today, EWTO {{incorporates}} {{a range of}} martial arts, most notably Wing Tsun under the International WingTsun Association of Leung Ting and also Newman-Escrima, the Eskrima interpretation of Bill Newman.|$|R
50|$|As bishop, he {{strongly}} supported <b>instruction,</b> <b>opening</b> the first primary school in Blaj, establishing over fifty parish schools, and founding the diocesan printing press in Blaj. The pastoral activities of Aron were hindered by the disturbance of the Orthodox monk Sofronie, which took {{the proportions of}} a violent riot supported by the Serbians.|$|R
50|$|Hillcrest High School is the {{youngest}} of the ten state and state-integrated secondary schools in Hamilton, <b>opening</b> for <b>instruction</b> {{for the first time in}} January 1972, although it plans to be superseded by a new secondary school at Rototuna in about 2016. Like many New Zealand state secondary schools built in the 1970s, Hillcrest was built to the S68 common design plan, characterised by single-storey classroom blocks of concrete block or brick construction (Hillcrest uses brick), with low-pitched roofs, protruding clerestory windows and internal open courtyards. The school has three full-sized S68 blocks (B, C, and D blocks) and one half-sized S68 block (western half of E block - the eastern half is a later addition).|$|R
5000|$|In {{an attempt}} to deny their existence, the Turkish {{government}} categorized Kurds as [...] "Mountain Turks" [...] until 1991. Since then, the Kurdish population of Turkey has long sought to have Kurdish included as a language of instruction in public schools {{as well as a}} subject. Several attempts at <b>opening</b> Kurdish <b>instruction</b> centers were stopped on technical grounds, such as wrong dimensions of doors. Turkish sources claimed that running Kurdish-language schools was wound up in 2004 because of an apparent lack of interest. Even though Kurdish language schools have started to operate, many of them have been forced to shut down due to over-regulation by the state. Kurdish language institutes have been monitored under strict surveillance and bureaucratic pressure. Using Kurdish language as main education language is illegal in Turkey. It is accepted only as subject courses.|$|R
25|$|The University of Southern Mississippi {{was founded}} on March 30, 1910 as Mississippi Normal College, a teacher-training school. The college's first president, Joseph Anderson Cook, presided over the <b>opening</b> session of <b>instruction</b> on September 18, 1912 and oversaw the {{construction}} of College Hall (the academic building); Forrest County Hall (men's and married students' dormitory); Hattiesburg Hall (women's dormitory); the Industrial Cottage (training laboratory for home management); and the president's home (now the Ogletree Alumni House). In its first session, Mississippi Normal College had a total enrollment of 876 students.|$|R
50|$|It {{describes}} itself as:"Navya Shastra is a Hindu organization, which unites {{members from}} various Hindu sects, various walks of life, and {{various parts of}} the world under the banner of Sanatana Dharma to bring about a genuine reform of the social structure in the Hindu religious tradition. All Hindus who believe in bringing a true reform in Hindu religious tradition, ending caste and gender distinctions based on the purana shastras, and <b>opening</b> Vedic/Agamic <b>instruction</b> to all already subscribe to the Navya Shastric ideals, whether they are members of Navya Shastra or not. People who subscribe to the Navya Shastric ideals may belong to any Hindu sectarian or religious tradition, may be Hindu by birth or conversion, or anyone who is a friend of Sanatana Dharma and supports the idea of a genuine Hindu renaissance. Navya Shastra fully appreciates and respects other Hindu organizations, which are working toward the same goal of ending casteism in Hinduism, but we do not believe in founding new sects to propagate our ideals."Navya Shastra was active in relief work among Indian communities affected by the 2004 tsunami.|$|R
5000|$|Fluxus {{is similar}} in spirit to the earlier art {{movement}} of Dada, emphasizing the concept of anti-art and taking jabs at the seriousness of modern art. Fluxus artists used their minimal performances to highlight their perceived connections between everyday objects and art, similarly to Duchamp in pieces such as Fountain. Fluxus art was often presented in [...] "events", which Fluxus member George Brecht defined as [...] "the smallest unit of a situation". The events consisted of a minimal <b>instruction,</b> <b>opening</b> the events to accidents and other unintended effects. Also contributing to the randomness of events was the integration of audience members into the performances, realizing Duchamp's notion of the viewer completing the art work.|$|R
60|$|About two Months after this, our Regiment, {{among many}} others, was, {{according}} to Order, shipp'd {{off on a}} Secret Expedition, under the Command of the Duke of Leinster, no Man knowing to what Place we were going, or on what Design; no, not the Commander himself. However, when we were out at Sea, the General, according to <b>Instructions,</b> <b>opening</b> his Commission, we were soon put out of our Suspence, and inform'd, that our Orders were to attack Dunkirk. But what was so grand a Secret to those concern'd in the Expedition, having been intrusted to a Female Politician on Land, it was soon discover'd to the Enemy; for which Reason our Orders were countermanded, before we reach'd the Place of Action, and our Forces receiv'd Directions to land at Ostend.|$|R
