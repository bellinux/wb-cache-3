5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they}} were accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E

5|$|Kosygin {{would prove}} to be a very {{competent}} administrator, with the Soviet standard of living rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy. Kosygin's moderate 1965 reform, as with Nikita Khrushchev's thaw, radicalised the Soviet reform movement. While Leonid Brezhnev was content to maintain the centralised structure of the Soviet planned economy, Kosygin attempted to revitalise the ailing economic system by decentralising management. Following Brezhnev's death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov's path <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> control and Gorbachev's liberalisation of all aspects of public life.|$|E

He attended advanced individual training in September and October of that year, followed by a honeymoon trip to New York City, New York.

5|$|After graduating, Horvath {{attended}} Ohio State University on a work scholarship, {{but managed}} to make the school's football team in 1940. Horvath was small for a football player – he weighed just 160 pounds – but was a quick runner and had a strong arm. Ohio State's football team was a disappointment in 1940, however, finishing {{the season with a}} 4–4 win–loss record under head coach Francis Schmidt. Schmidt was fired after the season and replaced by Paul Brown, an Ohio high school coach who had guided Massillon Washington to a series of undefeated records and state championships. Brown simplified Ohio State's offense, but imposed a level <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> organization that had been absent under Schmidt. Horvath was a reserve halfback in the Buckeyes' single-wing offense in 1941, when the team posted a 6–1–1 win–loss–tie record and finished second in the Big Ten Conference standings. He played in many games, but senior fullback Jack Graf and senior halfback Tom Kinkade got most of the carries for Ohio State.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to convince his fellow Hominidae to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan, Costello, who has taken command from the recently deceased Thorn. The band builds windbreaks to help them descend more often from the trees, thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground. A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member, Re, who not only questions the leading abilities of the present alpha but also desires Costello's females. To alleviate the escalating debate of authority, Pitar tries to implement a parliament to settle disputes peacefully. Costello, however, considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power, citing famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln; the other members ruin this noble idea with their lack <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> ostentatious indifference.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{a control}} system was {{inspired}} by Vladimir Lenin in The State and Revolution. Lenin argued that every communist vanguard party, at all levels, needed a system to supervise party-official elections, dismissals and performance. His writings led {{to the establishment of}} the Soviet Central Control Commission; the control system and the Communist Party of China (CPC) structure were imported to China. The importance <b>of</b> <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> supervision was emphasised since the CPC's founding. The 2nd National Congress amended the party constitution, devoting a chapter to party discipline. However, no institution was established to safeguard party norms or supervise cadre behaviour. Until the establishment of the Central Control Commission (CCC) at the 5th National Congress in 1927, local party committees were responsible for supervising members and control commissions were established at the central and provincial level.|$|E
