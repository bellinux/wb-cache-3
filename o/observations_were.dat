Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope {{was used to determine}} the amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine the}} mass of the planet. Independently, <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E

The goal of direct <b>observation</b> <b>is</b> to record the immediate antecedent and consequences that functions with the problem behavior within a natural environment. The main advantage of direct <b>observation</b> <b>is</b> that the antecedents and consequences are recorded as it happens instead of recollection of memory. Therefore, the information recorded is generally more accurate. The main disadvantage of direct <b>observation</b> <b>is</b> it requires {{a considerable amount of}} time and effort to implement. Another thing about direct <b>observation</b> <b>is,</b> like indirect methods, it can only demonstrate a correlation but not a functional relationship.|$|R

5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{the theory of}} biology, {{grounded}} in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science.

Depending {{on the degree of}} correlation between the sensors' observations and the variance of the noise affecting the sensors, the performance of the mGLRT varies when compared to the optimal independent test. The mGLRT out-performs the optimal independent test the most when the sensors' <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> highly correlated and the variances of the sensors' <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> not equal. Interestingly, when the sensors' <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> of equal variance and all <b>observations</b> <b>are</b> highly correlated, the performance of the optimal independent test matches that of the mGLRT.|$|R

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{were first}} {{studied in the}} wild by Petter and colleagues in 1971. His <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> {{secondary}} to his primary research interest, the fork-marked lemurs north of Morondava. Both northern and southern populations were studied intermittently between 1978 and 1981, and in 1993, long-term social and genetic studies began in Kirindy Forest. Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b was {{difficult}} to confirm because its star experiences high jitter, which disrupted the ability to obtain accurate measurements. As such, {{a greater number of}} radial velocity <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could not be determined using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation came about after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios.|$|E

5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} drawn by hand.

Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more was}} {{discovered}} about Venus until the 20thcentury. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet <b>observations</b> <b>were</b> carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Observations</b> <b>are</b> the {{raw data}} fed into orbit {{determination}} algorithms. Observations made by a ground-based observer typically consist of time-tagged azimuth, elevation, range, and/or range-rate values.
