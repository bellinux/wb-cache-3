When Briggs returned to Sacramento, he wrote a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools throughout California. Briggs claimed in private that he had nothing against gays, telling gay journalist Randy Shilts, [...] "It's politics. Just politics." [...] Random attacks <b>on</b> <b>gays</b> rose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Castro. When the police response was considered inadequate, groups of gays patrolled the neighborhood themselves, on alert for attackers. On June 21, 1977, a gay man named Robert Hillsborough died from 15 stab wounds while his attackers gathered around him and chanted [...] "Faggot!" [...] Both Mayor Moscone and Hillsborough's mother blamed Anita Bryant and John Briggs. One week prior to the incident, Briggs had held a press conference at San Francisco City Hall where he called the city a [...] "sexual garbage heap" [...] because of homosexuals.

50|$|Significant change {{took place}} to {{legislation}} relating to rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people during Blair's period in office. During his first term, {{the age of}} consent for homosexuals was equalised at 16 (see Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000) and the ban <b>on</b> <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> armed forces was lifted. Subsequently, in 2005, a Civil Partnership Act came into effect, allowing gay couples to form legally recognised partnerships. At the end of September 2006 more than 30,000 Britons had entered into Civil Partnerships {{as a result of}} this law. Adoption by gay couples was legalised, and discrimination in the workplace (Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003), and in relation to the provision of goods and services (Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations) were both made illegal. Transgender people were given the right to change their birth certificate to reflect their new gender as a result of the Gender Recognition Act 2004.

50|$|By {{the time}} of his switch, no Republican Senator had a lower {{lifetime}} score from the American Conservative Union. In 1981, Jeffords was the only Republican member of the House to vote against a bill reducing the top tax rate from 70 per cent to 50 per cent — a hallmark of President Ronald Reagan's legacy. During his time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Brady Bill, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, an end to <b>the</b> ban <b>on</b> <b>gays</b> serving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military, and against permanent normal trade relations with China and barring affirmative action at the federal level. Jeffords was also vocal in his opposition to the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States by President George H. W. Bush. He was one of only two Republicans to vote against confirming Clarence Thomas. In 1993, he was the only prominent Republican to support President Clinton's unsuccessful attempt to establish a national healthcare plan. Jeffords's voting record and positions on environmental issues put further distance between himself and his Republican Party colleagues.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 On February 9 th, 2014 Michael Sam {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with ESPN's "Outside the Lines" that he is gay. Since he was drafted, Sam will become the first ever openly <b>gay</b> player <b>in</b> NFL history. <b>The</b> following study aims to explore ESPN's coverage of Michael Sam, with a goal of identifying how their coverage shapes perspective <b>on</b> <b>gay</b> identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL. Because of the NFL's impact and prominence, it is important to look at Michael Sam as the first ever-active openly <b>gay</b> football player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Football league. Since Sam is the first active, openly gay player to navigate this identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL, it is crucial to look at how Sam is portrayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media, and if media portrayed has any impact on public opinion. ESPN was the first to cover Sam coming out, {{and is one of the}} most influential sports news sources. Therefore focusing on their coverage will provide a consistent point of view, as well as an appropriate understanding of media coverage <b>on</b> <b>gay</b> athletes. This thesis analyzes the rhetorical strategies of ESPN's coverage of Michael Sam, and the impact their coverage had on public perspective of <b>gay</b> athletes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL. Utilizing an interdisciplinary approach guided by a cluster criticism methodology, the analysis finds that ESPN did seek to shape public perspective <b>on</b> <b>gay</b> identity through their entrance into the national discussion <b>on</b> <b>gay</b> rights and the opportunity to address gay rights to a new public...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{print media}} {{discourse}} <b>on</b> <b>gay</b> families <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of HIV/AIDS and {{the gay rights}} movement. Comparing and contrasting reports from the mainstream heterosexual press, the mainstream gay press, and the gay community press, revealed a moral discourse on AIDS that implicated gay men throughout the 1980 s. At the same time, a resurgence appeared in religious conservative forces working to recuperate the traditional nuclear family ideal through a family values agenda. The importance of family <b>in</b> <b>gay</b> communities during <b>the</b> 1980 s meant {{that the existence of}} gay families, legal and social discrimination, and caregiving support, became important components <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gay/AIDS movement. As cases of HIV and AIDS surfaced <b>in</b> hetereosexuals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980 s, and AIDS factored into the traditional home and family domain, a discourse <b>on</b> <b>gay</b> families also started to emerge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mainstream press. Unlike the media images projected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous decade of single promiscuous gay men with AIDS, gay families were presented as normalized: sanitized, monogamous, and AIDS-free, much like the traditional nuclear family. The issues around HIV, AIDS, AIDS stigmatization and discrimination <b>in</b> <b>gay</b> families were left unmentioned <b>in</b> these reports. <b>The</b> contextualization of HIV/AIDS and gay families also waned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> community press during the 1990 s as a result of changing attitudes around disease, death, and the family, although gay families continue to be talked about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of <b>gay</b> rights...|$|R
