40|$|Worldwide {{demand for}} {{therapeutic}} herbal and neutraceutical preparations has increased greatly in past few years. In India, like <b>other</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>preparations,</b> {{there is a}} need to put strict regulations over the microbial quality of such preparations since they are consumed internally and safety is of prime concern. In this work we have focused on assessing the microbial quality of few marketed herbal liquid oral preparations. These preparations were procured from retail pharmacy outlets and traditional medicine sales outlets in western Maharashtra (India). None of the test samples could comply with the safety limits prescribed by WHO. This fact certainly cannot be ignored, and thus there is an immense need to prescribe and follow stringent regulations regarding microbiological quality of such herbal preparations...|$|E

Michaela Voříšková Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Králové, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Drug Control The HPLC method for determination of camphor content in pharmaceutical preparation Unguentum camphoratum vaselinatum 10 % using monolithic column was developed. The time of analysis was shorted on 1, 3 min. The chromatographic column Chromolith Speed rod, RP- 18 e 50 - 4, 6 mm and chromatographic precolumn Chromolith, RP- 18 e 10 - 4, 6 mm with mobile phase water : methanol 35 : 65 were used. UV detector for the determination with the setting wave lenght 289 nm was used. The metod was validated for accuracy (recovery = 99, 03 %), precision (RSD = 0, 83 %), linearity (R = 0, 9995) and for specificity. The metod was also tested in <b>other</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>preparations</b> containing camphor...|$|E
40|$|Botulinum neurotoxin has {{revolutionized}} {{the treatment of}} spasticity and is now administered worldwide. There are currently three leading botulinum neurotoxin type A products available in the Western Hemisphere: onabotulinum toxin-A (ONA) Botox®, abobotulinum toxin-A (ABO), Dysport®, and incobotulinum toxin A (INCO, Xeomin®). Although the efficacies are similar, there is an intense debate regarding the comparability of various preparations. Here we will address the clinical issues of potency and conversion ratios, as well as safety issues such as toxin spread and immunogenicity, to provide guidance for BoNT-A use in clinical practice. INCO was shown to {{be as effective as}} ONA with a comparable adverse event profile when a clinical conversion ratio of 1 : 1 was used. The available clinical and preclinical data suggest that a conversion ratio ABO:ONA of 3 : 1 —or even lower—could be appropriate for treating spasticity, cervical dystonia, and blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. A higher conversion ratio may lead to an overdosing of ABO. While uncommon, distant spread may occur; however, several factors <b>other</b> than the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>preparation</b> are thought to affect spread. Finally, whereas the three products have similar efficacy when properly dosed, ABO has a better cost-efficacy profile...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to develop and {{evaluate}} a new method for the production of puerarin phospholipids complex (PPC) microparticles. The advanced particle formation method, solution enhanced dispersion by supercritical fluids (SEDS), was used for the preparation of puerarin (Pur), phospholipids (PC) and their complex particles for the first time. Evaluation of the processing variables on PPC particle characteristics was also conducted. The processing variables included temperature, pressure, solution concentration, the flow rate of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) and the relative flow rate of drug solution to CO 2. The morphology, particle size and size distribution of the particles were determined. Meanwhile Pur and phospholipids were separately prepared by gas antisolvent precipitation (GAS) method and solid characterization of particles by the two supercritical methods was also compared. Pur formed by GAS was more orderly, purer crystal, whereas amorphous Pur particles between 0. 5 and 1 μm were formed by SEDS. The complex was successfully obtained by SEDS exhibiting amorphous, partially agglomerated spheres comprised of particles sized only about 1 μm. SEDS method may be useful for the processing of <b>other</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>preparations</b> besides phospholipids complex particles. Furthermore adopting a GAS process to recrystallize pharmaceuticals will provide a highly versatile methodology to generate new polymorphs of drugs in addition to conventional techniques.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{elaborate}} an efficient method for the micronization of the decapeptide cetrorelix (a GnRH-antagonist), in order to obtain a microsuspension as basis for <b>other</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>preparations,</b> such as e. g. inhalation aerosols. A modified pearl-mill coupled with a cryostat was used for the micronization of cetrorelix in fluid propellant and operated under different conditions. The obtained cetrorelix suspensions were analyzed for particle size distribution, purity of cetrorelix, and for metal contamination through abrasion from parts of the mill. The method allowed an effective micronization of cetrorelix. The mean particle size of the initial cetrorelix lyophilizate bulk ware was reduced from 52. 5 μ (Volume Mean Diameter, VMD) down to 14. 9, 6. 1 and 3. 1 μm, respectively, respectively. The HPLC analysis of all cetrorelix suspensions after micronization did not show signs of decomposition as compared to the initial product. The elementary analysis of the suspensions performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed a negligible amount of contaminants in the suspension (Zr=max. 0. 6 ppm; Fe, Cr, Ni, Ba, below limit of quantification, i. e. < 0. 14 ppm). The only appreciable contaminant. Aluminum (Al= 1. 1 ppm), was derived from the mechanical capping of aluminum canisters prior to analysis. The Zr determination in the suspension of 0. 6 ppm, is still considered to be negligible as compared to the legally tolerated limit of air contamination. By low-temperature micronization in fluid propellant, fine drug suspensions of cetrorelix for pMDIs can be directly manufactured in one-step procedure without destruction of the peptide structure and without appreciable product contamination...|$|E

Its fruit is used as purgative and its juice is taken as cathartic and antiseptic in typhus fever, diuretic and stomachic, for blood purification, as aphrodisiac and is also used in intestinal inflammation. The second species, Citrullus colocynthis (Colocynth vern. "tumma") is used as important medicine by the local physicians in their concoctions in the form of its leaves, roots, whole fruit, pulp, seeds and seed oil. It is used for the treatments' of various ailments as purgative, anathematic, antipyretic. and carminative. It cures tumours, ascites, leucoderma, ulcer, asthma, bronchitis, urinary discharges jaundice, enlarged spleen, constipation atrophy of the foetus, rheumatic pains, snake bites and scorpion stings. Keeping in view the vast medicinal properties of these two species, it is intended to study the chemistry of one of the major component known as lipid and lipid metabolism during the course of germination. The distribution of fatty acids in the triacylglycerol molecules of the two species were determined for their structure elucidation. The activity of lipase and phospholipase procured from the defatted seed meal were' also studied under various parameters. The lipids were classified qualitatively and quantitatively by thin layer and gas chromatographies. The neutral lipids identified were hydrocarbons, wax esters, triacylglycerols (the main constituent), free fatty acids, 1, 3 -diacylglycerols, 1, 2 -diacylglycerols, glycolipids, fatty alcohols, sterols, 2 -monoacylglycerols, and I-monoacylglycerols. The polar lipids found were monogalactosyldiacylglycerols, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylinositols.
