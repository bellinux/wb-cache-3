500|$|During May's Giro d'Italia, Sylvain Georges tested {{positive}} for the vasodilator heptaminol, after the seventh stage; his positive test was the second by a rider from the [...] squad {{in the space of a}} year, after Steve Houanard {{tested positive}} for the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in an <b>out-of-competition</b> <b>test</b> in September 2012. Since the team was a member of the Mouvement pour un cyclisme crédible union, a second positive test meant that, according to the union's regulations, they had to stop racing for eight days. The team voluntarily withdrew from the Dauphiné, avoiding a financial penalty which could have been incurred by the team for failing to compete in a World Tour event, against UCI regulations. As a result, the peloton was reduced to the following twenty-two teams.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2009 Tour, Doping {{controls}} {{were conducted by}} the UCI, with the French body AFLD shadowing the process. Officials targeted top riders like Lance Armstrong and Alberto Contador with an unprecedented amount of tests.

The news that Giro runner-up Danilo Di Luca had a positive A probe in the Giro did not change that. Five days after the race finished the UCI announced that the initial Stage 16 winner Mikel Astarloza tested positive for EPO in an <b>out-of-competition</b> <b>test</b> on 26 June, eight days before the race started. Later, Astarloza {{was removed from the}} results, and the stage win transferred to Sandy Casar.|$|E

However, the long battle to contest the decision brought an end to his running career as his physical fitness had heavily declined over the period.|$|R
