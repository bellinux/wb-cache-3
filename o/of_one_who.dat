5|$|A {{year later}} (1917) he met Kamila Stösslová, a young married woman 38 years his junior, {{who was to}} inspire him for the {{remaining}} years of his life. He conducted an obsessive and (on his side at least) passionate correspondence with her, of nearly 730 letters. From 1917 to 1919, deeply inspired by Stösslová, he composed The Diary <b>of</b> <b>One</b> <b>Who</b> Disappeared. As he completed its final revision, he began his next 'Kamila' work, the opera Káťa Kabanová.|$|E
5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E

Alderton got off the train at Manningtree at 18.15 before going on to Ipswich on another train, arriving at 18.43. Alderton's body was found on 10 December near Nacton, in woodland in front of Amberfield School.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Judeo-Christian view of Jacob, one main {{difference is that the}} story of Jacob's blessing, in which he deceives Isaac, is not accepted in Islam. The Qur'an makes it clear that Jacob was blessed by God as a prophet and, therefore, Muslims believe that his father, being a prophet as well, also knew of his son's greatness. Jacob is also cited in the Hadith as an example <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was patient and trusting in God in the face of suffering.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) was a poet, philosopher, {{literary}} critic, and theologian {{who was a}} {{major force}} behind the Romantic movement in England. No single person had meant more to Hazlitt's development as a writer than Coleridge, who {{changed the course of}} Hazlitt's life on their meeting in 1798. Afterwards at odds over politics, they became estranged, but Hazlitt continued to follow the intellectual development <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> answered more closely to his idea of a man of genius than anyone he had ever met, as he continued to chastise Coleridge and other former friends for their abandonment of the radical ideals they had once shared.|$|E
25|$|Winter {{then went}} to see Wurmbrand at Dominee Dana Minnaar's house, hoping to clear up misunderstandings and bring about reconciliation. Winter said that he sympathised with the plight of persecuted Christians in Romania, but that Romania was far away, and Christians in Namibia {{had to face the}} evils of apartheid, which were far more immediate. Wurmbrand said that this was being parochial; South Africa did not aim at world domination, but {{communism}} did, therefore Winter should concentrate his energies on fighting communism. As he was leaving, Winter knelt down in front of Wurmbrand and asked for his blessing. Wurmbrand refused at first, but Winter insisted, saying that he wanted the blessing <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> had suffered for his faith.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} ENO, Marks devoted himself to writing, {{broadcasting}} and travelling. In 2004 he scripted and directed a filmed version, with the tenor Ian Bostridge and the soprano Ruby Philogene, of Leoš Janáček's song cycle, The Diary <b>of</b> <b>One</b> <b>Who</b> Disappeared, {{and was a}} lead presenter of an entire day dedicated to Janáček on BBC Radio 3. In 2011 he published {{a book about the}} writer Joseph Roth. In a 2013 radio programme for BBC Radio 4, Little Moscow in Israel, Marks examined the effects of the immigration of Russian Jews to Israel. Although already seriously ill, Marks was in the audience for the new ENO production of Wagner's The Mastersingers shortly before his death.|$|E
25|$|In a very {{definite}} sense, {{we are all}} beneficiaries {{from the}} life of Fr. Kapaun. He has left us a stirring example of devotion to duty. He has passed on to us a spirit of tolerance and understanding. He has given us a share of dauntless bravery– of body and soul. He has transmitted to every one of us a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of our country's greatest enemy– godlessness, now stalking the world in the form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul– the spirit <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> loved and served God and man– even unto death.|$|E
25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.|$|E
