Another attempt a month later to form a union of white collar professionals was also quickly broken up by authorities and its founder Vladimir Svirsky arrested.|$|E

5|$|Both the Human {{fleet and}} the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, which {{occurred}} at least 2,000 {{years prior to}} the events of the episode. After research on the bodies found in the soil, the Cylons and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) conclude the remains are not Human, but Cylon in origin. The rebel Cylons further state the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs, but are of a kind unknown to them. Following this, they postulate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> of Cylon which existed over 2,000 years ago and moved out from Kobol to populate Earth. When addressing the fleet, Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) never states this fact, leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human. Meanwhile, Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) and Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) receive memories showing that they had lived and died on Earth 2,000 years ago. Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) has Leoben (Callum Keith Rennie) help track the origins of the beacon. However, what they find is a crashed Colonial Viper, containing a corpse with Starbuck's dog tags. After Kara recites what the Hybrid has told her, Leoben becomes scared and retreats, with Thrace wondering what she is. In shock, Thrace takes the body and burns it on a pyre, and decides to not tell anyone about what she found, making people believe she lost the signal.|$|E

The dermis of bony fish typically contains relatively little of the connective tissue found in tetrapods. Instead, in most species, it is largely replaced by solid, protective bony scales.

25|$|The ancient Mesopotamians {{regarded}} {{the sky as}} a series of domes (usually three, but sometimes seven) covering the flat earth.

The middle dome of heaven was made of saggilmut stone and was the abode of the Igigi. The highest and outermost dome of heaven was made of luludānītu stone and was personified as An, the god of the sky. The celestial bodies were equated with specific deities as well. The planet Venus was believed to be Inanna, the goddess of love, sex, and war. The sun was her brother Utu, the god of justice, and the moon was their father Nanna.|$|E
25|$|<b>Of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> is the {{approach}} made by James Lovelock. In the 1970s he and microbiologist Lynn Margulis presented the Gaia theory or hypothesis, that states that all organisms and their inorganic surroundings on Earth are {{integrated into a}} single self-regulating system. The system {{has the ability to}} react to perturbations or deviations, much like a living organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature (homeostasis). Nevertheless, this capacity has limits. For instance, when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range, it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments. Similarly the Earth {{may not be able to}} react to large deviations in critical parameters. In his book The Revenge of Gaia, he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity, compounded with the increase of greenhouse gases made by humans, is producing global warming.|$|E

500|$|The synod at Croft held by Wiglaf in 836, which Beorhtwulf {{may have}} attended, {{was the last}} such {{conclave}} called together by a Mercian king. [...] During Beorhtwulf's reign and thereafter, the kingdom of Wessex had more influence than Mercia with the Archbishop of Canterbury. [...] A charter of 840 provides evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>kind</b> concerning Beorhtwulf's relations with the church. [...] The charter concerns lands that had originally been granted by Offa to the monastery of Bredon in Worcestershire. [...] The lands had come {{under the control of}} the church in Worcester, but Beorhtwulf had seized the land again. [...] In the charter Beorhtwulf acknowledges the church's right to the land, but forces a handsome gift from the bishop in return: [...] "four very choice horses and a ring of 30 mancuses and a skilfully wrought dish of three pounds, and two silver horns of four pounds ..... two good horses and two goblets of two pounds and one gilded cup of two pounds." [...] This is not an isolated case; there are other charters that show Mercian kings of the time disputing property with the church, such as a charter of 849 in which Beorhtwulf received a lease on land from the bishop of Worcester, and promised in return that he would be [...] "more firmly the friend of the bishop and his community" [...] and, in the words of historian Patrick Wormald, [...] "would not rob them in future". [...] Wormald suggests that this ruthless behaviour may be explained by the fact that landed estates were becoming harder to find, as so much land had been granted to monasteries. [...] The problem had been mentioned over a century before by Bede, who in a letter to Egbert, the Archbishop of York, had complained of [...] "a complete lack of places where the sons of nobles and of veteran thegns can receive an estate". [...] Beorhtwulf's concession of wrongdoing suggests that he could not rely on his nobles to support him in such a disagreement, and may indicate that his hold on the throne was insecure.|$|E
