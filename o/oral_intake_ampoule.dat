40|$|Background: Patients {{approaching}} death {{often have}} a decreasing <b>oral</b> <b>intake,</b> which can be distressing for relatives. Little {{is known about the}} relatives' experiences with and perceptions of <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> at the end of life. Aim:This study aims to contribute to a more thorough understanding of relatives' concerns regarding decreased <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> of the patient at the end of life. Design: Qualitative interview study: semi-structured interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Setting/participants:Twenty-three bereaved relatives of patients who had been referred to a New Zealand palliative care service were interviewed. Results: All relatives experienced significant changes in patients' <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> at the end of life. <b>Oral</b> <b>intake</b> towards the end of life was considered important and is perceived as meaningful by relatives in different ways, such as nutritional value, enjoyment, social time, daily routine and a way of caring. Relatives responded differently to decreasing oral intake; some accepted it as inherent to the dying process, others continued efforts to support the patient's <b>oral</b> <b>intake.</b> Some relatives perceived decreasing <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> as the patient's choice, and some viewed maintaining <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> as part of the battle against the disease. Relatives recalled limited communication with health-care professionals concerning <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> at the end of life. Conclusions:This study revealed the complexity of meaning relatives' experiences with dying patients' decreasing <b>oral</b> <b>intake.</b> Their perceptions and concerns were related to their awareness of the imminent death. These findings can guide staff involved in care delivery to better support relatives. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Timing of <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> after total {{laryngectomy}} (TLE) is mostly delayed until postoperative day 10 - 12, {{under the assumption}} that this limits the incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistulization (PCF). However, early <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> could be advantageous and could reduce costs, providing that it does not lead to increased PCF. Comparison of PCF incidence in traditional ‘late’ <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> protocol (start at postoperative day 10 - 12; LOI) and in early <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> protocol (start at postoperative day 2 - 4; EOI). Retrospective cohort study comparing two different <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> protocols in 247 consecutive patients laryngectomized between early 2000 until mid 2006 (LOI; N = 140), and mid 2006 until mid 2012 (EOI; N = 107). Both groups were comparable in terms of sex, age, origin of tumor, and TLE indication, except for the American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA), which was slightly more favorable in the LOI group (p = 0. 047). Compliance with the <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> protocols during both periods was good: the median day of starting <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> was day 11 (range 6 - 103) in the LOI group vs. day 3 (range 2 - 84) in the EOI group (p = 0. 001). The incidence of PCF was not significantly different between the two groups (25 % for LOI and 32 % for EOI; Fisher’s exact: p = 0. 255). In addition, no association was observed between the timing of <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> and PCF (HR = 0. 995; CI 0. 98 - 1. 01; p = 0. 364). This study suggests that early <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> is safe and does not increase pharyngocutaneous fistulization...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Immediate {{start of}} <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> is {{beneficial}} following colorectal surgery. However, following esophagectomy {{the safety and}} feasibility of immediate <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> is unclear, thus these patients are still kept nil by mouth. This study therefore aimed to determine the feasibility and safety of oral nutrition immediately after esophagectomy. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective trial was conducted in 3 referral centers between August 2013 and May 2014, including 50 patients undergoing a minimally invasive esophagectomy. Oral nutrition was started postoperatively immediately (clear liquids on postoperative day [POD] 0, liquid nutrition on POD 1 to 6, solid food from POD 7). Nonoral enteral nutrition was started when < 50 % of caloric need was met on postoperative day POD 5 or when <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> was impossible. A comparison was made with a retrospective cohort (n = 50) with a per-protocol delayed start of <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> until POD 4 to 7. RESULTS: The median caloric intake at POD 5 was 58 % of required. In 38 % of the patients nonoral nutrition was started, mainly due to complications (36 %). The pneumonia rate was 28 % following immediate <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> and 40 % following delayed <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> (p = 0. 202). The aspiration pneumonia rate was 4 % in both groups. The anastomotic leakage rate was 14 % after immediate <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> versus 24 % following delayed <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> (p = 0. 202). The 90 -day mortality rate was 2 % in both groups. Hospital stay and intensive care unit stay were significantly shorter following immediate <b>oral</b> <b>intake.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Immediate start of oral nutrition following esophagectomy seems to be feasible and does not increase complications compared to a retrospective cohort and literature. However, if complications arise an alternative nutritional route is required. This explorative study shows that a randomized controlled trial is needed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Complications of adenotonsillectomy such as pain, {{nausea and}} vomiting, fever, {{inadequate}} <b>oral</b> <b>intake,</b> dehydration and bleeding are common and important. In addition of unpleasant feeling for patient, post operative nausea and vomiting {{will lead to}} more prolonged hospitalization and intravenous hydration. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a single dose of dexamethasone (0. 5 mg/kg) administered before surgery could decrease postoperative vomiting and improves <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> in the first 24 -hours after adenotonsillectomy procedures. Materials & Methods: In this double-blinded, placebo controlled study, 100 patients age 5 - 15 years, with ASA physical status I and II were enrolled and they were randomly allocated to receive either dexamethasone (n= 50) 0. 5 mg/kg IV (maximum dose 8 mg) or an equivalent volume of saline (n= 50) preoperatively. The anesthetic regimen and surgical procedures were standardized for all patients. The incidence of early and late vomiting, the first time <b>oral</b> <b>intake,</b> <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> adequacy, and duration of IV hydration were compared in both groups. Results: Data from 100 patients were analyzed. The overall incidence of early as well as late vomiting was significantly less in dexamethasone as compared to control group (P= 0. 001). The time to first <b>oral</b> <b>intake,</b> <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> adequacy, and duration of IV hydration showed significant difference in both groups (P= 0. 01). Conclusion: A single dose of dexamethasone was not associated with adverse effects. Dexamethasone significantly decreased the incidence of postoperative vomiting during the first 24 hour, shortened the time to the first <b>oral</b> <b>intake,</b> <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> adequacy, and duration of IV hydration...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{clinical}} characteristics of an adult chemical ingestion population and examine the course of return to <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> post injury and speech-language pathologist (SLP) involvement during the initial acute-care admission. A retrospective chart review of adults admitted to a quaternary hospital {{for the treatment of}} an acute chemical ingestion injury between 2008 and 2012 was conducted. Forty-four adults (23 men, 21 women) were identified as receiving treatment for ingestion injury, of whom 18 (40. 91 %) required altered <b>oral</b> <b>intake.</b> Of those requiring altered <b>oral</b> <b>intake,</b> 50 % were referred to SLPs.

40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} a beneficial effect of early enteral nutrition (EN) on anastomotic leakage following colorectal surgery. Early <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> is a common form of early EN with various clinical benefits, but the effect on anastomotic leakage is unclear. This systematic review investigates the effect of early vs late start of <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> on anastomotic leakage following lower intestinal surgery. A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases. Randomized controlled trials were included that compared early (within 24 hours) vs late start of <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> following elective surgery of the small bowel, colon, or rectum. Meta-analysis was performed for anastomotic leakage, overall complications, length of stay, and mortality. Sensitivity analysis was performed in which studies of inferior methodological quality were excluded. Nine studies including 879 patients met eligibility criteria. Early start of <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> significantly reduced overall complications (odds ratio [OR], 0. 65; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 46 - 0. 93; P =. 02), length of stay (mean difference, - 0. 89; 95 % CI, - 1. 22 to - 0. 57; P <. 001), and anastomotic leakage (OR, 0. 40; 95 % CI, 0. 17 - 0. 95; P =. 04) compared with late start of <b>oral</b> <b>intake.</b> However, in the sensitivity analysis only the overall reduction of length of stay remained significant.

40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>intake</b> of {{ascorbic acid}} is {{essential}} for optimum health in human beings. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients have an increased need for ascorbic acid, because of increased loss through dialysate, reduced intake owing to nausea and loss of appetite, and increased oxidative stress. However, optimum intake is still controversial. We studied 50 clinically stable patients to determine the relationship between <b>oral</b> ascorbic acid <b>intake</b> and serum ascorbic acid (SAA) level. Total <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> ranged from 28 mg daily to 412 mg daily. Only one patient had an <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> of ascorbic acid below 60 mg per day. The SAA levels ranged from 1 mg/L to 36. 17 mg/L. Although a strong correlation existed between intake and SAA (p < 0. 001, R 2 = 0. 47), the variation in SAA at any given intake level was wide. Of the studied patients, 62 % had an SAA < 8. 7 mg/L, 40 % had an SAA < 5. 1 mg/L (below the level in a healthy population), and 12 % had a level below 2 mg/L (scorbutic). None of the patients demonstrated clinical manifestations of scurvy. Our results show that, in CAPD patients, ascorbic acid deficiency can be reliably detected only with SAA measurements, and <b>oral</b> <b>intake</b> may influence SAA level.
