The alcohols employed were n-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, and n-heptanol. The oils ranged from n-hexane (C 6) to n-hexadecane (C• 6). It was observed that an increase in chain length of alcohols affected the solubility adversely. Changes in surfactant concentration, <b>oil</b> chain <b>length,</b> or water-to-oil ratios in the microemulsions {{did not have any}} significant effect on the solubility of the steroid. The solubilization capacity of the microemulsions was comparable to that of pure alcohols.

A sharp variation of viscosity is only observed for alkyd resins having more than 40 % (w/w) of karawila seed oil.

Significant variation in transesterification time was also observed for 30 % (w/w). However, further increase in karawila seed oil above 40 % (w/w) had only a marginal effect on the polyesterification reaction. The drying properties of the alkyd resins had been significantly improved with the increase of karawila seed oil up to 30 % (w/w) but further increase in karawila seed oil resulted in poor drying characteristics. The film properties (drying time, hardness, adhesion, chemical resistance and gloss) of the alkyd resins were determined.

40|$|The {{formation}} of molecular networks {{related to the}} consumption of unsaturated carbon–carbon double bonds (CC) during oxidative drying of alkyd coating films incorporating unsaturated fatty acids was studied. The concentration of CC bonds was measured {{as a function of}} drying time and distance from the exposed film surface (depth) using confocal Raman microspectroscopy (CRM). The change in spatial distribution of the CC double bond concentration across the film cross section provides information on the kinetics of the oxidative cross-linking process in the alkyd films. It was found that the CC bond consumption is not homogeneous across the depth of the drying film. The results obtained allowed us to quantitatively monitor the progress of the drying process and the movement of the ‘drying front’ within the coating films. The drying profiles suggest that oxygen penetration into the coating film is a rate-limiting factor in the drying process. Depth profiles during the film forming process develop due to local variations in the oxygen solubility, diffusion coefficient of oxygen, and available amount of double bonds for cross-linking.

40|$|This {{research}} project mainly focused on developing air drying alkyds with 65 % <b>oil</b> <b>length</b> which offer superior film properties using locally available a suitable fatty oil and also developing {{a mathematical model}} to predict the gel point acid value in manufacturing alkyd resins. Analysis of seed oil of 'Karawila' MC 43 indicated {{that it was a}} fatty oil rich in conjugated trienoic acids with moderate amount of saturated fatty acids. The oil content of seed of MC 43 was about 24 % and the weights of dried seeds were in the range 2. 98 - 7. 93 g with weight ratio of kernel to seed in dry basis of about 0. 6. Acid value of the oil was 2. 73 mg g", saponification value was 190. 70 mg g-l and iodine value was 115. 96 cg g". The seed oil of MC 43 showed better drying properties compared to common drying oils. A simple mathematical model was developed to predict the iodine value of fatty oils based on the total number of pi-bonds in the fatty acid profile (π) as Iodine value equals 0. 8683 x π Since the acid value of seed oil of MC 43 was comparatively low, monoglyceride process was selected in manufacturing alkyd resins. The optimum heating rate, mixing speed and the volume ratio were first established for the laboratory reactor used in the experiment. Better film properties could be obtained when a mixture of glycerol and pentaerythritol was used as polyols with excess OH. Film properties were compared by gradually increasing the pentaerythritol content while keeping <b>oil</b> <b>length</b> at 65 % until the industrial specifications for film properties were obtained. Excellent film properties were obtained when the minimum ratio of pentaerythritol/glycerol was 0. 33 and the OHICOOH ratio was in the range of 1. 23 to 1. 4. Satisfactory film properties were obtained when OHICOOH ratio was in between 1. 23 to 1. 48 with pentaerythritol / glycerol ratio within 0. 23 to 0. 33. When pentaerythritol / glycerol ratio was lower than 0. 2, hardness was not acceptable. The results of kinetic studies on polyesterification of monoglyceride mixture based on seed oil ofMC 43 with pthalic anhydride suggested that the way of assigning order to the reaction based on correlation coefficient was unsatisfactory. This was mainly due to the simultaneous occurrence of several reaction mechanisms associated with steric hindrance of reacting molecules. A new mathematical model was developed to predict the acid value at gel point based on the statistical approach of proposing the growth pattern of alkyd molecules during the polyesterification reaction. Proposed model was compared with the existing models using the actual data recorded in literature. The predicted acid values from the proposed model gave minimum deviation from actual data compared to existing models. However, the predicted acid values of alkyd resins based on MC 43 seed oil deviated significantly from the experimental data due to the presence of conjugated trienoic acids in the fatty oil of MC 43. Hence, a modification was introduced to incorporate the effects of dimerization reactions and the predicted results were then closely agreed with the actual dat...|$|E

(2009, 2010) have examined relative permeability of liquid–liquid (namely, oil–water) two-phase flow in smooth- and rough-walled fractures {{as well as}} flow regimes and flow structures. Pan et al. (1996) found that the flow patterns in the fracture vary with variation in oil and water flow rates. Also, the discontinuous phase can still flow in smooth-walled fracture unlike {{the case with the}} granular porous media. More significant phase interference was observed when the fluids flowing in the fracture are segregated (not mixed). Finally, the single-phase homogenous model fitted their experimental data reasonably well. Pan (1999) observed four major flow structures in the smooth-walled fractures: channel, dispersed, mixed flow, stratified flow structures. However, with the rough-walled model with smaller fracture aperture (0.26  mm), only dispersed flow was observed. He found that relative permeability to oil is a function of oil saturation, viscosity ratio, and flow pattern, whereas, relative permeability to water is a strong function of water saturation. The effects of surface roughness on relative permeability to oil and water were more pronounced for smaller fracture aperture and at higher pressure gradient, i.e., the relative permeabilities and flow patterns observed in the rough-walled fracture with larger aperture were similar to the ones observed with the smooth-walled fracture. Shad (2009) found that when the non-wetting phase (water) flows in the form of discontinuous drops, its velocity depends on the conveying phase velocity (<b>oil),</b> <b>length</b> of the drop, viscosity ratio, capillary number, and the fracture aperture. Due to lubrication effects, he obtained relative permeability data that was often greater than unity and none of the X-Curve, Corey, or the VCMs were able to fit and/or predict the flow behavior. However, Shad and Gates (2010) were able to provide a reasonable analytical model, which somewhat overestimated the relative permeability to oil and underestimated the relative permeability to water.|$|E

I have worked with microemulsions at fixed surfactant to oil volume ratio of 0. 815 : 1 and with balanced (bicontinuous) microemulsions. The microemulsions were studied at the temperature of emulsification boundary TEFB and their expected behavior there was as hard spheres. Careful investigation shows {{that there is a}} previously unknown growth with droplet concentration at TEFB. This growth is bigger the longer the oil chain. The growth is to elongated aggregates with axial ratios of up to 2 for long oil chains and volume ratios of 0. 4 at TEFB. When increasing the temperature from TEFB the aggregates become bigger and more elongated similarly to a prolate with axial ratios 2 - 4 before the microemulsion becomes bicontinuous. The longer the oil is, the lower the axial ratios are at which the change into bicontinuous structure occurs. The temperature increase needed for the change to bicontinuous is also smaller the longer the oils are. The growth of the aggregates shows a monomodal distribution and not a bimodal as was previously suggested. This was shown with contrast variation SANS experiments. There was no growth of the intensity at the match point with temperature as would be expected with bimodal distribution. The main techniques used in the thesis are 2 H-NMR relaxation, NMR self-diffusion, Static and Dynamic Light Scattering, Small Angle X-Ray Scattering of solution samples and Small Angle Neutron Scattering both with contrast variation and with the droplets matched.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Chemical and Process Engineering for the MSc in Polymer TechnologyThis research is based on synthesizing an air drying long oil alkyd resin using a blend of semi drying soya bean (Glycine max -Pb I) oil and fast drying karawila (Momodica charantia -MC 43) seed oil. The alkyd resin was synthesized {{with the aim of}} obtaining a varnish without standing film properties, especially drying characteristics enhance by significant amount of a-eleostetic acid (ctt, 9, 11, 13 - 18 : 3), where is having conjugated double bonds, presence in karawila seed oil. A series of alkyd resins were prepared maintaining 65 % <b>oil</b> <b>length</b> by changing the ratio of karawila seed oil from 0 - 50 % (by w/w%). The other constituents of alkyd resins werepentaerythritol, phthalic anhydride, xylene and sodium methoxide as catalyst. Due to the lowacid values of the seed oils monoglyceride process was selected and obtained accept able standard for transesterification and polye sterification reactions and 240 °C temperature was maintained at transesteritication and esterification stages. Patton constant and the ratio of OH:COOH groups were maintained closer to 1. 00 when preparing alkyd resins. In addition, the alkydresins were prepared by maintaining final acici. value below 20 mg/g to make sure the extent of polymerization was in the range of 90 % to 95 %. Physicochemical properties of these alkydresin solutions were examined to see the effect with the increase of karawila seed oil in the resin. The solid content was adjusted to 50 % and cobalt octate with lead octate were used as driers to prepare varnish from these alkyd resins. The film properties of the alkyd resins were examined to find the optimum ratio of karawila oil to soya bean oil. Mechanical properties, chemical resistant properties and drying properties of these films were examined and evaluated in this regardThe alkyd resin blended with 30 % karawila seed oil showed the best film properties in the oil blended series and it also render lower set to touch drying time and dry to touch drying time, better scratch hardness, adhesion and better gloss. In addition, better resistance to water, acid, solvent and corrosion was observed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel method for the rapid identification of complex organic materials, including macromolecules, that involves a high temperature simultaneous hydrolysis and derivatisation reaction. In this procedure, aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxides are made to react {{with a wide range of}} complex molecular species, including synthetic and natural polymers, under high temperature flash heating conditions. The hydrolysis products are converted to derivatives, such as alkyl esters or alkyl ethers. The reaction forms the basis for a modified pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC) identification technique. Although the process is primarily intended for the rapid identification of polymers which are susceptible to hydrolysis, it is also valuable for characterisation of a variety of hydrolysable lower molecular weight species, such as polymer additives, triglycerides and natural waxes. The reaction takes place when an intimate mixture of an aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxide solution is flash heated with the analyte in a conventional pyrolysis unit, and "on-line" GC-MS is used to separate and identify the reaction products. Analytes included synthetic polyester resins and phenolic polymers, natural products such as lipids and wood extractives, and natural polymers including lignocellulose, proteins and kerogen. Reaction variables, such as temperature, pH analyte particle size, substrate, and the derivatising reagent were studied, in order to find the optimum conditions for the reaction. While the reaction occurs at temperatures as low as 358 degrees celsius, a 770 degrees celsius reaction temperature was adopted to allow direct comparison with Py-GC data. A high pH of the derivatising reagent was found to be necessary to achieve an efficient hydrolysis of the macromolecule. Small particle size gives better conversion to derivatised ++products. The nature of the heating substrate did not appear to influence the reaction. Tetraalkylammonium hydroxides (TAAH) were found to be the most effective derivatising reagents for the reaction. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was the most useful derivatising reagent, since the methyl derivatives of the hydrolysed products were conveniently chromatographed and usually had well known mass spectra. Other TA-AHs were useful for (i) producing higher molecular weight alkyl derivatives of low molecular weight side chains in some polymers, e. g., acetate groups in polyvinyl acetate, (ii) the purpose of determining sites of pre-existing methylation in natural products such as lignocellulose, or (iii) cases where methylation products could be confused with existing pyrolysis products. The reaction mechanism is believed to involve hydrolysis of the organic material, formation of the tetra-alkylammonium salt, and thermal degradation of the quaternary ammonium salt to alkylated derivatives. Some evidence is presented to support this mechanism, which is considered to be ionic in character, rather than a free radical reaction. A detailed study of the reaction of alkyd resins indicated that polyhydric alcohols, polybasic acids, degree of cure, <b>oil</b> <b>length,</b> and rosin acid and epoxy modification could be determined. The reaction of rosin modified phenolic resins (tert-butyl phenol formaldehyde and para-nonyl phenol formaldehyde), gave rosin acid methyl esters and easily identifiable products from the synthetic components. Fatty acid methyl esters could be obtained directly from lipids, such as vegetable oils, without time consuming preparative steps. The problems of base catalysed isomerisation of the double bonds in polyunsaturated fatty acids were overcome by reducing the amount of base used for the reaction. The reaction facilitated the identification of fatty acids in ++woolwax, the triglycerides in cosmetic products, and lipids in trace quantities of human fingerprint deposits. A more reliable representation of the chemical structure of lignocellulose in softwood and hardwood species was obtained by the reaction, as compared to conventional PyGC which underestimates the aromatic carboxylic acid moieties. Gymnosperm or angiosperm origin was indicated by the presence of solely guaiacyl, or both guaiacyl and syringyl derived groups, respectively. Other extraneous extractable material was identified simultaneously, including aliphatic and aromatic acids, which would not normally be detected by conventional Py-GC. An alternative method involved extracting the wood with TMAH, followed by pyrolysis of the extract, to give less complex but more specific GC profiles. The TMAH extraction procedure also indicated some characteristic biomarker species as well as guaiacyl and syringyl derived compounds. The pyrolysis of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAH) extracts revealed the sites of pre-existing methylation in the Eucalyptus marginata species. The thermally assisted hydrolysis and alkylation method which has been developed is usually superior to the conventional Py-GC procedure for those polymers which are prone to hydrolysis, since it results in products which are more readily related to the polymer structure. For example, concerted hydrolysis and alkylation of polyester resins results in alkyl carboxylate esters and the alkyl ethers, whereas in conventional Py-GC the products are alkenes and carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids are more difficult to chromatograph by GC, and aromatic carboxylic acids in particular are susceptible to decarboxylation under the pyrolysis conditions. The reaction procedure has provided an alternative approach to the characterisation of submicrogram quantities of a range of synthetic polymers, natural products and ++natural polymers, which has not previously been possible without lengthy chemical degradation procedures. Although it has not displaced the conventional Py-GC technique, it has given a new dimension to the characterisation of organic materials, providing a powerful tool for forensic science investigations and the analysis of complex materials...|$|E
