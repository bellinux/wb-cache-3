40|$|Successful social {{coordination}} {{usually requires}} {{one person to}} be able to judge the limits and abilities of another person. Two experiments investigating perception of the maximum height to which an actor could jump and reach were conducted. In both experiments those estimates were compared to estimates of the perceiver’s own maximum jump-with-reach height. Results of Experiment 1 showed that perceptions for the self improved over time, in the absence of explicit feedback, but perceptions for the <b>other</b> <b>actor</b> remained constant. Experiment 2 demonstrated that providing perceivers with perceptual information about the <b>other</b> <b>actor’s</b> action capabilities enabled perceivers to recalibrate their perceptual reports for the <b>other</b> <b>actor’s</b> maximum jump-with-reach height...|$|R
