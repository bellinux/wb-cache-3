40|$|Quantitative structure-activity {{relationships}} (QSARs) {{are analyzed}} for evaluating phenylurea compounds side effects on mammals. Available QSARs derived from substructures or solely partition properties significantly underestimate their toxicity (<b>oral</b> <b>rat</b> LD sub 50). Predictive QSARs are presented using partitioning and electronic descriptors from quantum mechanical calculations. The combination of log Pow and the ionization potential results in satisfactory estimates of phenylurea rat LD sub 50 values for hazard assessment purposes. None of the phenylureas was significantly underestimated in toxicity. Using log Pow and hardness, a model was derived very {{well suited for}} screening of experimental data in order to recognize outliers, for which either spurious test results or a different mode of action have to be assumed...|$|E

40|$|A common {{challenge}} for human risk assessment {{is the quality}} of the available animal studies. Non-guideline studies are often limited for different aspects of study design and documentation. Within this publication the relevance of a limited scope of examination is discussed. Preliminary analyses of the RepDose database have shown that liver, body weight, kidney and clinical symptoms are frequently affected in oral repeated dose toxicity in rats and mice (Bitsch et al., 2006), while many other targets are seldom affected. As most of these targets are investigated frequently also in non-guideline studies, it is likely that they provide a reliable NOEL, although the full spectrum of endpoints has not been covered. Based on RepDose data we investigate the relevance of individual targets for determining the LOEL and the consequences for risk assessment. The resulting coverage model for subchronic <b>oral</b> <b>rat</b> studies includes up to six targets and an additional assessment factor for LOEL extrapolation. It can be applied to assess the reliability of non-guideline studies with respect to the scope of examination. Furthermore the application of the coverage model to other databases will increase and/or specify the chemical domain and reveal respective targets as well as effects...|$|E
40|$|Salirasib (Concordia Pharmaceuticals) is an <b>oral</b> <b>rat</b> sarcoma (RAS) {{inhibitor}} {{that causes}} dislocation of RAS by competing directly with farnesylated RAS in binding to its membrane-anchoring proteins. A phase I {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Salirasib in patients with advanced leukemia. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and Grade 1 / 2 diarrhea was the only frequent nonhematologic toxicity seen. The safety profile of Salirasib and its relevant target makes it ideal to be used in combination therapy. Background: Rat sarcoma (RAS) /rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) /mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (mutational or nonmutational) is a key pathway for survival and proliferative advantage of leukemic cells. Salirasib (Concordia Pharmaceuticals) is an oral RAS inhibitor that causes dislocation of RAS by competing directly with farne-sylated RAS in binding to its putative membrane-binding proteins. Salirasib does not inhibit farnesyl transferase enzyme. Patients and Methods: We report on a phase I study of Salirasib in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Salirasib was administered orally twice daily on days 1 to 21 of a 28 -day cycle in a “ 3 þ 3 ” dose escalation design. Results: Seventeen patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia were treated for a median of 4 cycles (range...|$|E
