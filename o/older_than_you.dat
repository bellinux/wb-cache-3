25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in the House. I admire his ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.|$|E
60|$|CROFTS [aggressively] I'm no <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> if {{you come}} to that.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He was <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> my lady lass,' {{pursued the}} Captain, 'but you was like two {{children}} together, at first; wam't you?' ...|$|E
60|$|B. B. [rising in incredulous amazement] Your father! But, Lord bless my soul, Paddy, {{your father}} {{must have been}} an <b>older</b> man <b>than</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Josey dear, you {{did what}} many <b>older</b> persons <b>than</b> <b>you</b> have done, and what God's Book tells us the wicked do,--fled when no man was pursuing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An <b>older</b> hand <b>than</b> <b>you</b> {{might have}} been taken in. They {{probably}} {{got a glimpse of}} your telegram, and were thus able to deceive you, so don't feel badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|So in came Tommy Lamb, a little, curly-headed fellow, not any <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> [...] "What {{is it you}} want, Tommy?" [...] {{said the}} dame.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} thinking, Davy,' replied the sexton, 'that she,' {{he pointed to}} the grave, 'must have been a deal <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> or me.' ...|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. You mustnt rush to {{conclusions}} about the Archbishop, Mrs Lutestring. He is an older bird than you think. <b>Older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> at all events.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tired and miserable, poor heart. Years {{and years}} <b>older</b> <b>than</b> when <b>you</b> saw her last. Quite a staid, worn woman now. 'Tis the man--she can't stomach un, even now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are you {{quite sure}} of that, nurse?' said Miss Dacre; 'I {{think this is}} an <b>older</b> friend <b>than</b> <b>you</b> imagine. You {{remember}} the little Duke; do not you? This is the little Duke. Do you think he has grown?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was in 1801, when James Boyd was {{building}} ships for Kamehameha at Hilo," [...] Pool cast {{back through the}} calendar; [...] "which makes you seventy-nine, or eight years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> I. <b>You</b> are very old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Noel is <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> think, Edward; she is {{more than}} her age. And real married life wouldn't begin for them till after--if it ever began." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bowen smiled infinitesimally. But after {{a moment}} she said gravely, [...] "Mr. Colville is very much <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> He's old enough to be your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why, father, I don’t {{think you}} look a year <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> did when I last saw you. Both you and mother look good for another ten years yet.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, my friend," [...] {{said the}} General {{regarding}} him with some amusement, [...] "I am an <b>older</b> man <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> yet I hardly think I could have ridden out {{with such a}} goddess without becoming her slave." ...|$|R
6000|$|Violet Wayne {{shook her}} head. “That was pretty, {{but not quite}} sincere,” she said. “In some respects I am <b>older</b> <b>than</b> you—and <b>you</b> are in trouble, dear. Perhaps if you told me {{everything}} I could help you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} sharply, [...] "it comes from Cencho--one {{of your own}} peons--who is more true to you and the <b>old</b> Rancho <b>than</b> <b>YOU</b> have ever been. He saw what was going on, and came to me, to warn you!" ...|$|R
60|$|MARTHA--No, I don't. Honest, {{cross my}} heart, I wouldn't even conceal that from you, if I did. But gray hairs prove nothing. I am {{actually}} <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> don't forget.|$|E
6000|$|... "My mother!" [...] {{cried out}} Arthur, {{jumping up and}} sober in a minute. [...] "Pooh! damn it, Smirke, you must be mad--she's {{seven or eight years}} <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does mean}} something. It means a great deal. As {{for being a}} boy, I am <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are, and have quite as much right to know my own mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You look <b>older</b> today <b>than</b> <b>you</b> did yesterday," [...] {{the latter}} said, {{as he held}} his hand and gazed into Dick's face. [...] "I fancy that neither of us has had any sleep to speak of. As for myself, I have not closed an eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Robarts, look here. I am {{speaking}} now, perhaps, {{with more}} of the energy of an <b>old</b> friend <b>than</b> circumstances fully warrant; but I am an <b>older</b> man <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> and as I have a regard for you I do not like to see you throw up a good game when it is in your hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{keep track}} of the years," [...] said Miss Cuttenclip, laughing. [...] "You see, I don't grow up at all, but stay just the same as I was when first I came here. Perhaps I'm <b>older</b> even <b>than</b> <b>you</b> are, madam; but I couldn't say for sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|He said, [...] "I am <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> Ogier; [...] Not {{all things}} would I rend, [...] For whether life be bad or good [...] It {{is best to}} abide the end." ...|$|E
60|$|CROFTS. I'm a {{good deal}} <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> Twenty-five years: quarter of a century. I shan't live for ever; and I'll take care that you shall be well off when I'm gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "H--m. I'm <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> Lord Lovel. You see, she had {{nobody else}} near her. A girl must cotton to somebody, {{and who was}} there? We {{ought not to be}} angry with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{one of the}} {{children}} is <b>older</b> <b>than</b> yourself, <b>you</b> needn't talk so like a grandma. I flatter myself I'm a 'gentleman growed' as Peggotty said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a precocious infant," [...] said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.|$|R
50|$|If someone feels hurt {{because of}} you, {{apologize}} {{irrespective of the}} fact that he is <b>older</b> or younger <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> because greatness lies in submission and humiliation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} are satisfied," [...] he said grimly. He then paused, and in a changed and more hesitating voice added: [...] "I am an <b>older</b> soldier <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> sir, but I am always glad to make the {{acquaintance}} of West Point." [...] He paused {{and held out his}} hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "P'raps not by you; but I know of some, no <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> who'd have {{it before}} morning. Of course, I don't blame a boy for not tryin' when he hasn't the nerve----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Flora {{shook her}} head. [...] "The dusk is kind. Any way, I know I am years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you.</b> There are no little girls {{in this country}} like the ones you have been {{accustomed}} to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I do. I am <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>you,</b> {{and know}} more {{of men and}} their ways than you can do. I do suspect him. You must promise me that you will search for this deed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Time of life! He's {{but three}} years <b>older</b> <b>than</b> Edmund. If <b>you</b> are not more respectful, {{we shall have}} to go out to Canada to countenance him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To that {{marriage}} my noble client, the Baroness, is most averse--having other views for you, and thinking {{it will be}} your ruin to marry a party,--of noble birth and title it is true; but, excuse me, not of first-rate character, and so much <b>older</b> <b>than</b> yourself. <b>You</b> had given an imprudent promise to that party." ...|$|R
6000|$|That is {{work which}} I am rueing-- [...] Do as Charles and I are doing! [...] Strawberry-blossoms, one and all, [...] We must spare them--here are many: [...] Look at it--the Flower is small, [...] Small and low, though fair as any: [...] Do not touch it! summers two [...] I am <b>older,</b> Anne, <b>than</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
