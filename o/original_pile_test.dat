There are problems associated with interpreting the test results in clay soils due to the non linear variation in shear resistance with rate of shearing. An investigation has been conducted for two clay soils which were used in an associated research project. These were a reconstituted kaolin clay (KSS) used for model <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> and undisturbed glacial clay taken from a full scale prototype <b>pile</b> <b>testing</b> site near Grimsby. Monotonic and multistage strain controlled triaxial tests were carried out on both clays using a, pneumatic computer, controlled rapid load triaxial system at rates from 0. 001 mm/s to 200 mm/s. The shear strength increased and the excess pore pressure decreased as the rate of shearing increased. A power law was proposed relating dynamic and static shear strength. The damping coefficients and hence the rate effects, defined as a function of strain, were similar for both clays Based on the triaxial test results and a back analysis of Statnamic and "static" constant rate of penetration data from the associated model and full scale <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> in both clays, a non-linear model has been proposed relating the static resistance of a pile to the measured Statnamic load taking into account the rate effects and the inertia of the pile.

40|$|Five <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been}} performed, {{at the west}} coast of Mexico, in order to {{evaluate}} their pile bearing capacity. The Kentledge system (a <b>test</b> <b>pile</b> loaded in between two tension piles) has been used to execute the <b>pile</b> <b>tests.</b> The soil stratigraphy has been surveyed with standard penetration tests, cone penetration tests and borings, and consists of a ten to twelve meter soft clayey soil on top of a hard clay layer. Three identical <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed on bored piles with a pile diameter of 0. 6 m and a pile length of 30 m. In addition, two identical <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed on driven piles with a squared cross section of 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m and a pile length of about 21 m. The aims of these tests were, first to evaluate the pile bearing capacity for both the bored and the driven pile types, in order to decide which pile type will be used finally, for the foundation of a factory; and second, to study the influence of the pile installation process on the pile bearing capacity of both pile types. During the testing of the bored piles, load measurements in different sections of the pile suggested that almost all bearing capacity came from the pile section in the upper soft clay layer. Since it is impossible to have such a relative large friction along the pile shaft in the soft soil, and because far more concrete was used for making the pile than expected, it had to be concluded that the liquid concrete has widened the pile diameter just above the hard soil layer, leading to a bulking effect in the pile. Therefore, the pile was leaning on this hard soil layer. For the driven <b>test</b> <b>piles,</b> the measurements showed a normal behaviour of both the pile shaft friction and the pile tip bearing capacity...|$|R

40|$|The largest {{part of an}} ice ridge {{consists}} of unconsolidated ice rubble, whose material properties decide the load from ridges on ships and structures. Material resistance is attributed to the initial freeze-bonds and the friction and interlocking between blocks. The objective of the thesis was to investigate rubble behaviour by two tests: shear box test at NTNU and <b>pile</b> <b>test</b> at HSVA. The shear box test was aimed at investigating freeze-bond mechanisms in rubble. The <b>pile</b> <b>test</b> was aimed at suggesting values for rubble properties for a model scale experiment. The shear box had dimensions 600 mm x 400 mm x 40 mm, and was filled with ice blocks of 60 mm x 22 mm x 40 mm simulating rubble. Confinement was added, the box was submerged for 10 minutes, and tested in a rig by forcing the rubble to fail in shear. Force vs. displacement was measured. Different types of saline ice and submerging water temperatures were used. <b>Pile</b> <b>testing</b> consisted of making an elongated pyramid-shaped pile, baseline 600 mm, of rubble collected from the ice tank at HSVA. The pile was tilted and geometry was measured before and after failure happened in the pile. Main results from the shear box tests were the observation of a first phase deformation of rubble, that displayed a near linear force-displacement relation and a first peak shear stress. Magnitude of first peaks was measured in the range 8. 9 kPa to 59. 7 kPa, and depended on submersion water temperature, salinity of ice, how blocks were cut in respect to crystal structure in the ice sheet and confining pressure. <b>Pile</b> <b>tests</b> had repose angles ranging from 36. 0 &# 176; to 47. 3 &# 176;, and cohesion for an assumed angle of friction of 30 &# 176; was {{in the range of}} 172 Pa to 342 Pa. First phase shear stress was compared to shear strength of single freeze-bond tests of the same ice, and direct relations were found. The magnitude of first peak shear stress in tests varied most with ice salinity and crystal structure.

40|$|Due to {{wind and}} wave actions, ship impacts, {{high-speed}} vehicles, {{and other sources}} of loading, structures such as offshore platforms, tall buildings, high-rise bridges, and electric transmission towers undergo significant torsional loads. Insufficient design of the foundations of these structures against torsional loads may affect the serviceability and safety of these structures. The objectives of this research are: (1) {{through a series of}} centrifuge model tests, to build basic understanding of load sharing mechanisms in pile groups subjected to torsion, pile-soil-pile interactions in torsionally loaded pile groups, and the load-deformation coupling effects in the pile groups and (2) to develop a model to analyze the problems in a rational manner. A series of centrifuge tests, including eight laterally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests,</b> twelve torsionally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> and seven torsionally loaded <b>pile</b> group <b>tests,</b> were performed to achieve the objectives. The laterally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> and the torsionally loaded single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> were performed using a robotic manipulator. It is perhaps {{the first time that a}} robotic manipulator was used to perform the two types of single <b>pile</b> <b>tests</b> in centrifuge. The robotic manipulator was utilized to conduct multiple activities in each test and multiple tests at different loading rates. A separate testing system was developed to conduct the torsionally loaded <b>pile</b> group <b>tests.</b> The testing system can achieve pile jacking and torsional loading without stopping the centrifuge. Using this testing system, seven model tests on 1 x 2, 2 x 2, and 3 x 3 pile groups subjected to torsion were conducted. These tests produced the first batch of experimental data on performance of torsionally loaded pile groups. Test results of the pile groups were compared with those of the single <b>piles.</b> The <b>test</b> results reveal the load sharing mechanism. An applied torque on a pile group is primarily resisted by the torsional and lateral resistances of the individual piles in the group. The torsional and lateral resistances of the piles significantly rely on their locations in the group. The different lateral displacements of the piles at different locations are proportional to the distances from the piles to the torsional centre of the group. Consequently, different shear resistances are mobilized in the piles. Through the deflection-torsion coupling effect, the different lateral resistances then result in the different torsional resistances. In addition, pile-soil-pile interactions also influence the load sharing. Test results show that pile-soil-pile interactions are different for the piles at different locations in the pile group. The <b>pile</b> group <b>test</b> results reveal that effects of lateral movement of the pile on lateral and torsional behaviours of adjacent piles exist in torsionally loaded pile groups. In the 3 x 3 <b>pile</b> group <b>tests,</b> both the pile-head shear forces and the p-y curves demonstrate that side piles and the corner piles in the group interact each other. The induced reductions of the soil resistances in these piles were different. Meanwhile, the side piles were found to affect the torque distributions of the corner piles, as well as their torsional resistances. Patterns of shear zones of piles in pile groups subjected to torsion and lateral loading were found to be significantly different. The difference implies that empirical interaction factors from numerous laterally loaded <b>pile</b> group <b>tests</b> can hardly be used to analyze torsionally loaded pile groups. The deflection-torsion coupling effect was also analyzed. Generally, for a pile in a torsionally loaded pile group, the increase of the soil pressures in front of the pile in lateral loading direction contributes to increase normal stresses on the pile surface. Therefore, the torsional shaft friction increases with the group torsional angle. A factor is introduced to quantify the coupling effect in the <b>pile</b> group <b>tests.</b> A relation between the factor and lateral soil reaction is proposed. Through studying the results of the centrifuge tests, a hybrid model was developed to formulate the problem. In the model, load-transfer curves were used to model nonlinear soil behaviour, which occurs in the near fields around piles. The pile-soil-pile interactions were predicted through Mindlin's solutions. A coupling coefficient was introduced to formulate the deflection-torsion coupling effect in pile groups. This model achieved fairly good agreement with the centrifuge test results...|$|R
