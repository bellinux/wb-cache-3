40|$|The <b>oversheath</b> (jacket) of a cable {{provides}} {{the first line}} of defence for the cable during transportation, installation and throughout its life. As such the <b>oversheath</b> {{is an integral part of}} the cable system and choosing the appropriate material is essential to protect the cable throughout its life. This paper reviews the range of <b>oversheath</b> materials in use today by utilities, and will focus on which are most appropriate in particular situations. A particular emphasis will be placed on benefits of modern halogen free flame retardant (HFFR) compounds as an alternative to PVC. Â© 2010 Chinese Soc for Elec Eng. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of newly installed cables {{is expected to}} be as high as possible from commissioning to replacement. The cable <b>oversheath</b> (jacket) provides the first line of defence for the cable during transportation, installation and throughout its life in the laying environment. As such choosing the most appropriate <b>oversheath</b> material is essential to protect the cable at all stage of its life. </p...|$|E
40|$|A circuit {{model has}} been {{proposed}} to represent an underground power cable system and its surroundings. The damage on <b>oversheath</b> is represented by a resistive component. The simulations on different parameters were carried out using PSpice to examine {{the change in the}} detecting branches brought by this resistive component. The simulated results indicate {{that it is possible to}} detect the damage by monitoring the current change at each joint bay. When there is a fault on <b>oversheath</b> of the cable the current drifts away from its normal value. By monitoring the branch current shape change at adjacent joint bays it is possible to locate the fault. However, the accuracy of the modelling depends on the values of parameters used...|$|E
40|$|Specifies the construction, {{dimensions}} and test requirements of power cables with extruded solid insulation for rated voltages of 1 kV (Um = 1, 2 kV) and 3 kV (Um = 3, 6 kV) for fixed installations such as distribution networks or industrial installations. This standard includes cables which exhibit properties of reduced flame spread, {{low levels of}} smoke emission and halogen-free gas emission when exposed to fire. Cables for special installation and service conditions are not included, for example cables for overhead networks, the mining industry, nuclear power plants (in and around the containment area), submarine use or shipboard application. The main changes {{with respect to the}} first edition relate to insulation and <b>oversheath</b> thickness requirements, and inclusion of constructions and requirements for halogen free cables with reduced flame propagation and low levels of smoke emission...|$|E
