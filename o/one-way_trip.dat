5|$|Harrison {{attempted}} {{to increase the}} power of Southern's locomotives. In 1923, engineers under his direction created {{the plans for the}} P-4 class of Pacific type locomotives, which became famous and a symbol of the Southern Railway. On a visit to England, Harrison had seen the paint scheme used by the London and North Eastern Railway, which used apple green-painted engines. Returning home in 1925, he ordered the newly delivered Pacifics painted a forest green, which he called Virginia, with gold lettering and silver trim. The roof of each engine was painted brick red. These engines pulled the newly refurbished passenger trains that Harrison had begun work on before the war. He also instituted new passenger lines. In 1921 the Suwannee River Special began to run between Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland down to Tampa and St. Petersburg in Florida. The Crescent Limited began service in 1925 between New Orleans and New York, with a scheduled time for the <b>one-way</b> <b>trip</b> of 37hours and 50minutes.|$|E

25|$|The route Seattle-Sydney-Newcastle-Honolulu-San Francisco-Seattle was the Minnie A. Caines most typical cyclic voyage. On average, {{this route}} took her 9 months, as a <b>one-way</b> <b>trip</b> to Australia lasted {{approximately}} three months, {{loading and unloading}} process was complicated, so docking could take weeks, and the schooner often waited for the cargo for the return trip. This route was also the Minnie A. Caines maiden voyage, and she was scheduled to leave Puget Sound for Sydney on October 25, 1900. From {{the day of the}} launch, the Minnie A. Caines captain was J.K. Olsen.|$|E
25|$|The State Street Subway {{opened on}} October 17, 1943, {{providing}} two new tracks bypassing the Loop tracks and {{the portion of}} the North and South Side 'L' lines not equipped with express tracks. By providing an express route free of the most restrictive curves on the Chicago 'L' and shorter than the old line it supplemented, the subway reduced running time by as much as eleven minutes for a <b>one-way</b> <b>trip.</b> The route was placed in operation on October 17, 1943, for a portion of the through north-south trains, although other trains continued to use the 'L' both on through trips and on services circling the Loop and returning to the point of origin.|$|E

25|$|The tram was {{the last}} holdout {{for the use of}} tokens in the New York City transit system. Initially, it used a special token, which was later {{replaced}} by the standard variety for subways and buses. Although tokens were phased out in favor of the MetroCard by 2003, the tram did not start to accept MetroCards until March 1, 2004. The fare is the same as that on the buses and subways: U.S. $2.75 for a <b>one-way</b> <b>trip,</b> with free transfers to the subway and buses. During the 2005 New York City transit strike, the tramway {{was one of the few}} intra-city public transportation systems still in operation, since it was privately operated.|$|E
25|$|By January 2016, average {{ridership}} slumped {{further to}} 1,967 passengers per day. Fares were reduced on March 9, 2016 to $12 for a <b>one-way</b> <b>trip</b> between Union and Pearson, or $9 with a Presto card. On {{the first day}} of reduced fares, staff counted 5,300 boardings with 40 per cent of the riders being first-time UPX users, 83 per cent being air travelers and 17 per cent being commuters. By June 2016, the daily average ridership had risen to 7,657, and a new record was set on July 29, when the service carried more than 11,000 passengers. However, the fare reduction has lowered the total revenue collected by the UP Express, which is expected to be below what is required for its operating costs. It was revealed that since opening day to March 2016, the UP Express' provincial operating subsidy totaled $39.3 million or about $52.26 per ride.|$|E
25|$|The ferry fare {{remained}} a nickel when the subway fare increased to 10 cents in 1948. Despite the ferry's growing operational shortfalls in the 1950s, the five-cent fare remained static regardless of inflation. By 1968, the Citizens Budget Commission was proposing to hike fares {{to close the}} deficits, with Staten Island commuters paying 20 cents and others paying 50 cents for a <b>one-way</b> <b>trip.</b> In May 1970, then-Mayor John V. Lindsay proposed that the fare be raised to 25 cents, {{pointing out that the}} cost for each ride was 50 cents, or ten times what the fare brought in. As part of a city budget passed in June of that year, the nickel fare was kept. Due to the city's financial crisis in the mid-1970s, Mayor Abraham Beame submitted a proposal to increase the fare in July 1975. On August 4, 1975, the nickel fare ended and the charge became 25 cents for a round trip, with the quarter being collected in one direction only. The fare increase was intended to earn the ferry service an extra $1.35 million in annual revenue.|$|E

As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud and takes his hand. He is guided to an alien ship deeper in the trench. Deep inside, the NTI creates an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTI plays back Bud's message to his wife, and the two look at each other with understanding.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} {{it was thought that}} the Goa'uld were the {{builders}} of the Stargate Network, but it was later discovered that they had merely made use of the relics left behind by a different and extinct race, the Ancients. At the climax of SG-1s 6th season, Daniel Jackson discovers that the Earth myth of Atlantis is in fact founded upon the Lost City of the Ancients, and Season 7 is spent trying to locate it. At the beginning of the show Stargate Atlantis, which coincides with the beginning of SG-1s 8th season, the city is found in the Pegasus Galaxy, and 8 chevrons are dialed to send an expedition there on what could be a <b>one-way</b> <b>trip.</b> It is there that they discover a new network of stargates, and are plagued by the nemesis of the Ancients, the Wraith.

30|$|Results {{summarized}} in Table¬† 1 imply that hitchhiking has no prior arrangement between a passenger and a driver {{and does not}} involve change of an initial route, {{which is similar to}} both public transport and slugging.

The two main differences with all other ridesharing types include mostly free rides and intraurban character of travels.|$|R
