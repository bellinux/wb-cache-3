5|$|After the {{beginning}} of World War I in August, the ship captured a German merchantman the following month. Essex spent most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> {{the war in the}} Atlantic Ocean, escorting convoys and searching for German commerce raiders. The ship captured another German merchantman in mid-1916 and was reduced to second-line roles such as depot ship and accommodation ship a few months later. She was paid off in 1919 and sold for scrap two years later.|$|E

5|$|The Barnard Run is {{a school}} competition, {{consisting}} of a cross-country trial over a hilly course. It {{is the most important}} sporting event in the school year.

The race takes place annually at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Spring Term. The girls' and younger boys' race is 2¾ miles while the senior boys' is 4 miles.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} Louisville's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{elected to}} run out the clock and bring the first half to an end. During the process, Marcus Vick ran the ball on a designed play and was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil after Vick gained nine yards. Following the play, Vick paused, then stomped on Dumervil's leg. Though referees failed to observe the stomp, television commentators replayed the action, and Tech coaches considered pulling Vick from the game as punishment. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> play, Louisville held a 17–10 lead.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 {{through his}} John F. Kennedy {{memorial}} cover on December 16, 1963, Rockwell created 321 magazine covers for the Post, {{which was the}} most popular American magazine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century with a subscribership that reached a peak of 4 million. Rockwell illustrated American life during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations, and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II. Some of the war art involved American life. During much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 1940s, Rockwell's cover illustrations focused on the human side of the war. Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II by means of his covers that endorsed war bonds, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service. His World War II illustrations used themes of patriotism, longing, shifting gender roles, reunion, love, work, community and family during wartime to promote the war. In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war, Rockwell draws comparisons to Winslow Homer, an American Civil War illustrator for Harper's Weekly. Rockwell's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address. His painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{started from}} pole position, but was {{overtaken}} by Rosberg {{at the first}} corner. Rosberg held the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race, barring brief periods during pit stops, and won by over three seconds. Hamilton remained ahead of Williams driver Felipe Massa to claim the runner-up position. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel had been holding third position for much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the race, but a delay due to a stuck wheel nut during his pit stop dropped him into fourth place. Former World Champions Kimi Räikkönen and Fernando Alonso were eliminated on the first lap, after Räikkönen lost control of his Ferrari at the second turn and collided with Alonso. The two came to rest against the safety barrier, with Alonso's McLaren atop the Ferrari.|$|E

5|$|Mills' signings for 2012–13 {{proved to}} be less {{influential}} than his signings the previous summer, {{a number of new}} players being left out of the team with little playing time. York were in midtable for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the season, and his signings in the winter transfer window had little impact on the team. Having been 14th in the table on 1 January 2013, York went on a run of 11 matches without a win, and this left the team four points above the relegation zone in 18th place. Mills was dismissed by York on 2 March 2013, an hour after the last of these matches, a 2–0 defeat at home to Bradford City.|$|E
5|$|Morenz {{died from}} {{complications}} {{of a broken}} leg, an injury he suffered in a game. After his death, the Canadiens retired his jersey number, {{the first time the}} team had done so for any player. When the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in 1945, Morenz was one of the original nineinductees. In 1950, the Canadian Press named him the best ice hockey player <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 20thcentury, and in 2017 the NHL included him on their list of the 100 greatest players in league history.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} skilled players in the early NHL, Morenz led the Canadiens in both goals and points from 1926 until 1932, though he tied with Aurèle Joliat for points in 1926. At {{the time of his}} death, he had set an NHL record for most career points with 472. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was {{established}} in 1945, he was among the first group of nine inductees. A 1950 Canadian Press poll named Morenz the best ice hockey player <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 20thcentury. In 1998 he was ranked 15th on The Hockey News list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. When the NHL announced its 100 greatest players in conjunction with the league's centennial 2017, Morenz was included on the list.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 1876, Sitting Bull's camp {{continually}} expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted warriors and families, creating an extensive village estimated {{at more than}} 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual leader. A week prior to the attack, he had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the Creek Turnpike, from US-75 in Jenks to US-64/US-169 in Tulsa, was first {{authorized}} in 1987, with construction beginning in 1989. The turnpike's construction was controversial; homeowners along {{the route of the}} highway formed a group called Tulsans Against Turnpikes to fight the highway in both the courtroom and the media. The highway was also challenged on environmental grounds, with impacts upon wetlands and endangered species being the chief concerns. Nevertheless, the highway opened to traffic in three sections, starting from the easternmost, over the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden goal}} was used during extra-time, {{which meant that}} {{whatever}} team scored first would win. Liverpool kicked off {{the first half of}} extra-time and within three minutes, Alavés looked like they had scored a golden goal. Ivan Alonso had put the ball in the Liverpool goal, but it was ruled out as Alonso was offside. A minute later, Óscar Téllez was booked for fouling Robbie Fowler. Within four minutes, Alavés had been reduced to 10 men. Magno was shown a second yellow card for a two-footed challenge on Markus Babbel. With a minute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> extra-time remaining, Fowler thought he had scored the winning goal, however it was disallowed as he was offside.|$|E

5|$|The {{teaching}} of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. The Scopes Trial decision of 1925 caused {{the subject to}} become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson v. Arkansas decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design (ID), to be excluded {{once again in the}} 2005 Kitzmiller v.

5|$|Without Mikan, the Lakers {{made the}} playoffs, but {{were unable to}} reach the 1955 NBA Finals. In {{the middle of the}} 1955–56 NBA season, Mikan {{returned}} to the Lakers lineup.

At the end of the season, Mikan retired for good. His 10,156 points were a record at the time; he was the first NBA player to score 10,000 points in a career.
