5|$|The 1963 census {{indicated}} that 47% of Nigerians were Muslim, 35% Christian, and 18% members of local indigenous congregations. If accurate, this indicated a sharp increase since 1953 {{in the number}} of Christians (up 23%); a decline among those professing indigenous beliefs, compared with 20%; and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> (6%) drop of Muslims which can likely be attributed to immigration, emigration, and birthrate.|$|E
5|$|During {{his primary}} victories, McGovern used an {{approach}} that stressed grassroots-level organization while bypassing conventional campaign techniques and traditional party power centers. He capitalized on support from anti-war activists and reform liberals; thousands of students engaged in door-to-door campaigning for him. He benefited by the eight primaries he won being those the press focused on the most; he showed electoral weakness in the South and industrial Midwest, and actually received fewer primary votes overall than Humphrey and had <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> edge over Wallace.|$|E

5|$|To fly {{non-stop}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This {{was achieved by}} a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds, a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio, and a complex wing shape for a high lift-to-drag ratio. This also required carrying <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.|$|E
5|$|While holiday {{weekends}} in the US generally increase film audiences and thus attract major releases throughout the year, {{the two that}} occur during these months—Martin Luther King Day in January and Presidents' Day in February—offer <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> prospect for improvement. The most lucrative take by any movie on Martin Luther King Day weekend is $107.2 million by American Sniper in 2015, its first weekend in wide release; the previous best opening weekend was Ride Along the previous year, taking in $41.5 million ($48.6 million if the entire three-day holiday weekend is counted).|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Eastwood {{teamed up}} with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high {{suspense}} and tragedy but was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> success at the box office, earning $32.4million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed {{at the lack of}} Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again.|$|E
50|$|The VMEbus had {{provided}} a high-quality solution for high-performance 16-bit processors, using reliable DIN 41612 connectors and well-specified Eurocard board sizes and rack systems.

5|$|Milton Blockhouse {{was built}} as a {{consequence}} of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, playing <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, as well as a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, The Commitments grossed $14.9 {{million during}} its North American {{theatrical}} run. Reviewers praised the music, performances and humour, while criticism {{was aimed at}} the pacing and direction. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing, and won four BAFTA Awards for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing. While <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> success with North American audiences, The Commitments has since been regarded as a cult film {{and one of the}} best Irish films ever made. It is the first in a series of films known as The Barrytown Trilogy, followed by The Snapper (1993) and The Van (1996).|$|E
5|$|When a film {{is highly}} exploitable as a {{commercial}} property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales. The Lion King earned over $2 billion in box-office and home video sales, but this {{pales in comparison to}} the $6 billion earned at box offices around the world by the stage adaptation. Merchandising can be extremely lucrative too: The Lion King also sold $3 billion of merchandise, while Pixar's Cars—which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> hit by comparison to other Pixar films—generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release. Pixar also had another huge hit with Toy Story 3, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.|$|E

5|$|Steps {{had also}} been taken to expand the pre-Federation network of coastal defences to provide {{protection}} against raids from Japanese or German warships prior to World War I. In 1912, these defences were manned by 14 companies of the Australian Garrison Artillery, each of which had a strength of over 100 men. Meanwhile, in September 1912 the government officially approved {{the formation of an}} Australian military air arm. In so doing Australia became the first of the Dominions, {{and one of the few}} nations outside of Europe, to begin to develop such a capability, even if it was initially <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> one. The Central Flying School was established at Point Cook, Victoria in 1913. Flying training did not begin immediately, though, and it was not until 1914, that the first class of pilots were accepted. No. 1 Flight of the Australian Flying Corps was raised in the 3rd Military District on 14 July 1914.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{fringes of}} Hurricane Dean swept over Haiti {{bringing}} heavy squalls. On Gonâve Island, {{thousands of people}} lost power and some took shelter in schools and churches. The roof of the Hopital St. Michel in Jacmel, damaged before the storm, leaked significantly leading to water damage in the operating room. Two {{people were killed in}} Tiburon and Moron, towns in the south and southeast of the island, respectively. Seven other storm-related deaths were confirmed but few details were given. Another four were injured in a sailboat after disregarding warnings to stay in port. Several hundred homes were destroyed due to the resulting landslides. In the department of Sud-Est, Nippes, Centre, and Artibonite, 5,154people retreated to temporary shelters. Hurricanes typically pose significant hazards to potable water in Haiti, but Hurricane Dean produced <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> 2.06inches (52mm) of rainfall. As such, the storm caused no major problems with water and sanitation, except in the town of Bainet, where the temperamental water system was compromised.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He (d. 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E

The mainstream economists and policy makers attributed this slow industrial growth to (a) governmen...|$|R
50|$|The fur trade <b>only</b> played <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> {{role in the}} colony's economy {{because its}} rivers did not connect its centers well with the Indians who engaged in fur trapping.

25|$|Daniel Gotwald's death {{left his}} wife of twenty-five years, Susannah, with their eight {{surviving}} children to bring up and with meager financial means to do it. He left her with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> home and a few acres of land.|$|E
25|$|The film {{continued}} {{to dominate the}} box office, with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> decline of 36% to post $21.6 million in its second weekend, despite competition from three new wide releases: Blair Witch, Bridget Jones's Baby and Snowden. It finally lost the top spot in its third weekend, after the releases of The Magnificent Seven and Storks.|$|E
25|$|The happy {{outcome is}} that Max Value chooses Big-Is-Best, {{which has the}} higher NPV of 20,000 US dollars, over Small-Is-Beautiful, which <b>only</b> has <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> NPV of 2,500, whereas Max Return chooses Small-Is-Beautiful, for its {{superior}} 37.5 percent return, over the attractive (but not as attractive) return of 32 percent offered on Big-Is-Best. So there is no squabbling of who gets which project, they are each happy to choose different projects.|$|R
50|$|If the {{progenitor}} star {{had exploded}} as a supernova, then observations of similar objects {{show that the}} remnant would most likely have been ejected from the system at a relatively high velocity. As the object remained in orbit, this indicates that the progenitor may have collapsed directly into a black hole without exploding (or at most produced <b>only</b> <b>a</b> relatively <b>modest</b> explosion).|$|R
50|$|On 20 May 1777, Jean-Joseph Raepsaet married Maria Olympa Bauwens, {{daughter}} of another high-ranking official from Oudenaarde, in Antwerp. Together they had seventeen children, of whom six died before reaching adulthood.Of the twelve that remained, six didn't marry, {{and the remaining}} six <b>only</b> had <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> amount of children which, combined with {{the division of the}} inheritance between the many children, caused the name of Raepsaet to disappear from the high society.|$|R

Generation and distribution received 58% and 40% of total investment respectively. For the year 2004 in particular, total public investment in the electricity sector was around $US 20million which was matched by another $US20 million from private sources. Those two figures add up to less than 0.5% of Bolivia’s GDP in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The nominal furnace loading has {{increased}} {{during the last}} ten years and will continue to increase. Changes in air design have increased furnace temperatures. This has enabled a significant increase in hearth solids loading (HSL) with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> design increase in hearth heat release rate (HHRR). The average flue gas flow decreases as less water vapor is present. So the vertical flue gas velocities can be reduced even with increasing temperatures in lower furnace.|$|E
50|$|Military {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} that a military spaceplane {{could also be used}} to place small satellites in orbit, to retrieve them, to provide a means of launching nuclear weapons from orbit, or to serve as a platform for exotic orbit-to-ground hypervelocity weapons.

This study extends their model and employs variables that are more conducive to policy formulation: calorific intake and school enrolment ratios. Results suggest that reducing undernutrition would <b>only</b> make <b>a</b> <b>modest</b> contribution to economic growth while increasing enrolment ratios, especially secondary, has a positive and more significant effect. Policies to increase economic growth should favour investments in education over health. ...|$|R
