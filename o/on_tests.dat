5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% <b>on</b> <b>tests</b> of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Only {{purebred}} Mérens may {{be registered}} in the breed stud book. The selection of stallions is rigorous, based <b>on</b> <b>tests</b> {{at the age of}} three. The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character. The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions, and during the three-year-old inspections, they must perform a dressage test, a cross-country jumping test, a test on the longe line and a physical inspection. The Mérens {{has one of the most}} stringent inspection procedures, and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed. Mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by the French National Stud.|$|E

The following year {{he and his family}} were encouraged by former opponent Jack Fingleton to emigrate and settle in Australia, where he was warmly welcomed, in contrast to the reception accorded him in his cricketing days. He worked for a soft drinks firm, and as an occasional reporter and commentator <b>on</b> <b>Tests</b> against visiting England sides. He paid several visits to England, and was honoured at his old county ground, Trent Bridge, where a stand was named after him.

40|$|Daily {{feed intake}} (DFI) was {{described}} as a function of days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> using a spline random regression model. Order of fit for the spline random regression model was varied, models were compared using Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion. The objective was to investigate whether there are genetic differences in DFI patterns. Data were DFI records of 257 growing gilts, which had ad libitum access to food. Gilts were 94 days old at start of test. All gilts were from a Dutch Landrace line. Number of random regression coefficients was varied from zero to nine for both random effects (animal and permanent environment), the model with four random regression coefficients resulted in the most optimal fit. Six traits were derived to capture differences in DFI patterns, average DFI over test, variance of DFI over test, DFI at day 5 <b>on</b> <b>test,</b> DFI at day 50 <b>on</b> <b>test,</b> DFI at day 95 <b>on</b> <b>test</b> and the difference between DFI at day 95 and day 5. Heritability for DFI decreased from 0. 53 at 5 days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> to 0. 24 at 95 days <b>on</b> <b>test.</b> Genetic correlations between DFI at 5 days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> and 95 days <b>on</b> <b>test,</b> and between DFI at 50 days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> and 95 days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> were low (around 0. 3). The results suggested that DFI at different days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> could not be regarded as repeated measurements of a single trait with constant variance and heritability. Based on the results presented, it can be concluded that changes in feed intake patterns through selection are possible. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower <b>on</b> <b>tests</b> designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent {{studies have shown that}} lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance <b>on</b> <b>tests</b> of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse <b>on</b> <b>tests</b> of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E

The limits <b>on</b> <b>test</b> costs are mainly due to the sample size, test methods, test time, equipment number and test stress levels. Many studies introduced some constraint <b>on</b> <b>test</b> sites and costs in the optimization model [65, 66, 68]; however, we are not aware of a general model or a systematic study on the characteristics of the solutions of such optimization problems.|$|R
30|$|The {{interaction}} effect between test value and other latent variables was also examined: Test value {{has a positive}} effect <b>on</b> <b>test</b> anxiety (β[*]=[*]. 22), but shows no significant relationship with intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. As for the effect of learning motivation <b>on</b> <b>test</b> performance, results show that only extrinsic motivation has a positive effect (β[*]=[*]. 17) <b>on</b> <b>test</b> performance, {{while there is no}} significant relationship between intrinsic motivation and test performance. In other words, in order to improve students’ performance <b>on</b> English <b>tests,</b> it is important to increase their extrinsic learning motivation. In addition, there is no relationship between test anxiety and learning motivation. Results also show there is a significant negative effect (β[*]=[*]−. 29) of <b>test</b> anxiety <b>on</b> <b>test</b> performance. The various relationships among learning motivation, test anxiety, and test performance in this study echo those reported by Cheng et al. in their findings.|$|R

On a tachistoscopic test in 1975, Genie had little difficulty when asked to point to words which rhyme. Genie also did very well on one evoked response test involving familiar homophones, demonstrating that, similar to these patients, her receptive language comprehension was significantly better than her expressive comprehension.
