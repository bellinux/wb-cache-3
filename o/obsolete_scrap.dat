40|$|By {{means of}} a ‘Cycle of Matter’ model a {{comprehensive}} scrap cycle can be estimated for a region, country or continent. The model covers scrap flows between the three main actors defining the cycle, i. e. scrap users, scrap generators and scrap dealers. The ‘Cycle of Matter’ incorporates the generation and use of three types of scrap, i. e. home scrap, prompt scrap and <b>obsolete</b> <b>scrap.</b> It allows for a better assessment {{of the impact of}} government policies regarding scrap recycling {{in various parts of the}} scrap cycle. This paper presents the main results of a detailed study of the national scrap recycling industry of a developing country, Tanzania. The scrap flows in the ‘Cycle of Matter’ model were estimated on the basis of specially tailored surveys amongst scrap users, producers and traders, and on the basis of secondary data and coefficients derived from the literature. The paper demonstrates that the model is a powerful tool for the analysis of the scrap cycle. The study reveals that Tanzania possesses large surpluses of scrap. These surpluses are increasing over time. The scrap users — foundries and steel mills — are not capable of utilising all available scrap. Large quantities of scrap are thus either dumped in the environment or transferred abroad. Foundries and steel mills will only be able to make better use of existing scrap surpluses if they succeed in upgrading their quality of their production processes...|$|E

50|$|After the American {{entry into}} World War I, the Army {{recognized}} the need for large-caliber guns for use on the Western Front. The Coast Artillery operated all US Army heavy artillery in that war, due to their experience and training with these weapons. A total of 28 5-inch coast defense guns were removed from fixed emplacements and mounted on M1917 wheeled carriages as field guns; these equipped a Coast Artillery regiment in France, the 69th. All of these were probably M1897 weapons. However, due to the Armistice, the regiment did not complete training {{in time to see}} action, and reportedly never received ammunition. None of the 5-inch guns were returned to coast defenses. In June 1919, after the Treaty of Versailles was signed, the field carriages for the 5-inch guns were declared <b>obsolete</b> and <b>scrapped.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{he became}} First Sea Lord, Fisher began drawing up {{plans for a}} naval war against Germany. [...] "Germany keeps her whole fleet always {{concentrated}} {{within a few hours}} of England," [...] he told King Edward in 1906. [...] "We must therefore keep a fleet twice as powerful within a few hours of Germany." [...] He therefore concentrated the bulk of the fleet in home waters, with a secondary concentration in the Mediterranean Fleet. He also had dozens of <b>obsolete</b> warships <b>scrapped</b> or reduced to harbour duties. The resources thus saved were directed to new designs of submarines, destroyers, light cruisers, battlecruisers and (most notably) dreadnoughts. Fisher proclaimed, “We shall have ten Dreadnoughts at sea before a single foreign Dreadnought is launched, and we have thirty percent more cruisers than Germany and France put together!”.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{experience}} and training with large guns, the Coast Artillery operated all US Army heavy artillery (155mm gun and up) in World War I, primarily French- and British-made weapons. They also acquired the anti-aircraft mission in that war. A number of 5-inch and 6-inch guns were withdrawn from coast defenses and remounted on wheeled carriages {{for use on}} the Western Front, with about 72 6-inch (possibly including some Navy guns) and 26 5-inch guns shipped to France. However, due to the Armistice, none of the units equipped with repurposed coast defense guns completed training {{in time to see}} action. Only a few of the 6-inch guns and none of the 5-inch guns were returned to the coast defenses after the war. Most of the 6-inch guns were stored until remounted in World War II, and the 5-inch guns were declared <b>obsolete</b> and <b>scrapped</b> circa 1920.|$|R
50|$|During {{the repair}} work, her {{original}} boilers {{were replaced by}} eight Miyabara boilers, her three smokestacks were reduced to two, her lateral engines were removed and power output was reduced to 6,000HP. Suzuya's bow and stern main guns were replaced with 120-mm guns and her four 120-mm guns amidships were replaced by 76-mm guns. She also retained her six 47mm Hotchkiss guns and two 37mm guns. All repairs were complete by December 1908, and she was officially designated as an aviso {{rather than as a}} cruiser. Indeed, she served with the IJN primarily for high speed reconnaissance and as a dispatch vessel; however, due to her battle damage and fewer boilers, the repaired vessel could only attain a maximum speed of 19 kn, as opposed to 25 kn in her original configuration. Furthermore, the development of wireless communications quickly made such dispatch vessels obsolete. Suzuya was re-classified as a 2nd class coastal defense vessel on 28 August 1912, and was declared <b>obsolete</b> and <b>scrapped</b> on 1 April 1913.|$|R

5|$|Edward {{involved}} himself {{heavily in}} discussions over army reform, {{the need for}} which had become apparent with the failings of the Boer War. He supported the redesign of army command, {{the creation of the}} Territorial Force, and the decision to provide an Expeditionary Force supporting France in the event of war with Germany. Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the Imperial German Navy as a new strategic threat. Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir John Fisher, who favoured efficiency savings, <b>scrapping</b> <b>obsolete</b> vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new dreadnoughts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies to}} which extent a firm using a scarce {{resource}} input and facing environmental regulation can still manage {{to have a}} sustainable growth of output and profits. The firm has a vintage capital technology with two complementary factors, capital and a resource input subject to quota, the latter being increasingly scarce through an exogenously rising price. The firm can <b>scrap</b> <b>obsolete</b> capital and invest in adoptive and/or innovative R&D resource-saving activities. Within this realistic framework, we first characterize long-term growth regimes driven by scarcity (induced-innovation) vs. long-term growth regimes driven by quota regulation (Porter-like innovation). More importantly, we study the interaction between scarcity and quota regulation. In particular, we show that there exists a threshold level for {{the growth rate of}} the resource price above which the Porter mechanism is killed while the scarcity-induced growth regime may emerge. Symmetrically, we also find that there must exist a threshold value for the environmental quota under which the growth regime induced by scarcity vanishes while the Porter-like growth regime may survive.

The firm can <b>scrap</b> <b>obsolete</b> capital and invest in adoptive and/or innovative R&D resource-saving activities. We show that there exists a threshold level for {{the growth rate of}} the resource price above which the firm will collapse. Below this threshold, two important properties are found. In the long-run, a sustainable growth is possible at a growth rate which is independent of the resource price. In the short-run, not only will the firms respond to increasing resource price by increasing R&D on average, but they will also reduce capital expenditures and speed up the scrapping of older capital goods. Finally, we identify optimal intensive Vs extensive transitional growth regimes depending {{on the history of the}} firms.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} hydrometallurgical {{procedures for}} concentrating precious metals from a mechanically processed metal fraction of <b>obsolete</b> military electronic <b>scrap.</b> Feed {{material for the}} leaching procedures described in this report was the high-tension-separated metal concentrate obtained as a fraction from mechanically processing partially stripped electronic units. Initial pretreatment with a 20 -wt-pct-NaOH solution solubilized most of the aluminum. After washing, the resulting residue was incinerated to destroy any organics attached to metal particles. The incinerated residue was leached with 20 -vol-pct H 2 S 04 solution using two methods, countercurrent pressure and ultrasonic-aided leaching to solubilize the base metals, predominantly copper. Silver was recovered from the base metal leach residue using 50 -vol-pct HN 03, and gold contaminated with several percent palladium was recovered from the silver leach residue using aqua regia. The impure silver and gold plus palladium products represent about 1. 5 wt pct of the high-tension-separated metal concentrate. Included is a three-step process evaluation study of mechanical processing of general electronic scrap and two hydrometallurgical procedures for leaching high-tension-separated metallic concentrates obtained from the mechanical processing step. Process evaluation concluded that only mechanical processing is economically viable...|$|R
40|$|Shipbreaking is {{the process}} of {{dismantling}} an <b>obsolete</b> vessel for <b>scrapping</b> or disposal. This activity was not officially declared an industry in Bangladesh until 2006, even though the country {{is one of the biggest}} ship-breakers in the world. This industry has dramatically expanded in Bangladesh, at the cost of environmental degradation and severe labour exploitation. Despite environmental and human rights violations, the shipbreaking industry represents a vital source of income for the country and a livelihood for a significant portion of its population. Shipbreaking activities in Bangladesh present both opportunities and challenges for Bangladesh. This article examines the extent to which the existing regulatory framework for dealing with these issues in Bangladesh is congruent with international instruments. This article also examines relevant international instruments which prescribe the core principles for regulating the ship breaking industry and evaluates the legal regulation of the Bangladesh ship breaking industry against these international instruments. The underlying objective of this evaluation is to demonstrate that Bangladeshi instruments could incorporate the core of the international instruments to minimise the environmental damage caused by this industry. This article concludes that Bangladesh should either amend its laws or enact a new legislative scheme that is based on the core values of the Basel Convention. This change is vital if Bangladesh wants to ensure a long lasting industry that could serve its need for iron ore and engage its abundant labour force, without the cost of destroying its coastal line which is one of its most valuable natural assets. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes 12 weeks internship at Fluorocarbon. The aims of {{this project}} are to improve the storage system and setup area in the press shop through application of 5 S Which means that everything is displayed, marked, documented, and reported, so that any individual can {{be able to identify}} and allocate tooling and other parts needed to carry on production. The company faces problems in delays and unnecessary extra cost for tools that are missing or broken. It is not uncommon for an operator to spend long time looking for common parts, tools or equipment to accomplish all the tasks necessary to make a setup. These issues cause an increase in idle time of the press shop. The project starts with the observation of the press shop, identification of setup area and storage area then understanding the process and tools for each product family. From the observation it is seen that {{there is a lack of}} planning, organization, and structure in the storage area system; everything is done in a personal manner. The information from Department design to the shop floor is not well aligned having significant effect on the organization and its performance. At FBS there is not any procedure for the storage area, tools are placed everywhere and mixed with other product families; therefore there is not clear understanding between things which are useful and which are <b>scrap.</b> <b>Obsolete</b> tools, broken tools and unneeded tools are kept in the storage area. The company feels that 5 S initiative might help remove variability by standardizing where tools can be found and making everything visual and eliminating misplaced and lost tools in the storage are. 5 S program is an integral part of all Lean tools...|$|R
