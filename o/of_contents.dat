The {{magazine was}} initially titled Beyond Fantasy Fiction, and this remained the title on the masthead throughout the ten-issue run. However, issue 9 changed the title to simply Beyond Fiction {{on the cover}}, spine, and table <b>of</b> <b>contents.</b> Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to Beyond Fantasy Fiction for the table <b>of</b> <b>contents.</b> As a result, the magazine is often listed as having changed its name {{for the last two}} issues.|$|E

40|$|David Papineau [1999. "Normativity and Judgement. " Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 73 (Sup. Vol.) : 16 - 43. ] {{argues that}} norms of {{judgement}} pose no special problem for naturalism, because all such norms of judgement {{are derived from}} moral or personal values. Papineau claims that this account of the normativity of judgement presupposes an account <b>of</b> <b>content</b> that places normativity outside the analysis <b>of</b> <b>content,</b> because in his view any accounts <b>of</b> <b>content</b> that place normativity inside the analysis <b>of</b> <b>content</b> cannot explain the normativity of judgement in the derivative way he proposes. Furthermore, he argues that normative accounts <b>of</b> <b>content</b> along those lines are independently problematic. In this paper I aim to respond to both objections, by arguing that normative accounts <b>of</b> <b>content</b> {{can be seen as}} naturalist accounts, even if they place normativity inside the analysis of content; and that normative accounts <b>of</b> <b>content</b> are compatible with a derivative account of norms of judgement of the sort Papineau advocates...|$|R

40|$|Table <b>of</b> <b>content</b> (TOC) {{detection}} {{has drawn}} attention now a day because it {{plays an important}} role in digitization of multipage document.

5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force {{did not know}} the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had never had to handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for them to learn about military cargoes and procedures.|$|E
30|$|The {{pedagogical}} side {{of using}} multiple types <b>of</b> <b>content</b> raises {{the issue of}} course requirements: should we enforce student work with different types <b>of</b> <b>content</b> or should using such content be strictly voluntary? In our research setting, all practice content available in the Python Grids system was non-mandatory, yet {{almost half of the}} students (of those who used the system) used all four types <b>of</b> Python Grids <b>content</b> and less than one-fourth focused on one type <b>of</b> <b>content.</b> As two content types (animated examples and Parson’s problems) were also used in the mandatory content, we investigated whether this had an effect on the use <b>of</b> voluntary <b>content</b> types. We found no evidence that students would ignore voluntary practice <b>content</b> <b>of</b> a specific type if they used this type <b>of</b> <b>content</b> in the mandatory exercises, i.e., students considered it to be worthwhile to continue working with many types <b>of</b> <b>content.</b>|$|R

5|$|The first sixteen {{issues of}} Unknown had cover paintings, but from July 1940 the cover style {{was changed to}} a table <b>of</b> <b>contents,</b> with a small ink drawing usually {{accompanying}} the summary of each story, {{in an attempt to}} make the magazine appear more dignified. The cover art came almost entirely from artists who did not contribute to many science fiction or fantasy magazines: six of the sixteen paintings were by H. W. Scott; Manuel Islip, Modest Stein, Graves Gladney, and Edd Cartier provided the others. Cartier {{was the only one of}} these who regularly contributed to sf and fantasy periodicals; he painted four of Unknowns last six covers before the change to a text-heavy design.|$|E
5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording <b>of</b> <b>contents,</b> and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.|$|E
5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, but {{a little}} less simple {{than those in the}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table <b>of</b> <b>contents).</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. While {{the amount}} <b>of</b> {{multimedia}} <b>content</b> on the Web is continuously growing, reuse <b>of</b> multimedia <b>content</b> remains low and automated processing <b>of</b> <b>content</b> remains hard. An increased reuse <b>of</b> <b>content</b> however {{would result in}} a greater consistency, quality and lowered cost of the production <b>of</b> new <b>content.</b> The retrieval <b>of</b> multimedia <b>content</b> on the Web is a continuous challenge which is {{due to the lack of}} (formal) descriptions and generic multimedia analysis algorithms. We present a model and a set of ontologies to mark up multimedia content embedded in web pages which can be used to deploy its descriptions on the Semantic Web and which in turn can be used to reason about the <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> multimedia resources. This model is part of a method to raise the reusability potential <b>of</b> <b>content</b> which in turn is expected to lower production costs <b>of</b> new <b>content.</b> ...|$|R

30|$|This paper uses content {{analysis}} to identify types <b>of</b> <b>content</b> provided by airlines on their official Facebook pages. The method applied {{is similar to}} that of Halpern and Regmi [11] who have recently published a thorough <b>content</b> analysis <b>of</b> 451 European airport websites. Using a technique of deductive coding, they first identified 4 different types <b>of</b> <b>content</b> expected to be found on an airport’s website. Then they started searching for these types <b>of</b> <b>content</b> online. In the process, a list of more than 70 items <b>of</b> <b>content</b> emerged – they added new items to the list as they discovered them. Halpern and Regmi then offered a simple statistical analysis <b>of</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> airport websites according to different airport characteristics, such as airport ownership, airport size, region, and internet penetration of the country.|$|R
30|$|The above results {{point to}} a {{positive}} impact in practicing with smart content, {{as well as the}} style of practicing, on students’ performance. Although all practice styles that included work with single or multiple types <b>of</b> <b>content</b> correlated with good student performance on the course, mandatory exercises, positive correlation with learning gains, and increased exam scores were only observed for the practice style that included work on multiple types <b>of</b> <b>content.</b> This improved performance could be explained by the greater amount of time that students spent practicing with multiple types <b>of</b> <b>content.</b> This observation, in fact, highlights the importance of practicing with different types <b>of</b> <b>content</b> for learning programming—those students who work with multiple types <b>of</b> <b>content</b> tend to spend more time practicing and thus tend to achieve a better performance.|$|R
