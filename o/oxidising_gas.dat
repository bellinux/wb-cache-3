Atmospheric mercury species {{concentrations}} were measured during two oceanographic cruise campaigns cover-ing the Adriatic Sea, the first during the autumn in 2004 {{and the second}} {{in the summer of}} 2005.

40|$|When air is {{introduced}} horizontally into the packed bed of carbonaceous particles, a heterogeneous combustion zone forms within the packed bed. Depending {{on the relative}} gas velocity {{at the point of}} introduction of the gas {{and the size of the}} packed-bed particles, these combustion zones vary from relatively quiescent regions to zones in which turbulent, high speed, rotational motion of the particles occurs. It is shown in this review that in the past studies in this field have mostly been carried out as a result of investigations into the iron-making blast furnace. In the conducting of this research, four approaches to the problem have been adopted, these being: 1. (i) experiments on laboratory models at room temperature, 2. (ii) experiments on hot models in which the combustion occurs at high temperatures but where a small scale of operation applies, 3. (iii) experiments on full-scale packed beds during or after commercial operation and 4. (iv) theoretical studies which simulate the system.

The main objective is to measure in real time {{with a high level of}} accuracy the variations of oxidising gases concentration in bus passenger compartments to inform travellers or commuters and to evaluate the assessment of bus drivers' exposure. A self-contained gas sensor microsystem of which the sensitive element is constituted by a thin layer of copper phthalocyanine has been developed, validated at laboratory under controlled experimental conditions and then implemented in a bus of the urban network of Clermont-Ferrand, France. Preliminary in-car measurements realized with commercial analyzers show that nitrogen dioxide is the major <b>oxidising</b> <b>gas</b> present on urban roads and so is considered as the target gas in this study.

40|$|Using a {{purpose-built}} 3 D atom probe, we {{have previously}} shown {{that exposure to}} <b>oxidising</b> <b>gases</b> (NO, N 2 O, O 2) induces Rh surface segregation in Pt-Rh alloys, the extent of which {{is strongly dependent on}} treatment temperature, crystallographic plane and the presence of ternary alloy additions. In this paper, the segregation trends identified on three different crystallographic surfaces of Pt-Rh are analysed using thermodynamic and kinetic arguments. The segregation model we present is generic for diffusion on alloy surfaces in the presence of active gases. From it we obtain activation energies and diffusion coefficients for the processes of metal-oxide species diffusion both perpendicular to and laterally across the surface. Using these we propose a simple model for the interaction of chemically active gases with the surfaces of such alloys. Applying this understanding to sequential oxidation/reduction treatments would in principle allow improved control of the surface composition of alloy catalysts.

Therefore, within this graduation project, the underlying physical principles o f droplet formation and the process parameters had to be characterised. After characterisation of the process parameters, the uniform production o f spherical particles had to be realised and controlled. A small scale experimental setup {{was used to test}} and realise these results. Periodic single droplet formation at the nozzle was demonstrated to be the most suitable mechanism for uniform shot production. A relation for the maximum uniform production rate was found and evaluated. Both the maximum production rate and the diameter of the produced shot are determined by the nozzle diameter, the metal flow rate through the nozzle, and the metal properties (surface tension and density). <b>Oxidising</b> <b>gas</b> components cause unstable droplet formation and non-spherical shapes. The viscosity of the coolant is determining for the end shape o f the shot particle. Tests with a high viscosity oil (also at elevated temperature) increased the sphericity of the shot particles.

The shape factor, defined as the ratio of the two longest lengths of an ellipsoidal particle, has been determined at 1. 05.

In this study the effect of an adsorbed organic layer on the dynamic response of zinc oxide nanowire gas sensors was investigated. The effect of ZnO surface functionalisation by two different organic molecules, tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THMA) and dodecanethiol (DT), was studied. The response towards ammonia, nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide was investigated for three sensor configurations, namely pure ZnO nanowires, organic-coated ZnO nanowires and ZnO nanowires covered with a sparse layer of organic-coated ZnO nanoparticles. Exposure of the nanowire sensors to the <b>oxidising</b> <b>gas</b> NO 2 produced a significant and reproducible response. ZnO and THMA-coated ZnO nanowire sensors both readily detected NO 2 down to a concentration in the very low ppm range. Notably, the THMA-coated nanowires consistently displayed a small, enhanced response to NO 2 compared to uncoated ZnO nanowire sensors. At the lower concentration levels tested, ZnO nanowire sensors that were coated with THMA-capped ZnO nanoparticles were found to exhibit the greatest enhanced response. &# 916; R / R was two times greater than that for the as-prepared ZnO nanowire sensors. It is proposed that the &# 916; R / R enhancement in this case originates from the changes induced in the depletion-layer width of the ZnO nanoparticles that bridge ZnO nanowires resulting from THMA ligand binding {{to the surface of}} the particle coating.

In this present research selected transition metal nitrides and carbides have been oxidised in air and carbon dioxide. Activation energies have been determined for these reactions from isothennal oxidations utilizing the Arrhenius equation and from oxidations at different heating rates utilizing the Kissinger equation. Kinetic schemes for the isothermal oxidations have been proposed based on two models of the reactions, that is half order kinetics in which the rate of reaction is determined by the diffijsion of <b>oxidising</b> <b>gas</b> througli the oxide product and two-thirds order kinetics in which the reaction takes place at the surface of a spherical particle of diminishing size as the reaction pioceeds. Surface area measurements and electron microscopy have been utilized to study the ability of the product formed during the oxidations to sinter. X-ray diffractometry has been used to identify the crystal phases present in the initial nitride or carbide and in the oxidation products. The activation energies of the carbides were found to be lower than that found for the respective nitrides. At low temperatures the carbides oxidised more extensively than the respective nitrides, but at high temperatures the situation was reversed. This is explained in terms of the difference in the preexponential term of the Arrhenius equation.

Specimens are prepared from Pt alloy wires, using compositions comparable with those in catalytic converters. The hemispherical specimen provides a good model for real catalyst particles. To simulate engine exhaust environments, this instrument features a reaction cell for specimen heating (up to 873 K). This is connected to gas lines (including CO, NO, SO 2, O 2), which can supply single or multiple gases in any chosen ratio for treatments. The specimens are analysed post-exposure to determine structural and chemical changes. Work presented will cover results on metal atom surface segregation of Pt/Rh, Pt/Rh/Ir and Pt/Rh/Ru specimens, illustrating {{that the nature of}} segregation is not only gas-specific but also surface-specific.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} behaviour of porous, sintered iron was studied by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), at temperatures between 300 oC and 700 oC, in a flowing atmosphere of 20 % O 2 / 80 % N 2. Samples for TGA tests were compacted from pure iron powder, at 150 MPa to 550 MPa, and vacuum sintered at 1120 oC. The mass gain of samples during oxidation was recorded continuously {{for a period}} of 24 hours. It was found that the oxidation mass gain of PM samples depended on the permeability of the pore structure and the temperature. At low temperatures, the <b>oxidising</b> <b>gas</b> was able to permeate through the pore structure, causing the oxidation of a large active surface area. At high temperatures the active surface area was smaller, because oxygen diffusing into the pore structure, from the external atmosphere, was adsorbed by pore surfaces close to the external surface of the compact. Although the weight of the external oxide scale on compacts increased with increasing oxidation temperature, the absence of oxide in the core porosity in compacts oxidised at higher temperatures resulted in smaller mass gains than were observed for compacts oxidised at lower temperatures. The heat generated by the oxidation of the large active surface areas of porous samples was studied by thermo-calorimetric analysis (TCA). It was determined that this phenomenon could raise the core temperature of samples significantly above the ambient furnace temperature, and affecting the morphology of the oxide scale formed. The effects (on {{oxidation behaviour}} at 500 oC) of small, elemental alloy additions of Al, Cu, P and Si to pure iron powder were studied. It was found that elements that promote pore rounding during sintering caused a significant reduction in the mass gain rate of the PM alloys, compared to the PM pure iron. The oxidation resistance due to these elements prevented pore closure by oxide growth, so that the active surface area of these PM alloys remained high. The PM alloys were also studied by thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA, dilatometry), to determine their dimensional stability during sintering and subsequent elevated temperature service.

30|$|When both {{reactants}} {{are passed}} over the catalyst a unique product distribution is observed. Firstly, no cis- 2 -butene is formed, even though both reactants produce this product when {{passed over the}} catalyst individually; secondly, both iso-butane and iso-butene are formed even though neither reactant produces these products when passed over the catalyst individually. Thirdly, an enhanced initial yield of propene is observed. The absence of cis- 2 -butene is a slightly odd result, although the primary product of butane dehydrogenation is 1 -butene [9] there is rapid isomerisation {{and the production of}} both trans- and cis- 2 -butene. Note that the yield of 1 -butene and trans- 2 -butene is very similar to that found in the absence of propyne if we assume that the butenes are only formed from butane (0.7  % 1 -butene, 0.5  % trans- 2 -butene from the mixed feed cf. 0.6  % 1 -butene, 0.5  % trans- 2 -butene from the butane feed). This implies that either the 1 -butene isomers to trans- 2 -butene first prior to isomerisation to cis- 2 -butene, as this would allow a situation where no cis- 2 -butene was detected, or cis- 2 -butene is formed but reacts in the alkylation reaction to form iso-butane (ene). Interestingly, assuming that a butane molecule must be used to form either iso-butane or iso-butene then all of the butane conversion can be accounted for in the production of 1 -butene, trans- 2 -butene, iso-butane and iso-butene. However, after 25  min time on stream the butane conversion remains approximately the same yet no dehydrogenation products are observed. The likely reason for this is carbon deposition from the propyne poisoning the dehydrogenation activity. It has been shown in previous studies of alkane dehydrogenation [9, 17] that the materials desorbed at room temperature in an <b>oxidising</b> <b>gas</b> are responsible for the major loss in activity for vanadia-based catalysts. In this case it can be seen from Fig.  5 that propyne, methane and carbon monoxide are the principal gases desorbed and these can all be traced back to propyne. The transhydrogenation activity is also lost when the main dehydrogenation activity is lost. This {{can be seen from the}} drop in propene yield. Note that the amount of iso-butane and iso-butene formed match the butane conversion in agreement with the TPO that butane contributes very little to the carbon deposition.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing concern to produce {{energy-efficient}} lubricated components and modem engine oil specifications require lubricants to demonstrate fuel efficiency in standardised engine tests. One important method of producing low friction and thus fuel-efficient lubricants is to use oil-soluble, molybdenum-containing, friction modifier additives. In optimal conditions these additives are able to produce very low friction coefficients, in the range 0. 045 to 0. 075 in boundary lubrication conditions. Very {{little is known about the}} chemical and physical mechanisms by which oil soluble molybdenum additives form low friction films in tribological contacts. Information about their activity could lead to optimal use of these additives in lubricants and, therefore, more efficient engine running. The work outlined in this thesis investigated the behaviour of oil-soluble molybdenum additives and showed that these additives were able to effectively reduce friction in the absence of other additives such as ZnDTP. Their activity was shown to be highly concentration and temperature dependent and was also found to be sensitive to the roughness of the contacting surfaces. Raman spectroscopy was used to analyse the chemical nature of molybdenum-containing reaction films and found that friction reduction indubitably arises from the local formation of platelets (diameter 30 - 50 nm) of MoS sub 2. The formation of MoS sub 2 -rich films was found to occur only during direct asperity-asperity rubbing of the contacting surfaces (this type of contact being especially prevalent in pure sliding contacts).

Following exposure to the <b>oxidising</b> <b>gases</b> NO on Pt, and NO, O 2 or N 2 O on Pt-Rh, both surfaces appear disrupted, while for Pt-Rh, Rh enrichment of the surface atomic layer is noted over the entire specimen apex for exposure temperatures up to 523 K. However, for oxidising exposures at 573 - 773 K relatively clean, Rh-depleted surfaces are observed on { 0 0 1 }, { 0 1 1 } and { 0 1 2 } crystallographic regions of Pt-Rh. It is suggested that this result is due to surface diffusion of oxide species over the specimen apex, towards the { 1 1 1 }-orientated areas where the oxides appear to be stabilised. In contrast, CO exposure appears to have little effect on the either the surface structure or composition of the Pt-Rh alloy. Finally, combinations of two gases (NO + CO, O 2 + NO) were also dosed onto Pt-Rh alloys in the same exposure. These revealed that while NO and CO can co-adsorb without interference, CO prevents the build up of oxide layers and reduces the extent of Rh segregation seen under NO exposure alone. On exposing Pt-Rh to NO after an oxygen exposure, heavily oxidised surfaces, Rh segregation and no intact NO molecules were seen, confirming the ability of oxidised Pt-Rh to dissociate nitric oxide. © 2007 Elsevier B.

The chlorine dioxide gas converts the relatively insoluble nitric oxide (NO) to the more soluble nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). This makes a downstream wet scrubbing process feasible for simultaneous removal of sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). An experimental evaluation of the proposed process using chlorine dioxide gas has been performed on a laboratory scale. The experimental setup, designed and built by Akzo Nobel, consists of a reactor for oxidation, a flue gas condenser and a wet scrubber. The results show that ClO 2 <b>gas</b> <b>oxidises</b> NO with high efficiencies under {{a wide range of}} process conditions, also in the presence of sulphur dioxide (SO 2). The more ClO 2 gas is added, the higher the degree of NO oxidation and the total nitrogen oxides (NOx) removal efficiency becomes. The results also show that the presence of water strongly increases the removal of SO 2, which is believed to be an effect of liquid phase nitrogen-sulphur interactions. The absorption solution, sodium carbonate and sodium sulphite, is efficient in removing NOx (especially NO 2) from the <b>oxidised</b> flue <b>gas.</b> The total NOx reduction at 0. 6 ClO 2 :NO mole ratio and subsequent wet scrubbing is between 79 % and 94 %, depending on the process conditions used.

40|$|Heightened {{concerns}} for cleaner air and increasingly more stringent regulations on sulphur content in transportation fuels will make desulphurization {{more and more}} important. The sulphur problem is becoming more serious in general, particularly for diesel fuels as the regulated sulphur content is getting {{an order of magnitude}} lower, while the sulphur contents of crude oils are becoming higher. This thesis aimed to develop a desulphurisation process (based on oxidation followed by extraction) with high efficiency, selectivity and minimum energy consumption leading to minimum environmental impact via laboratory batch experiments, mathematical modelling and optimisation. Deep desulphurization of model sulphur compounds (di-n-butyl sulphide, dimethyl sulfoxide and dibenzothiophene) and heavy gas oils (HGO) derived from Libyan crude oil were conducted. A series of batch experiments were carried out using a small reactor operating at various temperatures (40 - 100 °C) with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as oxidant and formic acid (HCOOH) as catalyst. Kinetic models for the oxidation process are then developed based on 'total sulphur approach'. Extraction of unoxidised and <b>oxidised</b> <b>gas</b> oils was also investigated using methanol, dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-methyl pyrolidone (NMP) as solvents. For each solvent, the 'measures' such as: the partition coefficient (KP), effectiveness factor (Kf) and extractor factor (Ef) are used to select the best/effective solvent and to find the effective heavy gas oil/solvent ratios. A CSTR model is then developed for the process for evaluating viability of the large scale operation. It is noted that while the energy consumption and recovery issues could be ignored for batch experiments these could not be ignored for large scale operation. Large amount of heating is necessary even to carry out the reaction at 30 - 40 °C, the recovery of which is very important for maximising the profitability of operation and also to minimise environmental impact by reducing net CO 2 release. Here the heat integration of the oxidation process is considered to recover most of the external energy input. However, this leads to putting a number of heat exchangers in the oxidation process requiring capital investment. Optimisation problem is formulated using gPROMS modelling tool to optimise some of the design and operating parameters (such as reaction temperature, residence time and splitter ratio) of integrated process while minimising an objective function which is a coupled function of capital and operating costs involving design and operating parameters. Two cases are studied: where (i) HGO and catalyst are fed as one feed stream and (ii) HGO and catalyst are treated as two feed streams. A liquid-liquid extraction model is then developed for the extraction of sulphur compounds from the <b>oxidised</b> heavy <b>gas</b> oil. With the experimentally determined KP multi stage liquid-liquid extraction process is modelled using gPROMS software and the process is simulated for three different solvents at different oil/solvent ratios to select the best solvent, and to obtain the best heavy gas oil to solvent ratio and number of extraction stages to reduce the sulphur content to less than 10 ppm. Finally, an integrated oxidation and extraction steps of ODS process is developed based on the batch experiments and modelling. The recovery of oxidant, catalyst and solvent are considered and preliminary economic analysis for the integrated ODS process is presented.

Depletion of OH by reactive carbon gases has been compensated by increased OH formation by nitrogen oxides, an act of &quot;inadvertent geo-engineering&quot;. Analyses of global mean OH for the past 2. 5 decades, however, partly based on methyl chloroform measurements, are ambiguous.

40|$|International audienceThe {{selective}} {{and real}} time monitoring of <b>oxidising</b> <b>gases</b> in atmosphere by semiconductor gas sensors remains {{a real challenge}} despite all improvements to reach analyzer performances. Thanks to its insensitivity to reducing species and its high reactivity with oxidising ones, even for low concentrations, copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) {{is one of the}} most attractive semiconductor for this application. In recent works, we have shown that selective detection of O 3 can be obtained with CuPc based gas sensor, using an appropriate methodology of measurements exploiting the fastest kinetics of response to this gas [1 - 2]. For the selective detection of NO 2 in air, ozone constitutes the most important interfering agent and leads to the irreversible degradation of phthalocyanine molecular units in long term which reduces the sensors lifetime [3]. Thus, to efficient monitoring of NO 2 in atmosphere by phthalocyanine gas sensors, it appears necessary to eliminate O 3 without altering NO 2 concentration, by means of selective filter. Among all the material investigated as ozone filter (MnO 2 powder or impregnated grids, charcoal, C 60 powder, stainless steel cuttings, indigo powder [...] .), only indigo can be considered as a real selective ozone filter. Moreover, indigo powder being easily sublimed to be deposited as thin layers, this material is really suitable for the realization of integrated selective ozone filter. The structure investigated in this work is constituted by a 300 nm-CuPc thin film as sensitive layer and an additional indigo evaporated film as the filter layer. The range of thickness investigated for indigo layer is 10 - 100 nm. The very low intrinsic conductivity of indigo films (Σ = 2. 10 - 107 - 1. cm- 1) makes them insulating, that's avoid bypassing the sensitive layer. Sensor responses measured for the same concentration of NO 2 and O 3 emphasize that response and recovery times remain high, gas/phthalocyanine interactions are reversible, the response under O 3 is negligible and kinetics of response to NO 2 is slower than device without indigo filter due probably to the slow diffusion of NO 2 species through the filtering layer to reach the sensitive one. The last point is confirmed by experiments made on structures with different thicknesses of indigo: the thicker the layer is, the slower the kinetics of response is. The integrated indigo layer on phthalocyanine sensors makes them selective to NO 2 and avoids the fast ageing effect due to the strong and irreversible interaction of O 3 on the sensitive layer...|$|R

Since human-induced pollution emissions strongly affect OH formation and loss, large global changes in OH concentrations are possible. Global models and observations of trace gas distributions from global networks {{have been used to}} study geographical and temporal changes in tropospheric OH.

Globally, depletion of OH by reactive carbon gases has been compensated by increased OH formation by nitrogen oxides, an act of "inadvertent geo-engineering". However, OH analyses for the past 1 - 2 decades, partly based on methyl chloroform measurements, are inconclusive. Some work, assuming that methyl chloroform emissions have largely ceased, suggests a very strong downward global OH trend in the 1990 s, inconsistent with modelling studies. The discrepancy could be much reduced by assuming continued small emissions of methyl chloroform.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a {{thermodynamically}} stable gas {{owing to}} its inherent colourless, odourless and inflammable nature. At low concentrations (~ 1000 ppm) {{it is considered}} harmless, however at higher concentrations (&gt; 20000 ppm), it significantly affects the respiratory system. In recent years, the health hazards of CO 2 have forced government and environmental safety bodies {{around the world to}} introduce stern rules to curb CO 2 emission from major anthropogenic sources. In this context, efficient and selective detection of CO 2 gas has gained considerable interest as it is the first step to emission reduction of this greenhouse pollutant. To date, metal oxide based sensors have shown promising potential in gas sensing applications as they can be easily miniaturized, has defect tuned facile synthesis and high structural stability necessary in harsh testing conditions. However, the major issue of using them for CO 2 sensing applications is their lack of sensitivity and selectivity towards the gas at the desired operating temperatures. This doctoral project centres around the development of metal oxides based CO 2 gas sensors that can detect low concentrations (&lt; 1000 ppm) in the presence of <b>oxidising</b> co-interfering <b>gases</b> such as NO 2, SO 2, CO and NO at various operating temperatures. The initial stage of this doctoral work deals with comprehensive literature review that revealed challenging inadequacies in the existing sensor materials synthesis and fabrication techniques. Furthermore, important semiconductor materials that have not yet been explored towards CO 2 but have shown sensing capabilities towards similar <b>oxidising</b> <b>gases</b> were studied for the first time. In an attempt to address the research questions developed during the course of study, potentiometric and chemo-resistive micro-sensors were fabricated as a case study to successfully develop a set of sensitive and selective CO 2 gas sensors operating from 100 to 500 oC for range of potential applications. Among the CO 2 sensors, potentiometric sensors are extensively tried in sectors requiring sensors operating efficiently at temperature above 400 oC. Unlike the conventional potentiometric sensors using commercially procured sensitive materials, the sensor developed in this work was fabricated out of nanomaterials in a bid to improve its electrochemical stability. In case of chemo-resistive gas sensors, various hierarchical n-type metal oxide semiconductors (ZnO, SnO 2 and BaTiO 3) were synthesized and decorated with Ag@CuO to target CO 2 application, where an operating temperature less than 300 oC is required. The chosen n-type metal oxides were selected based on their band-gap, work function, and charge carrier concentration. Carbonising ability of CuO in the presence of CO 2 and catalytic role of Ag in expediting the CO 2 sensing phenomenon were the sole reasons for the decoration of n-type MOS with Ag@CuO. Plausible formation mechanism in each case was proposed based on the nucleation and crystal growth supported by physicochemical characterizations techniques. Both types of the developed sensors were tested towards CO 2 gas concentrations (100 - 10000 ppm) as a function of operating temperature (40 - 700 &deg;C) and their influence on sensor performance (i. e. sensitivity, selectivity, long-term stability, response/recovery times, dynamic range, repeatability and reusability) were thoroughly investigated. The probable CO 2 sensing mechanism has also been attempted by corroborating sensing performance with in-situ spectroscopic techniques. The results demonstrated in this work were found to be encouraging and is anticipated to pave way for intensified research efforts in CO 2 sensor development for real industrial applications. For example, the nanostructured potentiometric CO 2 composing of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 octahedra showed enhanced response compared to commercial sensor, thus standing strong chance as real-time sensor. Among the n-type MOS tested, Ag@CuO/BaTiO 3 showed exceptional sensing performance and the sensing mechanism were determined by employing in-situ DRIFTS technique. The sensors developed in this doctoral work are anticipated to be suitable for industrial applications requiring low operating temperatures and detection limits. The methods, materials and devices presented in this thesis have potential to be explored further, not only for CO 2 based sensing but also many other applications such as visible light driven dye degradation, supercapacitors and so on...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the project {{reaction}} probabilities were determined for heterogeneous reactions of <b>oxidising</b> trace <b>gases</b> with airborne soot particles. It was found that the initial reaction probabilities decrease fairly rapidly due to passivation of the soot particles. This sets an upper limit to the impact of soot aerosol on the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. When averaged over the atmospheric residence time of soot particles the reaction probabilities are negligibly low. Only the loss of HO_ 2 radicals on soot particles might {{have an impact on the}} oxidation capacity, provided that the true reaction probability is really as large as the upper limit determined in this work. Furthermore, the climatically relevant optical properties of soot particles and their external and internal mixtures with ammonium sulphate as well as secondary organic aerosol were determined. The physico-chemical characteristics of Diesel soot and soot aerosol from graphite spark generators were determined. It was shown that spark generator soot is a poor proxy for atmospheric soot aerosol in some respects. Models were developed to describe the physico-chemical and optical characteristics of soot aerosol. This includes simplified parametrisations for the description of soot particles in regional chemistry transport models. (orig.)

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{oxidation}} of monoterpenes by O 3 and NO 2 and factors that influenced the oxidation were studied. In the environment both ozone (O 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) are present as <b>oxidising</b> <b>gases,</b> which causes sampling artefacts when using Tenax TA as an adsorbent to sample organic compounds in the air. A scrubber {{was developed to}} remove O 3 and NO 2 prior to the sampling tube, and artefacts during sampling were minimised when using the scrubber. The main organic compounds sampled in this thesis were two monoterpenes, alfa-pinene and delta- 3 -carene, due to their presence in both indoor and outdoor air. The recovery of the monoterpenes through the scrubber varied between 75 - 97 % at relative humidities of 15 - 75 %. The reactions of alfa-pinene and delta- 3 -carene with O 3, NO 2 and nitric oxide (NO) at different relative humidities (RHs) and reaction times were studied in a dark reaction chamber. The experiments were planned and performed according to an experimental design were the factors influencing the reaction (O 3, NO 2, NO, RH and reaction times) were varied {{between high and low}} levels. In the experiments up to 13 % of the monoterpenes reacted when O 3, NO 2, and reaction time were at high levels, and NO, and RH were at low levels. In the evaluation eight and seven factors (including both single and interaction factors) were found to influence the amount of alfa-pinene and delta- 3 -carene reacted, respectively. The three most influencing factors for both of the monoterpenes were the O 3 level, the reaction time, and the RH. Increased O 3 level and reaction time increased the amount of monoterpene reacted, and increased RH decreased the amount reacted. A theoretical model of the reactions occurring in the reaction chamber was created. The amount of monoterpene reacted at different initial settings of O 3, NO 2, and NO were calculated, as well as the influence of different reaction pathways, and the concentrations of O 3 and NO 2, and NO at specific reaction times. The results of the theoretical model were that the reactivity of the gas mixture towards alfa-pinene and delta- 3 -carene was underestimated. But, the calculated concentrations of O 3, NO 2, and NO in the theoretical model were found to correspond to a high degree with experimental results performed under similar conditions. The possible associations between organic compounds in indoor air, building variables and the presence of sick building syndrome were studied using principal component analysis. The most complex model was able to separate 71 % of the “sick” buildings from the “healthy” buildings. The most important variables that separated the “sick” buildings from the “healthy” buildings were a more frequent occurrence or a higher concentration of compounds with shorter retention times in the “sick” buildings. The outcome of this thesis could be summarised as follows; - - -...|$|R

40|$|This work investigates high {{temperature}} interactions of silicon and ferrosilicon alloys with graphite {{as well as}} the reactions occurring in the presence of <b>oxidising</b> <b>gases.</b> These reactions {{play a key role in}} the scrap-melting cupola process. Using the sessile droplet method, the dynamic wetting of synthetic graphite by liquid ferrosilicon alloys containing 24. 7 and 74 %Si and silicon (98. 5 % Si) at 1550 °C was investigated. Silicon 98. 5 % and ferrosilicon alloys containing 74 and 24. 7 % Si showed good wetting behaviour (&# 952; < 90 º) with synthetic graphite at 1550 °C. Full wetting was observed for silicon 98. 5 and ferrosilicon 74 within the first 90 seconds. However, the final contact angle value appeared higher for the low-silicon ferroalloy and remained steady around 70 degrees during the 2 hours-run. The role of the interfacial product formed and its relationship with the dynamic wetting phenomena was also investigated. The formation of SiC at the interface appeared 30 seconds after melting for Si 98. 5, while this was observed after 60 seconds for FeSi 74, and after 30 minutes for FeSi 24. 7. Further wettability investigations carried out on SiC substrates showed trends similar to the ones observed on synthetic graphite. Full wetting was observed for Si 98. 5 and FeSi 74 after 80 and 90 seconds, while FeSi 24. 7 showed a different pattern, since the contact angle decreased rapidly during the first 10 minutes and remained steady around 40 degrees after that time. The dynamic wetting appeared to be strongly dependent on the rate of formation of SiC at the ferrosilicon-graphite interface. A kinetic mechanism has been developed for the carbon dissolution phenomena in ferrosilicon alloys. The overall rate constants at 1550 °C for Si 98. 5, FeSi 74 and FeSi 24. 7 were determined to be 3. 8, 3 and 3. 9 x 10 - 3 (s- 1) respectively. These did not vary significantly across samples under investigation. A rapid increase of carbon pickup was observed during the initial few minutes and remained fairly constant later on. The faster rate observed in the case of FeSi 24. 7 was explained on the basis of delayed formation of SiC interfacial product which had a retarding effect on the overall process and dictated carbon transfer. In depth and detailed investigations were carried out on the effect of the alloy composition, oxygen partial pressure and flow rate on interactions at 1550 °C. Significant differences were observed in the weight gain and carbon loss between these three alloys; both decarburisation and silicon oxidation reactions were found to occur simultaneously. There was a clear evidence for two rate regimes: the rate of decarburisation was found to be much higher during the initial 2 minutes and a much slower rate was observed in later stages for all specimens. These rate regimes were explained in terms of the extent of surface coverage with the reaction product silica. No significant effect was found on the decarburization rates when the proportion of oxidizing gas (CO 2) was increased from 20 to 100 %, indicating that mass transfer in the gas phase was not a dominant rate controlling step compared to chemicalkinetics. The net weight gain in these alloys was found to be due to the combined influence of decarburization (weight loss due to the generation of a gaseous product) and silicon oxidation (weight gain due to silica formation on the sample surface). The results of this investigation showed that the silicon losses in the cupola process can be better managed by using lower grade ferrosilicon alloys as well as an adequate air blowing regime...|$|R
