VANISH started as a stain removing bar laundry product produced about 1983 by a small Scottish company called Projectina Co Ltd established by Robert G Macfarlane in Skelmorlie, Scotland. The brand was soon acquired by Ecolab in 1986 and became a Benckiser brand in 1987 when the latter acquired Ecolab’s consumer goods operations. Benckiser N.V. merged with Reckitt & Colman PLC in 1999 to form Reckitt Benckiser PLC.

Under the Constitution alone, it is imperative that the State promotes the people's right to health (Article II, Section 15), and right to a balanced and healthful ecology (Article II, Section 16). Other laws that may be violated include Republic Act No. 6969 (Toxic Substance and Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Act of 1990) which prohibits the entry of hazardous wastes into and their disposal within the country for whatever purpose, and Republic Act No. 4653 (An Act to Safeguard the Health of the People and Maintain the Dignity of the Nation by Declaring it a National Policy to Prohibit the Commercial Importation of Textile Articles Commonly Known as Used Clothing and Rags) wherein worn clothing and other worn articles, used or new rags, scrap twine, cordage, rope and cables and worn out articles of twine, cordage, rope or cables, <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> are also prohibited from being imported into the Philippines. Aside from local laws, one international treaty is also said to be a direct contradiction to the JPEPA. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was ratified in 1989 by 133 countries and is currently adopted by 170 countries, including Japan and the Philippines. It is the most comprehensive global environmental treaty on hazardous and other wastes, addressing cleaner production, hazardous waste minimization and controls on the movement of these wastes. One of the main concerns regarding JPEPA is the possibility of having Japan export their waste products and hazardous materials to the Philippines. Such products are included in Article 29 of the agreement, which defines [...] "originating goods.

Some program elements include development <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> preforms, processing science, mechanics of materials, experimental characterization of materials, and development and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>textile</b> reinforced composite structural elements and subcomponents. Textile 3 -D weaving, 3 -D braiding, and knitting and/or stitching are being compared with conventional laminated tape processes for improved damage tolerance.
