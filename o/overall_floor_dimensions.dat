40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{economics}} planning of super tall office buildings in Asia Pacific cities. This study is based on the case study of the Asia Pacific’s 10 tallest buildings which are distributed over six major cities. All are landmark buildings with similar functions. From the analysis of the collected data, the floor plate of these buildings is comparatively large, thus achieving a fairly high lettable to gross floor ratio of about 80 % and low wall to floor area ratio of about 0. 33. The most common lease span is approximately 12 m with column-free between its service core and exterior window. The most common floor-to-floor height is about 4. 0 m. Square or similar plan is the most common geometry in super tall buildings since this geometry offers the same stiffness in both directions against lateral wind forces. Typically the building is in form of a large podium at lower levels with a setback in the <b>overall</b> <b>floor</b> plan <b>dimension</b> in the main tower and a slightly tapered shape at its top floors. The central core approach in which the core is designed as a structural element to provide stability is commonly used in super tall buildings. By using slip-form or jump-form techniques, a 3 to 4 -day cycle is achievable for core wall construction which is similar to stee...|$|R

5000|$|Hollow-core {{is a type}} of precast, {{prestressed}} concrete floor slab. It is often used in construction of multi-storey buildings. The advantages it has over cast-in-place concrete floor are that it is lighter in weight and often cheaper. Also, wet concrete needs to be pumped or carried up to higher floors. The slabs which are manufactured off site are simply lifted with a crane and set in place. Disadvantages are an increased <b>overall</b> <b>floor</b> thickness (due to the requirement of steel supporting beams), the cost of a steel frame over the cost of concrete columns and increased cranage requirements.|$|R

This is termed a ‘bubble-reinforcement’ sandwich, which is then cast into bottom layer of 60 mm pre-cast concrete, encasing the bottom mesh reinforcement, to provide permanent formwork within part of the overall finished slab depth.|$|R
