5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946.

5|$|Controversy exists {{over the}} Falklands' {{discovery}} and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements.

With a long history of Arab rule dating back to 1698, Zanzibar was an <b>overseas</b> <b>territory</b> of Oman until it achieved independence in 1858 under its own Sultanate. In 1890 during Ali ibn Sa'id's reign, Zanzibar became a British protectorate, and although never formally under direct rule was considered part of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain.

After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of <b>overseas</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E

5|$|Of the season's {{fourteen}} tropical cyclones, thirteen {{became a}} tropical storm, and six of those strengthened into a hurricane. With no major hurricanes {{occurring in the}} following year, 1901 and 1902 were {{the first time that}} two consecutive seasons lacked a major hurricane since 1864 and 1865. The fourth and eighth systems were the deadliest and most damaging storms of season. The fourth storm, known as the Louisiana hurricane, which left about $1million (1901USD) in damage and 10-15fatalities in Louisiana. In September, the eighth cyclone impacted some islands of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, including Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Cuba.

By 1833, however, the islands were under full British control. The South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain James Cook for George III in January 1775, and from 1843 were {{governed by the}} British Crown-in-Council through the Falkland Islands, an arrangement that stood until the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were incorporated as a distinct British <b>overseas</b> <b>territory</b> in 1985.
