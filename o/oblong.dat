5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these are roughly <b>oblong</b> in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split longitudinally {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|B.sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that {{encompasses}} the type material of the species. This {{is the most}} widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland as far as Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (wedge-shaped) or <b>oblong,</b> and are usually two to three centimetres long but may reach five.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is <b>oblong,</b> even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E

5|$|One {{potentially}} distinguishing {{character is}} {{the shape of}} the ultimate segments in the middle part of the leaf blade, which are <b>oblong</b> in A.pedatum and long-triangular or reniform (kidney-shaped) in A.viridimontanum and some specimens of A.aleuticum. Furthermore, A.viridimontanum can grow in both shade and sun, while A.pedatum grows in shade only.|$|E
5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus is {{very similar}} to P.nevadensis in {{external}} appearance, and the two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has <b>oblong</b> spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E
5|$|Spores are {{elliptical}} or <b>oblong</b> in shape, smooth, inamyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of 3.5–4.5 by 1.5–2.5 µm. The use of {{scanning electron microscopy}} has revealed that L.periphragmoides (in addition to several other Phallales species) has a hilar scar—a small indentation in {{the surface of the}} spore where it was previously connected to the basidium via the sterigma.|$|E

5|$|Spores of Hydnellum {{are almost}} spherical to <b>oblong</b> and tuberculate, and are brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are {{narrowly}} club-shaped and usually four-spored; {{there are no}} cystidia in Hydnellum. Three types of hyphae {{are found in the}} flesh of Hydnellum: generative hyphae (thin-walled, not inflated); skeletal hyphae (thick-walled and narrow); and thin-walled gloeoplerous-like hyphae, which stain with methyl blue.|$|E
5|$|The Inner Court is {{separated}} from the Outer Court by an <b>oblong</b> courtyard lying orthogonal to the City's main axis. It was {{the home of the}} Emperor and his family.

5|$|The {{bright green}} {{cotyledon}} {{leaves of the}} seedlings are <b>oblong</b> to linear in shape and measure 1.5cm (0.6in) long by 0.3cm (0.1in) wide. The greenish red hypocotyl is hairy, as are the stems of young plants. The hairy seedling leaves are crowded and oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7–1.3cm (0.2–0.5in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within {{their first year of}} life.|$|E

5|$|The huge, vaulted lid of N. rajah, {{the largest}} in the genus, is another {{distinguishing}} characteristic of this species.

5|$|The {{spore print}} is olive to olive-brown. The smooth spores are {{somewhat}} <b>oblong</b> to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} faces of the tubes) are fuse-shaped and ventricose, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14µm.|$|E
5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This <b>oblong</b> spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way, and therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 the Westray Wife, a lozenge-shaped figurine that is {{believed}} to be the earliest representation of a human face found in Scotland, was discovered at the site of a Neolithic village at Links of Noltland near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray. The figurine's face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an <b>oblong</b> nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing. Two figurines were subsequently found at the site in 2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are a deep reddish purple-brown color. The {{use of a}} light {{microscope}} can reveal further details: the spores are <b>oblong</b> when seen in side view, and <b>oblong</b> to oval in frontal view, with dimensions of 10.5–15 by 6.5–8.5μm. The basidia (spore bearing cells of the hymenium), are 20–31 by 5–9μm, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases; there are no basidia found on the sterile gill edge. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 15–30 by 4–7μm, and are flask-shaped with long thin necks that are 1–3.5μm wide. P.semilanceata does not have pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The cap cuticle is up to 90μm thick, and is made of a tissue layer called an —a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising the ixocutis are cylindrical, hyaline, and 1–3.5μm wide. Immediately under the cap cuticle is the subpellis, made of hyphae that are 4–12μm wide with yellowish-brown encrusted walls. There are clamp connections present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E

5|$|The Brazil Parure {{is one of}} {{the newest}} items of {{jewellery}} in the collection. In 1953, the president and people of Brazil presented Elizabeth II with the coronation gift of a necklace and matching pendant earrings of aquamarines and diamonds. It had taken the jewellers Mappin & Webb an entire year to collect the perfectly matched stones. The necklace has nine large <b>oblong</b> aquamarines with an even bigger aquamarine pendant drop. The Queen had the drop set in a more decorative diamond cluster and it is now detachable. She was so delighted with the gift that in 1957 she had a tiara made to match the necklace. The tiara is surmounted by three vertically set aquamarines. Seeing that the Queen had so liked the original Coronation gift that she had a matching tiara made, the Government of Brazil decided to add to its gift, and in 1958 it presented Elizabeth II with a bracelet of <b>oblong</b> aquamarines set in a cluster of diamonds, and a square aquamarine and diamond brooch.|$|E
5|$|The egg is {{generally}} <b>oblong,</b> slightly curved and tapering at one end. In {{the case of}} solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows. The nest varies from {{a hole in the}} ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} Coeffin Castle {{stand on the}} summit of a rocky {{promontory}} on the coast west of Clachan.
