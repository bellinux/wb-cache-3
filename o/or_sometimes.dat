5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 <b>or</b> <b>sometimes</b> 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, <b>or</b> <b>sometimes</b> 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E

5|$|Isolated vacancy is {{the most}} studied defect in diamond, both {{experimentally}} and theoretically. Its most important practical property is optical absorption, like in the color centers, which gives diamond green, <b>or</b> <b>sometimes</b> even green–blue color (in pure diamond).

5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, <b>or</b> <b>sometimes</b> with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E

5|$|In other tables, {{lutetium}} and lawrencium {{are classified}} as the remaining members of group 3. In these tables, lutetium and lawrencium end (<b>or</b> <b>sometimes</b> succeed) the lanthanide and actinide series, respectively. Since the f-shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals, they behave most similarly to other period 6 and period 7 transition metals {{compared to the other}} lanthanides and actinides, and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of scandium and yttrium. However, this resemblance in not unique to lutetium and lawrencium, but is common among all the late lanthanides and actinides.|$|E
