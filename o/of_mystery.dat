5|$|In {{a review}} {{of the history of the}} Moberly-Jourdain {{adventure}} and the extensive public reaction to it, Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women.

5|$|The {{culture and}} monuments of ancient Egypt {{have left a}} lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Roman Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome. The Romans also {{imported}} building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place <b>of</b> <b>mystery.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept <b>of</b> <b>mystery.</b> He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if there is an element <b>of</b> <b>mystery</b> to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Usher {{began dating}} TLC member Chilli Thomas, and their {{relationship}} lasted for two years. In 2003, Usher started working on the album which would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air <b>of</b> <b>mystery</b> about Usher, and arouse fans' curiosity about {{how much of the}} infidelity story was Usher's own confession. The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about Usher. They broke up in December 2003.|$|E

5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their connection with the afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system <b>of</b> <b>mystery</b> initiations.|$|E
5|$|The Act II {{illustration}} from Les Beautés shows a {{dark wood}} {{with a pool}} of water in the distance. The branches of aged trees create a tree tunnel. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with 'Giselle' carved on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood <b>of</b> <b>mystery</b> and terror.|$|E
5|$|Ba Cụt {{was born}} circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An aura <b>of</b> <b>mystery</b> surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.|$|E
