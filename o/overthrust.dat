25|$|Some 60 {{million years}} ago, these forces uplifted the low-lying coastal plain in the Teton region {{and created the}} north-south-trending thrust faults of the nearby Wyoming <b>Overthrust</b> Belt. Uplift {{intensified}} and climaxed a few million years later early in the Eocene epoch when large thrust and reverse faults created small mountain ranges separated by subsiding sedimentary basins. One of the reverse faults, the north-south trending 10 mile (16km) long Buck Mountain Fault, elevated what is today {{the central part of}} the Teton Range.|$|E
500|$|The rocks {{found in}} the park are {{primarily}} sedimentary rocks of the Belt Supergroup. They were deposited in shallow seas over 1.6billion to 800million years ago. During {{the formation of the}} Rocky Mountains 170million years ago, one region of rocks now known as the Lewis <b>Overthrust</b> was forced eastward [...] This <b>overthrust</b> was several miles (kilometers) thick and hundreds of miles (kilometers) long. This resulted in older rocks being displaced over newer ones, so the overlying Proterozoic rocks are between 1.4 and 1.5billion years older than Cretaceous age rocks they now rest on.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} evidences of this <b>overthrust</b> is visible in the form of Chief Mountain, an isolated peak {{on the edge of the}} eastern boundary of the park rising [...] above the Great Plains. There are six mountains in the park over [...] in elevation, with Mount Cleveland at [...] being the tallest. Appropriately named Triple Divide Peak sends waters towards the Pacific Ocean, Hudson Bay, and Gulf of Mexico watersheds. This peak can effectively be considered to be the apex of the North American continent, although the mountain is only [...] above sea level.|$|E
5000|$|As {{an ocean}} is {{progressively}} trapped in between two colliding continental lithospheres, the rising wedges of oceanic crust and mantle rise {{are caught in}} the jaws of the continent/continent vise and detach and begin to move up the advancing continental rise. Continued convergence may lead to the <b>overthrusting</b> of the arc-trench gap and eventually <b>overthrusting</b> of the metamorphic plutonic and volcanic rocks of the volcanic arc.|$|R

50|$|Finger rafting {{develops}} in an ice cover {{as a result}} of a compression regime established within the plane of the ice. As two expanses of sea ice converge toward another, one of them slides smoothly on top of the other (it is <b>overthrusted)</b> along a given distance, resulting in a local increase in ice thickness. The term finger rafting refers to the systematic alternation of interlocking <b>overthrusts</b> and underthrusts involved in this process. Such a pattern derives its name from its resemblance to the interlocking of fingers.|$|R
500|$|Climbing {{is popular}} in Glacier Park. Due to the Lewis <b>Overthrust</b> Fault, the rock quality in Glacier is old and loose. Despite this, Glacier Park attracts many climbers. The seminal {{literature}} on climbing in Glacier Park, A Climber's Guide to Glacier National Park, {{was written by}} J. Gordon Edwards in 1961, with the latest edition published in 1995. Climbing has increased in popularity recently {{with the publication of}} the [...] "Climb Glacier National Park" [...] series, which provides detailed route descriptions for many major peaks around the park. [...] The [...] sponsors climbing in Glacier Park, and issues awards for those climbers who summit all 10,000 foot peaks in the park or all 6 [...] "Technical" [...] peaks.|$|E
500|$|The {{mountains}} of Glacier National Park began forming [...] {{years ago when}} ancient rocks were forced eastward up and over much younger rock strata. Known as the Lewis <b>Overthrust,</b> these sedimentary rocks are considered {{to have some of}} the finest examples of early life fossils on Earth. The current shapes of the Lewis and Livingston mountain ranges and positioning and size of the lakes show the telltale evidence of massive glacial action, which carved U-shaped valleys and left behind moraines which impounded water, creating lakes. Of the estimated 150 glaciers which existed in the park in the mid-19th century, only 25 active glaciers remained by 2010. Scientists studying the glaciers in the park have estimated that all the glaciers may disappear by 2030 if current climate patterns persist.|$|E
2500|$|Peridotite is the {{dominant}} rock of the Earth's mantle above a depth of about 400km; below that depth, olivine is converted to the higher-pressure mineral wadsleyite. Oceanic plates consist of up to about 100km of peridotite covered by a thin crust; the crust, commonly about 6km thick, consists of basalt, gabbro, and minor sediments. The peridotite below the ocean crust, [...] "abyssal peridotite," [...] is found {{on the walls of}} rifts in the deep sea floor. Oceanic plates are usually subducted back into the mantle in subduction zones. However, pieces can be emplaced into or <b>overthrust</b> on continental crust by a process called obduction, rather than carried down into the mantle; the emplacement may occur during orogenies, as during collisions of one continent with another or with an island arc. The pieces of oceanic plates emplaced within continental crust are referred to as ophiolites; typical ophiolites consist mostly of peridotite plus associated rocks such as gabbro, pillow basalt, diabase sill-and-dike complexes, and red chert. Other masses of peridotite have been emplaced into mountain belts as solid masses but {{do not appear to be}} related to ophiolites, and they have been called [...] "orogenic peridotite massifs" [...] and [...] "alpine peridotites." [...] Peridotites also occur as fragments (xenoliths) carried up by magmas from the mantle. Among the rocks that commonly include peridotite xenoliths are basalt and kimberlite. Certain volcanic rocks, sometimes called komatiites, are so rich in olivine and pyroxene that they also can be termed peridotite. Small pieces of peridotite have even been found in lunar breccias.|$|E
