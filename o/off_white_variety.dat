The mean number of canes per vine and shoot length was higher for red <b>varieties</b> than <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> with more variation for cane diameter. Red varieties have also produced longer shoots than <b>white</b> <b>varieties.</b> Vigorous varieties such Chenin Blanc and Shiraz have produced comparatively shorter shoots than less vigorous <b>varieties.</b> <b>White</b> grape <b>varieties</b> have recorded more number of leaves (16. 96) in comparison to red varieties (16. 64) [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the purple}} and <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> of the Java tea plant could be mistakenly considered {{the same if}} both varieties were not examined properly. The collection of 14 samples of java tea from the various locations in Indonesia and Malaysia showed that the Java tea varieties were distinguishable by the characteristic of colour of corolla and calyx, leaf shape and the colour of stem. The purple varieties had purple tint on the corolla and calyx. The <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> had <b>white</b> corolla and the calyx colour was green. Generally, the <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> produce rhomboid shape leaves with both acute and acuminate apex, the leaf base is either cuneate or narrowly cuneaete. The purple varieties produce ovate shaped leaves with acute leaf tip and an obtuse leaf base. Even though both Indonesia and Malaysia <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> look the same at first sight, the difference was observed in the colour of stem, stamen and calyx. The colour of stem, and calyx were green for the Malaysia varieties while the colour of stern and calyx were purple, slightly green for the Indonesia varieties. The stamen of the <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> from Indonesia had a bright clear purple tint. While the stamen of the <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> from Malaysia had a slight purple, almost white colouration. Other than that, leaf size of the Malaysia varieties were smaller compared to the Indonesia varieties. Also, there were two <b>white</b> java tea <b>varieties</b> W 14 (Perumnas) and WM 2 (Perak) that had ovate shape leaves similar to the leaf shape of the purple varieties. The external morphological characteristics of the purple variety from both Indonesia and Malaysia were the same. That is no variations were observed in terms of colour of flower, leaf shape and colour of stem...|$|R
