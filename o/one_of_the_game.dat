5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend was {{conceived}} by Nobuyuki Hoshino and developed under director Akitoshi Kawazu; renowned composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote its score. The game is Square's first million seller with 1.37million units shipped. Though released to mixed reception, {{it has since}} been described as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> Boy's greatest games and cited as an influence for series such as the Pokémon franchise.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of the Browns drafting Clifford Charlton and Junkin's desire to move back inside, the Browns planned to move him back to inside linebacker for the 1988 season. He spent training camp competing with Eddie Johnson for the second inside linebacker position alongside Mike Johnson, {{and by the end of}} preseason play, Junkin had won the starting job. In his first career start against the Kansas City Chiefs, Junkin had six tackles, including the first <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in a 6–3 Browns win. A month later, Junkin injured his knee, and was forced to miss several games. He returned to the team in early November, but Johnson had played so well in Junkin's absence that he spent the next few weeks as the backup inside linebacker. He was given the starting job again to end the season, but missed tackles and a lack of impact plays led to his second season being considered a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 2016, Costa {{scored a}} late winner against West Ham United to give Chelsea a 2–1 win in their season opener. During the match, he caught {{opposing}} goalkeeper Adrián with a late challenge when already on a yellow card, {{but did not}} receive a second yellow {{and went on to}} score the winner; Adrián stated after the match that he was fortunate not to be seriously injured. On 15 October, he scored in a 3–0 over reigning Premier League champions Leicester City, and on 20 November Costa became the first player to reach ten league goals for the season, with the only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> at Middlesbrough. With two goals and two assists for league leaders Chelsea, he was voted Premier League Player of the Month {{for the second time in}} November 2016, with his manager Antonio Conte picking up the equivalent.|$|E

5|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals paired United with Porto, against {{whom they had}} played in the first {{knockout}} round of the 2003–04 competition. The draw also determined the semi-final pairings, with United or Porto drawn to play against Arsenal or Villarreal. The first leg of the quarter-final was played at Old Trafford, giving Porto the chance to put the pressure on Manchester United with an away goal. That away goal came in the fourth minute of the game, but Wayne Rooney equalised tenminutes later and Carlos Tevez gave United {{the lead in the}} 85thminute. However, with only oneminute left in the game, United suffered a defensive lapse, allowing Mariano González to score Porto's second away goal. Those away goals meant that United travelled to the Estádio do Dragão in Porto needing a win or a score-draw of 2–2 or higher to remain in the competition. A 40-yard goal from Ronaldo in the sixthminute put United into the lead, and although both sides pressed for another goal, it proved to be the only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> making Manchester United the first English side to win in Porto.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E

500|$|When {{development}} {{began in}} 2011, {{only a few}} core staff members {{were working on the}} game, forming a skeleton team. At this time, Yamazaki said that the player should be able to use emotions and analytical psychology to reach the truth, in addition to using evidence: he thought that previous Ace Attorney games had only focused on evidence versus statements, and wanted to introduce a third element. Natsuki Ikawa, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> designers, read books on psychology and talked to the other staff members about what to do. She wrote down several ideas for how to handle it, including goggles that show the witness's personality as a specter, or a large computer that analyzes brain waves and heart rates, and showed them to Yamazaki, who would say [...] "that's a pretty nifty idea" [...] but still reject them; this contradiction between what he said and what he felt made Ikawa realize the basic concept for the mood matrix system, which was revised through feedback from everyone on the team and was implemented in the game. Another game designer, Yoriki Daigo, worked on several new features, including making the player able to move between locations freely and designing the revisualization system. Because the game was built from the ground up, the user interface for investigation sections was overhauled completely to be more visually appealing. The developers tried to keep the game simple, keeping it in line with Takumi's original vision of a game simple enough for his mother to play.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Federal Communications Commission v. American Broadcasting Co., Inc. 347 U.S. 284, that quiz shows {{were not a}} form of gambling; this {{paved the way for}} their {{introduction}} to television. The prizes of these new shows were unprecedented. The $64,000 Question became the first big-money television quiz show during the 1950s. In 1955, Joyce Brothers first earned fame by becoming the first woman to earn the $64,000 prize. It was revealed later that the show was [...] "controlled"; the producers did not want her to win and deliberately gave her questions perceived to be beyond her ability, which she answered correctly anyway. The $64,000 Question was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> shows ultimately implicated to be fixed in some fashion.|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{of using}} tears {{in the fabric of}} space-time was {{influenced}} by a similar story decision in BioShock. With Rapture set in the 1960, the Irrational team had looked to the scientific progress of James D. Watson and Francis Crick towards understanding DNA in 1953, and built the idea of ADAM and gene modification. For Infinite, the same concept was used with the development of quantum theory by Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and Werner Heisenberg that would later bore out in the Many Worlds Theory. Incorporating the use of tears was a challenge from the story standpoint but one that Levine enjoyed, noting that this leads to the impression of Booker being an unreliable narrator for the events of the game. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> demonstrations showed Elizabeth accidentally opening a tear into a 1980s setting after trying to revive a fallen horse. This setting was in contrast to their initial idea, a woodland glade, which Levine felt wasn't [...] "striking or different enough" [...] than the rest of Columbia. Instead, they borrowed assets from a previous project that, according to lead artist Shawn Robertson, Irrational was [...] "literally about to throw away", finding the contrast and abrupt differences from the Columbia setting helped to emphasize the use of tears in the game. In regards to the ending, Levine has stated that the ending of Infinite is [...] "like nothing you've experienced in a video game before"; the story purposely avoids a problem that arose from the original BioShock in which, after the death of Andrew Ryan before the last third of the game, [...] "the story loses some of its steam".|$|E
