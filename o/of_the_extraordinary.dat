5|$|The first Nobel Prize in Physics {{was awarded}} to {{physicist}} Wilhelm Röntgen in recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extraordinary</b> services he has rendered by {{the discovery of the}} remarkable rays (or x-rays). This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physics. It is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Through 2017, a total of 206 individuals have been awarded the prize.|$|E
5|$|Tofu: Although both popular {{tradition}} and Song Dynasty philosophers like Zhu Xi (1130–1200 AD) credit {{the invention of}} tofu—along with soymilk— to Liu An (179–122 BC), a Han-Dynasty King of Huainan, no mention of tofu {{is found in the}} extant Huainanzi (compiled under Liu An). The earliest known mention of tofu was made in Records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> (Qingyi lu 清異錄), which reported that tofu was sold at Qingyang (Anhui). The earliest explanation of how to make tofu is found in the Bencao Gangmu, written by the Ming dynasty polymath Li Shizhen (1518–1593). According to Liu Keshun (1999), Liu An's process for making tofu was essentially the same as today.|$|E

25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1918, as {{consolidation}} of the political situation of the republic continued, a move toward elimination of Uyezd-, Raion-, and Volost-level Chekas, {{as well as the}} institution of Extraordinary Commissions was considered.

On January 16 the presidium of VCheKa approved the draft on the establishment of the Politburo at Uyezd militsiya. This decision was approved by the Conference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> Commission IV, held in early February 1920.|$|E
25|$|In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus, aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{accuracy}} {{with which}} Babylonian astronomers could predict the planets' motions, insisted that Greek astronomers achieve similar levels of accuracy.

For the Sun, he used a simple eccentric model, based on observations of the equinoxes, which explained both changes in {{the speed of the}} Sun and differences in the lengths of the seasons. For the Moon, he used a deferent and epicycle model. He could not create accurate models for the remaining planets, and criticized other Greek astronomers for creating inaccurate models.|$|E

25|$|During Venetian rule, the Corfiotes {{developed}} a fervent appreciation of Italian opera, {{which was the}} real source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extraordinary</b> (given conditions in the mainland of Greece) musical development of the island during that era. The opera house of Corfu during 18th and 19th centuries {{was that of the}} Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo, named after the neighbouring Catholic cathedral, but the theatre was later converted into the Town Hall. A long series of local composers, such as Antonio Liberali (a son of an Italian bandmaster of the British Army, who later translated his surname to 'Eleftheriadis'), Domenico Padovani (whose family has been in Corfu since the 16th century) or Spyridon Xyndas contributed to the fame of the Teatro di San Giacomo.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian subcontinent, tigers inhabit {{tropical}} moist evergreen forests, {{tropical dry}} forests, tropical and subtropical moist deciduous forests, mangroves, subtropical and temperate upland forests, and alluvial grasslands. Latter habitat once covered a huge swath of grassland, riverine and moist semi-deciduous forests along the major river {{system of the}} Gangetic and Brahmaputra plains, but has now been largely converted to agricultural land or severely degraded. Today, {{the best examples of}} this habitat type are limited to a few blocks {{at the base of the}} outer foothills of the Himalayas including the Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs) Rajaji-Corbett, Bardia-Banke, and the transboundary TCUs Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki, Dudhwa-Kailali and Shuklaphanta-Kishanpur. Tiger densities in these TCUs are high, in part because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extraordinary</b> biomass of ungulate prey.|$|E
25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no {{as if there were}} no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extraordinary</b> ray, to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which remains fixed.|$|E

The opera house of Corfu during 18th and 19th century was the Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo, named after the neighbouring Catholic cathedral; it was later converted into the City Hall. It was both the first theatre and first opera house of Greece in modern times and {{the place where the}} first Greek opera (based on an exclusively Greek libretto), Spyridon Xyndas' The Parliamentary Candidate was performed. A long series of local composers, such as Nikolaos Mantzaros, Spyridon Xyndas, Antonio Liberali, Domenico Padovani, the Zakynthian Pavlos Carrer, the Lambelet family, Spyridon Samaras, and others, all developed careers intertwined with the theatre. San Giacomo's place was taken by the Municipal Theatre in 1902, which maintained the operatic tradition vividly until its destruction during German air raid in 1943.|$|E
25|$|All {{results of}} its activities, VCheKa had either to {{transfer}} to the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal or to dismiss a case. The control of the commission's activity {{was provided by the}} People's Commissariat for Justice (Narkomjust, at that time headed by Isidor Steinberg) and Internal Affairs (NKVD, at that time headed by Hryhoriy Petrovsky). Although the VCheKa was officially an independent organization from the NKVD, its main members such as Dzerzhinsky, Latsis, Unszlicht, and Uritsky (all main chekists), since November 1917 composed the collegiate of NKVD headed by Petrovsky. In November 1918, Petrovsky was appointed {{as the head of the}} All-Ukrainian Central Military Revolutionary Committee during VCheKa's expansion to provinces and front-lines. At the time of political competition between Bolsheviks and SRs (January 1918), Left SRs attempted to curb the rights of VCheKa and establish through the Narkomiust its control over its work. Having failed in attempts to subordinate the VCheKa to Narkomiust, the Left SRs were to seek control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Extraordinary</b> Commission in a different way. They requested that the Central Committee of the party was granted the right to directly enter their representatives into the VCheKa. Sovnarkom recognized the desirability of including five representatives of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary faction of VTsIK. Left SRs were granted the post of a companion (deputy) chairman of VCheKa. However, Sovnarkom, in which the majority belonged to the representatives of RSDLP(b) retained the right to approve members of the collegium of the VCheKa.|$|E
