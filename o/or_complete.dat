5|$|But {{theories}} of either complete independence of <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> {{dependence on the}} synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, elements such as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and the prologue on the Logos, are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.|$|E

5|$|From 1944 the Operational Holding Commando Headquarters was formed. It was {{responsible}} for two subâ€“units: the Army and Royal Marines Holding Commando Wings. Both units had an establishment of five troops and a heavy weapons troop of fully trained commandos. The men in these troops were to provide individual <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> troop replacements for the Commando units in the field. In December 1944, the four Special Service brigades were re-designated as Commando brigades.|$|E
5|$|Many critics {{repeatedly}} {{asserted that}} she was calling {{for the elimination of}} all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction. The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> loss of sensation. Neuropathic pain, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain {{in the absence of}} any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and interferes with sex.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way <b>or</b> <b>complete,</b> particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E

5|$|Asellus, {{formerly}} a human girl, was {{run over by}} a carriage and given a blood transfusion by the Mystic Lord Orlouge. Chosen as the Charm Lord's heir, she is despised by human and mystic alike due to her status as the only half-Mystic in existence. She escapes Orlouge's castle {{with the help of the}} Princess White Rose. Asellus and White Rose remain on the run from Orlouge's many servants, but after White Rose sacrifices herself to save Asellus's life and freedom, Asellus decides to return and defeat Orlouge, to end the struggle once and for all. Depending on the actions the player does, there are three endings, in which she end live on as a human, half Mystic, <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> Mystic.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|Housed in the Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center, Willamette's College of Law offers both {{full-time}} and part-time enrollment {{for the doctor}} of jurisprudence (JD) degree, joint-degree programs, and a Master of Laws (LLM) program. The joint-degree programs allow students to earn both a JD and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) concurrently in a four-year program, <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> a bachelor's degree and JD in six years. Willamette Law's oldest legal journal is the Willamette Law Review, which started in 1960 and is housed in the Oregon Civic Justice Center. The center is a community outreach center located in a renovated library that Willamette opened in 2008. According to Willamette's 2016 ABA-required disclosures, 52.63% of the Class of 2016 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.

5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart is a kart racing game {{featuring}} several {{single and}} multiplayer modes. During the game, players {{take control of}} one of eight Mario franchise characters and drive karts around tracks with a Mario franchise theme. In {{order for them to}} begin driving, Lakitu will appear with a traffic light hanging on his fishing pole, which starts the countdown. When the light turns green, the race or battle officially begins. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players, <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> a circuit in the fastest time. There is also a battle mode in which the aim is to attack the karts of the other human players.|$|E
5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> the peacekeeping operations in 1992â€“93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010â€“13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E

5|$|The Western Front at {{this time}} {{generally}} followed the River Rhine with two important exceptions: the American bridgehead over the Rhine at Remagen, and a large German salient west of the Rhine, the Saarâ€“Palatinate triangle. Consideration was given to evacuating the triangle, but OKW ordered it held. When Kesselring paid {{his first visit to}} the German First and Seventh Army headquarters there on 13 March 1945, the army group commander, Oberst-gruppenfÃ¼hrer Paul Hausser, and the two army commanders all affirmed the defence of the triangle could only result in heavy losses <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> annihilation of their commands. General der Infanterie Hans Felber of the Seventh Army considered the latter the most likely outcome. Nonetheless, Kesselring insisted that the positions had to be held.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the JNA barracks in Bjelovar also {{affected}} the ceasefire agreement reached between the JNA and Croatia in Igalo, specifically a provision regarding {{the lifting of the}} blockade of the JNA barracks there. Initially there was a dispute between TuÄ‘man and JNA General Veljko KadijeviÄ‡ as to whether it meant achieving normal living conditions in the barracks <b>or</b> <b>complete</b> freedom of movement for the JNA in Croatia. A compromise interpretation was negotiated, only to be dropped by KadijeviÄ‡ specifically because of the events in Bjelovar. On 1 October, KadijeviÄ‡ issued an ultimatum to Croatia threatening destruction of one civilian facility vital to the Croatian population for each military post captured by the ZNG. The ultimatum demonstrated that the JNA considered Croatia enemy territory, rather than part of the country it had a responsibility to protect.|$|E
