2500|$|Though Maywood {{officials}} {{stopped short}} of filing for bankruptcy or even giving up the city's municipal status, the city still faces a serious problem with a huge deficit. The city did keep a few employees as independent contractors when they outsourced most city functions to Bell and police duties to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In September 2010, the troubled nearby city of Bell agreed to cancel the contract to handle the day-to-day operations of neighboring Maywood. Maywood has been overrun with political crises — from recalls to a city clerk {{accused of trying to}} contract a hit man to kill Councilman Aguirre. In early 2006, a newly elected Aguirre called Maywood a [...] "sanctuary city" [...] for illegal immigrants, stating: [...] "I think we needed to amplify the debate by saying that no human being is illegal. These people are here ... making your clothes, shining your shoes and taking care <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>kids.</b> And now you want to develop this hypocritical policy?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Jim Reardon and written by Dan Greaney. Like numerous preceding episodes, [...] "My Sister, My Sitter" [...] deals with the relationship between Bart and Lisa. Greaney specializes in writing Bart and Lisa episodes {{from the perspective of}} a kid. Elaine E Sutherland, who is a member of the Law Society of Scotland's Family Law Sub-Committee and Professor of Child and Family Law at the Law School, Stirling University, used the episode to describe the potential problems of letting one <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>kids</b> babysit the rest. While one child may be mature enough to babysit, it is not certain that the other kids accept the babysitters authority. According to Alan S. Brown and Chris Logan, the writers of the book The Psychology of the Simpsons: D’oh!, the episode is an example of how feminine anger rarely solves the problem on The Simpsons. “Here, Lisa’s rage and ongoing frustration contribute to her difficulty in making good decisions about what to do with her emotion,” they write. Keeping with the babysitter theme, there are cultural references to The Baby-Sitters Club: Lisa reads book #14 - The Formula Formula, while Janey is on book #20 - The President's Baby Is Missing.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the split}} of Carissa's Wierd, Brooke helped Bridwell {{learn to play}} guitar and he also began writing songs. He formed the band 'Horses' which soon had to change its name to Band of Horses, {{following}} the discovery that a long defunct band called Horses (featuring actor Don Johnson) were issuing re-releases. Band of Horses were briefly a trio featuring Bridwell (vocals and guitar), Tim Meinig (drums) and Chris Early (bass), but former Carissa's Wierd leader Mat Brooke (guitar and vocals) {{was added to the}} line up and the quartet released their debut album Everything All the Time in March 2006. In response to Bridwell's success, Brooke said, [...] " [...] I kind of feel bad, maybe Carissa's Wierd was holding him back, all this time...(I am) extremely proud. He took the ball and ran with it. At a time when we were all down he picked himself up, higher than anyone thought he could. It's kind <b>of</b> like seeing <b>your</b> <b>kid</b> brother blossom." ...|$|R
