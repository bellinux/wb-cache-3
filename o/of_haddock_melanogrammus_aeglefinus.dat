40|$|A multinomial {{logistic}} model {{is presented as}} a tool for comparing two or more age–length keys. The model provides an objective way to fill in missing values and can be used for estimating uncertainty and visualizing age–length keys (ALKs). An example <b>of</b> <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> L.) in ICES Division VIa (West of Scotland) is used to illustrate that significant regional differences in the proportions of age classes-at-length can exist on a small spatial scale. These differences are caused by regional variation in both length-at-age and relative abundance at age. As the length-at-age data are normally not weighted by the local catch rate (abundance), the ALK of the combined age data can result in strongly biased estimates of numbers-at-age. In the present case, the use of unweighted age data would have resulted in an overestimate of recruitment of nearly 200 % and an underestimate of spawning stock biomass of 15 %. Comparing ALKs using this method has several practical applications in fisheries science.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that crude oil {{exposure}} affects cardiac development in fish by disrupting excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. We previously found that eggs <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus)</b> bind dispersed oil droplets, potentially leading to more profound toxic effects from uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Using lower concentrations of dispersed crude oil (0. 7 – 7 [*]μg/L ∑PAH), here we exposed a broader range of developmental stages over both short and prolonged durations. We quantified effects on cardiac function and morphogenesis, characterized novel craniofacial defects, and examined the expression of genes encoding potential targets underlying cardiac and craniofacial defects. Because of oil droplet binding, a 24 -hr exposure was sufficient to create severe cardiac and craniofacial abnormalities. The specific nature of the craniofacial abnormalities suggests that crude oil may target common craniofacial and cardiac precursor cells either directly or indirectly by affecting ion channels and intracellular calcium in particular. Furthermore, down-regulation of genes encoding specific components of the EC coupling machinery suggests that crude oil disrupts excitation-transcription coupling or normal feedback regulation of ion channels blocked by PAHs. These data support a unifying hypothesis whereby depletion of intracellular calcium pools by crude oil-derived PAHs disrupts several pathways critical for organogenesis in fish...|$|R

The enrichment treatments affected the fatty acid composition of the rotifers and correlated with the accumulation of these fatty acids in the haddock larvae.

This paper uses bioeconomic simulation techniques to conduct an ex-ante impact assessment of the early life stages in haddock production. Using an economic engineering methodology, early life stages are modeled by decomposing the production system into two separable production activities: the production of live feeds and juvenile fish from hatching to grow-out. Uncertainty in live feeds and haddock production is simulated using Monte Carlo techniques in order to compare alternative production technologies using stochastic dominance techniques. Overall, fifteen production technologies are analyzed. Large-scale traditional production techniques dominate the other alternatives despite being more risky. There is a seventy percent probability that haddock juveniles can be produced at the current cost of salmon fry...|$|E
40|$|Methods of {{assessment}} that depend upon commercial catch {{data can be}} undermined by misreporting or where parts of the catch, such as discards, are not accounted for. An age-structured model that makes use of survey data alone, and avoids this problem, is developed within a Bayesian framework so that routine stock summary statistics such as fishing mortality, recruitment and spawning stock biomass can be estimated with associated levels of uncertainty. It is also possible to estimate catch on a relative scale which {{can be compared to}} reported catches. The model is applied to West <b>of</b> Scotland <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus),</b> a stock with suspected high catch misreporting. Stock trends derived from the model are consistent with conventional assessments that use catch data during periods of low misreporting. Estimated proportions of fish at each age in the catch correspond closely with observed values. Model estimates of total catches suggest substantial misreporting in some years, though the precision of the estimates is very low. Revised estimates of natural mortality are obtained from the model that are higher than conventional values used for this stock. These new values are generally consistent with those obtained from multispecies predation modelling for the adjacent North Sea stock. The model provides many of the basic quantities used for management advice. It should not be regarded as a replacement for more comprehensive analyses, but an additional tool to explore available data when catch information is unreliable...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} crude oil {{pollution}} on early life stages (ELS) of fish, including larvae and embryos, has received considerable attention in recent years. Of the organic components present in crude oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are considered the main class of compounds responsible for toxic effects in marine organisms. Although evidence suggests {{that they are more}} toxic, alkylated PAHs remain much less studied than their unsubstituted congeners. Recently, it was established that embryos <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus)</b> are particularly sensitive to dispersed crude oil, and it was hypothesized that this was caused by direct interaction with crude oil droplets, which adhered to the chorion of exposed embryos. Such a phenomenon would increase the potential for uptake of less water-soluble compounds, including alkylated PAHs. In the current study, we compared the uptake of parent and alkylated PAHs in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock embryos exposed to dispersed crude oil at a range of environmentally relevant concentrations (10 - 600 μg oil/liter seawater). Although the species are biologically very similar, the cod chorion does not become fouled with oil droplets, even when the two species are exposed to dispersions {{of crude oil}} droplets under similar conditions. A close correlation between the degree of fouling and toxicological response (heart defects, craniofacial malformation) was observed. Oil droplet fouling in haddock led to both quantitative and qualitative differences in PAH uptake. Finally, kinetic data on a large suite of PAHs showed differential elimination, suggesting differential metabolism of unsubstituted versus alkylated compounds...|$|R
40|$|Length–weight {{relationships}} of fish {{are often used}} to estimate the biomass of length distributions or to obtain indices of condition. Although large-scale spatial trends are known to exist, it is often assumed that length–weight relationships do not vary significantly within stocks or between neighbouring stocks. The present study examined length–weight relationships <b>of</b> 1334 <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus)</b> and 1186 whiting (Merlangius merlangus) collected on a groundfish survey in the waters around Ireland in 2004.

The length–weight regression showed a significant area effect and no differences between the sexes. The condition indices showed a moderate spatial structure for both species: around 25 % of the variability {{could be explained by}} the location of the samples, the rest of the variability was due to other sources. Length–weight relationships did not appear to vary significantly within stocks, however differences between stocks were significant. In the present case, a bias of up to 10 % could occur in biomass estimates as a result of applying length–weight {{relationships of}} one stock to length data of a neighbouring stock.

There are large differences in the size of discarded fish between inshore and offshore areas, with offshore-operating vessels discarding larger fish (high-grading). Increases in legal landing size correspond to immediate increases in the size of discarded fish, particularly for haddock and cod in inshore areas. In general, discarding practices for haddock and cod are similar over time and consistent across gears, whereas decisions for the lesser valued whiting are more variable and can be affected by the catch composition...|$|E

40|$|Eggs and larvae {{produced}} by pairs <b>of</b> spawning <b>haddock</b> <b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> were monitored between 2001 and 2003 {{to determine the}} effects of spawning time, egg size and food supply on early life history success. Females usually released eggs at 3 d intervals. All females exhibited a continuous decrease in egg diameter and dry weight with consecutive batches, but the decrease in size did not influence fertilization or hatching success. Larval size (standard length and dry weight), yolk area, eye diameter, myotome height, and finfold area were all positively related to egg size and therefore decreased between early- and late-season larvae {{produced by}} the same spawning pairs. Differences in larval morphology persisted for at least the first 5 d after hatching. Jaws were not developed at hatching (5 °C), but jaw length did show a strong positive relationship with egg size at 5 d post-hatch (dph). The ability of newly hatched larvae to withstand periods of starvation was directly related to initial egg size. Under high prey abundance (5000 l- 1) larval survival to 20 dph was highly variable (1. 8 to 50. 7 %) with no differences in survivorship or specific growth rate (0. 818 to 0. 936 % d- 1 in standard length) for larvae from early-, middle- and late-season egg batches. With low prey density (1000 l- 1) survival of larvae from late-season egg batches was significantly lower (0. 4 %) than those from early egg batches (1. 8 %). No differences in larval specific growth rate existed between early and late batches, but growth rate was reduced in both cases with low food abundance (0. 683 to 0. 690 d- 1 in standard length). Results suggest that smaller larvae produced late in the spawning season have reduced feeding capabilities and may experience lower survivorship in the ocean than larger, early-season larvae...|$|R

We show that the recruitment metric upon which Friedland et al. base their conclusions inadvertently biases the analysis in favour of high recruitment events and against low recruitments. As a consequence, Friedland et al. disregard correlations that are, in fact, significant. Furthermore, we show that the parental condition hypothesis hinges upon a single, highly uncertain data point, without which the correlation is no longer significant.

Several types of molecular markers have been employed to assess stock structure, genetic variability, and kinship in fisheries and aquaculture.

The overall objective of this dissertation is to investigate whether microsatellite DNA fingerprinting can be employed for improved management <b>of</b> captured <b>haddock</b> broodstock and for discrimination of populations of tautog. ^ Microsatellite markers were used to assess parentage in a captive population <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus)</b> population. Two dinucleotide microsatellite markers (one specific to cod and another specific to haddock) were used in this study after an array of both cod specific and haddock specific markers were found to be non-variable in this particular population. Assignment of parentage was uncertain for many larvae samples, possibly due to null alleles, as suggested by heterozygote deficiency at both loci. The microsatellite data did lend themselves towards development of a spawning profile. ^ Tautog-specific microsatellite markers were isolated and developed to determine the stock structure of tautog (Tautog onitis) along the Atlantic coast. Four tetranucleotide microsatellite markers were used to determine genetic variability and stock structure of tautog samples from Massachusetts to Virginia. Polymorphism was low in all four markers and only one marker out of the four followed Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium at all the sampling locations. Analysis of population differentiation with this marker indicated a significant difference between northern individuals (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, and New Jersey) and those from Virginia.

Fish were fed diets containing low (0. 42 % diet), optimum (1. 02 % diet) and excess (1. 42 % diet) levels of P for 8 and 20 weeks. At the end of two experimental periods, fish were subjected to gross examination, x-rayed, and the mineral content of the plasma and the vertebrae was measured. The vertebrae were also subjected to histological, histomorphometric and enzyme histochemical examinations to determine the level of bone formation and resorption. A P-deficient diet caused a delay in bone mineralization. In contrast, excess P in the diet increased matrix deposition and resulted in accelerated mineralization. Counting the numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and measuring the mineralized bone and the non-mineralized bone suggest that P {{deficiency in}} haddock initially increases bone resorption and subsequently decreases bone mineralization followed by a decrease in bone formation. The increase of the number of osteoclasts in P-deficient animals suggests that osteoclasts could be involved in P homeostasis. In the same fish group low bone mineral and deformed bones observed on x-rays, could be the result of a decrease in mineralization of the bone matrix. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

We obtained partial small-subunit rDNA sequences of Myxobolus ‘aeglefini’ from gadoids and pleuronectids from Norway and Iceland. The sequences from gadoids and pleuronectids represented two different genotypes, showing 98. 2 % identity. Morphometric studies on the spores from selected gadids and pleuronectids revealed slight but statistically significant differences in spore dimensions associated with the genotypes, the spores from pleuronectids were thicker and with larger polar capsules. We identify the morpho- and genotype from gadoids with Myxobolus ‘aeglefini’ sensu Auerbach, and the one from pleuronectids with Sphaerospora platessae Woodcock, 1904 as Myxobolus platessae n. comb. The latter species {{was originally}} described from Irish Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Myxobolus albi Picon et al., 2009 described from the common goby Pomatoschistus microps in Scotland is a synonym of M. ‘aeglefini’. The Pacific Myxobolus ‘aeglefini’ represents a separate species, showing only 97. 4 – 97. 6 % identity to the Atlantic species. In phylogenetic analyses based on SSU rDNA sequences, these and some related marine chondrotropic Myxobolus spp. form a distinct well supported group.

Members of family Myxobilatidae, Ortholinea spp. (currently Ortholineidae) and sequences of some other urinary system infecting myxosporeans form a well supported clade among members of the suborder Platysporina.

40|$|Background: Despite {{the growing}} {{awareness}} {{of the necessity of}} a sustainable development, the global economy continues to depend largely on the consumption of non-renewable energy resources. One such energy resource is fossil oil extracted from the seabed at offshore oil platforms. This type of oil production causes continuous environmental pollution from drilling waste, discharge of large amounts of produced water, and accidental spills. Methods and principal findings: Samples from natural populations <b>of</b> <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus)</b> and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in two North Sea areas with extensive oil production were investigated. Exposure to and uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were demonstrated, and biomarker analyses revealed adverse biological effects, including induction of biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress, altered fatty acid composition, and genotoxicity. Genotoxicity was reflected by a hepatic DNA adduct pattern typical for exposure to a mixture of PAHs. Control material was collected from a North Sea area without oil production and from remote Icelandic waters. The difference between the two control areas indicates significant background pollution in the North Sea. Conclusion: It is most remarkable to obtain biomarker responses in natural fish populations in the open sea that are similar to the biomarker responses in fish from highly polluted areas close to a point source.

The small fish are torn off the hook at the vessel side by means of a crucifier or a gaff and returned to the sea. It is generally thought that most of the discarded haddock die. An investigation to quantify this mortality was done in the season for this fishery in 1997. The undersized haddock that were torn off the longline hook were recaptured by gently catching them in a dip net as they reached the sea surface. Survival of haddock torn off by means of crucifier alone was compared to haddock torn of the hook by means of a gaff. The fish were transferred in tanks onboard a vessel to holding pens made of small meshed knotless netting floating at the surface. They were visually monitored for 7 - 11 days. The control group consisted of haddock fished with clean hooks without barbs and gently released by hand. At the end of the observation period the live and dead fish were examined for external damage. The experiment showed a total mortality of 39 % for fish that had been torn off by means of a crucifier, and 53 % mortality of fish released by means of a gaff. The mortality of the control group was 9 %. The injuries of the fish were also analysed...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{awareness}} {{of the necessity of}} a sustainable development, the global economy continues to depend largely on the consumption of non-renewable energy resources. One such energy resource is fossil oil extracted from the seabed at offshore oil platforms. This type of oil production causes continuous environmental pollution from drilling waste, discharge of large amounts of produced water, and accidental spills. Samples from natural populations <b>of</b> <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus)</b> and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in two North Sea areas with extensive oil production were investigated. Exposure to and uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were demonstrated, and biomarker analyses revealed adverse biological effects, including induction of biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress, altered fatty acid composition, and genotoxicity. Genotoxicity was reflected by a hepatic DNA adduct pattern typical for exposure to a mixture of PAHs. Control material was collected from a North Sea area without oil production and from remote Icelandic waters. The difference between the two control areas indicates significant background pollution in the North Sea. It is most remarkable to obtain biomarker responses in natural fish populations in the open sea that are similar to the biomarker responses in fish from highly polluted areas close to a point source. Risk assessment of various threats to the marine fish populations in the North Sea, such as overfishing, global warming, and eutrophication, should also take into account the ecologically relevant impact of offshore oil production...|$|E

40|$|The bycatch <b>of</b> <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus)</b> below {{legal size}} in the pelagic {{longline}} fisheries for haddock {{off the coast of}} Finnmark, northern Norway, is often high. This project was aimed at reducing the bycatch of undersized haddock through alterations in gear technology and fishing strategy. Fishing experiments with commercial longline vessels were carried out in JuneIJuly 1995 and 1996. The following modifications of fishing gear and fishing technology were tested: longlines with increased sinking speed; hooks with an inedible plastic body attached to the shank; hooks with nylon bristles attached to the shank; restructured bait based on mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and sandeel (Ammodytes lancea); mackerel bait of twice the normal size; restructured mackerel bait of twice the normal size. None of the methods tested gave the desired improvements in the size distribution of the haddock catches. Traditional mackerel bait of twice the normal size about 40 % reduction in undersized fish, but an increase in bait costs due to larger bait size, will not be accepted by commercial fishermen. In the survival experiments, where 18 haddock were torn off the longline hooks at the sea surface and kept in sea water tanks for five days, no mortality was found. One of the fishes was in bad condition at day five, and would probably not have survived if it was released to the sea. Additional experiments have to be carried out to confirm these results...|$|E
40|$|Urine {{collection}} {{from fish}} {{is an integral}} part of metabolic studies designed to measure the excretion of various biochemical compounds. The techniques developed for urine collection in salmonids cannot be applied to gadoid fish due to the anatomical differences in their urinary system. The anterior ureter <b>of</b> <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> L.) is an elongated duct that originates from the anterior part of the trunk kidney and courses dorsal-posterior to the region of the uropore. The posterior ureter originates from the middle of the caudal kidney, and eventually fuses with the anterior ureter before forming a small urinary bladder. After the two ureters join together, a short common duct empties into the urinary bladder and terminates at the uropore behind the anus. Just before the end, the terminal posterior ureter takes a sharp U-shaped turn, which makes cannulation difficult. We investigated the development of a cannulation technique for urine collection in three different-sized groups of juvenile haddock. In anaesthetized fish, a catheter was inserted in the uropore in a posterior direction to follow the U-shaped course of the ureter. After insertion of the catheter into the uropore, the externalized segment of tubing was connected to a needle attached to a syringe. Urine was then aspirated from each of the 20 fish at 15 ?L min 1 for 5 min to measure urine volume and urinary phosphate concentration. The results were reproducible and this cannulation technique has potential for use in other gadoid metabolic studies. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Fisheries {{surveys are}} widely used in the stock {{assessment}} process by providing time series of relative abundance and recruitment strength. Surveys also provide biological data that {{have the potential to}} improve stock projections by providing alternatives to the use of spawning stock biomass as a measure of stock reproductive potential. The objective of the present work is to illustrate various sources of error in survey data, using examples from bottom trawl surveys and to provide innovative methods for identifying and minimising these errors. In Chapter 1, the current work is framed within the existing literature and an overview is given of the different sources of error. The next six chapters consist of papers that have been published, are in press, or under review with peer-reviewed journals. These papers consist of case-studies, each exploring a different source of error. In Chapter 2, a method for summarising the precision of a length-frequency distribution is presented and recommendations are given on the sample sizes required to achieve a particlar precision level. In Chapter 3, the variability in the assignment of maturity stages of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa, L.) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus, L.) is examined, using statistical techniques developed in the social sciences. In Chapter 4, the spatial variability in the age-length structure <b>of</b> <b>haddock</b> (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus,</b> L.) is explored and a new method for comparing age-length keys is developed. In Chapter 5, the spatial structure in the length-weight relationships of whiting and haddock are analysed using geostatistical tools. In Chapter 6, the spatial trend in the sex ratio of megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis, Walbaum) is explored using generalized additive modelling techniques. In Chapter 7, spatial trends in the proportion of mature cod (Gadus morhua, L.) are investigated. In the concluding Chapter 8, the scale of various errors is reviewed {{in the light of the}} current work and recommendations for sampling design are proposed...|$|E
