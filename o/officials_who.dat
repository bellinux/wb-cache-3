5|$|The Arabic {{language}} and the Muslim religion continued to be spread in South Sudan by merchants and administrators from the North, and even by British <b>officials</b> <b>who</b> preferred to speak Arabic rather than learn the local language.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, in June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), {{responding}} to repeated requests from local police organizations, began accepting police organizations into their membership. By September, it had granted charters to police unions in 37 cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Paul, though not without protests from some city <b>officials,</b> <b>who</b> opposed the unionization of police, firefighters, and teachers.|$|E
5|$|Beneath the ealdormen, reeves—royal <b>officials</b> <b>who</b> were noble local landowners—were {{in charge}} of a town or royal estate. The {{authority}} of church and state was not separated in early medieval societies, and the lay officials worked closely with their diocesan bishop and local abbots, who also attended the king's royal councils.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War era, {{research}} on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish communist <b>officials,</b> <b>who</b> instead emphasized the role that communist partisans played in the anti-Nazi resistance. Hence, until recently, the bulk of research done on this topic {{was carried out by}} Polish scholars living in exile.|$|E
5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government <b>officials</b> <b>who</b> had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles {{as they left the}} country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, as {{a direct}} result of this campaign, Belgium {{formally}} annexed the territory, creating the Belgian Congo.

In July 2001, Atta met with bin al-Shibh in Spain, where they coordinated details of the plot, including final target selection. Bin al-Shibh also passed along bin Laden's wish for the attacks {{to be carried out}} as soon as possible. Some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt Saudi <b>officials</b> <b>who</b> were family members, or used fraudulent passports to gain entry.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, the Court {{began to}} read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly. In Guinn v. United States (1915), a {{unanimous}} Court struck down an Oklahoma grandfather clause that effectively exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be discriminatory. The Court ruled in the related case Myers v. Anderson (1915), that the <b>officials</b> <b>who</b> enforced such a clause were liable for civil damages.|$|E

5|$|Stafford blames Arab nationalists, most {{prominently}} Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and Bakr Sidqi.

5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing <b>officials</b> <b>who</b> had received Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since {{it could be}} read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, {{and most of the}} officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{justice system}} was {{maintained}} by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted <b>officials</b> <b>who</b> became county magistrates.
