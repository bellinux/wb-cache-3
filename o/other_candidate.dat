5|$|The {{returning}} officer, John Hall, after no <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> came forward, {{asked for}} {{a show of hands}} and declared it to be in favour of Sewell, upon which Hart demanded a poll. Hall declared that the poll be held at the Town Hall the following day (19 January), from 9am to 4pm.|$|E
5|$|Alan Tudyk applied {{through a}} casting office and {{several months later}} was called in for an audition, where he met with Whedon. He was called back to test with two {{candidates}} {{for the role of}} Zoe (Wash's wife) and was told that it was down to him and one <b>other</b> <b>candidate.</b> The Zoes he tested with were not selected (Gina Torres eventually received the role) and Tudyk was sent home, but received a call informing him he had the part anyway. His audition tape is included in the special features of the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{was freed}} from prison {{a year after}} his capture, {{as part of a}} {{prisoner}} exchange. He returned to Kentucky following his release and was honored at a public dinner on September 6, 1814. In 1816, he resigned as auditor of public accounts due to failing health. But, submitting to public demand, he became a candidate for governor later that year. James Johnson, the <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> for office, withdrew from the race due to Madison's popularity, thus the latter was elected without opposition.|$|E

50|$|New Jersey’s electoral {{vote was}} split, with {{four of the}} electors pledged to Lincoln being elected because the alternative, a fusion ticket of electors {{supporting}} <b>other</b> <b>candidates,</b> saw the Breckinridge and Bell electors finish behind all <b>other</b> <b>candidates.</b> and three Douglas electors being elected.|$|R
5|$|To promote her {{candidacy}} for senior class president, Brittany (Heather Morris) sings a rousing song of female empowerment—"Run the World (Girls)"—at an impromptu assembly, {{with the help}} of the Cheerios and Santana (Naya Rivera), who has rejoined New Directions unbeknownst to cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). The enormous enthusiasm of the school's entire female population worries Kurt (Chris Colfer), the <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> in the race. Kurt has given up his dream to play Tony in the musical, and gives a bouquet of roses to his boyfriend Blaine (Darren Criss), the likely choice as Tony.|$|E
5|$|Gerlachovský štít was {{not always}} {{considered}} the highest mountain in the Tatras. After the first official measurement of peaks in the Tatras {{during the period of}} the Habsburg Monarchy in the 18th century, Kriváň (2,494m) was considered the highest. <b>Other</b> <b>candidate</b> peaks for the status of the highest mountain at that time were Lomnický štít (2,633m) and Ľadový štít (2,627m). The first person to accurately name Gerlachovský štít as the highest peak was the forester Ľudovít (Ludwig) Greiner in 1838. Greiner's measurement was formally confirmed by an Austrian Army survey party in 1868. However, it was generally accepted only after the Vienna Military Institute for Geography issued a new, authoritative collection of maps of Central Europe in ca. 1875.|$|E
5|$|Stalwarts, led by Grant's old {{political}} ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw the ex-president's renewed popularity {{as a way}} {{for their}} faction to regain power, and sought to find ways to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any <b>other</b> <b>candidate,</b> but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination.|$|E

50|$|Isley {{was elected}} to the Alberta Legislature in the 1979 Alberta general election. He won the electoral {{district}} of Bonnyville defeating four <b>other</b> <b>candidates</b> to hold it for the Progressive Conservatives. He won his second term and a larger plurality facing two <b>other</b> <b>candidates</b> to win the 1982 Alberta general election. His third time running for office in the 1986 Alberta general election, would see him win his third term with a reduced but comfortable plurality. He would again defeat two <b>other</b> <b>candidates,</b> his strongest challenger was New Democrat candidate Thomas Tucker.|$|R
5|$|State legislatures elected U.S. Senators {{until the}} {{ratification}} of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In 1849 one of New York's seats was up for election, and a Whig would likely be elected to replace John Adams Dix. Seward, with Weed's counsel, decided to seek the seat. When legislators convened in January 1849, he was spoken of as the favorite. Some opposed him as too extreme on slavery issues, and intimated {{that he would not}} support the slaveholding President-elect Taylor, a Louisianan. Weed and Seward worked to dispel these concerns, and when the vote for the Senate seat took place, the former governor received five times the vote of the nearest <b>other</b> <b>candidate,</b> gaining easy election on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} brought after Jeffrey Heffernan, a detective with the Paterson, New Jersey police force, {{went to a}} {{distribution}} center {{and picked up a}} lawn sign for the candidate challenging the city's incumbent mayor in the 2005 election (Heffernan's mother had wanted a sign, so he was getting one for her). While Heffernan did not support the challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign they told senior officers, including the police chief, who strongly supported the mayor. For his apparent public support of the <b>other</b> <b>candidate,</b> they demoted Heffernan to beat patrol work as a uniformed officer.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor of}} Paris is elected {{indirectly}} by Paris voters; {{the voters of}} each arrondissement elect the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement {{has a number of}} members depending upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). The elected council members select the mayor. Sometimes the candidate who receives the most votes citywide is not selected if the <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> has won the support of the majority of council members. Mayor Bertrand Delanoë (2001–2014) was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a majority of council members.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} results, {{which were}} reported from Central Bougainville, gave President Tanis a clear lead over the <b>other</b> <b>candidates,</b> with Tanis' 1405 votes leading all <b>other</b> <b>candidates,</b> including Reuben Siara, who placed second with 495 votes. However, as more {{areas of the}} island were reported, Momis was able to significantly cut into Tannis lead. On May 27, Tanis lead Momis by just 268 votes, with 5,226 votes to Momis' 4,958. By June 2, Momis had overtaken Tanis and the <b>other</b> <b>candidates,</b> leading his nearest rival, President James Tanis, by more than 8,000 votes.|$|R

5|$|The {{speech was}} a success and Ingersoll’s {{appellation}} of “plumed knight” remained a nickname for Blaine for years to come. On the first ballot, no candidate received the required majority of 378, but Blaine had the most votes, with 285 and no <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> had more than 125. There were a few vote shifts {{in the next five}} ballots, and Blaine climbed to 308 votes, with his nearest competitor at just 111. On the seventh ballot the situation shifted drastically as anti-Blaine delegates began to coalesce around Hayes; by the time the balloting ended, Blaine’s votes had risen to 351, but Hayes surpassed him at 384, a majority.|$|E
5|$|William H. West of Ohio {{nominated}} Blaine with {{an enthusiastic}} speech {{and after the}} first ballot, Blaine led the count with 334½ votes. While short of the necessary 417 for nomination, Blaine had far more than any <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> with Arthur in second place at 278 votes. Blaine was unacceptable to the Arthur delegates just as Blaine’s own delegates would never vote for the President, so the contest was between the two for the delegates of the remaining candidates. Blaine’s total steadily increased as Logan and Sherman withdrew in his favor {{and some of the}} Edmunds delegates defected to him. Unlike in previous conventions, the momentum for Blaine in 1884 would not be halted. On the fourth ballot, Blaine received 541 votes and was, at last, nominated. Logan was named vice presidential nominee on the first ballot, and the Republicans had their ticket.|$|E
5|$|Elaine and Guybrush {{return to}} Mêlée Island in Escape from Monkey Island from their lengthy honeymoon {{to find that}} she has been {{declared}} legally dead; as a result the governorship of the Tri-Island Area is up for election. While Elaine and Guybrush work on reversing her legal demise, they discover that the <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> in the election is actually LeChuck in disguise, but the townspeople, feeling neglected by Elaine's long absence, do not believe her. Guybrush leaves to prevent the Ultimate Insult, a powerful voodoo talisman, from falling into the hands of LeChuck's co-conspirator Ozzie Mandrill. Elaine is defeated in the election and LeChuck becomes governor, while Guybrush is captured and marooned on Monkey Island. On Monkey Island, Guybrush discovers that resident castaway Herman Toothrot is actually Horatio Marley, Elaine's long thought dead grandfather. The two escape Monkey Island and defeat LeChuck and Mandrill. Elaine asks Horatio to take over her position as governor of the Tri-Island Area, and Guybrush and Elaine depart.|$|E

5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the <b>other</b> <b>candidate,</b> Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{name had}} been {{proposed}} several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health. Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including Thomas A. Hendricks, Allen G. Thurman, Stephen Johnson Field, and Thomas F. Bayard. Hancock's neutrality on the monetary question, and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, more than any <b>other</b> <b>candidate,</b> had nationwide support. When the Democratic convention assembled in Cincinnati in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but {{did not have a}} majority. By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and William Hayden English of Indiana was chosen as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Clinton {{announced}} that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent {{in the general election}} was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67percent of the vote to Spencer's 31percent, carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties. Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008. In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.|$|E

5|$|MacLaren played little cricket in 1898, {{initially}} {{owing to}} his teaching commitments {{and the need}} to establish himself and his wife in a new home. After making his first appearance in July, he did not play again until August. He played nine first-class games, scoring 478 runs at 29.87, before his season was ended by neuralgia. Despite his frequent absences—again he missed {{the first part of the}} season—Lancashire re-appointed MacLaren as joint captain for 1899. That summer, the Australians toured England and the first Test took place before MacLaren had played any cricket. For the second game, MacLaren replaced W. G. Grace as England captain; the <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> for the leadership was Stanley Jackson, who was senior to MacLaren at Harrow and had preceded him into the England side, but MacLaren was favoured owing to his previous experience in the role with Lancashire and England.|$|E
5|$|Hayes had {{announced}} {{early in his}} presidency {{that he would not}} seek another term, which meant that the contest for the Republican nomination in 1880 was open to all challengers—including Blaine. Blaine was among the early favorites for the nomination, as were former President Grant, Treasury Secretary John Sherman of Ohio, and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont. Although Grant did not actively promote his candidacy, his entry into the race re-energized the Stalwarts and when the convention met in Chicago in June 1880, they instantly polarized the delegates into Grant and anti-Grant factions, with Blaine the most popular choice of the latter group. Blaine was nominated by James Frederick Joy of Michigan, but in contrast to Ingersoll’s exciting speech of 1876, Joy’s lengthy oration was remembered only for its maladroitness. After the other candidates were nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; no <b>other</b> <b>candidate</b> had more than Sherman’s 93, and none had the required majority of 379. Sherman’s delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, but he refused to release them through twenty-eight ballots {{in the hope that the}} anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. Eventually, they did desert Blaine, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to Ohio Congressman James A. Garfield, and by the thirty-sixth ballot he had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E
