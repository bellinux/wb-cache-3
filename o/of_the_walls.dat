5|$|By the 16th century Conisbrough Castle {{was in a}} poor {{state of}} repair, and a royal survey carried out in 1537 and 1538 showed that the gates, bridge and parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> had {{collapsed}} in a spectacular land slippage, and that one floor of the keep had also fallen in. The collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> was {{a consequence of the}} instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} and western parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were originally {{faced with a}} local ashlar sandstone with a core of basalt rubble; the sandstone was mostly quarried at Howick. The sandstone has since been stripped from the western parts of the wall, and the sandstone along the eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> gives way to small limestone blocks, originally only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along {{the northern edge of}} the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} {{deterioration}} of the fortress ranges widely, from krstata kula which is still well preserved, to sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> which have seen no repair work and have collapsed in some places.|$|E
40|$|The {{finite element}} model is used to {{simulate}} <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full scale instrumented anchored reinforced <b>wall.</b> <b>The</b> validated {{finite element model}} is then used to carry out parametric studies to ascertain <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary conditions on <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>The</b> boundaries at the crest, facing and base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> are varied to study their effects. At <b>the</b> crest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> slope surcharge <b>of</b> various geometrical dimensions are imposed. At <b>the</b> facing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>the</b> boundary is allowed to yield laterally by inserting a compressible geoinclusion at <b>the</b> back face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> panels. Meanwhile, at the base, the boundary is allowed to yield vertically by allowing <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{to sit on a}} compressible foundation soil. <b>The</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is determined in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tensile stress distribution developed in the reinforcing bars, <b>the</b> summation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximum tension in the reinforcing bars, <b>the</b> summation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tensions developed at the connection to the facing panels, the lateral movement at the facing and the vertical movement at the base...|$|R
2500|$|Loshitzky depicts <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Wall</b> as {{a symbol}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, détente, and <b>the</b> {{collapse}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. She divides <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> into six major stages: <b>the</b> erection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> (1961); <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "geography <b>of</b> fear" [...] from the Cold War; <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> détente; <b>the</b> short period <b>of</b> glasnost and perestroika; <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> (1989); and after <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|R
50|$|In December 2014 some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Women <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> became <b>the</b> {{first women}} to light menorahs at <b>the</b> Western <b>Wall.</b> Specifically, they lit 28 menorahs in <b>the</b> women's section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b> Sarah Silverman {{was among those}} who {{attended}} <b>the</b> lighting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> menorahs. However, this event came after the rabbi in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Wall</b> had refused a request from Women <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> to place a menorah in the women's section.|$|R
5|$|At the north-west corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> stands Arundel tower, {{another large}} drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South {{of this is}} Catchcold tower. Catchcold tower {{was designed to be}} defended with guns and has three gunports; the need to support cannon leaves it much heavier in appearance than the other circular towers on the walls. The remains of machine gun mountings fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows {{on the west side of}} the gate are the original medieval designs. Along the south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> one of the twin towers protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E
5|$|Further {{renovation}} {{work in the}} early 1970s led to improvements in the building's structure and included restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and windows. Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building's fabric. In 1989, Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkström. Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Higher (av. 9m) and thicker (av. 3m) walls. Walls {{were made}} of stone or stone facing with rubble core. The greater {{thickness}} would protect the wall from enemy mining. The height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> would force attackers to use scaling-ladders. The parapet of the rampart would have crenellations to provide protection from missiles for defenders.|$|E
5000|$|A {{clear view}} of St Michael's from the Oranienplatz was not {{possible}} between 1961 and 1990, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Wall.</b> <b>The</b> lower half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, {{which could not be}} seen because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concrete segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> was painted on <b>the</b> western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> as Trompe-l'œil, by the Berlin-based, Iranian artist Yadegar Asisi on <b>the</b> initiative <b>of</b> Berlin architect Bernhard Strecker, in order to demonstrate the [...] "permeability" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> (Mauerdurchblick). After <b>the</b> demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>the</b> Italian Marco Piccininni bought painted segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> found near Waldemarbrücke n an auction at Monte Carlo in 1990, which he subsequently donated to the Vatican, where they were installed in the Vatican Gardens in August 1994. Other graffiti on <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Wall</b> along Waldemarstraße is documented in ten connected poster-photos taken by photographers Liselotte and Armin Orgel-Köhne in 1985.|$|R
50|$|For Post and Lintel System ICFs, the {{concrete}} has a horizontal member, called a lintel, only at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> (Horizontal concrete at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is often present in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building's footer or <b>the</b> lintel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> below.) and vertical members, called posts, between the lintel {{and the surface}} on which <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is resting.|$|R
50|$|From the 18th century, <b>the</b> {{deterioration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town <b>wall</b> progressed rapidly. It {{collapsed in}} sections due to neglect, and stones were then used as building material for other structures. It had become common practice for sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to be leased to burgesses (freemen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town), which increased <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> still further. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> {{was used to}} support the Glamorganshire Canal embankment.|$|R
5|$|In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury {{destroyed}} the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, {{which includes the}} well, was consecrated in 1186. There is evidence that, in the 12th century, the ruined nave was renovated enough for services while the great new church was being constructed. Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the aisle and crossing having been completed by 1189, progress then continued more slowly.|$|E
5|$|In February 1832 Etty began a {{campaign}} of writing to local York newspapers urging the preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation {{in light of the}} damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile to the preservation campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to a railway station within the walls galvanised Etty, and he delivered two lectures on the preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls, much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the running of trains to both north and south. While the walls were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty's death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and the preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being {{determined by the}} projection of the north transept chapel, with the west and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> in the present church suggests that the wall {{for the length of}} the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent a restoration in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E
50|$|It {{is useful}} to {{distinguish}} green walls from green facades. Green walls have growing media supported on <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> (as described below), while green facades have soil only at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> (in a container or in ground) and support climbing plants on <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to create <b>the</b> green, or vegetated, facade.|$|R

5|$|In {{other parts}} of Canterbury, the city walls became used for promenades by the more fashionable citizens. The Dane John Gardens were built between 1790 and 1803 by Simmons in the {{south-east}} corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> remodelling the old castle motte, and incorporating the Roman bank and the medieval wall-walk into the design. The ownership of the land was disputed, and the park was taken into {{the control of the}} city shortly after its construction.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and {{structures}} within the gardens, {{such as the}} central flight of steps, {{were built in the}} late 17th century. The gatepiers and flanking walls north east of the house were added in the mid 19th century. The gardens are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.|$|E
5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there {{does not appear to}} be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E
5000|$|A rainscreen {{drainage}} {{plane is}} a {{separation between the}} veneer and the weather resistant barrier of a rainscreen.

5000|$|<b>The</b> City <b>Wall</b> <b>of</b> Suzhou (...) is <b>the</b> city <b>wall</b> {{surrounding}} Suzhou city. That length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> was 15,204 metres before 1958.

5000|$|There are {{different}} ways to measure <b>the</b> regional function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> It has been proposed to measure <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LV <b>wall</b> motion, <b>the</b> thickening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> or other changes in <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> small regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> as it contracts and relaxes.

5|$|Most of {{the eastern}} walls of the city consist of an en crémaillère enciente built in the mid-16th century, {{although}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> {{date back to the}} medieval period.

5|$|On the {{southwest}} of the palace courtyard there were some low platforms, possibly ritual dance platforms, and on the southeast side was a building with benches against three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and hearths at each end. This {{may have been the}} room where the Ahpo Sotz'il held court and received visitors and tribute.|$|E
5|$|Structure 13 {{is on the}} {{southwest}} side of Plaza 1, dividing that Plaza from Plaza 2. It was accessed via a double stairway ascending from Plaza 1. This double stairway gave access to the first level of the temple structure only; from there, a wide single stairway continued to the summit shrine. Only the lower sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and columns of the temple superstructure remain. The earliest phase of construction dates to the Early Classic and consisted of a low platform that supported a perishable superstructure.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{relation}} between a displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and seismic earth pressure, horizontal vibrating tests are performed on sand or clay compacted in a box, 90 cm in length, 58 cm in width and 30 cm in depth with a movable <b>wall</b> using <b>the</b> shaking table. The conclusions are summarized as follows : The vibrating earth pressures of sand and clay decrease with increase of a displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> When a displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> becomes large, <b>the</b> phase difference between the vibrating earth pressure and <b>the</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> becomes 180 °. When <b>the</b> shear deformation <b>of</b> soil is relatively small, <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> vibrating earth pressure-displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> relationship obtained by the experiment {{can be explained by}} the theory...|$|R

2500|$|While {{portions}} {{north of}} Beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated, {{in many other}} locations <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> is in disrepair. Those parts might serve as a village playground or a source of stones to rebuild houses and roads. Sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> are also prone to graffiti and vandalism, while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold {{on the market for}} up to 50 renminbi. Parts have been destroyed because <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> is in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> construction. A 2012 report by <b>the</b> State Administration <b>of</b> Cultural Heritage states that 22% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ming Great <b>Wall</b> has disappeared, while [...] of wall have vanished.
