40|$|Life-cycle {{studies of}} the {{currently}} dominant transport biofuels (bioethanol made from starch or sugar and biodiesel made from vegetable oil) show that solar energy conversion efficiency is relatively poor if compared with solar cells and that such biofuels tend to do worse than conventional fossil transport fuels as to the emission of eutrophying and acidifying substances. Lifecycle studies of biofuels show diverging results regarding cumulative fossil-fuel demand and the emission of greenhouse gases. If properly done and when allocation is {{on the basis of}} prices, cumulative fossil-fuel demand is relatively high for ethanol currently produced from European grain or US maize and relatively low for palm oil or ethanol from sugarcane. The ‘seed-to-wheel’ emissions of greenhouse-gases associated with current transport biofuels are often higher than the corresponding life-cycle emissions of conventional fossil fuels. Transport biofuels vary much in their life-cycle emissions of substances that are ecotoxic or contribute to <b>oxidizing</b> <b>smog...</b>|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{production}} of liquid biofuels can have positive effects. It can decrease dependence {{on fossil fuels}} and increase farmers’ incomes. Agricultural {{production of}} mixed perennial biofuel crops may increase pollinator and avian richness. Most types of agricultural crop-based liquid biofuel production, however, {{have a negative effect}} on natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Comparisons of fossil fuels and liquid biofuels regarding their life cycle emissions of pollutants which are (eco) toxic or contribute to <b>oxidizing</b> <b>smog,</b> acidification or nutrification give mixed results. Fossil fuels often do better than biofuels as to emissions of acidifying and nutrifying substances, but often worse regarding ecotoxicity. A rapid increase in biofuel production can increase malnutrition due to its upward effect on food prices. Liquid biofuel lifecycles are linked to greater water consumption than their fossil fuel counterparts. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of liquid agricultural biofuels are currently often larger than those of their fossil fuel counterparts, when effects of land use on carbon stocks are included. An exception in this respect is current Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. When soil quality is to be maintained, there seems to be little scope to convert lignocellulosic harvest residues into liquid biofuels. Agricultural biofuels are much poorer converters of solar energy into usable energy than photovoltaic cells...|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} harsh {{chemicals}} are usually highly reactive and <b>oxidizing.</b> Photochemical <b>smog</b> is therefore {{considered to be}} a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles. Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.|$|R
50|$|A primary {{pollutant}} is an air pollutant emitted {{directly from a}} source.A secondary pollutant is not directly emitted as such, but forms when other pollutants ({{primary pollutant}}s) react in the atmosphere.Examples of a secondary pollutant include ozone, which is formed when hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) combine {{in the presence of}} sunlight; nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is formed as nitric oxide (NO) combines with oxygen in the air; and acid rain, which is formed when sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides react with water.All of these harsh chemicals are usually highly reactive and <b>oxidizing.</b> Photochemical <b>smog</b> is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization.

40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} to develop {{instrumental}} techniques for characterizing organic aerosol aging, we report on the performance of the Toronto Photo-Oxidation Tube (TPOT) and Potential Aerosol Mass (PAM) flow tube reactors under a variety of experimental conditions. The PAM system was designed with lower surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio to minimize wall effects; the TPOT reactor was designed to study heterogeneous aerosol chemistry where wall loss can be independently measured. The following studies were performed: (1) transmission efficiency measurements for CO 2, SO 2, and bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sebacate (BES) particles, (2) H 2 SO 4 yield measurements from the oxidation of SO 2, (3) residence time distribution (RTD) measurements for CO 2, SO 2, and BES particles, (4) aerosol mass spectra, O/C and H/C ratios, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity measurements of BES particles exposed to OH radicals, and (5) aerosol mass spectra, O/C and H/C ratios, CCN activity, and yield measurements of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from gas-phase OH oxidation of m -xylene and α-pinene. OH exposures ranged from (2. 0 ± 1. 0) × 10 10 to (1. 8 ± 0. 3) × 10 12 molec cm − 3 s. Where applicable, data from the flow tube reactors are compared with published results from the Caltech smog chamber. The TPOT yielded narrower RTDs. However, its transmission efficiency for SO 2 was lower than that for the PAM. Transmission efficiency for BES and H 2 SO 4 particles was size-dependent and was similar for the two flow tube designs. Oxidized BES particles had similar O/C and H/C ratios and CCN activity at OH exposures greater than 10 11 molec cm − 3 s, but different CCN activity at lower OH exposures. The O/C ratio, H/C ratio, and yield of m -xylene and α-pinene SOA was strongly affected by reactor design and operating conditions, with wall interactions seemingly having the strongest influence on SOA yield. At comparable OH exposures, flow tube SOA was more <b>oxidized</b> than <b>smog</b> chamber SOA, possibly because of faster gas-phase oxidation relative to particle nucleation. SOA yields were lower in the TPOT than in the PAM, but CCN activity of flow-tube-generated SOA particles was similar. For comparable OH exposures, α-pinene SOA yields were similar in the PAM and Caltech chambers, but m -xylene SOA yields were much lower in the PAM compared to the Caltech chamber...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest to}} reduce the {{dependence}} on fossil fuel has increased the use of bio-ethanol as an additive to gasoline. The metropolitan area of São Paulo (population 20 million) is a unique laboratory to study the ambient aerosol population caused {{by the use of}} bio-fuels because 55 % of the fuel used is ethanol. The use of ethanol as an additive to fossil fuel is known to increase aldehyde emissions and when photo chemically <b>oxidized,</b> result in <b>smog.</b> In order to characterize this smog problem total particle number concentration, particle number size distribution, light scattering and light absorption measurement equipment were deployed at the University of São Paulo campus area. Here we present the results from three months of measurements from 10 October 2010 to 10 January 2011. The median total particle number concentration for the sub-micron aerosol typically varies between 1 &times; 10 4 – 3 &times; 10 4 cm− 3 frequently exceeding 5 &times; 10 4 cm− 3 during the day. Median diurnal values for light absorption and light scattering vary between 12 – 33 Mm− 1 and 21 – 64 Mm− 1 , respectively. The hourly median single-scattering albedo varied between 0. 63 and 0. 85 indicating a net warming effect on a regional scale. A total of ten new particle formation (NPF) events were observed. During these events, growth rates ranged between 9 – 25 nm h− 1 . On average, a calculated sulphuric acid vapour abundance of 2. 6 &times; 10 8 cm− 3 would have explained the growth with a vapour production rate of 2. 8 &times; 10 6 cm− 3 s− 1 to sustain it. The estimated sulphuric acid concentration, calculated from global irradiance and sulphur dioxide measurements, accounted for {{only a fraction of the}} vapour concentration needed to explain the observed growth rates. This indicates that also other condensable vapours participate in the growth process. During the events, the condensation sink was calculated to be 12 &times; 10 &minus; 3 s− 1 on average...|$|R
