In 2014 after negotiations between the city and the police officers union reached an agreement on police officer pay that would give pay increases to nearly 1,000 officers who joined the department since the salaries for incoming officers were cut. The agreement also raised starting salaries for officers to $57,420 with an additional increase to $60,552 after 6 months which would become effective in the beginning of 2015. The agreement would also change the current <b>overtime</b> <b>payment</b> system from a deferred payment system, which was implemented to cut costs, to a pay-as-you-go overtime system as well as increasing the overtime budget from $30 million to $70 million.|$|E

These health impacts come from labor, human rights violations, and collapse of social norms.

Minimum wage laws are rarely followed at mines. Work week hour standards, <b>overtime</b> <b>payment</b> and rest periods are largely ignored as well.

50|$|In {{the area}} of social policy, the main issue was the {{progressive}} extension of social security to all socio-professional groups, and especially to farmers and the self-employed.

The law of 29 July 1957 extended compulsory health insurance to craftworkers, shopkeepers and manufacturers. The questions {{of the length of}} the working day, <b>overtime</b> <b>payment,</b> and wages, created numerous tensions between employers and workers.

40|$|This study applied {{engineering}} {{techniques to}} develop a nurse scheduling model that, while maintaining {{the highest level of}} service, simultaneously minimized hospital-staffing costs and equitably distributed overtime pay. In the mathematical model, the objective function was the sum of the <b>overtime</b> <b>payment</b> to all nurses and the standard deviation of the total <b>overtime</b> <b>payment</b> that each nurse received. Input data distributions were analyzed in order to formulate a simulation model to determine the optimal demand for nurses that met the hospital’s service standards. To obtain the optimal nurse schedule with the number of nurses acquired from the simulation model, we proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) with two-point crossover and random mutation. After running the algorithm, we compared the expenses and number of nurses between the existing and our proposed nurse schedules. For January 2013, the nurse schedule obtained by GA could save 12 % in staffing expenses per month and 13 % in number of nurses when compare with the existing schedule, while more equitably distributing overtime pay between all nurses...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} memo is to review the requirements and clarify how to determine the “regular rate of pay ” when calculating overtime. Background Information: Collective bargaining agreements for represented employees and California State University (CSU) policy for non-represented employees typically define overtime as authorized time worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a designated workweek period. CSU employees are paid under the state pay plan whereby an employee’s monthly salary is paid {{on the basis of}} 12, nearly equal pay periods each year. The pay period is called a calendar month and contains either 21 or 22 “normal ” workdays (Monday through Friday including holidays during the week). Under the state pay plan, when a monthly rate employee is paid overtime, the hourly rate equivalent is derived by dividing the employment history base monthly salary rate by 173. 33. 1 The hourly rate is then multiplied by the number of overtime hours worked at the overtime factor (e. g., 1. 5 x) to calculate the <b>overtime</b> <b>payment.</b> When an employee receives additional compensation such as a monthly stipend, the stipend is added to the monthly salary rate to derive the regular rate of pay to...|$|E

This change was mainly determined by a redistribution of fringe benefits and <b>overtime</b> <b>payments.</b> We discuss three possible sources of redistribution: (i) a change in the skill composition of the working males and females after the increase in the minimum wage, (ii) industrial differences in response to the changes in the wage floor, and (iii) discrimination.

30|$|The textile {{and apparel}} {{industry}} is one industrial sector that generates detrimental {{impact on the}} environment, due to its excessive use of water, energy, pesticides, and toxic chemicals in its production process and delivery to consumers (Walters et al. 2005).

Most apparel companies often seek to minimize costs of products through sourcing overseas (Ma et al. 2016; Wallace et al. 2012).

Estimation results based on a difference-in-difference-differences strategy indicate a widening of the gender gap, caused by redistribution of fringe benefits and <b>overtime</b> <b>payments</b> following the amendment. We discuss three possible sources of redistribution: (i) discrimination, (ii) a change in the skill composition of the working males and females after the increase, and (iii) industrial differences in response to the changes in the wage floor.
