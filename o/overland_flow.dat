25|$|The latest {{concept of}} the origin of the Driftless Area is the pre-Illinoian {{continental}} glacial ice flowing over the Driftless Area and depositing on it pre-Illinoian till, which is more than 790,000 years old. When the ice retreated and uncovered the area, periglacial erosion removed it: Anticyclonic snow-bearing winds episodically dropped large amounts of snow, which then gradually removed superficial sediment by solifluction and snowmelt <b>overland</b> <b>flow,</b> so-called sheetwash.|$|E
25|$|Floods {{occur in}} {{all types of}} river and stream channels, from the {{smallest}} ephemeral streams in humid zones to normally-dry channels in arid climates to the world's largest rivers. When <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> occurs on tilled fields, it {{can result in a}} muddy flood where sediments are picked up by run off and carried as suspended matter or bed load. Localized flooding may be caused or exacerbated by drainage obstructions such as landslides, ice, debris, or beaver dams.|$|E
25|$|Floods {{can happen}} on flat or low-lying areas when water is {{supplied}} by rainfall or snowmelt {{more rapidly than}} it can either infiltrate or run off. The excess accumulates in place, sometimes to hazardous depths. Surface soil can become saturated, which effectively stops infiltration, where the water table is shallow, such as a floodplain, or from intense rain from one or a series of storms. Infiltration also is slow to negligible through frozen ground, rock, concrete, paving, or roofs. Areal flooding begins in flat areas like floodplains and in local depressions not connected to a stream channel, because the velocity of <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> depends on the surface slope. Endorheic basins may experience areal flooding during periods when precipitation exceeds evaporation.|$|E
30|$|In {{traditional}} {{analysis of}} slope stability, <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> is not taken into account. As is well known, {{the depth of}} <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> is only several centimeters or millimeters, which may have little effect on a stable slope with a large safety factor; however, for a slope in the limiting equilibrium condition, the effect of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> should not be ignored. This is because the <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> with only several centimeters or millimeters may cause the so-called stable slope to become an unstable slope. Especially, in landslide hazard assessment, not considering the effect of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> may result in an incorrect assessment and lead to serious damage in the so-called safety area, which is obtained by landslide hazard assessment without consideration {{of the effect of}} <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> on the stability. Thus, {{in order to avoid the}} aforementioned accidents, the effect of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> should be taken into account in slope stability analysis.|$|R

First, actual <b>overland</b> flood <b>flows</b> caused by a storm surge are simulated and the accuracy of the simulation results is examined. Next, the measures for storm surge in Osaka city is evaluated. Finally, the main factors of urbanization, buildings, houses and a sewerage system are taken up, and their influence on the characteristics of <b>overland</b> flood <b>flows</b> is discussed. Through these studies, the validity of the simulation model for inundation analysis is demonstrated and the influence of urbanization on <b>overland</b> flood <b>flows</b> is clarified...|$|R
25|$|Inflow {{starts in}} May/June with maximum rates of flow of around 10,000 m3/s by late August and ends in October/November, amplified by {{precipitation}} {{of the annual}} monsoon. In November the lake reaches its maximum size. The annual monsoon coincides to cease around {{this time of the}} year. As the Mekong river begins its minimum around {{this time of the year}} and its water level falls deeper than the inundated Tonle Sap lake, Tonle Sap river and surrounding wetlands, waters of the lake's basin now drains via the Tonle Sap river into the Mekong. As a result the Tonle Sap River (length around 115km/71mi) flows 6 months a year South-East (Mekong) to North-West (lake) and 6 month a year in the opposite direction. The mean annual reverse flow volume in the Tonle Sap is , or about half of the maximum lake volume. A further 10% is estimated to enter the system by <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> from the Mekong. The Mekong branches off into several arms near Phnom Penh and reaches Vietnamese territory south of Koh Thom and Loek Daek districts of Kandal Province.|$|E
2500|$|An {{irrigation}} scheme draws {{water from}} groundwater, rivers, [...] lakes or <b>overland</b> <b>flow,</b> and distributes it over an area. Hydrological, or direct, effects {{of doing this}} include reduction in downstream river flow, increased evaporation in the irrigated area, increased level in the water table as groundwater recharge in the area is increased and flow increased in the irrigated area. Likewise, irrigation has immediate effects on the provision of moisture to the atmosphere, inducing atmospheric instabilities and increasing downwind rainfall, or in other cases modifies the atmospheric circulation, delivering rain to different downwind areas. Increases or decreases in irrigation are a key area of concern in precipitationshed studies, that examine how significant modifications to the delivery of evaporation to the atmosphere can alter downwind rainfall.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the process}} of {{separating}} “baseflow” from “direct runoff” is an inexact science. [...] In part this is because these two concepts are not, themselves, entirely distinct and unrelated. [...] Return flow from groundwater increases along with <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> from saturated or impermeable areas during and after a storm event; [...] moreover, a particular water molecule can easily move through both pathways {{en route to the}} watershed outlet. [...] Therefore, separation of a purely “baseflow component” in a hydrograph is a somewhat arbitrary exercise. [...] Nevertheless, various graphical and empirical techniques have been developed to perform these hydrograph separations. [...] The separation of base flow from direct runoff can be an important first step in developing rainfall-runoff models for a watershed of interest—for example, in developing and applying unit hydrographs as described below.|$|E
30|$|This {{model is}} simple, {{but has the}} {{capability}} of {{taking into account the}} effect of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> in the triggering mechanism of shallow landslide. The results of case study show that the <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> can make an obvious effect on shallow landslides, so it is quite important to consider the <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> in shallow landslide hazard assessment.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{treatment}} of hillslope hydrology {{consists of two}} mathematical parts (equations), one is {{used to describe the}} seepage flow and the other is used to describe the <b>overland</b> water <b>flow.</b> The equation for seepage flow using in this study is the one presented by Rosso et al. (2006). The equation for <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> is derived based on the assumption of an uniform <b>overland</b> water <b>flow.</b>|$|R
30|$|A physical-based model {{considering}} {{the effect of}} <b>overland</b> water <b>flow,</b> which is an improvement from the pioneering model presented by Rosso et al. (2006), was developed {{in this study and}} is used to predict rainfall-induced shallow landslides. The model preserves the model presented by Rosso et al. (2006) in explaining the combined hydrologic and topographic control on shallow landslides. Moreover, it includes an additional the equation to describe <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> to improve the hillslope hydrology model and considers the effect of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> on the slope stability to better analyse the slope stability. Here, the equation of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> was derived by the assumption that <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> is uniform flow. The effect of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> on slope stability is accounted for by the additional pore pressure that results the shear stress acting on the slope. We used simple examples and applied in study area to illustrate the method. Lastly, we made comparisons with the Rosso-Rulli-Vannucchi model to demonstrate the rationality of the model of this study model.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overland</b> <b>flow</b> can erode soil {{particles}} and transport them downslope. The erosion associated with <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> may occur through different methods depending on meteorological and flow conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Overland</b> <b>flow</b> is {{a primary}} factor in channel {{initiation}} where saturation <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> deepens to increase shear stress and begin channel incision. Overland flows converge in topographical depressions where channel initiation begins. Soil composition, vegetation, precipitation, and topography dictate the amount and rate of <b>overland</b> <b>flow.</b> The composition of a soil determines how quickly saturation occurs and cohesive strength retards the entrainment of material from overland flows. Vegetation slows infiltration rates during precipitation events and plant roots anchor soil on hillslopes.|$|E
50|$|This {{occurs when}} the rate of {{rainfall}} on a surface exceeds {{the rate at which}} water can infiltrate the ground, and any depression storage has already been filled. This is called flooding excess <b>overland</b> <b>flow,</b> Hortonian <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> (after Robert E. Horton), or unsaturated <b>overland</b> <b>flow.</b> This more commonly occurs in arid and semi-arid regions, where rainfall intensities are high and the soil infiltration capacity is reduced because of surface sealing, or in paved areas. This occurs largely in city areas where pavements prevent water from flooding.|$|E
30|$|However, the {{physical}} model presented by Rosso et al. (2006) {{does not consider}} the effect of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow.</b> In model application, the unconditionally stable slopes is defined as if the ground water table rose to the slope surface with the safety factor even greater than 1. In this consideration, the effect of <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> is ignored. Whether so-called unconditionally stable slopes can still remain stable under <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> quires further study.|$|R
30|$|The {{depth of}} <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> is higher at larger {{rainfall}} intensity, and this depth increases with increasing rainfall duration time until it finally becomes constant. Additionally, {{the depth of}} <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> is quite small, only several centimeters or millimeters, which is {{in accordance with the}} actual case.|$|R
30|$|Figure  2 {{shows the}} {{relations}} of h[*]+[*]l against rainfall intensity. For a given slope, h[*]+[*]l increase with increasing duration of rainfall. The larger rainfall intensity, the faster the h[*]+[*]l increase rate, and the earlier the time for <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> generation, resulting in higher <b>overland</b> water <b>flow</b> depth.|$|R
50|$|When {{the soil}} is {{saturated}} and the depression storage filled, and rain continues to fall, the rainfall will immediately produce surface runoff. The level of antecedent soil moisture is one factor affecting the time until soil becomes saturated. This runoff is called saturation excess <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> or saturated <b>overland</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E

50|$|Surface and {{subsurface}} sources: Stream discharge {{is derived}} from four sources: channel precipitation, <b>overland</b> <b>flow,</b> interflow, and groundwater.|$|E
50|$|In dry regions, cultivated, and {{urbanized}} areas, <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> or {{surface runoff}} {{is usually a}} major source of streamflow. <b>Overland</b> <b>flow</b> is a stormwater runoff that begins as thin layer of water that moves very slowly (typically less than 0.25 feet per second) over the ground. Under intensive rainfall {{and in the absence of}} barriers such as rough ground, vegetation, and absorbing soil, it can mount up, rapidly reaching stream channels in minutes and causing sudden rises in discharge. The quickest response times between rainfall and streamflow occur in urbanized areas where yard drains, street gutters, and storm sewers collect <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> and route it to streams straightaway. Runoff velocities in storm sewer piper can reach 10 to 15 feet per second.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>overland</b> <b>flow</b> is {{directly}} responsible for sediment entrainment but does not form gullies, it is called [...] "sheet erosion".|$|E
50|$|According to geologists {{the origin}} of the lake is {{attributed}} to a number of faults which occurred due to shifting of the earth's crust. This caused blockade of the <b>overland</b> <b>flows</b> and resulted in creation of the lake. The catchment area of the lake, particularly the hills have dense forest cover; the type of forest vegetation consists of chir pine, ban oak and mixed deciduous forests. The basin experiences varying tropical to sub-tropical weather conditions. Precipitation in the basin is very high, mostly occurring during the monsoon period.|$|R

Surface-water hydrology relates the dynamics of flow in surface-water systems (rivers, canals, streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, marshes, arroyos, oceans, etc.).
