In this article we present a novel decision procedure that refines formula abstractions with lemmas on demand.

Unlike traditional lazy SMT approaches, where lemmas are added on the boolean abstraction layer, <b>our</b> <b>decision</b> procedure adds lemmas in TB. We discuss <b>our</b> <b>decision</b> procedure in detail. In particular, we prove soundness and completeness, and discuss complexity.

40|$|We {{show that}} the satisfiability problem for the "symbolic heap" {{fragment}} of separation logic with general inductively defined predicates - which includes most fragments employed in program verification - is decidable. <b>Our</b> <b>decision</b> procedure {{is based on the}} computation of a certain fixed point from the definition of an inductive predicate, called its "base", that exactly characterises its satisfiability. A complexity analysis of <b>our</b> <b>decision</b> procedure shows that it runs, in the worst case, in exponential time. In fact, we {{show that the}} satisfiability problem for our inductive predicates is EXPTIME-complete, and becomes NP-complete when the maximum arity over all predicates is bounded by a constant. Finally, we provide an implementation of <b>our</b> <b>decision</b> procedure, and analyse its performance both on a synthetically generated set of test formulas, and on a second test set harvested from the separation logic literature.

2500|$|Russell Hardin rejects such arguments. He {{argues that}} it is {{possible}} to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism (which is [...] "to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these") from our ability to correctly apply rational principles which will among other things [...] "depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor's mental equipment." [...] The fact that the latter is limited and can change doesn't mean that the former has to be rejected. [...] "If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends, it does not follow that we then must change our ethics.

On several examples, we show that optimization under such granularity restriction indeed leads to observed human decision making.

2500|$|Rabbenu Asher possessed [...] "methodical and systematic" [...] Talmudic knowledge, and was {{distinguished}} for {{his ability}} to adumbrate long Talmudic discussions. The ROSH, influenced by his teacher Rabbi Meir, was averse to lenient decisions in halakha, even when theoretically justified. (Several of his rulings which may appear lenient, are actually strictures: his decision against praying more than three times a day is, in fact, limiting. Similarly, his assertion that the phrase halacha le-Moshe me-Sinai—"an oral law revealed to Moses on Sinai"—does not always bear a literal meaning but often signifies a universally adopted custom, is not usually taken as a liberal interpretation.) The ROSH was, however, known for his independent legal reasoning: [...] "We must not be guided in <b>our</b> <b>decisions</b> by the admiration of great men, and {{in the event of a}} law not being clearly stated in the Talmud, we are not bound to accept it, even if it be based on the works of the Geonim."

2500|$|Nor {{could the}} DSL survive {{because it was}} {{functionally}} indistinguishable from the post-Booker sentencing scheme in place for federal crimes. [...] Just as federal judges have discretion to impose a [...] "reasonable" [...] sentence by referring {{to a set of}} broad criteria, the Black court reasoned, California trial judges have broad discretion to impose a sentence within a predetermined range. [...] But this characterization of the DSL was not accurate, for California had adopted [...] "sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges between them. [...] Cunningham's sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sentence within the range of 6 to 16 years. [...] Her instruction was to select 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless she found facts allowing the imposition of a sentence of 6 or 16 years. [...] Factfinding to elevate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, <b>our</b> <b>decisions</b> make plain, falls within the province of the jury employing a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a judge determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies."

[...] Canadian leaders believed Canada was a middle power because it was a junior partner in larger alliances (e.g. NATO, NORAD), was actively involved in resolving disputes outside its own region (e.g. Suez Crisis), was not a former colonial power and therefore neutral in anti-colonial struggles, worked actively in the United Nations to represent the interests of smaller nations and to prevent the dominance of the superpowers (often being elected to the United Nations Security Council for such reasons), and because it was involved in humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts around the world.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{found that}} {{according}} to precedent, government officials could not {{be held liable for}} the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior and that because vicarious liability was inapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution. To do so, the Court found, [...] "Where the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, <b>our</b> <b>decisions</b> make clear the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 540–541 (1993) (First Amendment); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment). Under extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires more than “intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.” Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979). It instead involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course of action [...] "'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' [...] adverse effects upon an identifiable group." [...] Ibid.

60|$|If an Author, by {{any single}} composition, has {{impressed}} us with {{respect for his}} talents, {{it is useful to}} consider this as affording a presumption, that on other occasions where we have been displeased, he, nevertheless, may not have written ill or absurdly; and further, to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us to review what has displeased us, with more care than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it. This is not only an act of justice, but, in <b>our</b> <b>decisions</b> upon poetry especially, may conduce, in a high degree, to the improvement of our own taste: for an accurate taste in poetry, and in all the other arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed, is an acquired talent, which can only be produced by thought and a long-continued intercourse with the best models of composition. This is mentioned, not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced Reader from judging for himself, (I have already said that I wish him to judge for himself;) but merely to temper the rashness of decision, and to suggest, that, if Poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the judgment may be erroneous; and that, in many cases, it necessarily will be so.|$|E
60|$|Though {{so little}} use can be made, in science, of {{approximate}} generalizations, {{except as a}} stage {{on the road to}} something better, for practical guidance they are often all we have to rely on. Even when science has really determined the universal laws of any phenomenon, not only are those laws generally too much encumbered with conditions to be adapted for everyday use, but the cases which present themselves in life are too complicated, and <b>our</b> <b>decisions</b> require to be taken too rapidly, to admit of waiting till the existence of a phenomenon can be proved by what have been scientifically ascertained to be universal marks of it. To be indecisive and reluctant to act, because we have not evidence of a perfectly conclusive character to act on, is a defect sometimes incident to scientific minds, but which, wherever it exists, renders them unfit for practical emergencies. If we would succeed in action, we must judge by indications which, though they do not generally mislead us, sometimes do, and must make up, as far as possible, for the incomplete conclusiveness of any one indication, by obtaining others to corroborate it. The principles of induction applicable to approximate generalization are therefore a not less important subject of inquiry than the rules for the investigation of universal truths; and might reasonably be expected to detain us almost as long, were it not that these principles are mere corollaries from those which have been already treated of.|$|E
