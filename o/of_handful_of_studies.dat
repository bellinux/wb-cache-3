Here we provide {{information}} on breeding phenology, the length of incubation and nestling periods, parental care, and nesting success of the Star-throated Antwren, Rhopias gularis, an Atlantic Forest endemic. The data are discussed in light of life history theories. We found 27 active nests during two breeding seasons (2013 / 2014 and 2014 / 2015) at Carlos Botelho State Park in southeastern Brazil. Nesting activities were observed from September to January. Incubation and nestling periods lasted 16. 8 ± 0. 6 and 11. 0 ± 0. 86 days, respectively, as with most other antbirds. Males and females shared equally in incubation and nestling provisioning. The small clutch size of two eggs is that most commonly found in tropical birds and is hypothesized to have evolved due to increased nest predation rates. However, our data was not consistent with this hypothesis as the nest survival probability was high (57 %).

A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009 The main {{objective}} <b>of</b> this <b>study</b> was {{to answer the}} following question: What are the factors that impact volunteer participation in California Department ofAging (CDA) programs? There are many studies on volunteerism; however, with the exception <b>of</b> a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies,</b> information specific to CDA program volunteers is sparse. Therefore, the study also aimed to describe the current volunteers of CDA programs and their specific contributions by incorporating questions about personal and environmental factors associated with volunteering in general. This would help CDA assess whether it is meeting its objective of involving community members of all ages and backgrounds to participate as volunteers in their programs, as well as how to improve retention. Given California 's rapidly aging population and the fiscal conditions in the State, volunteers will remain an important component in sustaining these programs. Data was obtained through a web-based survey. Responses were collectedfrom volunteers who participate in CDA administered programs across various regions of the State. The main results <b>of</b> the <b>study</b> suggest that the most significant reasons for volunteerism are related to the values individuals hold and their perception of the program quality and effectiveness. The study also reveals that the demographic makeup of volunteers who participate in these programs is generally not diverse. These results suggest that, to improve retention, programs should develop techniques that acknowledge how the contributions of volunteers affect the quality and effectiveness of these programs. However, given the relatively small sample of responses, {{further research is needed to}} determine the full makeup of CDA volunteers. Therefore, CDA may find it beneficial to conduct a more comprehensive survey of its volunteers in the near future. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The key {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to test how two trust dimensions (cognition-based trust and affect-based trust) mediate the effects of three personal characteristics (psychological distance, the marketing manager's sales experience, and the marketing manager's relative level of formal education) on the following outcome variables: dysfunctional conflict, functional conflict, and perceived relationship effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on the interaction approach, the paper develops a conceptual framework to better understand the nature of the working relationship between marketing managers and sales managers. In total, it develops and test 13 hypotheses. Partial least squares was used to assess the validity of the measures, and to estimate the structural model. Using a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 101 marketing managers in Australia. Findings – The hypothesized model has high explanatory power and it was found that both trust dimensions strongly affected all three outcome variables. However, though both forms of trust were positively related to perceived relationship effectiveness, affect-based trust had the strongest impact on this outcome. The results also confirm that both cognition- and affect-based trust have negative effects on dysfunctional conflict, and strong positive effects on functional conflict. In addition to these new findings, the paper shows that while psychological distance has a strong negative impact on cognition-based trust, it has no impact on affect-based trust. Moreover, it was found that when marketing managers had greater levels of sales experience, it increased their affect-based trust but it had no impact on cognition-based trust. Finally, the marketing manager's relative level of formal education had no impact on either forms of trust.

Tadpole survival was unaffected by the pesticides but was reduced by Bd. Atrazine monotonically (i. e., consistently increasing or decreasing) reduced Bd in culture and on tadpoles, and every concentration tested (0. 0106 − 106 μg/L) significantly reduced Bd growth compared to controls. Chlorothalonil had a nonmonotonic (i. e., nonlinear) effect on Bd growth both in culture and on tadpoles, where low (0. 0176 − 1. 76 μg/L) and high (32 − 176 μg/L) concentrations inhibited Bd growth significantly more than did intermediate concentrations (8. 2 − 17. 6 μg/L) and controls.

Although expedient relationships {{may be the best}} available, their predictions are of only limited utility for policy analysis and regulatory purposes, because they account for very little variance in the association between environmental noise and sleep disturbance, have characteristically shallow slopes, have not been well validated in field settings, are highly context-dependent, and do not squarely address the roles and relative importance of nonacoustic factors in sleep disturbance.

The <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> that have focused on the wage impact of disabilities have either not fully incorporated the probability of employment into the analysis or have not correctly decomposed the wage differences in light of selectivity corrections. After estimating a two-stage model of the probability of employ-ment followed by a wage equation for men with and without disabilities, I use Newman and Oaxaca?s (2004) method to correctly decompose the distributions.

The results from <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> the Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP) of 1984, 1990, 1996 and 2001 indicate that the employment and wage gaps between the disabled and the non-disabled have risen sharply over time, {{both before and after the}} passage of the ADA.

It is characterized by a low effective population size, > 10 -fold lower than that of D. simulans, which ranks D. sechellia as the least genetically diverse Drosophila species. No obvious population subdivision was detected despite its fragmented geographic distribution on different islands. We used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to test for demographic scenarios compatible with the geological history of the Seychelles and the ecology of D. sechellia.

We estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations of morphological (fork length, pectoral and pelvic fin ray counts, and gill arch raker counts) and life-history (egg number and individual egg weight) traits of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) from Likes Creek, Alaska, in order to characterize the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in this species. Families were created from wild-caught adults, raised to the fry stage in the lab, released into the wild, and caught as returning adults and assigned to families using microsatellite loci and a growth hormone locus. Morphological traits were all moderately to highly heritable, but egg number and egg weight were not heritable, suggesting that past selection has eliminated additive genetic variation in egg number and egg weight or that there is high environmental variance in these traits. Genetic correlations were similar for nonadjacent morphological traits and adjacent traits. Genetic correlations predicted phenotypic correlations fairly accurately, but some pairs of traits with low genetic correlations had high phenotypic correlations, and vice versa, emphasizing the need to use caution when using phenotypic correlations as indices of genetic correlations.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to outline the main traits of the population geography of the Central Asian Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The report investigates the geographical characteristics of the countries’ vital statistics, as well as of other significant demographic indicators, such as the age structure, dependency ratio and infant mortality. Additionally, the report attempts to establish whether particular regional and local demographies show inter-linkages with the specific socio-economic and/or cultural settings that they are embedded in. The report uses the systematic collection and analysis of data from statistical sources as its main method. Most of the statistical materials derive from the national statistical authorities of the USSR and its successor states, although additional and complementary data was collected from the US Bureau of Census’ international database web resource. The use of such data involves substantial methodological and interpretative difficulties, which this report discusses in detail. Applying a three-scale geographical approach on the <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the Central Asian Republics’ population development, this report demonstrates that there are significant variations in the territoriality of these countries’ demographies.

These challenges should be taken into greater consideration by policy-makers and other stakeholders, along with matters of more immediate concern, such as the poor health infrastructure and sanitary situation, the high rate of poverty, environmental degradation, and the economic and political instability in the southern regions, most recently epitomized by the Ferghana valley-based “tulip” revolution in Kyrgyzstan and the violent riots in the Uzbek city of Andijan.

40|$|July 2013. A Dissertation Submitted to the Faculty of The Graduate School of The University of Missouri In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Carol Gilles. Vita. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This 14 -month long {{institutional}} ethnography {{seeks to}} understand how the work of recovery from serious mental illnesses is impacted by both limited literacy and the ruling relations found within a state-run long-term forensic mental health institution. It included 22 adults receiving treatment in the state's maximum and intermediate forensic mental heath facility for serious and persistent mental illnesses. All of the participants had been involuntarily committed to the hospital by either the courts or their families or guardians. Using methods that aligned with institutional ethnography, this study was conducted in four phases. These phases included observations, interviews, collecting artifacts, assessing clients' literacy skills, analyzing the text given to clients, and data analysis. Findings indicate that a complex set of ruling relations and level of literacy skills directly influence clients' recovery work. As a result, those clients who lacked literacy skills of an average middle school student were often unable to independently access many of the treatment tools that required them to read or respond to text. However, when clients could read well enough to understand and respond in writing to treatment texts, they not only had more access to treatment tools, but also had a greater sense of agency, more choice regarding their treatment, and were able to negotiate with their treatment teams. The ruling relations governing treatment often inhibited treatment efficacy and efficiency. This <b>study</b> is one <b>of</b> a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> in the United States that directly explores how limited literacy skills impact treatment efficacy; as such, it has many implications. It adds knowledge to the dearth of literature on the topic of literacy and mental health, and it makes clear the disparities between the intentions of scripted mental health treatment programs and the actualities of the clients' work of recovery, especially when they have limited literacy skills.

The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. This study piloted an intervention using attribution retraining and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to promote positive learning experiences and outcomes for students. This research is an important step to revitalise the dwindling field of attribution retraining research by assessing whether these techniques effectively improve student learning in modern classrooms. Participants were 50 students from grades five and six (age 10 - to 12 -years-old). Findings revealed that students in the intervention group showed significantly greater average reading levels compared to their control group peers at two months following the intervention. Whilst no other areas measured (mathematics, spelling, and self-concept) reached the level of significance, a number of interesting patterns were observed regarding student selection, intervention focus, and the trajectory of treatment effects. These findings encourage future researchers to expand the range of students targeted by school-based interventions, supports the use of attribution techniques, and highlights that without follow-up data, lagged treatment effects may go undetected. This is one <b>of</b> only a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> to combine attribution retraining with cognitive behavioral therapy, and the results <b>of</b> this pilot <b>study</b> support the need for further research in this area...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{relationships}} that underlie many stable mammalian groups often occur between philopatric kin. Although stable groups of nonrelatives {{appear to be}} less common, there is increasing evidence that social bonds between nonkin may confer sufficient intrinsic fitness benefits for these groups to persist. Here we evaluate whether social stability occurs in a bisexually dispersing species where social bonds {{have been shown to}} have reproductive benefits: the feral horse, Equus caballus. First, we quantified female social stability by applying a three-level framework to a 3 -year data set of associations in semiferal ponies; this tested for stability at the individual, dyadic and subpopulation levels. Despite the relative weakness of these female bonds, we found significant social stability across all levels, as shown by stable association preferences, social networks and individual network positions. Second, we investigated how seasonality impacts on social bond strength and grouping patterns. We found seasonal fluctuations in female gregariousness, with a peak during the mating season. We therefore propose that significant social stability in female horses is coupled with a degree of flexibility that allows for effects of ecological fluctuations. Although social network analysis is widely used in behavioural ecological research, this is one <b>of</b> only a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> to assess the temporal dynamics of networks over a significant timescale. Temporal stability in female relationships suggests that equid social structures are multifaceted: although bonds between stallions and mares are clearly strong, long-term relationships between mares underpin the social network structure. We suggest this framework could be used to assess social stability in other group-living species in order to improve our {{understanding of the nature of}} social bonds...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a multioutput generalization of the Lichtenberg-Zilberman damage-control technology. The dual {{representation of the}} technology is shown to be conditionally additive {{in the price of}} abatement activities and other prices. An econometric procedure for estimating the dual technology is developed and applied to an aggregate U. S. agricultural data set. The conditionally additive nature of the model allows estimation of pest damage from the dual technology. Our estimates of aggregate U. S. pest damage are much lower than previous estimates. Key words: abatement, pest damage, pesticides, productivity. Debates over pesticide policy hinge critically on productivity issues; the extent to which pes-ticide use should be curtailed to protect {{human health and the environment}} depends in part on the extent to which food and fiber production would fall. And because governments are reluc-tant to impose disproportionately large taxes, whether taxes or direct regulation should be used depends on the price responsiveness of pesticide demand. Existing empirical information on pesticide productivity and pesticide demand is, at best, inadequate. Econometric methods have been the basis <b>of</b> only a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies.</b> Instead most analyses rely on "expert " assessments for information on alternative production systems and changes in crop damage, despite the fact that these assessments estimate average rather than marginal productivity, do not take into ac-count adjustments by individual farmers, are subject to political biases, and have often proven wrong in retrospect. Lichtenberg and Zilberman (LZ) have pro-posed an econometric framework for estimating pesticide technologies that recognizes the pecu-liar role pesticides playas damage-control agents. Babcock, Lichtenberg, and Zilberman have applied the LZ damage-control framework to North Carolina apple production using an ex...|$|R

The southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina, hereafterSES), the largest phocid, is a major predator of the southern ocean feeding on myctophidsand cephalopods. Because of its large size it can carry bio-loggers with minimal disturbance. Moreover, it has great diving abilities and a wide foraging habitat. Thus, the SES is a wellsuited model species to study predator diving behaviour {{and the distribution of}} ecologicallyimportant prey species in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we examined how SESs adjusttheir diving behaviour and horizontal movements in response to fine scale prey encounterdensities using high resolution accelerometers, magnetometers, pressure sensors andGPS loggers. When high prey encounter rates were encountered, animals responded by (1) diving and returning to the surface with steeper angles, reducing the duration of transit divephases (thus improving dive efficiency), and (2) exhibiting more horizontally and verticallysinuous bottom phases. In these cases, the distance travelled horizontally at the surfacewas reduced. This behaviour is likely to counteract horizontal displacement from water currents,as they try to remain within favourable prey patches. The prey encounter rate at thebottom of dives decreased with increasing diving depth, suggesting a combined effect ofdecreased accessibility and prey density with increasing depth. Prey encounter rate alsodecreased when the bottom phases of dives were spread across larger vertical extents ofthe water column. This result suggests that the vertical aggregation of prey can regulateprey density, and as a consequence impact the foraging success of SESs.

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} {{on education and}} aspirations has been produced with the sole focus on the reproduction of class inequalities within a White middle class structure. There has only been a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> analytic engagement with Black professional middle class parents' expectations and aspirations regarding their children's futures in Britain. This gap creates an opportunity for new research to gain deeper insight into what decisions and choices are made by Black professional middle class parents and bring to light important knowledge of professional middle class educational attainment. The research presented here explored how Black professional middle class parents’ construct strategic approaches towards creating better futures for their children within a predominantly White middle class structure. Drawing on primary data taken from interviews with 25 Black African and Black Caribbean middle class parents’ (half from African or Caribbean heritage), this thesis analyses parents’ strategic decision making and navigation in an unequal playing field of education. Findings indicate adaptations of Bourdieu’s social, cultural and economic capitals to prepare and engage their children along certain pathways {{in order to create}} aspirational opportunities. Using Critical Race Theory (CRT) it is argued that while class is very influential in explaining educational attainment, understanding Black professional middle class parents’ aspirations for their children requires a deeper understanding of race. Evidence from in-depth narratives provided an insight into parents' own biographies that were either originally working or middle class backgrounds in shaping their orientations to, and manner of engagement with, their children's futures. Drawing from the data middle class parents were beginning to be geographically mobile, moving out of inner London areas in search of a better quality of life for their children and a preferred school choice – with a higher quality of education found around the surrounding areas of London and the South East suburbs. Parents’ subjective biographies illustrated diverse parenting practices and values such as those sets of parents using their Christian faith to help build a solid foundation for moral values, self-confidence and respectability. The research offers new insights into the choices made and strategic approaches used to nurture high aspirations for Black professional middle class children’s futures...|$|R
40|$|How big {{an impact}} has the Iraq War had on American electoral politics? That {{question}} {{has been the focus}} <b>of</b> a <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> recent <b>studies</b> analyzing the 2004 presidential election and the 2006 House and Senate elections. To date, scholars have largely employed aggregate data, at the county and congressional district level, for their analyses. The findings from those efforts strongly suggest that the Iraq War has hurt Republican candidates and has had its most substantial effects in locales experiencing a larger number of war deaths. The authors of these articles, however, acknowledge the limitations of relying solely on aggregate data. In this paper, we evaluate the importance of the Iraq war on the 2006 elections through an analysis of voter opinion and behavior, and answer questions that earlier works could not address. In political science, researchers regularly face unit of analysis issues. Within the political behavior sub-field this problem can be most troubling. If appropriate survey or experimental data are not available, scholars often turn to aggregate data. This is frequently the case when one wishes to test some behavioral relationship after the event has occurred. Depending on aggregate analysis alone, always leaves one uncertain about whether the results hold at the individual level. Especially when others discuss or cite the findings, they all too easily can step on the slippery slope of drawing individual inferences from aggregate data. In addition, although there are some advantages of the aggregate analysis, especially in the ability to make comparisons over time, reliance of aggregate data often deprives one of developing the level of specification that one might obtain with individual level data. In this manuscript, we analyze Polimetrix survey data regarding the 2006 midterm elections as they relate to vote choice and attitudes about the Iraq War. We compare the results from the survey data with previously reported aggregate research on the effects of the Iraq War deaths and the legislative roll-call vote authorizing the Iraq War on the 2006 midterm House an...|$|R
