50|$|Sensor nodes {{often make}} use of ISM band, which gives free radio, {{spectrum}} allocation and global availability. The possible choices of wireless transmission media are radio frequency (RF), optical communication (laser) and infrared. Lasers require less energy , but need line-of-sight for communication and are sensitive to atmospheric conditions. Infrared, like lasers, needs no antenna but it is limited in its broadcasting capacity. Radio frequency-based communication is the most relevant that fits most of the WSN applications. WSNs tend to use license-free communication frequencies: 173, 433, 868, and 915 MHz; and 2.4 GHz. The functionality of both transmitter and receiver are combined into a single device known as a transceiver. Transceivers often lack unique identifiers. The <b>operational</b> <b>states</b> are transmit, receive, idle, and sleep. Current generation transceivers have built-in state machines that perform some operations automatically.|$|E

50|$|Though {{the term}} BTS can be {{applicable}} {{to any of the}} wireless communication standards, it is generally associated with mobile communication technologies like GSM and CDMA. In this regard, a BTS forms part of the base station subsystem (BSS) developments for system management. It may also have equipment for encrypting and decrypting communications, spectrum filtering tools (band pass filters), etc. antennas may also be considered as components of BTS in general sense as they facilitate the functioning of BTS. Typically a BTS will have several transceivers (TRXs) which allow it to serve several different frequencies and different sectors of the cell (in the case of sectorised base stations). A BTS is controlled by a parent base station controller via the base station control function (BCF). The BCF is implemented as a discrete unit or even incorporated in a TRX in compact base stations. The BCF provides an operations and maintenance (O&M) connection to the network management system (NMS), and manages <b>operational</b> <b>states</b> of each TRX, as well as software handling and alarm collection.

5000|$|A systems {{philosophy}} formalism for {{representing the}} logic of the control of systems, USL is based on a set of axioms of a general systems control theory with formal rules for its application. At the base of every USL system is a set of six axioms and the assumption of a universal set of objects. The axioms provide the formal foundation for a USL [...] "hierarchy" [...] - referred to as a map, which is a tree of control that spans networks of relations between objects. Explicit rules for defining a map have been derived from the axioms, where - among other things - structure, behavior, and their integration are captured. Each axiom defines a relation of immediate domination of a parent over its children. The union of these relations is control. Among other things, the axioms establish the relationships of an object for invocation in time and space, input and output (domain and codomain), input access rights and output access rights (domain access rights and codomain access rights), error detection and recovery, and ordering during its developmental and <b>operational</b> <b>states.</b> Every system can ultimately be defined in terms of three primitive control structures, each of which is derived from the six axioms - resulting in a universal semantics for defining systems.|$|E
5000|$|The sampler/pulser circuit {{has three}} {{distinct}} <b>operational</b> <b>states</b> {{determined by the}} voltage level of the control signal, Control. The circuit transitions sequentially through all three states as the voltage level of the control signal, Control, falls from an initial voltage that {{is greater than the}} fixed input voltage V3, to the second state in which Control is between the voltage of the fixed input voltage V3 and the fixed voltage V2, to the third state in which Control's voltage is less than fixed voltage V2. Typically V2 can be approximately between one and two volts higher than voltage V1, and V3 can be approximately between one and two volts higher than V2. The control signal, Control, typically begins at a voltage level that is approximately the voltage level of Vdd, the power supply. The voltage level of Vdd is typically one to three volts higher than V3. At the time one desires to create a sampling aperture or pulse, the control signal is slewed in a negative direction, so that it ultimately ends up at a voltage that is less than V2. If the control signal is initially greater than V3 by more than a few tenths of a volt, transistor Q9 and Q10 are [...] "on" [...] (biased into the forward conduction region) and transistors Q7 and Q8 are [...] "off" [...] (biased so that essentially no current flows), resulting in the output nodes being pulled up to Vdd, causing the sampling gate to be turned [...] "off" [...] (the output nodes contain no signal). Similarly, if the level of the control signal {{at the end of its}} falling transition is less than V2 by a few tenths of a volt, transistors Q11 and Q12 are [...] "on" [...] and transistors Q5 and Q6 are [...] "off", resulting in the output nodes being pulled up to Vdd, and the sampling gate again being turned off. However, during the active falling of the control signal, when the control signal is between V2 and V3, transistors Q5, Q6, Q7, and Q8 are all [...] "on" [...] (and Q9, Q10, Q11, and Q12 all [...] "off") resulting in the sampling gate being turned on. In this case, the differential input signal across the input terminals IN+ and INâˆ’ is multiplied by the circuit gain to generate a differential output signal across OUT+ and OUTâˆ’ terminals.|$|E

In achieving these objectives, opinions of maintenance officers and users of randomly selected banks were sampled through structured questionnaires. Â The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The analysisÂ revealed the <b>operational</b> <b>state</b> of bank buildings in Lagos State as good, there is no significantÂ difference {{in the perception of}} the maintenance staff and users as to the <b>operational</b> <b>state.</b> Â However, there is significant difference in the <b>operational</b> <b>state</b> of {{the old and the new}} generation bank buildings as the study reveals that the components and services of theÂ buildings of the new generation banks are in better <b>operational</b> <b>state</b> than those of the oldÂ generation bank buildings. Maintenance officers ranked attitude of users and misuse ofÂ facilities as the most significant factor affecting maintenance management of bank buildingsÂ while users of the buildings ranked lack of discernable maintenance culture in the country as the most significant factor responsible for poor maintenance management of bank buildings. Â The perception of the maintenance staff and users of bank buildings as regards factorsÂ responsible for poor maintenance management of bank buildings are significantly different. Â The study recommended proactive measures to keep hypothesized factors under check inÂ other to overcome the prevailing maintenance problems of bank buildings. Top management are to provide adequate funding for the running of maintenance operations and such fundsÂ should be properly monitored to ensure that it is judiciously utilized. </div...|$|R

CNC machining systems are inevitably confronted with frequent changes in energy behaviors because they are widely used to produce various machining tasks.

To this end, this paper proposes a method to model the flexible energy behaviors in CNC machining systems based on a HOONet.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a novel technique to represent in a reduced, or compact, way short term uncertainty in Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP). Uncertainty reduction is handled {{by means of}} "snapshot selection". Instead of taking into account all the possible <b>operational</b> <b>states</b> and their associated optimal power flow, a reduced group of them is selected that is representative of all the states that should have an influence on investment decisions. Considering this reduced group of <b>operational</b> <b>states</b> should lead to the same investment decisions {{as if all the}} snapshots in the target year were considered. Original <b>operational</b> <b>states</b> are compared in the space of the benefits produced by potential reinforcements considered, which are relevant drivers for investment decisions.

A clustering algorithm is used to group together those <b>operational</b> <b>states</b> where similar line benefits are realized.

Modern advanced power strips can provide energy saving solutions by applying different kinds of sensors to monitor the user activities and make the decision to cut off the power source of the controlled outlet. However, normally this kind of solution needs a long trigger time and has less accuracy due to the differences in user behavior.
