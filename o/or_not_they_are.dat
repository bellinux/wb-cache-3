5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in therapy, and whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> currently on medication.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Voyager encounters a swarm of space-borne lifeforms, which mistake the vessel for a member of their species. The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes (Jennifer Lien), causing her and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) to question whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> ready to have children.|$|E
5|$|A young German rocket {{scientist}} who Edward befriends {{some time after}} arriving in Munich. He is similar in name and appearance to Edward's brother, Alphonse. He is easygoing and enjoys listening to Edward's stories of his homeworld, and while he doubts whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> true and is hurt by how distant Edward behaves, he is nonetheless supportive of his efforts. He suffers from a fatal lung disease and hopes {{to make a difference}} for the world before he dies. His wish is granted when he helps Edward return to his world through the opened Gate on a rocket before he is fatally shot by Rudolf Hess of the Thule Society.|$|E

5|$|Features {{necessary}} for defending a territory {{such as the}} horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, {{have been found in}} their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date back about eight hundred thousand years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though it is unclear whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as ancient as those found in Cornelia. Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and {{it has been suggested that}} these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo.|$|E
5|$|L.A. Noire {{is notable}} for using Depth Analysis's newly {{developed}} technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology {{is central to}} the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly five million copies combined. L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, a subset of the game's cases for virtual reality support through the HTC Vive, will be released in November 2017.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first to use the newly {{developed}} MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{wide variety}} of musical performances, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> artificially amplified (6, 7, 9, 10), all provide {{entertainment}} irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists (6), choral (2) or orchestral groups (5, 8), or ensemble (3). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers {{as well as of}} their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (5, 8). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate (7, 9). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately (10).|$|E
5|$|Team Bondi {{began to}} develop L.A. Noire {{following}} their founding in 2004. Initially due {{to be published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment, the publishing rights were later handed over to Rockstar Games in September 2006. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between Team Bondi and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. Unlike other games by Rockstar, which run on their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game is notable for being the first to use MotionScan, developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lying. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than US $50 million, which would make {{it one of the most}} expensive video games ever made.|$|E

5000|$|The {{observer}} {{section was}} known informally as the Dixie Mission, {{and it had}} both military and political objectives. The military objectives, broadly, were {{to find out whether}} <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the Communist forces were in fact fighting the Japanese and whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in fact willing to fight under Stilwell's command. The political objectives were, again broadly, to find out how much support the Communists had among the people, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> had in fact turned away from Moscow and were pursuing their own uniquely Chinese vision of a socialist state, and whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sincere about wanting the friendship and support of the United States both during and after the war.|$|R

25|$|In {{the context}} of {{category}} theory, objects are usually at most isomorphicâ€”indeed, a motivation {{for the development of}} category theory was showing that different constructions in homology theory yielded equivalent (isomorphic) groups. Given maps between two objects X and Y, however, one asks if they are equal <b>or</b> <b>not</b> (<b>they</b> <b>are</b> both elements of the set Hom(X,nbsp&Y), hence equality is the proper relationship), particularly in commutative diagrams.|$|E
25|$|Binge eating {{disorder}} is an {{eating disorder}} characterized by frequent and recurrent binge eating episodes with associated negative psychological and social problems, but without subsequent purging episodes (e.g. vomiting).

50|$|Old Persian {{cuneiform}} {{was somewhat}} {{similar to the}} Tartessian script, in that some consonant letters were unique to a particular vowel, some were partially conflated, and some simple consonants, but all vowels were written regardless of whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> redundant.|$|R
