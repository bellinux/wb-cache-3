25|$|Although {{not defined}} by the pendulum, the final length chosen for <b>the</b> metre, 10−7 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pole-to-equator {{meridian}} arc, {{was very close to}} <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seconds</b> pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the official document.

5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second.

The sacrifice in the production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second).</b> Opportunity cost is measured in the number of units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E
