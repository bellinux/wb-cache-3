5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism development strategy focuses <b>on</b> <b>encouraging</b> ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} cutbacks inevitably {{had major}} implications for Gibraltar's economy, which had {{up to that}} point depended largely on defence expenditure. It prompted the territory's government to shift its economic orientation and place a much greater emphasis <b>on</b> <b>encouraging</b> tourism and establishing self-sufficiency. Tourism in Gibraltar was encouraged through refurbishing and pedestrianising key areas of the city, building a new passenger terminal to welcome cruise ship visitors and opening new marinas and leisure facilities. By 2011, Gibraltar was attracting over 10 million visitors a year compared to a population of 29,752, giving it one of the highest tourist-to-resident ratios in the world.|$|E

25|$|Ralph Fesler Gates (February 24, 1893 - July 28, 1978) was the 37th Governor of the U.S. {{state of}} Indiana from 1945 to 1949. A lawyer and veteran of World War I, he is {{credited}} with returning his party to power after the Ku Klux Klan scandal in late 1920s that led to years of Democratic dominance of the state government during the Great Depression. His term in office focused primarily <b>on</b> <b>encouraging</b> economic growth as World War II ended through {{the improvement of the}} state highway system, education reform, and offering incentives for industrial growth. After leaving office he remained active as a leader in the state Republican Party until his death.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{has offered}} {{virtually}} universal {{access to its}} universities and academic colleges since the wave of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s prompted the establishment of numerous tertiary institutions to absorb the additional demand. However, the Arab and ultra-orthodox minorities still attend university in insufficient numbers. The Sixth Higher Education Plan places emphasis <b>on</b> <b>encouraging</b> minority groups to enrol in higher education. Two years after the Mahar programme was implemented in late 2012 for the ultra-orthodox population, student enrolment had grown by 1 400. Twelve new programmes for ultra-orthodox students have since been established, three of them on university campuses. Meanwhile, the Pluralism and Equal Opportunity in Higher Education programme addresses the barriers to integration of the Arab minority in the higher education system. Its scope ranges from providing secondary-school guidance through preparation for academic studies to offering students comprehensive support {{in their first year}} of study, a stage normally characterized by a high drop-out rate. The programme renews the Ma’of fund supporting outstanding young Arab faculty members. Since the introduction of this programme in 1995, the Ma’of fund has opened tenure track opportunities for nearly 100 Arab lecturers, who act as role models for younger Arab students embarking on their own academic careers.|$|E

500|$|I'm Breathless is a jazz, {{swing and}} pop album where Madonna and Sondheim tried to {{recreate}} {{the music of the}} period portrayed in Dick Tracy.

According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , after Madonna's split from husband Sean Penn in 1989, the singer was comfortable in her new relationship with Beatty, which influenced the songs. The singer and Leonard enlisted a ten-piece live band and jazz musicians. The sessions took place at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, California, and concluded by three weeks. The songs on the album reflect Madonna's showgirl personality where her singing ranged from [...] "rootsy, rocking" [...] in nature to slow, [...] "laid-back and soulful" [...] vocals. A studied approach was evident in most of them, which O'Brien compared to [...] "an actress playing a part and performing a vocal exercise in technique". Some of the songs had Madonna pitching her vocals and belting the notes only when necessary. A dryness was prevalent in most of the singing, which was required for the songs and the setting. Guy Pratt, who also played bass, said that the singer [...] "was in character and started smoking. She actually ponced a cigarette off me. Her character smoked, so therefore she did." ...|$|E
