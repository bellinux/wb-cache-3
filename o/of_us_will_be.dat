500|$|In 2015, {{following}} British {{prime minister}} David Cameron's decision to give Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the law against fox hunting, McCartney was quoted: [...] "The people of Britain are behind this Tory government on many things {{but the vast}} majority <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> against them if hunting is reintroduced. It is cruel and unnecessary and will lose them support from ordinary people and animal lovers like myself." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{official}} trailer for X-Men: Days of Future Past {{was released in}} October 2013. Jason Callina of Herald News gave the trailer a positive response, saying, [...] "it is fantastic to see characters that I grew up with in the flesh...we still {{have to wait till}} the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for now they have my interest". Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer for the amount of characters that will appear in the film. Child wrote, [...] "overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map".|$|E
500|$|His on-air {{commentary}} {{has caused}} controversy. As a commentator, Boycott has renewed his 'pull-no-punches' style {{in contrast to}} most of his fellow commentators. In particular he is known for criticising players, often in a caustic and strident style. In 2005 he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch, saying he was a [...] "nice man" [...] for being so generous to the England team. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of stress-related illness; however, he was not always as amiable. In March 2008, recently dropped Steve Harmison attacked Boycott {{in an article in}} The Mail on Sunday where he referred to Boycott as a [...] "waste of space." [...] This was in response to Boycott's statement a few days previously on 19 March 2008 that if Harmison [...] "gets a central contract this summer then a lot <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> screaming favouritism and a total waste of money. England should forget him".|$|E

500|$|In general, Sullivan {{preferred}} {{to write in}} major keys. In the Savoy operas, there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key (less than 5% of the musical numbers), and even in his serious works the major prevails. Examples of Sullivan's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, [...] "Go away, madam" [...] in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect. When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, he replied [...] "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, {{so long as there}} is no offence to the ear." [...] Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in [...] "Expressive glances" [...] (Princess Ida), where he smoothly negotiates E major, C sharp minor and C major, or [...] "Then one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a queen" [...] (The Gondoliers), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} problems within the Beatles' Apple business empire became another divisive issue at this time. From summer 1968 until {{the appointment of}} Allen Klein as business manager in March 1969, McCartney was a regular presence at Apple's central London headquarters, calling staff meetings and urging financial restraint. While noting that all the individual Beatles were demanding employers, Apple press officer Derek Taylor later described McCartney as [...] "the bossiest of the bossy"; according to Tony Bramwell, Apple Records' head of promotions, Lennon and partner Yoko Ono inflicted [...] "their own reign of terror". On 18 January, Disc magazine published what author Peter Doggett describes as [...] "a heroin-fuelled monologue" [...] by Lennon {{in which he said}} of Apple's finances: [...] "If it carries on like this, all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> broke in the next few months." [...] While McCartney sought to appoint his in-laws, New York lawyers Lee and John Eastman, as the band's business advisors, Lennon's outburst attracted the attention of the less conservative Klein. The latter effectively became the Beatles' manager when Harrison and Ringo Starr also chose to put their faith in his tough approach to business. Refusing to acknowledge Klein as his representative, McCartney later cited this division as the first [...] "irreconcilable difference" [...] among the four Beatles, leading to the band's break-up in April 1970.|$|E

[...] "You {{will have}} the whole flock of birds around our heads in a minute, and neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> escape. <b>Be</b> quiet, and I'll go ahead. If I find a way out, I'll come back and help you, if you'll promise {{not to try to}} eat me up again." ...|$|R

2500|$|Leading the {{decimated}} brigade during Pickett's Charge, Marshall's men {{crossed the}} field around the Bliss Farm and Stevens' Run and then crossed the Emmitsburg Rd, coming under withering {{fire at the}} fence line. While crossing the Emmitsburg Road, Marshall turned to Capt. Stockton Heth (son of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth) and said [...] "We do not know which <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> next to fall." [...] Just minutes later, as Marshall neared the stonewall on Cemetery Ridge he was struck in the forehead and killed instantly by two bullets while cheering his men on.|$|E
2500|$|In the Middle Ages {{the birth}} of Jesus as the second Adam {{came to be seen}} in the context of Saint Augustine's Felix culpa (i.e. happy fall) and was {{intertwined}} with the popular teachings on the fall from grace of Adam and Eve. Augustine was fond of a statement on Nativity by Saint Gregory of Nyssa and he quoted in five times: [...] "Venerate the Nativity, through which you are freed from the bonds of an earthly nativity". And he liked to quote: [...] "Just as in Adam all of us died, so too in Christ all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> brought to life".|$|E
2500|$|On several occasions, Umarov firmly {{denied any}} {{involvement}} in indiscriminate attacks against civilians and questioned its legitimacy and value. In a June 2005 interview with Andrei Babitsky, he criticized Basayev for ordering the Beslan raid, saying {{that most of the}} Chechen resistance does not consider the Beslan hostage taking was a legitimate response to Russian actions in Chechnya ("if we resort to such methods, I do not think any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to retain his human face"). Umarov's controversial appointment of Basayev to the post of prime minister in 2006 was precedeed by a public statement rejecting attacks against civilians as a tactic. In another statement in 2004 Umarov wrote: [...] "Our targets are the Russian occupation forces, their military bases, command headquarters and also their local collaborationists who pursue and kill peaceful Muslims. Civil objects and innocent civilians are not our targets." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{finally reached}} Luoyang after {{travelling}} day and night, {{he saw the}} provincial administration's courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, [...] "Sir, are you delivering a document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "Yes." [...] Taishi Ci asked again, [...] "Where is the document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E
