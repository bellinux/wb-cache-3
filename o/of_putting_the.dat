5|$|Overgrazing of meadows (especially by sheep), logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage caused Muir {{to become an}} {{advocate}} for further protection. Muir convinced prominent guests of the importance <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> area under federal protection; one such guest was Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on October 1, 1890. The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite high country.|$|E
5|$|Soon after World War II, amateur radio, {{also called}} ham radio, made its {{appearance}} in Gibraltar.

The annual International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend has as its goal in Gibraltar <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> Europa Point Lighthouse on the air, using the call sign, ZB2LGT.

50|$|Put {{options are}} most {{commonly}} used {{in the stock market}} to protect against the decline of the price of a stock below a specified price. If the price of the stock declines below the specified price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>put</b> option, <b>the</b> owner/buyer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>put</b> has <b>the</b> right, but not the obligation, to sell the asset at the specified price, while <b>the</b> seller <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>put</b> has <b>the</b> obligation to purchase the asset at the strike price if the owner uses the right to do so (the owner/buyer is said to exercise <b>the</b> <b>put</b> or put option). In this way <b>the</b> buyer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>put</b> will receive at least the strike price specified, even if the asset is currently worthless.|$|R

5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the lower tank to be filled first.|$|E
5|$|Following his ousting, Peter the Venetian {{took refuge}} in Germany. In response, Samuel stormed Austria in 1042, {{provoking}} a retaliatory invasion by the German monarch, Henry III in 1043. It forced Samuel to renounce all Hungarian territories {{to the west of}} the rivers Leitha and Morava as well as agree to the payment of a tribute. The funding of the tribute payment was through new taxes on the Christian prelates and seizure of Church estates. This policy caused discontent even among the members of Samuel's own council. He had a number of his councillors executed during Lent. In order to punish the king, Bishop Gerard of Csanád (modern-day Cenad, Romania) refused to perform the annual ceremony <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> royal crown Gerard upon the monarch's head at Easter.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals, or Grits, {{maintained}} {{power in}} the 1851 election, but soon, they were divided by a parliamentary scandal. In September, the government resigned, and a coalition government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Sir Allan MacNab took power. Macdonald did {{much of the work}} <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> government together and served as Attorney General. The coalition which came to power in 1854 became known as the Liberal-Conservatives (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives). In 1855, George-Étienne Cartier of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet. Until Cartier's 1873 death, he would be Macdonald's political partner. In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives. Though {{the most powerful man in}} the government he remained as Attorney General, with Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché as premier.|$|E

5000|$|In finance, a put or {{put option}} is {{a stock market}} device which gives <b>the</b> owner <b>of</b> a <b>put</b> <b>the</b> right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset (the underlying), at a {{specified}} price (the strike), by a predetermined date (the expiry or maturity) to a given party (<b>the</b> seller <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>put).</b> <b>The</b> purchase <b>of</b> a <b>put</b> option is interpreted as a negative sentiment about the future value of theunderlying.

25|$|Another way PSFS taught {{children}} {{to save money}} in savings banks was a program that produced pageants for playgrounds and settlement houses. The pageants included songs about thriftiness set to popular music, cheers, speeches that quoted historical figures' opinions on thriftiness, and a play.
