They were driven by turbines. The voltage was {{stepped up to}} 100,000 volts using three delta-connected <b>oil-cooled</b> transformers of 3,000 kilowatt capacity.

500|$|Each Iore {{consists}} of twin units with one driver's cab at each. They normally operate in fixed units of two, making a pair capable of hauling a [...] ore train. Technically an Iore section is also capable {{to operate as}} single locomotive, an option that is seldom used in operation. The units are fed with [...] via a pantograph. The power is transformed and then converted via a single water-cooled gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor based converter per bogie. The converters belong to the Camilla family, which was developed by ABB's Swiss branch as successor for its <b>oil-cooled</b> converters, and found previous use in the FS Class E464. The converters operate independently, with their own cooling and control systems and are shut down automatically in case of failure. The converters consist of seven line-replaceable unit modules to minimize maintenance costs. Each locomotive has six three-phase asynchronous alternating current traction motors, each rated at [...] and each powering a single axle. This gives a Co′Co′ wheel arrangement.

The OHV pushrod engine has four valves per cylinder, and nickel-ceramic coated cylinder bores. Lubrication is dry sump, with a trochoid pump.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the roof}} are found scissor (double-arm) {{pantographs}} {{of the type}} DBS 54a, standardized for all Einheits classes, mounted on the obligatory roof insulators, {{as well as the}} compressed air main switch and the current-to-voltage converter for the monitoring of the overhead wire voltage. [...] The 3-core transformers are <b>oil-cooled,</b> to which the control unit with its 28 running steps is connected. [...] The acceleration is designed to function in delayed mode, where the engineer chooses the running step, and the control unit will initiate the chosen setting independently. [...] For emergency operation manual control by hand crank is possible. [...] Many locomotives feature thyristor load diverters.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1998, Adtranz {{announced}} its intent to consolidate its product range into seven modular product platforms. [...] The electric locomotive platform with {{the brand name}} [...] "Octeon" [...] was {{to be based on}} Adtranz's newest types for Germany (the Class 145 and Class 101). [...] Adtranz originally intended to introduce Octeon types alongside existing products, and applied the name to its new products outside Germany {{at the end of the}} nineties, like the FS Class E464 or the heavy-haul locomotive Iore. [...] The GTO thyristor based converters of these locomotives were from the water-cooled Camilla family, which was developed by ABB as successor for the <b>oil-cooled</b> converters in the SBB-CFF-FFS Re 460. [...] The Octeon brand name did not catch on and was abandoned when Bombardier acquired Adtranz in 2001.|$|E
2500|$|The GG1 was [...] {{long and}} weighed [...] The {{frame of the}} {{locomotive}} was in two halves joined with a ball and socket joint, allowing the locomotive to negotiate sharper curves. The body rested on the frame and was clad in welded steel plates. The control cabs were {{near the center of}} the locomotive on each side of the main <b>oil-cooled</b> transformer and oil-fired train-heating boiler. This arrangement, first used on the Modified P5 class, provided for greater crew safety in a collision and for bi-directional operation of the locomotive. A pantograph on each end of the locomotive body was used to collect the 25Hz, 11,000V alternating current (AC) from the overhead lines. [...] In operation the leading pantograph was usually kept lowered and the trailing raised to collect current, since if the rear pantograph failed it would not strike the forward pantograph. Transformers between the two cabs stepped down the 11,000V to the voltages needed for the traction motors and other equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{particularly}} elaborate {{arrangement for}} the purifying and heating {{of the heavy}} oil used in the main engine was {{a feature of the}} machinery installation. The ship was powered by an eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engine of the type Sulzer 8SD72-CRDA, which was built under license by [...] Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico in Trieste. Each cylinder had a bore of [...] and a stroke of [...] The engine's normal service rating was 5,600hp at 125 rpm, driving a Karl Zeise right-hand four-bladed propeller of [...] im diameter. The main engine was generally of standard Sulzer design of the crosshead type, with an independent scavenge pump to each cylinder. It was arranged for operation on heavy oil. The only departure from standard was that the fuel valves had special provisions to enable the fuel to be circulated. The pistons were <b>oil-cooled</b> and the jackets fresh water-cooled. On the starboard side of the engine-room were three AEG 160kW 120-volt generators, each driven by a Sulzer four-stroke Diesel engine. The emergency set comprised a Motorenwerke Mannheim AG generator driving a two-cylinder 31hp engine which drives a 20kW AEG generator, also a two-stage compressor capable of delivering 26 CU.m. of free air per hour. The fuel consumption of the vessel, when running at full speed and on heavy oil, was 24 tons a day, while the Diesel-oil consumption of the three generators was approximately three tons per day. Adele and her sister ship Amelia had for cargo ships of that time a powerful drive: normally they ran with , but their top speed was [...]|$|E
2500|$|Each {{locomotive}} was {{powered by}} two Maybach 1035hp (D800–802) or 1135hp (D803–829, D831–832 and D866–870) MD650 engines coupled to Mekydro hydraulic transmissions. Although these diesel engines were of German Maybach design, they were physically manufactured by Bristol Siddeley at their factory at Ansty, near Coventry, under licence. The lower engine rating {{in the first}} three was because the first batch of transmissions could not accept more than this; a shortcoming swiftly rectified, although the technology of the time limited hydraulic transmissions to below [...] input, hence the need for two engines. D830 Majestic was equipped with two Paxman YJXL Ventura engines rated at [...] each as a potential showcase of an alternative British-designed engine which might prove superior to the German Maybach. The new locomotives were substantially lighter than previous diesel-electric designs: a Class 44 Peak locomotive weighed [...] and required 8 axles to carry it; the D800s weighed less than 80 tons and only needed 4 axles. D800–802 were produced as a pilot order and differed slightly both mechanically and cosmetically from the others. Aside from the obvious differences of disc versus rollerblind headcodes and the slightly less powerful engines, D800–802 were only equipped with six power controller notches, which was found to be unsatisfactory for smooth acceleration and economical running in operational use. These differences meant D800–802 were effectively a separate sub-class and could not work in multiple with the others (although the [...] "white diamond" [...] code multiple working capability of the Warships was rarely used until the late 1960s, and was removed from many locomotives as a constant source of electrical problems). In 1960 British Rail introduced the Class 43 diesel hydraulic locomotives, with a maximum tractive effort of [...] These were constructed by North British Locomotives, numbered in the range D833 to D865 and also bore names. Although of a very similar design to the Swindon-built examples, the 43s were equipped with MAN engines and Voith hydraulic transmissions at a similar power rating as the Swindon locomotives. The Maybach engines were a more sophisticated design, with advanced features such as <b>oil-cooled</b> pistons that the MAN design lacked. The German V200 class, upon which the D800 design was based, used Mercedes and Maybach engines – the MAN engines were not fitted in significant numbers to V200 locomotives – coupled to Mekydro and Voith transmissions in roughly equal proportions, with engines and transmissions being completely interchangeable. Thus one locomotive might have one Mercedes engine coupled to a Mekydro transmission and a Maybach coupled to a Voith. This interchangeability of engines and transmissions was theoretically a feature of the BR design as well, but was never exploited. Detail differences in the floor construction after the first few Swindon production locomotives removed the ability to exchange transmissions.|$|E
