6000|$|... § LIII. Let {{the reader}} fix this great fact {{well in his}} mind, and then follow out its {{important}} corollaries. We attach, in modern days, a kind of sacredness to the pointed arch and the groined roof, because, while we look habitually <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>square</b> windows and live under flat ceilings, we meet with the more beautiful forms {{in the ruins of}} our abbeys. But when those abbeys were built, the pointed arch was used for every shop door, as well as for that of the cloister, and the feudal baron and freebooter feasted, as the monk sang, under vaulted roofs; not because the vaulting was thought especially appropriate to either the revel or psalm, but because it was then the form in which a strong roof was easiest built. We have destroyed the goodly architecture of our cities; we have substituted one wholly devoid of beauty or meaning; and then we reason respecting the strange effect upon our minds of the fragments which, fortunately, we have left in our churches, as if those churches had always been designed to stand out in strong relief from all the buildings around them, and Gothic architecture had always been, what it is now, a religious language, like Monkish Latin. Most readers know, if they would arouse their knowledge, that this was not so; but they take no pains to reason the matter out: they abandon themselves drowsily to the impression that Gothic is a peculiarly ecclesiastical style; and sometimes, even, that richness in church ornament is a condition or furtherance of the Romish religion. Undoubtedly it has become so in modern times: for there being no beauty in our recent architecture, and much in the remains of the past, and these remains being almost exclusively ecclesiastical, the High Church and Romanist parties have not been slow in availing themselves of the natural instincts which were deprived of all food except from this source; and have willingly promulgated the theory, that because all the good architecture that is now left is expressive of High Church or Romanist doctrines, all good architecture ever has been and must be so,--a piece of absurdity from which, though here and there a country clergyman may innocently believe it, I hope the common sense of the nation will soon manfully quit itself. It needs but little inquiry into the spirit of the past, to ascertain what, once for all, I would desire here clearly and forcibly to assert, that wherever Christian church architecture has been good and lovely, it has been merely the perfect development of the common dwelling-house architecture of the period; that when the pointed arch was used in the street, it was used in the church; when the round arch was used in the street, it was used in the church; when the pinnacle was set over the garret window, it was set over the belfry tower; when the flat roof was used for the drawing-room, it was used for the nave. There is no sacredness in round arches, nor in pointed; none in pinnacles, nor in buttresses; none in pillars, nor in traceries. Churches were larger than most other buildings, because they had to hold more people; they were more adorned than most other buildings, because they were safer from violence, and were the fitting subjects of devotional offering: but they were never built in any separate, mystical, and religious style; they were built in the manner that was common and familiar to everybody at the time. The flamboyant traceries that adorn the façade of Rouen Cathedral had once their fellows in every window of every house in the market-place; the sculptures that adorn the porches of St. Mark's had once their match on the walls of every palace on the Grand Canal; and the only difference between the church and the dwelling-house was, that there existed a symbolical meaning in the distribution of the parts of all buildings meant for worship, and that the painting or sculpture was, in the one case, less frequently of profane subject than in the other. A more severe distinction cannot be drawn: for secular history was constantly introduced into church architecture; and sacred history or allusion generally formed at least one half of the ornament of the dwelling-house.|$|E

In particular, an arbitrary shape can be constructed using an asymptotically optimal number of distinct tile type (related to the shape 2 ̆ 7 s Kolmogorov complexity), after scaling the shape by only a logarithmic factor. By contrast, without the destruction operation, the best such result has a scale factor at least linear in the size of the shape and is connected only by a spanning tree of the scaled tiles.

40|$|Due {{to growth}} of number of storeys in a {{dwelling}} and public buildings for mass gatherings (up to 20 - 25 storeys) requirements of their construction industrialization necessitate designs of precast column joints which are capable to bear high loads (up to 10 - 12 МН and more). The paper presents {{an analysis of}} the known contact joint designs used in the columns of frame buildings and the analysis shows that the these design are rather efficient. However these joints are sensitive to accuracy of column butt end fabrication. Bearing capacity of joints can be significantly decreased in case of comparatively small ends <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>square.</b> It has been decided to introduce a deformable centering laying made of soft steel in a joint design in order to exclude the mentioned disadvantage. Due to its plastic deformation the laying ensures transformation of longitudinal effort occurring in it to the column axis. As a result of it we obtain the most advantageous position for joint design required for transfer of compressing force at column longitudinal axis. Experimental investigations of contact joints with a deformable centering laying have been carried with due account of the requirements to construction standards, results of the executed works and main results of the investigations are presented in the paper. Proposals for calculation and designing of these joints have been given {{on the basis of the}} obtained data and works. It has been shown that application of the centering laying with corresponding concrete confinement reinforcement at the joint make it possible to ensure the required bearing capacity and reliability. </p...|$|E
