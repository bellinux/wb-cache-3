25|$|The mayor battled the country’s {{three major}} oil companies, the partly {{state-owned}} and Saudi Aramco managed Petron, Dutch-owned Pilipinas Shell and Caltex-Chevron. Atienza {{and the city}} council decreed {{that the presence of}} oil distribution depots in the heavily populated district of Pandacan poised as a security and safety danger and issued an eviction notice to the oil companies. The concern was raised after the terror attacks that started on September 11, 2001 that destroyed the World Trade Center in New York. Atienza and the council decreed that the Pandacan district was to be converted from an industrial zone to a residential-commercial zone. A moratorium was set and the <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> agreed to gradually scale down their operations.|$|E
25|$|Though NASCAR {{typically}} promotes {{competition between}} multiple brands, {{including those that}} sponsor the sport and individual races, the sanctioning body provides exclusive protection to its series title sponsors, such as Monster Energy in the Cup Series, as well as current fuel supplier Sunoco. This policy, known as the Viceroy rule, prevents sponsorship from direct competitors within a certain series, although it does not prevent a company from moving to a different series within the sport, or advertising a product that does not directly conflict with the title sponsor. For example, Royal Dutch Shell, Texaco and other <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> been allowed to promote their motor oil brands (Pennzoil and Havoline respectively) but not their gasoline products. When a new title sponsor creates conflicts with existing team sponsors, NASCAR typically allows the team sponsors to remain under a grandfather clause. The rule is named after the British cigarette brand Viceroy, and is {{in reference to the}} 1972 USAC Championship Car season during which title sponsor Marlboro renounced its branding when Viceroy entered the sport to sponsor entries.|$|E

2500|$|Ongoing {{research}} and development involving extraction technology and processing methods have slowly chipped away at many of the barriers to bitumen production. [...] Many Canadian <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> a lot of exposure to heavy oil through assets in Alberta and so they will benefit when research into more efficient and cost effective solutions yields positive results (Petrobank has numerous patents related to extraction technology {{that at least one}} major engineering firm considers 17% more efficient than the widely used steam assisted gravity drainage). [...] In the summer of 2010 a research team at Hokkaido University revealed that they had discovered a catalyst that significantly improves the efficiency while lowering costs related to the processing of bitumen. [...] Also among major Canadian producers, interest in new energy technologies is rising, a direct result of both heightened interest in raising the proportion of the oil sands that can be recovered (10%, which means [...] are at stake) and the growing value of licensing rights. [...] That has resulted in a shift in focus over to patent producing {{research and}} development. [...] Cenovus Energy has used its patents as a tool to negotiate deals.|$|E
