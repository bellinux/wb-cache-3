40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} constitutes {{a powerful and}} innovative force in evolution, but often {{little is known about}} the actual <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>transferred</b> genes. Sequence alignments are generally of limited use in tracking the original donor, since still only a small fraction of the total genetic diversity is thought to be uncovered. Alternatively, approaches based on similarities in the genome specific relative oligonucleotide frequencies do not require alignments. Even though the exact <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> horizontally <b>transferred</b> genes may still not be established using these compositional analyses, it does suggest that compositionally very similar regions are likely to have had a common origin. These analyses have shown that up to a third of large acquired gene clusters that reside in the same genome are compositionally very similar, indicative <b>of</b> a shared <b>origin.</b> This brings us closer to uncovering the original donors <b>of</b> horizontally <b>transferred</b> genes, and could help in elucidating possible regulatory interactions between previously unlinked sequence...|$|R
5000|$|The traA gene {{codes for}} relaxase, {{which is an}} enzyme that initiates plasmid DNA {{transfer}} during bacterial conjugation. Relaxase forms a relaxosome complex with auxiliary proteins to initiate conjugation. Relaxosome binds to the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> (oriT) sequence and cleaves the DNA strand that will be transferred (the T strand).|$|E
50|$|The first DNA helicase ever {{described}} is encoded on the F-plasmid and {{is responsible}} for initiating plasmid transfer. It was originally called E. coli DNA Helicase I, but {{is now known as}} F-plasmid TraI. In addition to being a helicase, the 1756 amino acid (one of the largest in E. coli) F-plasmid TraI protein is also responsible for both specific and non-specific single-stranded DNA binding as well as catalyzing the nicking of single-stranded DNA at the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The F-plasmid is an episome (a plasmid {{that can}} {{integrate}} {{itself into the}} bacterial chromosome by homologous recombination) with a length of about 100 kb. It carries its own origin of replication, the oriV, and an <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer,</b> or oriT. There can only be one copy of the F-plasmid in a given bacterium, either free or integrated, and bacteria that possess a copy are called F-positive or F-plus (denoted F+). Cells that lack F plasmids are called F-negative or F-minus (F−) and as such can function as recipient cells.|$|E

50|$|A relaxase is a single-strand DNA transesterase enzyme {{produced}} by some prokaryotes and viruses. Relaxases {{are responsible for}} site- and strand-specific nicks in double-stranded DNA. Known relaxases belong to the Rolling Circle Replication (RCR) initiator superfamily of enzymes and fall into two broad classes: replicative (Rep) and mobilization (Mob). The nicks {{produced by}} Rep relaxases initiate plasmid or virus RCR. Mob relaxases nick at <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> (oriT) to initiate the process of DNA mobilization and transfer known as bacterial conjugation. Relaxases are so named because the single-stranded DNA nick that they catalyze lead to relaxation of helical tension.|$|E
50|$|Relaxosome is {{the complex}} of {{proteins}} that facilitates plasmids during bacterial conjugation. The proteins are encoded by the tra gene in the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer,</b> oriT, region. The {{most important of}} these proteins is relaxase, which is responsible for beginning the conjugation process by cutting at the nic site via transesterification. This nicking results in a DNA-Protein complex with the relaxosome bound to a single strand of the plasmid DNA and an exposed 3' hydroxyl group. Relaxase also unwinds the plasmid being conjugated with its helicase properties. The relaxosome interacts with integration host factors within the oriT.|$|E
50|$|PFF1 {{consists}} of an origin of replication, oriV, an <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer,</b> oriT, a gene coding for plasmid replication proteins, trfA, and two antibiotic resistance genes, bla and cat, which confer resistance to Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol, respectively. Minimal plasmids such as PFF1 are useful for studying the basic mechanisms of plasmid replication and copy number regulation, as there are less superfluous genetic elements which might affect the processes being studied. Several mutants of PFF1 which affect the copy number of the plasmid have been identified. Two such mutants, PFF1cop254D and PFF1cop271C, increase the copy number of PFF1 in E. coli from approximately 39-40 to about 501 and 113 plasmids per cell, respectively. An increase in copy number is useful for genetic engineering applications to increase the production yield of recombinant protein.|$|E
40|$|Integrative and conjugative {{elements}} (ICEs) {{are particularly}} interesting model systems for horizontal gene transfer, because they normally reside {{in an integrated}} state in the host chromosome but can excise and self-transfer under particular conditions, typically requiring exquisite regulatory cascades.

Recently we reported that ICEclc, a 103 kb ICE of Pseudomonas knackmussii B 13, has two active <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> (oriTs), which is very much unlike conjugative plasmids that usually employ a single oriT.

50|$|In {{conjugation}} {{mediated by}} Hfr cells, transfer of DNA {{starts at the}} <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> (oriT) located within the F factor and then continues clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the orientation of F factor in the chromosome. Therefore, the length of chromosomal DNA transferred into the F− cell {{is proportional to the}} time that conjugation is allowed to happen. This results in sequential transfer of genes on the bacterial chromosome. Bacterial geneticists make use of this principle to map the genes on the bacterial chromosome. This technique is called interrupted mating as geneticists allow conjugation to take place for different periods of time before stopping conjugation with a high-speed blender. By using Hfr and F− strains with one strain carrying mutations in several genes, each affecting a metabolic function or causing antibiotic resistance, and examining the phenotype of the recipient cells on selective agar plates, one can deduce which genes are transferred into the recipient cells first and therefore are closer to the oriT sequence on the chromosome.|$|E
40|$|The {{location}} of the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> on the map of Flac has been determined by two different techniques. The first showed that no transfer cistrons were transferred early by a transposition Hfr strain with a known point of chromosomal integration into Flac, and the second used a series of transfer-deficient Hfr deletion strains to map a locus required in cis for chromosome transfer by an incoming Flac factor. Both techniques gave results consistent with a location for the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> between traJ and the φR 11 locus...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{collection}} of 182 isogenic strains containing genetically linked antibiotic resistance elements located at approximately 1 -min intervals around the Escherichia coli chromosome.

40|$|Genetic and {{biochemical}} {{characterization of}} TraA, the relaxase of symbiotic plasmid pRetCFN 42 d from Rhizobium etli, is described. After purifying the relaxase domain (N 265 TraA), we demonstrated nic binding and cleavage activity in vitro and thus characterized {{for the first}} time the nick site (nic) of a plasmid in the family Rhizobiaceae. We studied the range of N 265 TraA relaxase specificity in vitro by testing different oligonucleo-tides in binding and nicking assays. In addition, the ability of pRetCFN 42 d to mobilize different Rhizobiaceae plasmid <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> (oriT) was examined. Data obtained with these approaches allowed us to establish functional and phylogenetic relationships between different plasmids of this family. Our results suggest novel characteristics of the R. etli pSym relaxase for previously described conjugative systems, with emphasis on the oriT cis-acting preference of this enzyme and its possible biological relevance. Bacterial species belonging to the family Rhizobiaceae usu-ally carry large plasmids essential for diverse functions that determine their lifestyles. For example, Ti plasmids enable Agrobacterium tumefaciens to induce crown gall disease in a wide range of plants (17, 29).

40|$|Summary: Structured {{forms of}} DNA with intrastrand pairing are {{generated}} in several cellular processes and {{are involved in}} biological functions. These structures may arise on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) produced during replication, bacterial conjugation, natural transformation, or viral infections. Furthermore, negatively supercoiled DNA can extrude inverted repeats as hairpins in structures called cruciforms. Whether they are on ssDNA or as cruciforms, hairpins can modify the access of proteins to DNA, and in some cases, they can be directly recognized by proteins. Folded DNAs {{have been found to}} play an important role in replication, transcription regulation, and recognition <b>of</b> the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> in conjugative elements. More recently, they were shown to be used as recombination sites. Many of these functions are found on mobile genetic elements likely to be single stranded, including viruses, plasmids, transposons, and integrons, thus giving some clues as to the manner in which they might have evolved. We review here, with special focus on prokaryotes, the functions in which DNA secondary structures play a role and the cellular processes giving rise to them. Finally, we attempt to shed light on the selective pressures leading to the acquisition of functions for DNA secondary structures...|$|R
40|$|Induction of the Mu {{prophage}} of a lysogenic HfrP 4 X strongly {{stimulates the}} early {{transfer of the}} purE gene, which is located far from the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer.</b> By using a rec- Mu cts 62 X lysogenic donor, it was established that this process reflects the inversion of the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> in part of the Hfr population. Hfr's with inverted polarity of gene transfer were isolated; their analysis suggests that two Mu genomes in opposite orientation surround the inverted DNA fragment. Due {{to the presence of}} the Mu genome of the invertible G segment, homologous regions in the same orientation can appear in Mu genomes in opposite orientation. In a Rec+ background, Hfr's with inverted polarity (i) return to their original polarity of transfer by recomination between the two inverted Mu and (ii) produce new F' strains by recombination between the two similarly oriented G segments...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} F-like {{plasmids}} to promote transfer from the F <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> was determined. Chromosome transfer was measured from plasmid derivatives of RecA− Hfr deletion strains which {{had lost all}} the F transfer genes but which in some cases retained, and in others had also lost, the origin sequence. ColV 2 and ColVBtrp could initiate transfer from the F origin, but R 100 - 1, R 1 - 19, and R 538 - 1 drd could not. These results can be correlated with the plasmid specificity of the traI components of the different plasmid transfer systems, supporting {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> is the site of action of the traI product. Most F-like plasmids, including R 1 - 19 and R 538 - 1 drd, could transfer ColE 1, consistent with previous findings that the (plasmid-specific) traI product is not necessary for ColE 1 transfer by Flac; ColE 1 transfer may be initiated by a ColE 1 -or host-determined product. R 100 - 1 and R 136 fin− could not transfer ColE 1 efficiently, apparently because of differences residing in their pilus-forming genes...|$|E

A sequence similar {{to the ends of}} the transposon that are bound by the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of Int was present in the protected region. However, Int binding to oriT required both the N- and C-terminal DNA-binding domains of Int, and the pattern of nuclease protection differed from that observed when Int binds to the transposon ends and flanking DNA.

40|$|Conjugative <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> {{bacterial}} plasmids is {{the most}} efficient way of horizontal gene spread, and it is therefore considered one of the major reasons for {{the increase in the number}} of bacteria exhibiting multiple-antibiotic resistance. Thus, conjugation and spread of antibiotic resistance represents a severe problem in antibiotic treatment, especially of immunosuppressed patients and in intensive care units. While conjugation in gram-negative bacteria has been studied in great detail over the last decades, the <b>transfer</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> antibiotic resistance plasmids in gram-positive bacteria remained obscure. In the last few years, the entire nucleotide sequences of several large conjugative plasmids from gram-positive bacteria have been determined. Sequence analyses and data bank comparisons <b>of</b> their putative <b>transfer</b> (tra) regions have revealed significant similarities to tra regions of plasmids from gram-negative bacteria with regard to the respective DNA relaxases and their targets, the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> (oriT), and putative nucleoside triphosphatases NTP-ases with homologies to type IV secretion systems. In contrast, a single gene encoding a septal DNA translocator protein is involved in plasmid transfer between micelle-forming streptomycetes. Based on these clues, we propose the existence of two fundamentally different plasmid-mediated conjugative mechanisms in gram-positive microorganisms, namely, the mechanism taking place in unicellular gram-positive bacteria, which is functionally similar to that in gram-negative bacteria, and a second type that occurs in multicellular gram-positive bacteria, which seems to be characterized by double-stranded DNA transfer...|$|R
