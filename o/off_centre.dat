5|$|The Nandi in Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur is seen placed <b>off</b> <b>centre</b> as a {{testimony}} of Nandanar's devotion and the miracle. A stone {{image of the}} saint is worshipped in the temple. The Dvarapalas (gate-keeper sculptures) are depicted with his heads leaning downwards, {{said to be in}} honour of Nandanar. In 1959, a shrine was created outside the Shiva temple, from where the stone image of Nandanar looks eternally at Shiva. Nandanar is depicted with his hands joined above his head, praying to Shiva. Scenes of Bharati's opera and the local legend of Nandanar and Ganesha digging the temple tank are seen on the shrine.|$|E
5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set <b>off</b> <b>centre</b> and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Humayun's tomb, the more closely contemporary Tomb of Itmad-Ud-Daulah marked {{a new era}} of Mughal architecture. It was built by the empress Nur Jehan for her father from 1622–1625 AD (1031–1034 AH) and is small in comparison to many other Mughal-era tombs. So exquisite is the execution of its surface treatments, it is often described as a jewel box. The garden layout, hierarchical use of white marble and sandstone, Parchin kari inlay designs and latticework presage many elements of the Taj Mahal. The cenotaph of Nur Jehan's father is laid, <b>off</b> <b>centre,</b> to the west of her mother. This break in symmetry was repeated in the Taj where Mumtaz was interred in the geometric centre of the complex and Jahan is laid to her side. These close similarities with the tomb of Mumtaz have earned it the sobriquet - The Baby Taj.|$|E
25|$|The Mayflower Grandstand is the club's main stand, {{with space}} for about 7,000 spectators. It {{is the oldest}} part of the ground, having been built in 1952. It houses the club's main offices, the boardroom, team {{changing}} rooms and press rooms, and also accommodates executive boxes, which can host functions and are available to supporters on match days. The dugouts, which are made of wood and supplied by the club's sponsors, {{sit in front of}} the Mayflower, with the player tunnel slightly <b>off</b> <b>centre</b> going underneath the Mayflower. To the rear of the stand is the Club Shop, selling official merchandise, and the Pyramid Suite, a hospitality area which can cater for up to 170 people. There are two structures overlooking the pitch {{on each side of the}} stand. To the east is a building which contains a hospitality area (the Chisholm Lounge), and a press area, and to the west is a disabled enclosure. There have been plans to replace this stand for a number of years. In 2013, planning permission was finally given to revamp and rebuild the Mayflower Grandstand after becoming less popular with supporters and the club's chairman James Brent, although no date has ever been set for the construction to begin.|$|E

25|$|On 7 November, 835 Squadron {{claimed a}} Junkers Ju 88 damaged. The long Arctic night with only {{four hours of}} light a day—together with heavy seas and low visibility—hampered any {{operations}} by the Wildcats. In the darkness, the ships could hear the engines of the shadowing German aircraft closing in. Campanias night fighting Fulmar took off at 17:30, but its electrics failed as it was approaching the German aircraft and it was forced {{to return to the}} carrier. The Fulmar landed <b>off</b> <b>centre</b> and crashed into the safety barrier, putting itself and the carrier out of action. On 10 November, a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol reported 30 Junkers Ju88s approaching the convoy. The Wildcats took off to intercept the torpedo bombers and the escorts opened fire on them. The combined fire from the escorts and the Wildcats shot down four Ju88s, two more were claimed as probably shot down by the Wildcats, and another was severely damaged. Those Ju88s that did release their torpedoes failed to hit any of the ships and a number of the torpedoes were seen to detonate in the ships' wakes, as they turned away from the attack. Two of the Wildcats were also shot down by the barrage from the escorts. The combined losses had reduced the escort's fighter cover to three aircraft, one on Campania and two on Nairana. At 11:30, another group of Ju88 torpedo bombers were discovered approaching. Nairanas Wildcats took off and shot one down. The others, under fire from the escorts, dropped their torpedoes too soon and they all missed.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 February 1945, Campania, Nairana, {{the cruiser}} HMS Bellona and eight fleet destroyers joined 26 {{merchant}} ships in convoy JW64. This time the squadrons had spare aircrews for their aircraft and Campanias squadron included a Fairey Fulmar {{fitted with a}} Royal Air Force AI air-to-air interception radar, {{for use as a}} dedicated night fighter. Shortly after the escorts and convoy came together Campanias radar operator reported a target approaching. Both carriers scrambled two Wildcats, to intercept the intruder. Campanias Wildcats got there first and shot down a Junkers Ju 88, one of the Wildcats was also shot down with the loss of the pilot. The next morning as 07:45 Campanias radar detected aircraft approaching. Two groups of Junkers Ju 88 torpedo bombers appeared and the convoys escorts opened fire. The ships manoeuvred to avoid the torpedo attack and Nairanas [...] Wildcats were airborne by 08:10. No ships were hit during the attacks and the bombers evaded the fighters in the heavy cloud cover. Campanias Swordfish were flying the daylight anti-submarine patrols, with a mixed armament of four RP-3 rockets and two depth charges. On 7 November 835 Squadron claimed a Junkers Ju 88 damaged. The long Arctic night with only four hours of light a day together with heavy seas and low visibility hampered any operations by the Wildcats.

Nairanas Wildcats took off and shot one down the others under fire from the escorts dropped their torpedoes too soon and they all missed. The return convoy RA 64 left Kola Inlet on the morning of 17 February, one of the escorts and a merchant ship were torpedoed almost immediately. Another merchant ship was torpedoed that afternoon. Terrible weather conditions kept all aircraft grounded until 20 November, when it began to clear the Luftwaffe also appeared and the Wildcats were scrambled to intercept them. Two Ju 88s were shot down by the fighters another two by the escorts and three were damaged. The convoys had lost to enemy action two fighters, two escorts and two merchant ships. In return they claimed 15 aircraft destroyed, seven aircraft probably destroyed and one U-boat sunk. Campania did one more Russian convoy JW 65 in March 1945, which had two merchant ships torpedoed and sunk on their approach to Kola Inlet. These were the last losses on a Russian convoy.|$|E
