50|$|In 2006, WHO {{conducted}} a study on suicide around the world.

5|$|If {{someone is}} {{found guilty of}} an attempt, they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. This {{provides}} that anyone who attempts to commit an offence will be punished with {{the same period in}} prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, {{attempted}} suicide, abetment of suicide, and abetment <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide are criminal acts. This {{applies to}} physicians who aid patients in ending their lives.

However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E

5|$|Proof of {{specific}} intent to endanger life is unnecessary {{on a charge}} of attempting this offence. In Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992 (1994), on a charge <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> aggravated arson, it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the defendant was reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered.|$|E

40|$|Background It {{is unclear}} whether any {{particular}} {{time of the day}} is Vulnerable for suicide attempts. Suicide attempt is a known risk factor for future completed suicide. Aim To investigate the relationship between the time <b>of</b> suicide <b>attempt</b> and the sociodemograpic and illness characteristics of suicide attempters. Method Time <b>of</b> <b>attempt,</b> clinical and demographic data and illness variables of 74 patients presenting to hospital following suicide attempt were analyzed. Results Our results showed 8. a. m. to 11. 59 a. m. is the most preferred time <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> and it is statistically significant. Suicide attempt is significantly more in the day time (between 8 a. m. to 11. 59 a. m.). The above time period is significantly associated with place <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>of</b> the suicide attempters. This is the time period where more young males (20 – 29 years) from rural back ground, married, illiterates and unemployed (significant no. of house wives also) attempt suicide during this time. Depression is the common psychiatric illness and pesticide is the common mode <b>of</b> <b>attempt.</b> More number <b>of</b> cases <b>attempt</b> during the months of August, September and October. Majority of them have experienced more than 5 life events before the attempt. Therefore we conclude that forenoon (8 a. m. to 11. 59 a. m.) is the most vulnerable period for attempting suicide. Conclusion The assessment of patients with history <b>of</b> suicide <b>attempt</b> in relation to the time <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> is beneficial in formulating suicide prevention strategies...|$|R

5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> murder, {{and one of}} torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which {{surrendered}} on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence. Before the conviction became final in 2009, and to avoid extradition, Glavaš fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, {{when he was arrested}} and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In January 2015, the conviction was set aside by the Constitutional Court of Croatia, pending a new trial before the Supreme Court of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his {{followers}} of participation in this and other crimes, including an aborted plan in 1985 to assassinate a United States Attorney, and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and executed search warrants in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> murder and served 29months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security federal prison.|$|E

Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary.

5|$|Great {{white sharks}} (Carcharodon carcharias) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) are plausible, albeit undocumented, predators of the porbeagle.

Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Dinobothrium septaria and Hepatoxylon trichiuri, and the copepods Dinemoura producta, Laminifera doello-juradoi, and Pandarus floridanus. Natural annual mortality is low, estimated to be 10% for juveniles, 15% for adult males, and 20% for adult females in the western North Atlantic.|$|E
