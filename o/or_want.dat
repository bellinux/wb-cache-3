25|$|During {{his life}} at Rome, {{although}} he never {{rose to a}} position of real independence, and had always a hard and close struggle with poverty, he seems to have known everybody, especially every one of any eminence at the bar or in literature (friend to all). In addition to Lucan and Quintilian, he numbered among his manifold friends or more intimate acquaintances Silius Italicus, Juvenal, the younger Pliny; and there were many others of high position whose society and patronage he relished. The silence which he and Statius, although authors writing at the same time, having common friends and treating often of the same subjects, maintain in regard to one another may (nay must certainly) be explained by mutual dislike <b>or</b> <b>want</b> of sympathy or healthy rivalry or simple disgust. Martial in many places shows an undisguised contempt for the artificial kind of epic on which Statius's reputation chiefly rests; and it seems quite natural in the mind of an eminent litteraturist that the respectable author of the Thebaid and the Silvae should feel little admiration, nay perhaps even outright contempt, for either the life or the works of the populist and unsophisticated bohemian epigrammatist.|$|E
25|$|Bette {{was now a}} very driven and {{somewhat}} spoiled Los Angeles debutante and tennis prodigy. After seeing Robin on the news, Bette vowed that she would gain his attention and favor by becoming a masked adventurer herself. Training to Olympic-levels in gymnastics and martial arts, she created the identity of Flamebird (and a costume that resembled her pre-Crisis Bat-Girl identity) and joined Titans West in hopes of catching Robin's eye. While flattered, the driven young hero was {{not sure how to}} deal with her obsession and avoided her, much to her dismay. After briefly giving up her heroic persona, Bette found that neither winning tennis tournaments nor achieving perfect grades in school matched the rooftop thrills of the hero biz. She attempted several times to reunite the Titans West team, most notably after a journey into the afterlife with Hawk and Dove, but was unsuccessful. Dove noted that Bette was essentially a very lonely person, basically desperate for company and contact with others. Bette again gave up her obsession with the Titans until malfunctioning former Titan Victor Stone collected her, along with all former Titans everywhere, in an attempt to protect his soul from the Justice League. Hoping this would lead to a formal invitation to rejoin the team, Bette was crushed to learn they did not need (<b>or</b> <b>want)</b> her assistance.|$|E

Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on Heathers, Denise Di Novi.

The singer further clarified that the lyrics ultimately was a commentary on social media and the problems one face trying to present a perfect representation of themselves. Media reports speculated that the lyrics alluded to the singer's breakup from her boyfriend, actor Taylor Kinney, around July 2016. Samantha Schnurr from E! decoded the lyrics, saying that the repetition of the phrase [...] "perfect illusion" [...] was about their relationship. Gaga retorted during an interview with SiriusXM that the song was not for Kinney, and was not a [...] "revenge" [...] track.
