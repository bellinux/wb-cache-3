5|$|Commercially, Luigi's Mansion is {{the most}} {{successful}} GameCube launch title and the best-selling game of November 2001. Despite meager sales in Japan at around 348,000 units in total, it became the fifth best-selling Nintendo GameCube game in the United States, with sales of roughly 2.19 million units. It {{was also one of}} the first Player's Choice titles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console,</b> along with Super Smash Bros. Melee and Pikmin.|$|E
5|$|Naka, Ohshima, and Yasuhara worked 19 {{hours a day}} on {{the project}} for several months. Due to the need to {{demonstrate}} the Genesis' technological prowess, the game underwent extensive testing and redesign, a process taking over six months. The developers' efforts were rewarded; and according to Naka, the game had the fastest-ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that had been considered impossible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b>|$|E
5|$|The N-Gage {{version of}} X-Men Legends {{contains}} {{most of the}} features found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console</b> versions. However, {{the game is played}} from an isometric point of view. Characters are two-dimensional sprites based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view. Cutscenes were reused from the console versions, but are rendered at a much lower frame rate. Players can link with other N-Gage systems for four-player cooperative gameplay using GSM cellular technology.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of the first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation, Sony {{contacted}} Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> Revolution wanted {{to move away from the}} style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. The game engine was written specifically for the title. It was released to average reviews from critics, who praised the game's story, puzzles and graphics, but criticized its controls, action scenes and animation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sixth}} {{installment}} to the Dragon Quest series, the graphics and gameplay remain {{close to the}} other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were vastly improved from , which was also for the SNES, but had rather unimpressive graphics due to being an early game <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from Dragon Quest III returns, with minor adjustments. The large cartridge ROM used by the game resulted in an extremely high price of 11,970 yen (about 137 dollars), Dragon Quest VI sold 3.2 million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995. The DS version sold an additional one million copies by March 2010.|$|E
50|$|Mayhem in Monsterland {{was their}} swan song. Platformers had become very popular, with Sonic The Hedgehog and Super Mario Bros. <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consoles.</b> Mayhem {{was a game}} {{fashioned}} after Sonic, though mostly a direct descendant of Creatures.|$|R

5|$|On October 2016, the reveal trailer for Nintendo Switch {{featured}} gameplay of Skyrim <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> At the time, it {{was reported}} that Bethesda only used the game for the reveal trailer and that it was not officially releasing on the Nintendo Switch. On January 13, 2017, Todd Howard officially confirmed that the game will come out on the Nintendo Switch, making it the first Elder Scrolls title to be released on a Nintendo platform, as well as the first game Bethesda has made or released for a Nintendo home console since Home Alone for the NES in 1991. During Bethesda's E3 2017 showcase, it was revealed that the Nintendo Switch version will support amiibo and the Joy-Con motion controls.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 2 {{version of}} Guilty Gear X2 has sold well in Japan; over 140,000 copies were sold between 2002 and 2004. In {{addition}} to the public reception, the game has been praised by video game critics. Several aspects were commended, the most noticeable being its gameplay, visuals, music, and new additions from Guilty Gear X, the second game in the series. It {{was found to be}} the best title of the series, as well {{as one of the best}} titles of the year, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console,</b> and on the genre by some reviewers. Since its release, it has received five updated versions, each offering additional features over previous versions.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 (excluding PlayStation 3 Slim) also {{supports}} running Linux OS on firmware versions prior to 3.21 {{without the need}} for buying additional hardware purchase. Yellow Dog Linux provides an official distribution that can be downloaded, and other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu have been successfully installed and operated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> The use of Linux on the PlayStation 3 allowed users to access 6 of the 7 Synergistic Processing Elements; Sony implemented a hypervisor restricting access to the RSX. The feature to install a second operating system on a PlayStation 3 was removed in a firmware update released in 2010.|$|E

50|$|Suddenly, the Doctor {{suffers a}} form of seizure, {{expelling}} glowing energy from his mouth, and the TARDIS shudders as if in sympathetic response. The Doctor tells Rose the regeneration is going wrong and starts to act maniacally, throwing switches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TARDIS <b>console</b> and ranting about increasing speed as {{the sounds of the}} Cloister Bell start ringing through <b>the</b> <b>console</b> room.

5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console</b> so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 {{would be available}} on PlayStation 3 {{came as a surprise}} to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box. The move toward the PlayStation 3 was a result of growing frustration with Microsoft's policies for Xbox 360 content, including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players. Newell saw Sony's publication model as more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from reviewers and was Nintendo's top seller {{during the}} 1999 holiday season, with 2.3 million units sold by 2004. It won the 1999 E3 Game Critics award for Best Platform Game, and multiple awards and nominations from games magazines. Reviewers noted the game's exceptional size and length, but criticized {{its emphasis on}} item collection and backtracking. Some cited its similarity in gameplay and visuals to Rare's 1998 predecessor, Banjo-Kazooie, despite Donkey Kong 64 mandatory memory add-on. The game's camera controls also frustrated reviewers. Critics felt that the game {{did not meet the}} revolutionary potential of Donkey Kong Country, but remained among the best 3D platform games <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b>|$|E

5|$|X-Men Legends {{is played}} as an action {{role-playing}} game. Players choose {{a team of}} up to four characters from a larger group of X-Men.

5|$|The seven-person {{development}} team {{started work}} on the sequel with the ideas that did not fit into the original. They also incorporated feedback from Killer Instinct players. Killer Instinct2 art, design, and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release. Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the game engine with feedback from Nintendo's Ken Lobb. Rare used compression technology to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo64 cartridge. While Killer Instinct was planned to showcase the Nintendo 64's power, the console was more limited than Rare's arcade setup, and Rare had to optimize the arcade version to run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> The arcade version used an animation to give the illusion of the camera panning horizontally, but the console version used static image files with less detail. Both the arcade and console versions use the same graphic engine and character roster.|$|E

50|$|NASCAR The Game was {{designed}} {{to appeal to the}} casual video game player, as opposed to full simulators such as NASCAR Racing 2003 Season and iRacing.

5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console.</b> This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer stereo vision and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where the camera was unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works of others in the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>console,</b> bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E
