5|$|Every year on July 25, Puerto Rican Nationalists and {{independence}} activists gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Soto and Arnaldo Dario, {{as well as}} to defend and celebrate the Puerto Rican independence ideology. It is usually organized by the family of the victims, former members <b>of</b> <b>nationalist</b> groups, and by the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The mountain has also been christened by them as “El Cerro de los Mártires” (The Mountain of the Martyrs).|$|E
5|$|Portugal {{designated}} Mozambique {{an overseas}} territory in 1951 {{in order to}} show to the world that the colony had a greater autonomy. It was called the Overseas Province of Mozambique (Província Ultramarina de Moçambique). Nonetheless, Portugal still maintained strong control over its overseas province. The increasing number of newly independent African nations after World War II, coupled with the ongoing mistreatment of the indigenous population, encouraged the growth <b>of</b> <b>nationalist</b> sentiments within Mozambique.|$|E

Nasser {{spent most of his}} spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt.

5|$|In September 1945, Hồ {{declared}} independence {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) following {{the withdrawal of}} Imperial Japan, which had seized {{control of the country}} from France during the Second World War. At the time, there was a power vacuum, as both Japan and France had been decimated by the war. There was an outbreak <b>of</b> <b>nationalist</b> fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned to be the leader of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
5|$|Several critics {{detect a}} crisis in public {{memorial}} style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation <b>of</b> <b>nationalist</b> values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, {{at least on the}} Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks in}} the east were {{immediately}} followed by similar actions {{in the south of}} the island before rapidly spreading throughout the country. By early April, when violence first erupted in Antananarivo, the number <b>of</b> <b>nationalist</b> fighters was estimated at around 2,000. Attacks against French military bases multiplied {{over the course of the}} month throughout the central highlands as far south as Fianarantsoa and as far north as Lake Alaotra. The movement enjoyed particularly strong support in the south, where the revolt attracted as many as one million peasants to fight for the nationalist cause.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, {{depicting the}} royal family or national colours, were extremely popular. When these symbols were banned, new ones, such as ivy leaves, were worn with similar meaning. Workers in strategic industries deliberately underperformed in their jobs {{as a form of}} resistance. The celebration <b>of</b> <b>nationalist</b> public holidays, like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations. One of the most notable acts of passive resistance was the Judges' Strike of 1918, which managed to gain concessions from the German occupiers under considerable public pressure.|$|E
5|$|Following the meeting, al-Bakri conferred with al-Shahbandar, {{who agreed}} to bring Damascus into the revolt, {{although}} this initial attempt did not materialize. As al-Atrash's men headed towards Damascus to launch their attack against French forces there, al-Bakri assembled some 260 armed volunteers from various neighborhoods and villages in and around Damascus, including al-Shaghour, Bab Musalla, al-Midan, and Jaramana. Al-Bakri maintained particularly close ties to Hasan al-Kharrat, the local boss (qabaday) of al-Shaghur {{and a friend of}} the al-Bakri family. In early August, upon al-Bakri's urging, al-Kharrat formed a militia, which would {{become one of the most}} effective rebel bands in the country. When the French authorities were informed <b>of</b> <b>nationalist</b> rebel plans, they began a wide-scale arrest campaign in the city on 27 August, detaining nearly all of Damascus's nationalist leaders and spokesmen, although al-Bakri, his brothers, and al-Shahbandar managed to evade arrest.|$|E
5|$|The Indian {{independence}} movement developed {{roots in the}} city when Mahatma Gandhi established two ashrams– the Kochrab Ashram near Paldi in 1915 and the Satyagraha Ashram (now Sabarmati Ashram) {{on the banks of}} the Sabarmati in 1917– which would become centres <b>of</b> <b>nationalist</b> activities. During the mass protests against the Rowlatt Act in 1919, textile workers burned down 51 government buildings across the city in protest at a British attempt to extend wartime regulations after the First World War. In the 1920s, textile workers and teachers went on strike, demanding civil rights and better pay and working conditions. In 1930, Gandhi initiated the Salt Satyagraha from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the Dandi Salt March. The city's administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the Quit India Movement. Following independence and the partition of India in 1947, the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between Hindus and Muslims in 1947, Ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan, who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy.|$|E

5|$|Although the PVA 13th Army had {{a nominal}} {{strength}} of 230,000 men, its actual strength {{during the battle}} could be as low as 150,000 men. The PVA 66th Corps, for example, had only 6,600 men per division {{at the start of}} the battle, as opposed to the expected 10,000 men per division. There were also only one firearm available for every three Chinese soldiers, and the rest were employed as grenade throwers. Because most of the Chinese howitzers and guns were left behind in Manchuria, mortars were the only artillery support available for the Chinese. For the counteroffensive, the average Chinese soldier were issued with only five days worth of rations and ammunition, and resupply could only be obtained by scavenging on the battlefield. To compensate for its shortcomings, the Chinese relied extensively on night attacks and infiltrations in order to avoid the UN firepower. The primitive logistics system had also allowed the Chinese to maneuver over the rough hilly terrains, thus enabled them to by-pass the UN defenses and to surround the isolated UN positions. Because the Chinese had captured large numbers <b>of</b> <b>Nationalist</b> weapons during the Chinese Civil War, most of the Chinese weapons were composed of US made small arms such as the Thompson submachine gun, the M1 Garand rifle, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, the bazooka and the M2 mortar.|$|E

5000|$|The {{nationalist}} reinforcement {{was sent}} in three fronts, {{and the main}} force of 2,000 consisted of the 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade <b>of</b> the <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 82nd Division and the Garrison Group <b>of</b> the <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 82nd Division. The 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade <b>of</b> the <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 82nd Division was originally organized as the 2nd Cavalry Division during the Second Sino-Japanese War {{to be sent to}} central China to fight the Japanese invaders, but they were sent in Shaanxi by Hu Zongnan to blockade communist base. After the end of World War II, the nationalist 2nd Cavalry Division returned to Qinghai, along with nationalist 8th Cavalry Division returning from Xuzhou. The nationalist 2nd Cavalry Division was subsequently reorganized as 2nd Regiment <b>of</b> the <b>nationalist</b> Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, and in May 1947, the unit was selected to reinforce the besieged town <b>of</b> Heshui.
