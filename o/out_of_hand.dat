5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, perhaps {{as a prelude to}} {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading out of town, and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time under the command of General E.J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|European club {{football}} competitions {{began in}} the mid-1950s. Though Manchester City were moderately successful domestically in this period, the club did not play in Europe. City were not invited {{to play in the}} Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup did not begin until 1960. When eight players from neighbours Manchester United lost their lives in the Munich air disaster when returning from a European Cup match in February 1958, UEFA wished for City to take United's place in the competition. City rejected the idea <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Giolitti {{acknowledged}} {{the need to}} stifle the agitation. From May 1893 onwards, leaders of the Fasci were arrested occasionally and police and military reinforcements were sent to Sicily. In the autumn of 1893 the leadership lost control over the Fasci and the popular agitation got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> Peasant squatters seized land, violent crowds demonstrated for work and against local misgovernment, tax offices were burnt down and clashes with the police grew more frequent and bloody. The violent social conflict almost rose {{to the point of}} insurrection. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene.|$|E
5|$|The dodos on this islet may not {{necessarily}} {{have been the last}} members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688–1715. The authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1970s, Ike Turner's {{excessive}} cocaine habit {{had gotten}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> During this period, Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo {{to help her}} deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal with Cream Records. The deal was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina {{got into a fight}} during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to Norway Magnus led campaigns into Dalsland and Västergötland in Sweden, {{claiming}} an ancient border with the country. After two unsuccessful invasions {{and a number of}} skirmishes Danish king Eric Evergood initiated peace talks among the three Scandinavian monarchs, fearing that the conflict would get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> Magnus concluded peace with the Swedes in 1101 by agreeing to marry Margaret, daughter of the Swedish king Inge Stenkilsson. In return, Magnus gained Dalsland as part of her dowry. He set out on his final western campaign in 1102, and may have sought to conquer Ireland. Magnus entered into an alliance with Irish king Muirchertach Ua Briain of Munster, who recognised Magnus' control of Dublin. Under unclear circumstances, while obtaining food supplies for {{his return to}} Norway, Magnus was killed in an ambush by the Ulaid the next year; territorial advances characterising his reign ended with his death.|$|E

5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
5|$|Johann Tetzel {{responded to}} the Theses by calling for Luther to be burnt for heresy and having theologian Konrad Wimpina write 106 theses against Luther's work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the University of Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1518. 800 copies of the printed disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but {{students}} of the University seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> {{and that he would}} be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a Sermon on Indulgences and Grace, which did not challenge the pope's authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther's first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet was not nearly as popular as Luther's. Luther's reply to Tetzel's pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.|$|E
5|$|Swan had {{no respect}} for Heath and was not afraid to show it, and so Heath kept Swan's {{appearances}} to a minimum in 1996–97. He offered loan moves to Third Division Hartlepool United and Hereford United, offers which Swan dismissed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand,</b> and so Heath placed him on the transfer list. The transfer took until August 1997, at which point {{he moved on to}} Bury for a fee of £50,000 – this reunited him with manager Stan Ternent. The move had been delayed after Heath left Burnley to be replaced by Chris Waddle, though Waddle quickly sanctioned the transfer. Ternent moved Swan back to his role as a striker, despite the player having been used exclusively as a defender at his last few clubs. He scored six goals in his first twelve games before hitting a fifteen-game goal drought. He helped the club to narrowly avoid relegation {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

To make things worse, Liz is summoned to jury duty and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia.

5|$|The {{events of}} Arkham City are set {{one year after}} Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's {{erstwhile}} director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City. Declaring both the asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed {{in the care of}} psychiatrist Hugo Strange—who is secretly manipulating Sharp—and monitored by a rogue private military firm, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do as they please, so long as they do not attempt to escape. A wary Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand.</b> Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.|$|E
