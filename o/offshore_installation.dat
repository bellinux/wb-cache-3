25|$|After the affair, it came {{to light}} that Greenpeace had miscalculated the amount of toxic waste present aboard the Brent Spar. Greenpeace {{admitted}} that its claims that the Spar contained 5000 tons of oil were inaccurate, apologizing to Shell on September 5. However, Greenpeace dismissed {{the importance of the}} amount of oil on board, pointing to wider industrial responsibility as the main issue at hand, as the Brent Spar was to be the first <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> to be dumped in the northeast Atlantic ocean; Greenpeace claimed that it would likely have been followed by the scuttling of dozens or hundreds more platforms, setting what they consider to be a dangerous precedent. The organization went on to point out that Shell's decision to scrap the platform had been taken before Greenpeace announced the existence of an incorrect amount of toxic waste, and that their mistake therefore did not influence Shell's decision.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many other}} {{offshore}} platforms, Piper Alpha had an automatic fire-fighting system, driven by both diesel and electric pumps (the latter were disabled by the initial explosions). The diesel pumps {{were designed to}} suck in large amounts of sea water for fire fighting; the pumps had an automatic control to start them in case of fire (although {{they could not be}} remotely started from the control room in an emergency). However, the fire-fighting system was under manual control on the evening of 6 July: the Piper Alpha procedure adopted by the <b>Offshore</b> <b>Installation</b> Manager (OIM) required manual control of the pumps whenever divers were in the water (as they were for approximately 12 hours a day during summer) although in reality, the risk was not seen as significant for divers unless a diver was closer than [...] from any of the four [...] level caged intakes. A recommendation from an earlier audit had suggested that a procedure be developed to keep the pumps in automatic mode if divers were not working {{in the vicinity of the}} intakes as was the practice on the Claymore platform, but this was never developed or implemented.|$|E

40|$|The {{offshore}} {{petroleum industry}} is {{of critical importance}} to the global economy. <b>Offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations</b> are considered elements of critical national infrastructure in many nation-States and their security may have significant implications for national security and economic wellbeing. Violence at sea is a very common occurrence today and major petroleum producing and consuming States {{are concerned about the}} protection of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations</b> from attacks and unlawful interferences, especially acts of terrorism. In recent years, the international community has taken a number of regulatory measures to enhance the security of the maritime transport and offshore petroleum sectors. The thesis examines the types of security threats to <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations,</b> the types of attacks that have been carried out against <b>offshore</b> <b>installations,</b> and factors that make <b>offshore</b> <b>installations</b> attractive targets including their vulnerabilities and potential impacts that can result from deliberate attacks on these vital facilities. This thesis also analyses the international legal framework for maritime and offshore petroleum security with the aim of determining whether the international legal framework adequately addresses the protection and security of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations.</b> Specifically, it analyses {{the law of the sea}} framework established under the umbrella of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 as well as other international legal instruments and regulatory measures pertaining to the security of <b>offshore</b> <b>installations.</b> The original contribution made by this thesis includes the compilation of a comprehensive chronology of attacks on and interferences with <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations,</b> the analysis of various security threats faced by <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations,</b> examination of factors that make <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations</b> attractive targets, and a detailed analysis of the international regulatory framework. The thesis concludes that there are gaps and limitations in the current international regulatory framework for the protection and security of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations.</b> It argues that there is a scope for improvement in the international legal framework and that further regulatory changes are necessary at the international level in order to enhance security of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations.</b> The thesis also provides several specific suggestions that would improve the international legal framework for the protection and security of <b>offshore</b> petroleum <b>installations...</b>|$|R

50|$|Innogy Nordsee 1-2-3 is a {{proposal}} for a large wind farm complex off Germany's coast. The planned <b>offshore</b> <b>installation</b> is to be built 40 km north of the island of Juist, within an area of around 100 km2 and in water 26 - 34 m deep. The project includes three wind farms: Innogy Nordsee 1 with 54 turbines, Innogy Nordsee 2 with 48 turbines, and Innogy Nordsee 3 with 60 turbines. In total, 162 wind turbines with a capacity of 6.15 megawatts (MW) will be used. The aim is to complete the wind farm in 2015 at a total investment of around €2.8 billion (US $3.72 billion).|$|E
50|$|<b>Offshore</b> <b>installation,</b> as yet, is a {{comparatively}} small market, probably accounting for {{little more than}} 10% of installation globally. The location of new wind farms increasingly will be offshore, especially in Europe.

The harsh environment means that the individual components {{need to be more}} rugged and corrosion protected than their onshore components.
