40|$|Aims: To {{estimate}} the prevalence, time trends and {{factors associated with}} paid sex among men. Methods: Norwegian Sex Surveys using similar questions in 1992, 1997 and 2002 were analyzed using a cohort analysis and logistic regression. The questionnaires included demographic background, and several aspects of sexual behaviour. The following questions on paid sex were included: ‘‘Have you ever paid for sexual services? ’ ’  ‘ ‘If yes, how many times?’’, ‘‘How <b>old</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> the first time?’’, ‘‘How <b>old</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> the last time?’’, and ‘‘Did you use a condom the last time?’’ Results: Of the 4, 545 men who answered this question, 585 (12. 9 %) reported ever having paid for sex. There was a marked decline overall in reporting from 26. 2 % in the cohort born in 1927 — 34, to 5. 9 % in the cohort born in 1975 — 84 (p < 0. 001). However, {{there was an increase}} in the last cohort after the age of around 23 years (p = 0. 1). Having paid for sex was significantly associated with being single, being on a disability pension, early sexual debut and having multiple other sex partners; these men were less likely to use condoms when having sex with a cohabiting partner (p < 0. 01) an...|$|E

40|$|Dizygotic (DZ) {{twinning}} {{appears to}} run in families and the underlying trait, multiple ovulation, appears to be genetically influenced [Lewis et al., 1996; Meule-mans et al., 1996]. Multiple ovulation is considerably more frequent in mothers of DZ twins than in controls [Martin et al., 1991 b] although its hormonal control is far from understood [Martin et al., 1991 a]. Whatever the cause, if the supply of ovarian follicles is finite, then it might be expected that a woman predisposed to mul-tiple ovulation would more quickly exhaust her supply. If this in turn is a precipitator of menopause [te Velde, 1993], one might expect mothers of DZ twins to have earlier menopause than controls. One predisposing factor to DZ twinning may be het-erozygosity for expansion of the CGG repeat number in the fragile X (FRAXA) locus into the premutation range (50 – 200 repeats) [Fu et al., 1991]. Previously we have shown that such women have a significantly higher DZ twinning rate than control women and have speculated {{that they should have}} earlier menopause [Turner et al., 1994]. Now Conway et al. [1995] have found 2 out of 9 women with premature ovarian failure with FRAXA premutations. This has prompted us to investigate: (i) the frequency of early menopause in mothers of DZ twins (MODZTs), and (ii) whether FRAXA premuta-tions contribute to any tendency to earlier menopause among MODZTs. Health and Lifestyle questionnaires were sent to mothers of 3, 220 adult twin pairs enrolled on the Aus-tralian NHMRC Twin Registry; 65 % responded (ages 38 – 96, mean 58) and 59 % answered “Have you reached menopause (‘natural change of life’) ? ” and “How <b>old</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> when your periods stopped? ” (Table I). They also answered questions about hysterectomy and its temporal relation to natural menopause. While it is dif-ficult to evaluate the validity of self-reported age at menopause, the consistency of this reporting over time appears to be good; for 357 postmenopausal twins who reported age at natural menopause in 1980 and again in 1988, the 8 -year test-retest correlation was 0. 80 6 0. 03, and in an overlapping sample of 85 women, the 2 -year consistency was 0. 92 6 0. 04. From Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the mean age at menopause was 49. 9 6. 2 in MODZTs and 50. 9 6. ...|$|E

Safe Room Access FRS and HBAI data Safe Room access datasets for the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and Households Below Average Income (HBAI) are available {{in addition to the}} versions available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33283 and SN 5828. SN 7196, Family Resources Survey, 2005 / 06 - 2014 / 15 and Households Below Average Income, 1994 / 95 - 2014 / 15 : Safe Room Access, replaces SNs 5839, 6083, 6253 and 6532, which were previously available under Special Licence. The Safe Room access data are only available for access from the UK Data Archive's Safe Room at the University of Essex, Colchester. Prospective users of the Safe Room access version of the FRS/HBAI will need to fulfil requirements additional to those associated with standard End User Licence datasets, commencing with the completion of an extra application form to demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the extra, more detailed variables, in order to obtain permission to use that version. Safe Room access users must also complete face-to-face training and agree to Secure Access User Agreement and Licence Compliance Policy (see 'Access' section below), as well as completing a Baseline Personal Security Standard (BPSS) check. Full details of the application requirements will be provided to users when they have placed an order for access to the data, and are available from Guidance on applying for the Family Resources Survey: Secure Access. Users are encouraged to download and inspect the EUL versions of the data prior to ordering the Safe Room access version. As the FRS is the main source of data used by the HBAI, the Safe Room access version of the HBAI data has been included with the FRS. The Safe Room access version of the FRS/HBAI dataset is currently available to UK HE/FE applicants only. Further information about the FRS {{can be found on the}} Family Resources Survey pages on the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) web site and further information regarding HBAI is also available from the DWP HBAI web page. European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) In 2005, the European Union (EU) made a legal obligation for member states to collect additional statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). In addition to this the EU-SILC data cover poverty and social exclusion. These statistics are used to help plan and monitor European social policy by comparing poverty indicators and changes over time across the EU. The EU-SILC requirement was integrated into the General Household Survey (GHS) /General Lifestyle Survey (GLF) in 2005. Since the closure of the GLF in 2012 the cross-sectional element of EU-SILC has been collected via the FRS. The FRS also provides the first wave of the EU-SILC longitudinal element, which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Please refer to study documentation for further details. FRS: The FRS aims to: support the monitoring of the social security programme support the costing and modelling of changes to National Insurance contributions and social security benefits provide better information for the forecasting of benefit expenditure From April 2002, the FRS was extended to include Northern Ireland. As the FRS does not track individuals over time, analysis of incomes is supplemented by the use of longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) element of the Understanding Society survey (held at the Archive under GN 33423). The BHPS (held at the Archive under GN 33196) was subsumed into Understanding Society from the beginning of 2009. The Safe Room access version of the FRS contains unrounded data and data within the following variables which are not available within the standard EUL versions: Household Table: LAC (Local Authority Code) - all years NICOUN (Northern Ireland District Council Code) - from 2007 / 08 LONDON (location of household) - from 2007 / 08 CAPVAL - Weeklyised Capital Value - from 2008 / 09 BRMA - Broad Rental Market Area - from 2008 / 09 OAC - ONS Area Classification - from 2009 / 10 SSTRTREG (FRS regional stratifier) - from 2009 / 10 URINDS (urban and rural indicators for Scotland) - from 2009 / 10 URINDEW (urban and rural indicators for England and Wales) - from 2009 / 10 GROSSCT (gross Council Tax - Band D) - from 2009 / 10 URB - Northern Ireland Urban Rural var (3 category) - from 2011 / 12 URBRUR - Northern Ireland Urban Rural var (5 category) - from 2011 / 12 LAUA - Local Authority Code (new) from 2012 / 13 Adult Table: AGE - all years IAGEGR 2 - Individual Adult 10 Year Age Bands – Pub - all years IAGEGRP - Individual Adult 5 Year Age Bands – Pub – all years MS - Marital status - all years W 1 - Age when widowed – all years NIREL 2 (alternative religious denomination) - from 2008 / 09 DOBMONTH - Month of birth - from 2009 / 10 DOBYEAR - Year of birth - from 2009 / 10 AGEHQUAL - How <b>old</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> when you achieved your highest qualification - from 2011 / 12 PENFLAG - Whether is State Pension Age - from 2010 / 11 POLLOPIN - Do you regard yourself as a nationalist, unionist or neither - from 2011 / 12 RELIGENW - Religion in England and Wales - from 2011 / 12 RELIGSC - Religion in Scotland- from 2011 / 12 SIDQN - Sexual Identity - from 2011 / 12 TYPEED - Type of school or college attended - from 2012 - 13 Child Table: DOBMONTH (date of birth month) - from 2009 / 10 DOBYEAR (date of birth year) - from 2009 / 10 TYPEED - Type of school or college attended - from 2012 - 13 HBAI: The HBAI uses household disposable incomes, after adjusting for the household size and composition, as a proxy for material living standards. More precisely, it is a proxy for the level of consumption of goods and services that people could attain given the disposable income of the household in which they live. In order to allow comparisons of the living standards of different types of households, income is adjusted to take into account variations in the size and composition of the households in a process known as equivalisation. A key assumption made in HBAI is that all individuals in the household benefit equally from the combined income of the household. This enables the total equivalised income of the household to be used as a proxy for the standard of living of each household member. This Safe Room access version of the HBAI comprises unrounded data and extra variable CTLIAB - Amount of council tax the household is liable for. An earlier HBAI study, Institute for Fiscal Studies Households Below Average Income Dataset, 1961 - 1991, is held at the Archive under SN 3300. PI series: The Safe Room access version of the FRS/HBAI also contains the Pensioners' Incomes (PI) series data from 2007 / 08 onwards. The PI series carries out a few extra steps beyond the FRS and HBAI data to derive pension income variables. Unlike the standard EUL versions, the ages of the head of household and spouse have not been top-coded at 80 years in the Safe Room access version. Further details of FRS and HBAI data can be found on the FRS major studies and HBAI major studies web pages. The study documentation in the table below includes the UK Data Archive Data Dictionaries for all years of available data, as well as all documentation for 2014 / 15. Documentation for previous years will be provided alongside the data for access and are also available upon request. For the sixth edition (July 2016) data and documentation were added for the year 2014 / 15.
