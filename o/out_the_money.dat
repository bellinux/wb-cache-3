5|$|With the bar full, {{the guys}} begin their routine, but are soon {{stopped by the}} police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, {{stripping}} is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.|$|E
500|$|NPR's Ken Tucker {{described}} the album as a [...] "glossy but heartfelt work" [...] and approvingly compared its contrasting philosophy to Nick Lowe's Quality Street: A Seasonal Selection for All the Family, {{both of which}} he described as [...] "will {{put you in a}} holiday mood". Matt Casarino of PopMatters gave the album a generally favorable review, claiming that [...] "Clarkson plays it safe and spends too much time showing off her upper register, but Wrapped in Red is a warm and romantic addition to the Christmas pop Zeitgeist," [...] adding: [...] "Wrapped in Red doesn’t need edge; it’s just dynamic and varied enough to be satisfying, and it’s light-years better than any of the whitewashed Christmas crap Simon Cowell has inflicted on the world". [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave a favorable review, particularly lauding [...] "Underneath the Tree", and described Clarkson's rendering of the Christmas standards as [...] "fairly straight". She added: [...] "She starts gently on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] before belting <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> notes. She ambles assuredly through the soulful favorite [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] and hangs by the piano for a torchy “White Christmas." [...] Newsdays music columnist Glenn Gamboa wrote that [...] "Clarkson handles it all expertly — hitting remarkably high notes on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] and swinging jazzily on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Dunn. The new songs make Wrapped in Red a real gift, as the title track and [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] channel the Phil Spector Christmas albums; and [...] "4 Carats" [...] somehow blends [...] "Stronger" [...] and [...] "Santa Baby". Reviewing for HitFix, Melinda Newman gave the album an [...] "A" [...] rating, praising Clarkson's vocal performances and noting that she and Greg Kurstin [...] "have clearly studied legendary Christmas albums of yore—most notably Spector's A Christmas Gift For You and Andy Williams' Merry Christmas—to lovingly recreate Christmas standards, as well as craft new ones in the image of those sets." [...] Chris Klimek of Slate declared Wrapped in Red as the best of 2013's new Christmas records, noting it for its vintage sound. He also observed that its five original tracks, most notably [...] "Wrapped in Red" [...] and [...] "Underneath the Tree", [...] "have reasonable odds of remaining in the yuletide rotation five years from now." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Jon [...] Caramanica wrote that [...] "Clarkson is very likely the only singer working in pop with a real possibility of creating a modern holiday classic along the lines of Carey's [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", and remarked that her takes on familiar songs, however accomplished, are [...] "also faithful in the way that someone mindful of pop history would be." ...|$|E

40|$|According to {{previous}} results, the main variance reduction techniques performed well during the Monte Carlo simulation of Asian calls (Marins, Santos e Saliby, 2003). Control Variate best performed {{in terms of}} the precision of the estimates, whereas Descriptive Sampling was the fastest technique. However, a performance deterioration was noted as the exercise probability of the Asian calls was decreased, or equivalently, as these calls became <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> In this <b>the</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> region, <b>the</b> call exercise becomes a rare event and the simulation process remains injured. One possible solution is to implement Importance Sampling, which is a specific technique to deal with rare event simulation problems. This technique has already performed well in <b>the</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> European call simulation case (Saliby, Marins and Santos, 2005). Therefore, the objective {{of this article is to}} use Importance Sampling in <b>the</b> simulation <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> Asian calls, in order to verify if the precision of the estimates is preserved. It is also implemented a combination of Importance Sampling with the two previously mentioned best techniques, Control Variate and Descriptive Sampling. According to the main findings, Importance Sampling was not only crucial to allow simulation in <b>the</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> region, but also to provide additional precision gains when combined with the two other techniques. ...|$|R

2500|$|In general, equity may {{be viewed}} as a call option on the firm, and this allows for the {{valuation}} of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse; [...] see Distressed securities. [...] Here, since the principle of limited liability protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see bond valuation. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. exercise their option) and not to liquidate. Thus analogous to <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debt—and this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate option valuation technique. (A further application of this principle is the analysis of principal–agent problems; see contract design under principal–agent problem.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Mack {{himself was}} upset by these allegations: when some writers {{accused him of}} {{deliberately}} losing the second game of the 1913 World Series in order to extend the series and make more money in ticket sales, he uncharacteristically wrote an angry letter to the Saturday Evening Post to deny it, saying [...] "I consider playing for the gate receipts ... nothing short of dishonest." [...] With the Athletics leading the Series three games to one, several New York writers predicted that the Athletics would deliberately lose Game Five in New York so that Mack {{would not have to}} refund the $50,000 in ticket sales for Game Six in Philadelphia. After reading this, Mack told his players that if they won Game Five he would give them the team's entire share of the Game Five gate receipts — about $34,000. The Athletics won the Game and the series, and Mack gave <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> as promised.|$|E
