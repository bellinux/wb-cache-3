By 1956, <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the complex had been built {{at the cost of}} 23billion yen, an enormous expense given the economic depression of the time.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the well}} {{can still be}} seen locked inside a red-brick {{enclosure}} with a steel gate, and its geothermal heat can be felt outside the building. Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at {{the perimeter of the}} compound, which has a makeshift shed in <b>one</b> <b>corner.</b> A caretaker, paid by Mindef, takes care of the place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location. The hot spring is less frequented nowadays but remains rustic for rural and suburban families to discover and explore.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the chapel}} was {{believed}} to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings {{scattered on the}} floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the room.|$|E
5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the gun platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E

50|$|Kormakssaga {{states that}} the holmgang was fought on an ox hide or cloak with sides that were three meters long. It was staked {{on the ground with}} stakes used just for that purpose and placed in a {{specific}} manner now unknown. After that the area was marked by drawing three borders around the square hide, each about one foot from the previous <b>one.</b> <b>Corners</b> of the outermost border were marked with hazel staves. Combatants had to fight inside these borders. Stepping out of borders meant forfeiture, running away meant cowardice.|$|R
5|$|The castle {{comprises}} {{a rectangular}} courtyard {{surrounded by a}} curtain wall, with a tower house, or keep, at <b>one</b> <b>corner,</b> and the round Glassin Tower projecting from the opposite corner. The foundations of demolished ranges of buildings remain around {{two sides of the}} courtyard. Of the outer court, only an earth bank shows the position of the walls, with fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.|$|E
5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and a shed was built in <b>one</b> <b>corner.</b> A slit trench was dug {{on the north side of}} the building, a rifle embrasure formed on the east side of the building, and a machine-gun position was dug out and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E
5|$|Launceston Castle {{is located}} in the town of Launceston, Cornwall, England. It was {{probably}} built by Robert the Count of Mortain after 1068, and initially comprised an earthwork and timber castle with a large motte in <b>one</b> <b>corner.</b> Launceston Castle formed the administrative centre of the new earldom of Cornwall, with a large community packed within the walls of its bailey. It was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century and then substantially redeveloped by Richard of Cornwall after 1227, including a high tower to enable visitors to view his surrounding lands. When Richard's son, Edmund, inherited the castle, he moved the earldom's administration to Lostwithiel, triggering the castle's decline. By 1337, the castle was increasingly ruinous and used primarily as a gaol and to host judicial assizes.|$|E

5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in <b>one</b> <b>corner,</b> and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, {{located along}} Skudai Road, {{is the main}} and the oldest mosque in the state. It was built with a {{combination}} of Victorian, Moorish and Malay architectures. The Johor Bahru Old Chinese temple, located on the Trus Road, hosts the Gods of five Chinese dialects spoken in the city. It was built in 1875 and renovated by the Persekutuan Tiong Hua Johor Bahru (Johor Bahru Tiong Hua Association) in 1994–95 {{with the addition of a}} small L-shaped museum in <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the square premises. The Wong Ah Fook Mansion, the home of the late Wong Ah Fook, was a former historical attraction. It stood for more than 150 years but was demolished illegally by its owner in 2014 to make way for a commercial housing development without informing the state government. Other historical religious buildings include the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple, Sri Raja Mariamman Hindu Temple, Gurdwara Sahib and Church of the Immaculate Conception.|$|E
5|$|The east range, of c.1635, {{comprises}} a long, narrow building, {{with a short}} {{projecting wing}} to the south-east. It is {{the only part of}} the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a long gallery, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a harpsichord, among other furniture. In the south-east wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair. The first-floor room has a 17th-century painted ceiling, decorated with fruit, foliage, and heraldic emblems. The south-east wing has crow-step gables, and a sundial on <b>one</b> <b>corner.</b> The east window of the long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment. The roof is of 18th-century date, and is lower than the original, resulting in the loss of the triangular pediments which once topped each of the side windows.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} contrast of bare nave walls against the paintings {{drawn on the}} metal ceilings leading to the main altar and retablo mayor. The ceiling paintings {{were known to be}} works of Raymundo Francia, as shown by his signature on <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the dome in the 1930s. An acknowledgment on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were never touched up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} {{the fact that there was}} a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation. The tail globe logo {{is intended}} to represent stability and reliability, and its positioning on the tail, with <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> off the edge, represents service innovation. The EVA Air livery was updated in 2002, adding a larger typeface {{and the use of}} green covering the aircraft below the window line. The tail design and logo remained unchanged. In late 2015, EVA Air redesigned their livery and tail logo, using the dark green color on the belly, and cancelled the orange line {{on the edge of the}} tail to highlight the corporate identity. It's the third generation livery of EVA Air, symbolizing their ambition to connect Taiwan to the world.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposals}} to reduce congestion on Oxford Street. Horse-drawn vehicles were banned in 1931, and traffic signals were installed in the same year. To alleviate congestion and help traffic flow of buses, most of Oxford Street is designated a bus lane during peak daytime hours, when private vehicles are banned. It is only open to buses, taxis and two-wheeled vehicles between 7:00am and 7:00pm on all days except Sundays. The ban was introduced experimentally in June 1972. It was considered a success, with an estimated increase of £250,000 in retail sales. In 2009, a new diagonal crossing opened at Oxford Circus, allowing pedestrians to cross from <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> of Oxford Street to the opposite corner without having to cross the road twice or use the pedestrian underpass. This doubles the pedestrian capacity at the junction.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} Kirby Muxloe Castle in October 1480, under the {{direction}} of Roger Bowlott, who was Lord Hasting's steward and became the clerk of works for the project. Most of the existing manor house was protected during the work, and probably continued in use while the new castle was built around it. A workshop able to make up to 100,000 bricks a week was constructed by Antony Yzebrond from Flanders. A brook was redirected to feed the new moat and a garden was established alongside the castle. Work intensified in early 1481, with the stonework being supervised by John Cowper, a master mason. The work progressed at speed and, at peak periods, over 40 men were working on the site. It is uncertain exactly how much of the castle was constructed, although at least <b>one</b> <b>corner</b> tower had been nearly completed by 1483 and the ground floor of the gatehouse laid down.|$|E
