5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> after landing on the main gear.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventories}} of both 1514 and 1546 also list several hundred heavy darts and lime pots {{that were designed}} to be thrown <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of enemy ships from the fighting tops, although no physical evidence of either of these weapon types has been identified. Of the 50 handguns listed in the Anthony Roll, the complete stocks of five matchlock muskets and fragments of another eleven have been found. They had been manufactured mainly in Italy, with some originating from Germany. Found in storage were several gunshields, a rare type of firearm consisting of a wooden shield with a small gun fixed in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{received}} his commission as an ensign in the Navy. He attended the Navy Supply Corps School for new junior officers, {{which was then}} located on Harvard Business School's campus. Following the completion of his initial training, Williams {{was assigned to the}} aircraft carrier USS Lexington (CV-2), where he served as a dispersing officer (or paymaster) for a 2,000-person crew. The USS Lexington was deployed to the Pacific Ocean theater. In May 1942, the USS Lexington was sunk by Japanese forces during the Battle of the Coral Sea. During the evacuation of the Lexington, Williams swung from a line <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of an American destroyer that had arrived to rescue the crew of the sinking aircraft carrier.|$|E

5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions. At 03:15, Niémens mizenmast and main topmast collapsed and another fire {{broke out in the}} main top, but Amethyst was also severely damaged and at 03:30 her mainmast fell <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> from a combination of shot damage and stress in high winds. Niémens mainmast also collapsed a few minutes later. Both frigates had stopped firing at 03:25, as the confusion on their decks was brought under control.|$|E
5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed to collide with one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up. With one of the hatches to the gun ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch, {{which could not be}} repaired. During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> {{to get a better view}} of the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned her attention to the Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation.|$|E
5|$|French {{fire was}} {{taking its toll}} on the British ship, and at 22:20, Amethysts {{mizzenmast}} was shot through and collapsed on the quarterdeck, smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour's command of his ship. Thétis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state, turning sharply to starboard but coming to a sudden halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed. With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered, Amethyst and Thétis gradually closed on one another, Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her, while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot. At 23:00, Pinsum suddenly swung his frigate towards Amethyst, the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British. At his signal, the soldiers and sailors crowded <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and railings, ready to leap onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand-to-hand combat. With seconds remaining, Seymour ordered his gunners to fire. The double-shotted broadside, fired at point-blank range, killed or wounded over 100 men, including most of the officers. Only four guns were still serviceable on Thétis, which was set alight in three places due to {{the proximity of the}} British muzzle flashes.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that further}} {{manoeuvring}} would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown {{and the ship}} evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took {{a survey of the}} ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of a motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch—like the cruiser—was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the saga}} {{states that the}} forces of Ölvir were {{superior}} in numbers to those of Earl Páll, it also notes that Ölvir's ships were smaller. Ölvir brought his own ship {{up next to the}} earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, Ólafr Hrólfsson, attacked Ölvir's smallest ships, and cleared three of them in a short time. Ölvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl Páll's own ship. When he spotted Earl Páll, Ölvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> With the fall of Earl Páll, a great shout goes up; but just at that moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at Ölvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although Ölvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. Ölvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. Ölvir eventually recovered his wits, but was unable to rally his troops—the battle was lost. Earl Páll pursued Ölvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before giving up the chase. Five of Ölvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl Páll. The earl is later further strengthened by two longships, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl Páll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl Rögnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl Rögnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl Páll successfully held onto the earldom. Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994 the bridge deck {{launching}} gantry fell onto the Gwent viaduct, causing the 200tonne bridge deck unit to fall <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> below. Although this delayed the project by ten weeks, the builders still completed the bridge on schedule two years later.|$|E

25|$|The Gazze 1 was boarded by {{soldiers}} from speedboats. Passengers and crew on board offered no resistance, {{and the ship}} was commandeered without incident. Passengers were ordered <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> while dogs searched the ship, and were later taken to the dining hall and body-searched. They were not handcuffed, and provided with food during the journey to Ashdod.|$|E
25|$|Asgard {{was bought}} for £1,000 in 1904 (£84,000 in 2006) {{from one of}} Norway's most famous boat designers, Colin Archer. The {{interior}} was custom built to the specifications of Childers and his wife Molly. Molly, disabled following a childhood accident, sometimes took the helm of Asgard, strapped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> with harnesses so she could navigate the rough waters of the Irish Sea.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 2008, the Mexican Navy intercepted a 10-meter long narco-submarine {{travelling}} about 200 kilometers off {{the southwest}} of Oaxaca; in a raid, Special Forces rappelled from a helicopter <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of the submarine and arrested four smugglers {{before they could}} scuttle their vessel. The vessel {{was found to be}} loaded with 5.8 tons of cocaine and was towed to Huatulco, Oaxaca, by a Mexican Navy patrol boat.|$|E
5|$|The first {{seaplanes}} used in combat, {{supplied by}} French manufacturer Donnet-Lévêque, were operated from Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{and her two}} sisters during the blockade. However, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was {{not satisfied with the}} operation, as the ships lacked enough <b>deck</b> space for <b>the</b> planes, as well as a lack of cranes with which they could easily hoist <b>the</b> planes <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks.</b> <b>The</b> planes were later moved to a hangar at the navy yard in Teodo. By 1913, the four new dreadnoughts of the —the only dreadnoughts built for the fleet—were coming into active service. With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts, the navy shifted Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her sisters to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|R
50|$|The Harbour Board {{purchased}} the timber number 1 wharf in 1915, and replaced {{this with a}} concrete wharf within a year. The number 5 wharf was constructed in 1925 and was the entry/exit point for railway lines extending <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> wharf <b>deck.</b> Plans indicate that the number 5 wharf's deck had two pairs of railway tracks which merged at the junction with the number 4 wharf. <b>The</b> tracks curved <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> wharf <b>deck</b> at <b>the</b> {{southern end of the}} number 5 wharf, and the corner of the wharf was truncated parallel to this curve.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, the US {{military}} {{issued a}} contract to the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Chester, Pennsylvania, {{for the construction of}} a new type of motorized vehicle carrier. The ship, USNS Comet, had a stern ramp as well as interior ramps, which allowed cars to drive directly from <b>the</b> dock, <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ship, and into place. Loading and unloading was sped up dramatically. Comet also had an adjustable chocking system for locking cars <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> and a ventilation system to remove exhaust gases that accumulate during vehicle loading.|$|R
25|$|Otter {{trawlers}} {{usually have}} two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated {{by its own}} winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> Some trawlers tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.|$|E
25|$|During workups for the 1981–1982 Mediterranean cruise, an EA-6B Prowler piloted by Marine Lieut. Steven E. White, {{crashed on}} the deck of the Nimitz. Upon {{crashing}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> the Prowler rammed broadside into six fueled F-14 Tomcats causing a fuel fire and ordnance to explode, including an AIM-7 Sparrow missile. The incident, which caused only superficial damage to the Nimitz, resulted in three F-14s destroyed, 45 injured sailors and fourteen casualties with VF-41 losing three shipmates.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday 5 January 1975, a {{disaster}} occurred in Hobart when the handyweight {{bulk ore carrier}} MV Lake Illawarra collided with the Tasman Bridge in what would later {{be referred to as}} the Tasman Bridge disaster. The ship crashed into pylon 19, and then bounced across to strike pylon 18, knocking both pylons down, and also causing a 127-metre section of steel and concrete roadway to collapse <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of the ship. The Illawarra sank, killing seven crew, and five motorists were killed when they drove off the gap, plunging into the river below.|$|E

50|$|Battery Way was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the fortifications program initiated by the Taft Board. Constructed between 1908 and 1914, it was the only single-pit mortar battery built {{as part of the}} program. Its four coast defense mortars, M1890MI guns on M1896MI carriages, were designed to loft armor-piercing shells in a high trajectory <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of warships threatening Manila Bay. Advances in naval gunnery and ship design rendered these weapons mostly obsolete by the end of World War I.|$|R
50|$|In a naval {{battle against}} King Eumenes of Pergamon in 184 BC, Hannibal of Carthage had clay pots filled with venomous snakes and {{instructed}} his sailors {{to throw them}} <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of enemy ships. The Roman commander Manius Aquillius poisoned the wells of besieged enemy cities in about 130 BC. In about AD 198, the Parthian city of Hatra (near Mosul, Iraq) repulsed the Roman army led by Septimius Severus by hurling clay pots filled with live scorpions at them.|$|R
25|$|Israeli commandos abseiled from a {{helicopter}} onto the Defne Y. The ship's crane had been positioned {{in such a}} way as to make it hard or impossible to abseil <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> forcing troops to descend directly to the roof. Soldiers met no physical resistance as they secured the ship, but reportedly encountered verbal abuse. Passengers cooperated with the soldiers, were not handcuffed, and kept in their cabins during the trip to Ashdod. An İHH cameraman on board the Defne Y claimed to have been beaten and interrogated for five hours over a hidden videotape.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{passengers}} on board San Juan were able to jump <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of the S.C.T. Dodd before the two ships drifted apart. Not long after the collision occurred, {{the lights went out}} on board the San Juan. While heading up to the San Juan's deck, passenger George Houghton, observed a group of distressed passengers by the main stairwell, shouting at each other and praying. Houghton compared the sight to Dante's Inferno. Shortly after the collision, the San Juan began to capsize on its port side and start sinking stern first. Wireless operator Clifford Paulson hurriedly returned to his room and began sending out distress signals. Soon after a single ship had replied, water rushed in through Paulson's door and completely flooded his room. Luckily, Paulson was able to escape.|$|E
25|$|Nobel {{also began}} to adopt a single-hull design, where the ship's hull forms part of its tank structure. In November 1880 he ordered his first single-hulled tanker, the Moses. Within a year, he ordered seven more single-hulled tankers: the Mohammed, Tatarin, Bramah, Spinoza, Socrates, Darwin, Koran, Talmud, and Calmuck. Branobel {{experienced}} {{one of the first}} oil tanker disasters. In 1881 Zoroasters sister-ship, Nordenskjöld, exploded in Baku while taking on kerosene. The pipe carrying the cargo was jerked away from the hold when the ship was hit by a gust of wind. Kerosene then spilled <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and down into the engine room, where mechanics were working in the light of kerosene lanterns. The ship then exploded, killing half the crew. Nobel responded to the disaster by creating a flexible, leakproof loading pipe which was much more resistant to spills.|$|E
