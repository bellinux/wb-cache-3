30|$|It {{is worth}} {{reconciling}} <b>our</b> results with <b>previous</b> reports. In contrast to <b>our</b> results, <b>previous</b> reports show that twin boundaries strengthen nanowires [16], even with circular cross-sections. In Ref. [16], fixed boundary condition is applied, which may cause stress concentration and make dislocation nucleation artificially easier. When the nucleation is easier, stress for dislocation penetration of twin boundaries becomes dependent on twin spacing. To confirm this point, {{we have used}} the same boundary condition as in Ref. [16], and indeed have found the artificial strengthening effects (as shown by the cross symbols (labeled as nanopillars) in Fig. 2).|$|R

These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore, memory is of the past, [...] prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our [...] "imprints" [...] cannot be performed suddenly.
