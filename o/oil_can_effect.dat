Seth Lover, the legendary {{designer of the}} Gibson [...] "P.A.F."

50|$|Of {{the many}} species {{affected}} by oil toxicity, birds {{are usually the}} most severely affected. Birds that nest near the shoreline {{are most likely to}} be affected, including loons (Gavia spp.), grebes (Family: Podicipedidae), murres (Uria spp.), pelicans (Family: Pelecanidae), and penguins (Family: Spheniscidae). The species of bird and the type of <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> vary the <b>effects</b> of oil exposure. Birds affected by oil toxicity often die from hypothermia, starvation, exhaustion, or drowning. Birds exposed to oil become more susceptible to other diseases due to a reduced immunologic function.|$|R
40|$|Fish <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> have {{beneficial}} <b>effects</b> {{in health}} and disease. In healthy individuals, reduction of the inflammatory status may be of benefit, whereas in patients with systemic inflammation, such as sepsis, {{it is important to}} diminish the immunosuppression that is thought to contribute to poor outcome. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of dietary fish oil on monocytes/macrophages in blood, bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneum and chemokine concentrations in blood and peritoneum in healthy mice and mice with endotoxin-induced inflammation. Mice were fed a Western-type diet without fish oil (C) or with 2. 8 % fish oil (FO) for 6 wk and then either killed (healthy mice) or injected i. p. with endotoxin (LPS) and killed after 3, 8, 12, 24, or 48 h. Blood, bone marrow, spleen, and peritoneal lavage were collected. Expression of cell surface molecules and chemokine receptors was analyzed by flow cytometry and chemokine concentrations measured by ELISA. Healthy mice in the FO group had lower proportions of classical monocytes in blood than healthy mice in the C group. LPS administration increased the proportion of classical monocytes in blood in mice in the FO group but not in those in the C group. Healthy mice in the FO group had lower serum concentrations of CCL 2 than mice in the C group, but in inflamed mice, CCL 2 concentrations were higher in the FO group than in the C group. These results indicate that dietary fish <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> attenuate the inflammatory status in homeostasis but intensify the immune response upon inflammation...|$|R

50|$|However, {{properties}} of the coolant (water, oil, or air) also affect cooling. As example, comparing water and oil as coolants, one gram of <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> absorb about 55% of the heat for the same rise in temperature (called the specific heat capacity). Oil has about 90% the density of water, so a given volume of <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> absorb only about 50% of {{the energy of the}} same volume of water. The thermal conductivity of water is about 4 times that of <b>oil,</b> which <b>can</b> aid heat transfer. The viscosity of <b>oil</b> <b>can</b> be ten times greater than water, increasing the energy required to pump oil for cooling, and reducing the net power output of the engine.|$|R
