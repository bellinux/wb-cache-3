5|$|About a {{year after}} her arrival at Quantico and several months after the {{successful}} completion of her training, Alex is living in New York City and is preparing to work the security detail for the upcoming Democratic National Convention. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convention, Alex awakes {{in the ruins of}} Grand Central Terminal, and discovers it was destroyed several hours earlier with high-grade explosives. Alex is taken into custody and learns that she is being charged with the terrorist attack on Grand Central.

5|$|Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's {{disaster}} {{plan was}} activated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack. It {{called for more}} than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to head back to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{officials}} charged Loughner {{the next}} day with killing federal government employees, attempting to assassinate a member of Congress and attempting to kill federal employees. Police reports reveal he had purchased a Glock pistol at a Sportsman's Warehouse store, after passing the required FBI background check, less than six weeks before and attempted to buy additional ammunition for the pistol at a Walmart <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shooting, but the clerk refused to sell it to him based on his appearance and demeanor.|$|E
5|$|Hill and Cape {{appealed to}} the London Court of Quarter Sessions. The prosecutor, Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip, {{solicited}} testimony from biological and medical experts and from the writer Rudyard Kipling. But when Kipling appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial, Inskip {{told him he would}} not be needed. James Melville had wired the defence witnesses the night before to tell them not to come in. The panel of twelve magistrates who heard the appeal had to rely on passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the Director of Public Prosecutions had refused to release copies for them to read. After deliberating for only five minutes, they upheld Biron's decision.|$|E
5|$|Humberto {{continued}} to intensify <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 23rd {{as the central}} dense overcast became well defined, {{despite the lack of}} a clear eye feature. However, the intensification was slowed somewhat by the proximity of Iris to the west, whose outflow interfered with that of Humberto. Early on August 24, Humberto strengthened into a Category2 hurricane, finally forming a well-defined eye, as it slowed down and entered a Fujiwhara interaction with Iris. That afternoon, while still moving west-northwest, Humberto reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to trace {{the route of the}} Ford van, police {{examined}} CCTV footage from every major road and motorway taken in England within two days of the bombing. Footage revealed that the van was driven south along the M1 motorway into London on the Friday afternoon before the attack. It was seen again heading north along the motorway at 7:40pm, accompanied by the Ford Granada. Detectives surmised that the van had been loaded with explosives in London and that the Granada was intended to be the getaway vehicle. The truck was last recorded travelling east along the M62 motorway towards Manchester at 8:31am <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{was not in}} Bradman's planned Test team. However, the Australian skipper {{changed his}} mind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played {{in the hope of}} {{exploiting}} a wet wicket. Johnston had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on similar surfaces. He showed his credentials by taking a match total of 9/183 from 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory by eight wickets. England elected to bat first and after strike bowler Ray Lindwall broke down on the first day, the burden on Johnston grew.|$|E
5|$|Once in Adenau, the {{regiment}} dispersed to many {{villages in the}} area, while Colonel Middleton stayed in a large home in Adenau where the owners continued to live as well. During the stay in Adenau, the 47th continued with its training, building a rifle range, running combat problems, and practicing lessons learned from its recent combat operations. In early March 1919, after nearly four months in Adenau, the 47th was ordered {{to the area of}} Remagen on the Rhine. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> move, Middleton had breakfast with General Pershing's aide, Colonel George Marshall, who had come to Adenau the day before to inform Middleton of his regiment's new orders.|$|E

5|$|The British fleet {{departed}} {{its base}} on 18 August, and launched the first raid against Kaafjord <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 22nd. This major attack was unsuccessful, {{and a small}} raid that evening inflicted little damage. Two further major strikes were conducted on 24 and 29 August, but without success. Tirpitz was struck by two bombs during the raid on 24 August, but neither caused significant damage. British losses during Operation Goodwood were 17 aircraft to all causes, and a frigate sunk by a submarine. An escort carrier was also badly damaged. German forces suffered the loss of 12 aircraft and damage to 7 ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while Friedrich der Grosse and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on Ösel. The coastal artillery in both locations were quickly silenced by the battleships' heavy guns. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th, Friedrich der Grosse, Kaiserin, and König Albert were detached to support German troops advancing toward Anseküll. The three ships fired on the battery at Zerel for an hour, which prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts.|$|E

5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker tape from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, {{and he was}} apprehended at {{his home}} in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking laudanum shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Peel {{was very}} popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became {{well known for}} liking alcohol. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match that England won after {{following}} on, Peel was intoxicated {{and had to be}} sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened—Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket {{for most of his life}} and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.|$|E
