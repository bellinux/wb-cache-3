25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{assert that}} there was no Liber (other than a god of wine) within historical memory. <b>O.</b> <b>de</b> Cazanove argues that the domain of the sovereign god Jupiter was that of sacred, sacrificial wine (vinum inferium), while that of Liber and Libera was confined to secular wine (vinum spurcum); these two types were obtained through differing fermentation processes. The offer of wine to Liber was made possible by naming the mustum (grape juice) stored in amphoras sacrima.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} period from 1517 to 1519, the Spanish conquistadors Bernal Díaz del Castillo (who {{referred}} {{to the use of}} cocoa by Aztecs in his book Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España) and Hernán Cortés both tried the drink and found it to have both bitter and spicy tastes due to the use of achiote. On occasions cornmeal and hallucinogenic mushrooms were also added to the drink. Thereafter the Spaniards knew that cocoa beans were considered legal tender by the locals. Fray Toribio de Benavente (nicknamed Motolinía) mentioned the existence of cocoa in his works such as Memorias or Libro de Cosas de la Nueva España <b>o</b> <b>de</b> los naturales de ella.|$|E

500|$|Seventh song [...] "Que Vuelvas" [...] {{is another}} song {{inspired}} by {{her relationship with}} Ríos. It was musically compared to Shakira's past single [...] "Estoy Aquí" [...] (1996). The following track, [...] "Tú", lyrically expresses the sweetness of love, with Shakira singing: [...] "Porque eres tú mi sol, la fe con que vivo" [...] and [...] "nunca podré vivir sin ti". The ninth song is [...] "Dónde Están los Ladrones?", a guitar-driven song which criticizes the politic and social reality in South American nations {{at the time of}} the album's release. She sings, [...] "Los han visto por ahí, los han visto en los tejados, dando vueltas en París, condenando en los juzgados. Con la nariz empolvada, de corbata <b>o</b> <b>de</b> blue jeans, los has visto en las portadas todas, sin más nada que decir". Finally, she sentences the aristocracy singing, [...] "Los han visto en los cócteles todos repartiendo ministerios". The following track on Dónde Están los Ladrones? is [...] "Sombra de Ti". During the song, Shakira remembers a past love, singing, [...] "Todas las palabras que dijimos, y los besos que nos dimos, como siempre, hoy estoy pensando en ti". The album's closing song [...] "Ojos Así" [...] is accompanied by a [...] "Lambadalike middle eastern rhythm". Containing a verse in Arabic, lyrically Shakira laments that even though she has traveled from Bahrain to Beirut, she has never found eyes like her lover has.|$|E

2500|$|Cuban {{music is}} very rich {{and is the}} most {{commonly}} known expression of Cuban culture. The central form of this music is Son, {{which has been the}} basis of many other musical styles like [...] "Danzón de nuevo ritmo", mambo, cha-cha-chá and salsa music. Rumba ("de cajón <b>o</b> <b>de</b> solar") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Hispanic elements of style. [...] The Tres was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, Taíno origin, or both, such as the maracas, güiro, marímbula and various wooden drums including the mayohuacán.|$|E
2500|$|The Mexican Armed Forces' {{policy on}} sexual {{orientation}} is ambiguous, leaving homosexual and bisexual soldiers in a [...] "legal limbo". Officially, {{there is no}} law or policy preventing homosexuals from serving, and applicants are not questioned on the subject. In practice, however, outed homosexual and bisexual soldiers are subject to severe harassment and are often discharged. One directive, issued in 2003, described actions [...] "en contra de la moral <b>o</b> <b>de</b> las buenas costumbres dentro y fuera del servicio [...] " [...] ("contrary to morality or good manners on- and off-duty") as serious misconduct warranting disciplinary action. Other references to morality are found throughout military documents, leaving room for interpretation with regards to sexual orientation. Although there is no clear position from current military leadership, several retired generals have agreed that homosexual soldiers were usually removed from service either through an encouraged withdrawal or dishonorable discharge.|$|E
2500|$|Rumba (de solar <b>o</b> <b>de</b> cajón) is {{a secular}} musical style from the docks {{and the less}} prosperous areas of Havana and Matanzas. A the beginning, rumba musicians used a trio of wooden boxes (cajones) [...] to play, that were {{substituted}} {{at a later time}} by drums, similar in appearance to conga drums. The treble drum is called [...] "quinto", the medium range drum is called [...] "macho or tres-dos" [...] (three-two), because its essential rhythm is based on the Cuban clave pattern, and the bass drum is called [...] "hembra o salidor," [...] because it usually began or [...] "broke in" [...] (rompía) the rumba. In the Rumba ensemble they also utilize two sticks or spoons to beat over a hollow piece of bamboo called [...] "guagua" [...] or [...] "catá," [...] as well as the Cuban Claves, the Güiro and some rattles from bantu origin called [...] "nkembi".|$|E

60|$|Meanwhile I see Hardwicke's Science Gossip for March {{gives an}} extract {{from a letter}} of M. <b>O.</b> <b>de</b> Thoron, communicated by him to the Academie des Sciences, December 1861, which {{confirms}} Mr. Joseph's story. He asserts that in the Bay of Pailon, in Esmeraldos, Ecuador, i.e. on the Pacific Coast, and also up {{more than one of}} the rivers, he has heard a similar sound, attributed by the natives to a fish which they call 'The Siren,' or 'Musico.' At first, he says, he thought it was produced by a fly, or hornet of extraordinary size; but afterwards, having advanced a little farther, he heard a multitude of different voices, which harmonised together, imitating a church organ to great perfection. The good people of Trinidad believe that the fish which makes this noise is the trumpet-fish, or Fistularia--a beast strange enough in shape to be credited with strange actions: but ichthyologists say positively no: that the noise (at least along the coast of the United States) is made by a Pogonias, a fish somewhat like a great bearded perch, and cousin of the Maigre of the Mediterranean, which is accused of making a similar purring or grunting noise, which can be heard from a depth of one hundred and twenty feet, and guides the fishermen to their whereabouts.|$|E

The sward heights were distributed in an experimental randomized block design with three replicates. Data was recorded by visual assessment, from sunrise until sundown, in three evaluation dates, two in the vegetative stage {{and one in the}} reproductive stage. The evaluated variables were grazing time, rumination time, idling time, number and length of meals, and number and length of meals intervals. Results indicated that with increasing sward height the animals reduced grazing time and the meal length as well, however, the ruminating time increased. The variables such as idling time, number of meals and number/length of intervals were not influenced by the sward surface height. The results showed changes in the animal grazing behavior due to the variations in sward height management...|$|R
