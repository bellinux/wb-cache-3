5|$|Another {{strikingly similar}} portrait, {{depicting}} a woman also credited as Jane– although the costume differs slightly– was <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, {{but is now}} in an undisclosed private collection. Owing to similarities between the two works, Edwards suggests they are both copies of a lost original, perhaps completed by the same studio. A third copy, <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by the English costume designer Herbert Norris, is known through records, although its whereabouts are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Before being {{acquired}} by the society, the Corstorphine hill site was a nursery, <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by Thomas Blaikie, who planted many of the great French parks such as ‘La Bagatelle’. On this site two nurserymen raised the famous apple cultivars ‘John Downie’ and ‘James Grieve’. Today, the zoo {{has one of the}} most diverse tree collections in the Lothians with 120 species. The south-facing aspect allows bananas to be grown outside. Increasingly, horticulture is seen as a discipline in its own right, with the focus on habitat creation within enclosures, food stuffs for the animals, and enrichment for both the animals and the visiting public.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, {{with his}} medical bills at £40,000 a year, Terry-Thomas's {{financial}} resources were dwindling. He {{and his wife}} sold their dream house and moved into the small cottage <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by his former wife Pat Patlanski, which she left to him in her will on her death in June that year. Shortly afterwards he worked with ghostwriter Terry Daum on an autobiography, Terry-Thomas Tells Tales. Although the first draft was completed by late summer 1984, Terry-Thomas refused to release the script and continued to make alterations, but never completed his copyediting: the book was finally published after his death.|$|E

High responds that the earth will appear once more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, untouched by Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir <b>once</b> <b>owned.</b> Völuspá stanza 51 is then quoted.|$|E

The Merchant’s House or Law’s Close at 339–343 High Street; <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by the Law family, {{is one of}} the best surviving examples of a sixteenth-century town house in Scotland. Sailors' Walk, at 443–449 High Street; consists of two seventeenth-century houses, resting on foundations dating back to around 1460. These two houses were once divided into four dwellings; three of which were owned by the Oliphant family and the fourth by James Ferguson of Raith.|$|E
5|$|Pleydell {{was born}} by 1519. The sixth of nine children, {{he was the}} fourth son of wealthy tenant farmer William Pleydell of Coleshill, Berkshire—now Oxfordshire—and Agnes Reason (daughter of Robert Reason of Corfe Castle, Dorset). His younger brother was John Pleydell, Member for Cricklade in 1593. The Pleydell family were thought to descend from Thomas de Coleshill, a knight who was awarded lordship of the eponymous parish on 2 March 1275 by King Edward I. Gabriel came of age by 1540, holding land <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by Sir Anthony Hungerford at Eisey (near the parish of Cricklade).|$|E

5|$|Smith's net worth, {{including}} {{real estate}} and stocks and bonds, was $3,250,000, and as he had no will his estate was divided equally among his mother, brother, nephew (James McGill) and niece (Eleanor Ewing). William Smith and James McGill later moved to Indianapolis in 1913 after purchasing the Indianapolis Baseball Club for $150,000. George Smith, the 1916 Kentucky Derby winner, was named after Pittsburgh Phil because he had <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> the colt's dam, Consuelo II. His racing Maxims, gleaned from his only interview with Edward Cole {{a few years before}} his death, are still considered valid by modern handicappers.|$|E
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual.

At {{the far end of the}} same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit.

Three of his siblings died of bubonic plague before 1829. Throughout his early youth, Ion was the focus of his parents' affectionate supervision: early on, Ilie Rădulescu purchased a house <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by the scholar Gheorghe Lazăr on the outskirts of Bucharest (near Obor), as a gift for his son.

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century a rising cost of {{consumable}} goods and a series of bad harvests brought about economic changes in Glamorgan. Those with enough wealth were able to seize on opportunities created by these unsettled conditions and set about enlarging and enclosing farm lands. The enclosure of freehold lands that began in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum and farms that were <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century most of the Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords, such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} tunnel {{as built}} {{was designed by}} Sir Alexander Binnie and built by S. Pearson & Sons, between 1892 and 1897, for whom Ernest William Moir was the lead engineer. It was constructed using tunnelling shield and compressed air techniques and a Greathead shield (named after its inventor, James Henry Greathead). It was lit by three rows of incandescent street lights. To clear the site in Greenwich, more than 600 people had to be rehoused, and a house reputedly <b>once</b> <b>owned</b> by Sir Walter Raleigh had to be demolished. The work force was largely drawn from immigrants; the tunnel lining was manufactured in Glasgow, while the manual labour came from provincial England, particularly Yorkshire.|$|E
