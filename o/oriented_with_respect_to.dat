40|$|An {{oriented}} graph is a directed graph without any cycle of length at most 2. To push a vertex of a directed graph is {{to reverse the}} orientation of the arcs incident to that vertex. Klostermeyer and MacGillivray defined push graphs which are equivalence class of <b>oriented</b> graphs <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> vertex pushing operation. They studied the homomorphism of the equivalence classes of <b>oriented</b> graphs <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> push operation. In this article, we further study the same topic and answer some of the questions asked in the above mentioned work. The anti-twinned graph of an {{oriented graph}} is obtained by adding and pushing a copy of each of its vertices. In particular, we show that two oriented graphs are in a push relation if and only if they have isomorphic anti-twinned graphs. Moreover, we study oriented homomorphisms of outerplanar graphs with girth at least five, planar graphs and planar graphs with girth at least eight <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the push operation...|$|R

50|$|Unlike the tangent {{galvanometer}}, the astatic galvanometer {{does not}} use the Earth's magnetic field for measurement, so it {{does not need to}} be <b>oriented</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the Earth's field, making it easier to use. It has two magnetized needles parallel to each other, but with the magnetic poles reversed. suspended by a silk thread. The lower needle is inside a vertical current sensing coil of wire and is deflected by the magnetic field created by the passing current, as in the tangent galvanometer above. The purpose of the second needle is to cancel the dipole moment of the first needle, so the suspended armature has no net magnetic dipole moment, and thus is not affected by the earth's magnetic field. The needle's rotation is opposed by the torsional elasticity of the suspension thread, which is proportional to the angle.|$|E
