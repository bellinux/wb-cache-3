5|$|Butlins Skegness (officially Butlins Resort Skegness), {{formerly}} Butlin's Skegness or Funcoast World; is {{a holiday}} camp located in Ingoldmells near Skegness in Lincolnshire, England. Sir William Butlin conceived of its creation {{based on his}} experiences at a Canadian summer camp in his youth and by observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> other holiday accommodation providers, both in seaside resort lodging houses and in earlier smaller holiday camps.|$|E
5|$|During the Labour {{leadership}} campaign, {{he described}} himself as a socialist, and spoke out against some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the Blair ministry, including criticising its record on civil liberties and foreign policy. Though he was not yet an MP {{at the time of the}} 2003 vote, Miliband was a strong critic of the Iraq War. He backed UK military action and intervention in Afghanistan and Libya respectively.|$|E
5|$|Fictional {{accounts}} sometimes {{portray the}} rebelling slaves as ancient Roman freedom fighters, struggling {{to change a}} corrupt Roman society and to end the Roman institution of slavery. Although this is not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions {{that the goal of}} the rebel slaves was to end slavery in the Republic, nor do any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery.|$|E

5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the Assembly during {{the writing of the}} Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
5|$|Braidwood {{regarded}} Westminster Hall as {{safe from}} destruction by 1:45am, partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the floating fire engine, {{but also because}} {{a change in the}} direction of the wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that the hall was safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00am, by which time the fire near the Hall was nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The firemen remained in place until about 5:00am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.|$|E

5|$|By June, {{the mayor}} was looking for {{political}} support to avert a full public inquiry. The National Party, whose members were dominant on the Council, and MLC Melinda Pavey had been particularly critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the Department of Local Government in the General Purpose Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address {{the findings of the}} report, and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of it. He also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E
5|$|Dungeons & Dragons {{has been}} the subject of rumors {{regarding}} players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III, the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel Mazes and Monsters and later made into a TV movie. The game was blamed for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather. Research by various psychologists, the first being that of Armando Simon, has concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of D.|$|E
5|$|In 1258 and 1259, Boniface was {{a member}} of the Council of Fifteen, which {{conducted}} business for Henry III under the Provisions of Oxford. This Council consisted of the earls of Leicester, Gloucester, Norfolk, Warwick, Hereford, the Count of Aumale, Peter of Savoy, John fitzGeoffrey, Peter de Montfort, Richard Grey, Roger Mortimer, James Audley, John Maunsell, Walter de Cantilupe, Bishop of Worcester as well as Boniface. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> this council was to send the Lusignans into exile. In April 1260, Boniface worked with Richard of Cornwall to broker a peace between King Henry and Prince Edward.|$|E

5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number}} of conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo {{is in love with}} Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E
5|$|Wooller was a {{dissident}} {{member of the}} Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). In 1991, Wooller accused the ICAEW of having built-in bias when it marked examinations during a recession, and used PE II (Professional Education II) results to show the bias. Wooller was fined by the ICAEW in 1995 for promoting unaccredited MBA courses. Wooller formed a ginger group when the ICAEW tried to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in 1995. Wooller's ginger group opposed many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the ICAEW. The merger was shelved after {{the majority of the}} ICAEW members voted against it. The ginger group decided to keep fighting for democratic reforms and in June 1996, demanded that the executive of the ICAEW be elected directly by the 109,000 members of the body, instead of by the ICAEW's council of seventy members. A year later, Wooller demanded that members of the ICAEW be allowed to vote on Peter Gerrard's key constitutional reform proposals, and Wooller's motion failed by 1,400 votes, including proxies.|$|E
