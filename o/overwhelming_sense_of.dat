500|$|Both Friedrich's {{life and}} art have at times been {{perceived}} by some to have been marked with an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loneliness. Art historians {{and some of his}} contemporaries attribute such interpretations to the losses suffered during his youth to the bleak outlook of his adulthood, while Friedrich's pale and withdrawn appearance helped reinforce the popular notion of the [...] "taciturn man from the North".|$|E
500|$|Lindsay Johns of the Daily Mail {{cited the}} Bullingdon Club, a {{socially}} exclusive student dining club at Oxford University of which Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson were former members, {{as a place}} for such people. She observed the [...] "jarring Hooray Henry lexicon (e.g. 'getting chateaued' for drunk), the verbal jousting between fragile egos eager for one-upmanship within the club’s rigid hierarchy, the endemic casual racism and the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> entitlement which are possessed by these obnoxious oiks" [...] in Laura Wade's 2010 play Posh, which depicted the Bullingdon Club as the [...] "Riot Club".|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, noting: [...] "While very {{little in the way of}} horrific action takes place in The Seventh Victim, the film has a haunting, lyrical, <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> melancholy and despair to it—death is looked upon as a sweet release from the oppression of a cold, {{meaningless}} existence." [...] They considered its conclusion [...] "without a doubt the bleakest ending to any film ever made in Hollywood." [...] Time Out London also praised the film, calling it Robson's [...] "masterpiece, a brooding melodrama built around a group of Satanists... the whole thing is held together by a remarkably effective mix of menace and metaphysics—half noir, half Gothic." ...|$|E

500|$|As the German Emperor, he officially {{received}} Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (his mother-in-law) and King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, {{and attended}} {{the wedding of}} his son Prince Henry to his niece Princess Irene. However, Frederick reigned for only 99days, {{and was unable to}} bring about much lasting change. The majority of the German ruling elite viewed Frederick's reign as merely a brief interim period before the accession of his son Wilhelm to the throne. [...] An edict he penned before he ascended to the throne that would limit the powers of the chancellor and monarch under the constitution was never put into effect, although he did force Robert von Puttkamer to resign as Prussian Minister of the Interior on 8 June, when evidence indicated that Puttkamer had interfered in the Reichstag elections. Dr. Mackenzie wrote that the Emperor had [...] "an almost <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the duties of his position". In a letter to Lord Napier, Empress Victoria wrote [...] "The Emperor is able to attend to his business, and do a great deal, but not being able to speak is, of course, most trying." [...] Frederick had the fervour but not the time to accomplish his desires, lamenting in May 1888, [...] "I cannot die ... What would happen to Germany?" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} more recent reviews: Rob Cromwell of The Guardian listed the final scene among six [...] "perfect end-of-show finales", saying of Blackadder: [...] "It was brilliantly funny throughout, right up until the last 60 seconds", and praising the writers and {{producer}} John Lloyd for [...] "deliver a perfectly pitched, poignant ending". Comparing Blackadder Goes Forth to the 2012 war serial Birdsong, Alison Graham of the Radio Times commented that [...] "Nothing ... evokes the terror of those unspeakable battlefields or leaves such an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loss as [...] going over the top to their certain death". Den of Geek's Carley Tauchert placed the episode second on her list of [...] "top 10 TV show endings", calling it [...] "one of the greatest interpretations of the madness of war that has ever been put on film". Reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club, Kate Kulzick described it as [...] "...a masterpiece, a hilarious and painful crystallization of everything Blackadder does well. It is without a doubt the best episode of the series and more than that, it’s one of the best series finales in television history". She particularly praised it for [...] "...its masterful balancing of comedy and tragedy. Both are interspersed throughout, with each character given moments of laugh out loud brilliance and poignant reflection", concluding that [...] "...there {{is no such thing as}} a perfect television show or episode, but “Goodbyeee” comes dang close". The academic and theatre director Mary Luckhurst contrasted the regular British comedic treatment of the Second World War with the absence of comedies set in the First World War, until the Blackadder series, which she considered [...] "an important British dramatic treatment" [...] of the War. Of the final episode Luckhurst wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|The egotist has an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the {{centrality}} of the 'Me', that is to say of their personal qualities. Egotism means placing oneself at the core of one's world with no concern for others, including those [...] "loved" [...] or considered as [...] "close", in any other terms except those subjectively set by the egotist.|$|E
60|$|The stillness was profound, Mr. Lewisham was now highly strung. Doubts assailed him suddenly, and an <b>overwhelming</b> apprehension, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> vast occurrences {{gathering}} above him. The {{darkness was}} a physical oppression....|$|R
60|$|And she {{was drawn}} to him strangely, as in a spell. Kneeling on the hearth-rug before him, {{she put her arms}} round his loins, and put her face against his thigh. Riches! Riches! She was <b>overwhelmed</b> with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a heavenful of riches.|$|R
50|$|Ending: In {{contrast}} {{to the beginning of}} the novel, which highlights Mataichi’s repeated failures in goldfish breeding, Mataichi finds the one fish that he had desired to create for over ten years swimming amongst the sludge. Mirroring the beginning, he finds himself in a reclining position on the mud, but now he is <b>overwhelmed</b> by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> peace.|$|R
2500|$|Garland's book {{dedication}} is a {{story in}} itself: [...] "To my father and mother, whose half-century pilgrimage on the main travelled road of life has brought them only toil and deprivation, this book of stories is dedicated by a son to whom every day brings a deepening sense of his parents' silent heroism". [...] As foreshadowed by the dedication, Garland's stories paint an unforgiving portrait of Midwestern farm life: [...] unrelenting physical toil, harsh living conditions, widespread poverty and an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hopelessness.|$|E
2500|$|When {{screenshots}} of {{the game}} were released in April of that year, it was seen that the original graphic style of Advance Wars would stay unchanged, and one could guess that changes would mostly be cosmetic. When a demo {{of the game}} was released at E3 that year, {{it was clear that}} the gameplay would stay nearly identical to its predecessor Advance Wars, though new content would be added. IGN journalist Craig Harris commented after E3 2003 that [...] " [...] doesn't have an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> newness".|$|E
2500|$|However, by {{the late}} 1950s, her health was deteriorating rapidly, and {{director}} K. Asif, probably unaware {{of the extent of}} Madhubala's illness, required long shooting schedules that made physical demands on her, whether it was posing as a veiled statue in suffocating make-up for hours under the studio lights or being shackled with heavy chains. It was also a time when Madhubala's relationship with Dilip Kumar was fading out, and [...] "The lives of Madhubala and her screen character are consistently seen as overlapping, it is because of the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loss and tragedy and the unrelenting diktat of destiny that clung to both and which neither could escape".|$|E
6000|$|... [4] Mathilda too is the unwitting {{victim in}} a story of incest. Like Oedipus, she has lost her parent-lover by suicide; like him she leaves {{the scene of the}} revelation <b>overwhelmed</b> by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> her own guilt, [...] "a sacred horror"; like him, she finds a measure of peace as she is about to die.|$|R
60|$|The {{mother looked}} at us. For a while, the proud, {{sensitive}} woman struggled successfully with herself; but the pang that wrung her {{was not to}} be endured in silence. With a low cry of pain, she hid her face in her hands. <b>Overwhelmed</b> by the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> her own degradation, she was even ashamed to let the man who loved her see that she was in tears.|$|R
60|$|No smoking was permitted, {{but some}} of the {{officers}} went down to the little open gallery to chew tobacco. No lights whatever were safe amidst that bundle of inflammable things. Bert suddenly fell yawning and shivering. He was <b>overwhelmed</b> by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> his own insignificance amidst these great rushing monsters of the air. He felt life was too big for him--too much for him altogether.|$|R
2500|$|Rosenhan and {{the other}} pseudopatients {{reported}} an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dehumanization, severe invasion of privacy, and boredom while hospitalized. Their possessions were searched randomly, and they were sometimes observed while using the toilet. They reported that though the staff seemed to be well-meaning, they generally objectified and dehumanized the patients, often discussing patients at length in their presence {{as though they were}} not there, and avoiding direct interaction with patients except as strictly necessary to perform official duties. Some attendants were prone to verbal and physical abuse of patients when other staff were not present. A group of bored patients waiting outside the cafeteria for lunch early were said by a doctor to his students to be experiencing [...] "oral-acquisitive" [...] psychiatric symptoms. Contact with doctors averaged 6.8 minutes per day.|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on my way home from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E
2500|$|Drake's songwriting is {{characterized}} by wistful introspection, existential contemplation, and minimal boasting, with lyrics that convey frankness, vulnerability, melancholia, and narcissism. Andy Gill of The Independent writes that he [...] "eschews anger or threat for a weariness shadowed by wistful regret." [...] Music journalist Greg Kot comments that Drake does not [...] "indulge in the macho poses that have dominated mainstream hip-hop for decades, and blur the line between singing and rhyming", adding that he [...] "makes his rhymes sound conversational, matter of fact, like he’s talking to the listener one-one-one". Tim Sendra of AllMusic notes that his [...] "introspective tone [...] is only rarely punctured by aggressive tracks, boasts, and/or come-ons." [...] Drake's persona on songs shows traits of sincerity, self-doubt, regret, passive-aggressiveness, and self-absorption. Kazeem Famuyide of The Source explains his conflicted persona as being [...] "arrogant enough to know his place {{as one of the}} most successful artist in hip-hop, and comfortable enough to realize his own faults in his personal life." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone writes that Drake [...] "collaps many moods – arrogance, sadness, tenderness and self-pity – into one vast, squish-souled emotion." [...] Kevin Ritchie of NOW notes [...] "an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> alienation, and sadness" [...] on Take Care, calling it [...] "an idiosyncratic, aggressively self-conscious and occasionally sentimental album".|$|E
60|$|He {{knew the}} curious {{slackness}} which sometimes seizes men {{exposed to the}} fury of the sea. It differs from fatigue in being moral rather than physical, and it is distinct from fear; its victim is <b>overwhelmed</b> by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the futility of anything that he can do. Determined effort is its best cure, and Jimmy smiled as he heard the clatter of the pump. He thought Bethune would feel better presently.|$|R
50|$|Ralph J. Gleason (in {{the review}} in Rolling Stone (U.S. edition only) of October 1969) {{explains}} why this song has such {{an impact on}} listeners:Nothing I have read … has brought home the <b>overwhelming</b> human <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> history that this song does. The only thing I can relate it to at all is The Red Badge of Courage. It's a remarkable song, the rhythmic structure, the voice of Levon and the bass line with the drum accents and then the heavy close harmony of Levon, Richard and Rick in the theme, make it seem impossible that this isn't some traditional material handed down from father to son straight from that winter of 1865 to today. It has that ring of truth and the whole aura of authenticity.|$|R
5000|$|Hegel {{considered}} the sublime {{a marker of}} cultural difference and a characteristic feature of oriental art. His teleological view of history meant that he considered [...] "oriental" [...] cultures as less developed, more autocratic {{in terms of their}} political structures and more fearful of divine law. According to his reasoning, this meant that oriental artists were more inclined towards the aesthetic and the sublime: they could engage God only through [...] "sublated" [...] means. He believed that the excess of intricate detail that is characteristic of Chinese art, or the dazzling metrical patterns characteristic of Islamic art, were typical examples of the sublime and argued that the disembodiment and formlessness of these art forms inspired the viewer with an <b>overwhelming</b> aesthetic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> awe.|$|R

60|$|Covering {{her face}} with her hands again, as if the passion which had {{sustained}} her through these disclosures lost itself in an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> shame and grief, she abandoned herself to tears.|$|E
60|$|In the {{sweetness}} of that embrace, in the simplicity and answering passion of her kiss, in the <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> her gift of herself, heart and soul, he found a strength, a restraint, a nobler fire that gave him peace.|$|E
50|$|For {{almost nine}} years, Rapoport was {{employed}} as a draftsman-designer of stage equipment, while continuing his own creative work. Initially <b>overwhelmed</b> by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> freedom in his new life, he soon came to feel that these liberties restricted more than they permitted, with freedom limited to the narrow views of artists who followed {{the demands of the}} market. He experienced difficulty fitting into the American contemporary art mainstream, which he considered frivolous, career-oriented and devoid of any spirituality or artistic merit.|$|R
50|$|Alone {{with her}} uncle, Mariana begins {{a game of}} {{seduction}} until Luis succumbs. When Mariana's mother (the writer's sister-in-law) comes to visit, worried about what he can say about her in his memoirs, it is revealed that Mariana is in fact his daughter. Luis, <b>overwhelmed</b> by a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> guilt for his incestuous relationship, retires to his rooms and tries to commit suicide, but he only shoots himself in the hand. Mariana and his mother go to help him. Unashamed of the sexual relationship she had with Luis, Mariana heals her uncle-father wound.|$|R
5000|$|David Freedberg {{offers an}} {{appreciation}} of Schikaneder's text; it [...] "describes in extraordinary detail something of the mental movements that one can imagine accompanying the revelation of the picture. Tamino's heart is stirred, and then more powerfully so; he cannot name the emotion, he calls it love. Thus identified, the sentiment grows stronger; he moves from beautiful picture to the beautiful woman represented on it. Tamino is <b>overwhelmed</b> with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> her potential presence, her potential liveliness. He speaks of pressing her to his breast, {{and he wants to}} possess her forever." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{the people}} {{immediately}} began to disperse after this, Mark and his friends hastened sway from the place with an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> horror upon them, but thankful as well as relieved to know that their friend Mamba was not yet among the martyrs.|$|E
60|$|Gone was {{the look}} of {{defiance}} from her eyes, the pride had vanished and all the joy of life; no thought {{was left in the}} young mind now save an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, no feeling lingered in the heart save the desire for self-sacrifice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yet {{there are}} moments when one has such an <b>overwhelming</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> one's sins and negligences {{provoking}} God to chastise one. I know that His merciful intention towards men must be accomplished, and on the whole I rest thankfully in that, and feel that He will not suffer my utter unworthiness to hinder His work of love and goodness.' ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this was}} patent {{to the eyes}} of David Boone, {{but he was so}} <b>overwhelmed</b> with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the guilt he was about to incur, and the {{deception}} he was even then practising, that he regarded the whole affair as a hollow bubble, which would soon burst and leave nothing behind. Even the rapid increase of the credit-balance in his bank-book did not affect his opinion, for he was not much of a financier, and, knowing that his transactions were founded on deception, he looked on the balance as being deceptive also.|$|R
60|$|Cyrus {{consented to}} this proposal, and Panthea sent for Abradates. Abradates {{came at the}} head of two {{thousand}} horse, which formed a very important addition to the forces under Cyrus's command. The meeting between Panthea and her husband was joyful in the extreme. When Abradates learned from his wife how honorable and kind had been the treatment which Cyrus had rendered to her, he was <b>overwhelmed</b> with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> gratitude, and he declared that he would do the utmost in his power to requite the obligations he was under.|$|R
50|$|Denise's {{story is}} played against {{the career of}} Octave Mouret, the owner of Au Bonheur des Dames, whose retail {{innovations}} and store expansions threaten the existence of all the neighborhood shops. Under one roof, Octave has gathered textiles (silks, woolens) {{as well as all}} manner of ready-made garments (dresses, coats, lingerie, gloves), accessories necessary for making clothes, and ancillary items like carpeting and furniture. His aim is to <b>overwhelm</b> the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> his female customers, forcing them to spend by bombarding them with an array of buying choices and by juxtaposing goods in enticing and intoxicating ways. Massive advertising, huge sales, home delivery, and a system of refunds and novelties such as a reading room and a snack bar further induce his female clientele to patronize his store in growing numbers. In the process, he drives the traditional retailers who operate smaller speciality shops out of business.|$|R
