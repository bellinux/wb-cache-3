5|$|A {{third round}} of {{guidelines}} was issued in April 2012 when the company {{announced that it would}} begin phasing in a plan to stop purchasing poultry and pork products from suppliers that caged animals. With this announcement, Burger King became the first American Fast food company to promise to purchase 100% of its eggs from companies that did not utilize wire battery cages and pork from suppliers that did not use gestational cages for sows. This is an increase of the percentage of cage free products from 9% of egg purchases and 20% <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> purchases the company made in 2008. The plan should be completed by 2017.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} food {{eaten in}} Sihanaka {{has long been}} rice, which they cultivate heavily. The rice based diet was supplemented by {{a wide range of}} game and other meats, including lemurs, wild boars, snakes, owls, rats, cats and crocodile, the latter having at one time been protected by a fady that was eventually abandoned. Use of tobacco or marijuana and consumption <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> were commonly forbidden in Sihanaka families. Many believed that transporting swine across Lake Alaotra would bring storms. Their traditional dress consisted of clothing woven of raffia fibers.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} colonies can be culturally {{divided between}} the uplands and the lowlands, and this distinction is seen in diet and food preparation in the two regions. The diet of the uplands often included cabbage, string beans, white potatoes, while most affluent whites in the uplands avoided crops imported from Africa because they were associated with, and reflected the social inferiority of, black slaves. Those who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits on their table for breakfast, along with healthy portions <b>of</b> <b>pork.</b> Salted pork was a staple of any meal, as it {{was used in the}} preparations of vegetables for flavor, in addition to its direct consumption as a protein.|$|E

5|$|In August1998, {{the station}} {{building}} was leased to Amtrak for 99years by the borough of Elizabethtown for $1 per year after ownership {{was transferred to}} the borough; ownership of the platforms and right-of-way was retained by Amtrak. Renovations began in August2009 and were funded by $9.3million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The station was cited by U.S. Senator Tom Coburn as an example <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> barrel spending in the stimulus bill. Elevators were built and the station's two platforms were raised, per the requirements of Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The platforms were also lengthened to accommodate longer trains. Canopies were erected over the platforms to provide protection from the elements for waiting passengers. The station building was completely remodeled, including restoration of the original wood furnishings, replacement of broken slate roof tiles, and masonry repointing. The completed station was unveiled in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} loanwords for food dishes and their {{ingredients}} are Hokkien in origin, {{and are used}} throughout the Indonesian language and vernacular speech of large cities. Because they have {{become an integral part}} of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, lumpia, and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Among ethnic Chinese families, both peranakan and totok, pork is generally preferred as meat; this is in contrast with traditional Indonesian cuisine, which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as high cholesterol levels and heart disease.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. was {{expanding}} westwards and, in Ohio, Hiram Joy {{began to}} exploit Crystal Lake, near Chicago, which was soon {{linked to the}} city by the Chicago, St Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad company. The ice was used to allow goods {{to be brought to}} market. Cincinnati and Chicago began to use ice to help the packing <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> in the summer, John L. Schooley developing the first refrigerated packing room. Fruit began to be stored in the central Illinois using refrigerators, for consumption in later seasons. By the 1860s, ice was being used to allow the brewing of the increasingly popular lager beer all year round. Improved railroad links helped the growth in business across the region and to the east.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven appendices. The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> in comparison to beef. The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid fattening and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.|$|E
5|$|The major cereal crops of {{the ancient}} Mediterranean region were wheat, emmer, and barley, while common {{vegetables}} included peas, beans, fava, and olives, dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats, and meat, which was consumed on rare occasion for most people, usually consisted <b>of</b> <b>pork,</b> beef, and lamb. Agriculture in ancient Greece was hindered by the topography of mainland Greece that only allowed for roughly 10% of the land to be cultivated properly, necessitating the specialized exportation of oil and wine and importation of grains from Thrace (centered {{in what is now}} Bulgaria) and the Greek colonies of southern Russia. During the Hellenistic period, the Ptolemaic Empire controlled Egypt, Cyprus, Phoenicia, and Cyrenaica, major grain-producing regions that mainland Greeks depended on for subsistence, while the Ptolemaic grain market also {{played a critical role in}} the rise of the Roman Republic. In the Seleucid Empire, Mesopotamia was a crucial area for the production of wheat, while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1880s various European {{countries}} had imposed {{a ban on}} importation of United States pork out of an unconfirmed concern of trichinosis; at issue was over one billion pounds <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> products with a value of $80 million (annually). Harrison engaged Whitelaw Reid, minister to France, and William Walter Phelps, minister to Germany, to restore these exports for the country without delay. Harrison also successfully asked the congress to enact the Meat Inspection Act to eliminate the accusations of product compromise. The president also partnered with Agriculture Secretary Rusk to threaten Germany with retaliation – by initiating an embargo in the U.S. against Germany's highly demanded beet sugar. By September 1891 Germany relented, and was soon followed by Denmark, France and Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, {{the group claimed that}} CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. Under the agreement, 2% of BK's North American egg suppliers are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% <b>of</b> <b>pork</b> suppliers are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King’s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E
