Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Given {{the strangeness}} of the concept, some historians have doubted {{the reality of the}} {{exchange}} of goods and suggested that the exchange was really a transfer of the liturgy itself. [...] For contrary evidence, others [...] look to Demosthenes' speech [...] "Against Phaenippus", where an exchange of property is explicitly mentioned by the litigant: [...] "For I made this offer before to Phaenippus, and now again, men of the jury, I tender it freely:—I will surrender to him all my property including the mines, if he will hand <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the farm alone free from all encumbrances as it was when I first went to it with witnesses, and will replace as they were before the grain and wine and the other things which he has carried away from the buildings after removing the seals from the doors." [...] However, it is possible that placing seals on the property was done solely to assess the respective fortunes of the owners.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield hailed Veedon Fleece as [...] "the culmination of everything Van was doing {{up to that}} point, all Celtic mystic tumult in the vocals and pastoral beauty in the music" [...] and ranked it among [...] "his most majestic music". Allmusic critics [...] Jason Ankenny and Thom Jurek called the album [...] "brilliant" [...] and commented that [...] "With its elegiac tone and deeply autobiographical lyrics, this was a Morrison who didn't so readily associate himself with the feel-good, peace, love, and rhythm & blues sound American audiences were used to." [...] John Kennedy from PopMatters felt it is beautiful in the sense defined by French poet Charles Baudelaire, [...] "a poet's album, a jazz lover's album, a masterpiece of soul-singing, a blue and green journey into the places of the heart that were first opened up for dowsing [...] with Astral Weeks." [...] Derek Miller of Stylus Magazine believed it is astonishing, [...] "so frothy and thick, that requires silence when it's <b>over</b> ... <b>To</b> <b>me</b> that's the better explanation for Morrison's three-year absence. He'd just finished Veedon Fleece." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic and said it is Morrison's most shamelessly cathartic work since Astral Weeks, [...] "soothing, evocative late-night music", but suffers from his long-windedness and a second side highlighted only by [...] "Bulbs".|$|E
2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E

[...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
