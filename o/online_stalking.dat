Some users even indulge in a little “harmless” <b>online</b> <b>stalking</b> to dig beyond the pseudonyms and may even publicly out perceived trolls. But what happens when public authorities, such as @realDonaldTrump and @Sweden apply such typically private Twitter behaviors? While commentary on these accounts has focused on freedom of speech, we query what data protection law requires when blocking (and exposing) contrarian Twitter accounts. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Internet (Net) and World Wide Web (WWW) have {{developed}} a variety of cultures and communities. Although most early users of the Net (mostly males) were well-intentioned and well-mannered, their social conventions (some blatantly sexist, others {{in the nature of}} macho posturing) have continued in many online chat rooms and virtual gaming environments. Women have not always felt welcome or safe in these areas. Gender harassment and invasions of women's online privacy by men has now gone beyond macho posturing and sexist language. Online classrooms now have many of the same problems as the larger world of the Web. Going beyond "flaming " (blasting someone publicly for something said <b>online),</b> <b>stalking</b> is a potential danger for both students and faculty. Flaming that got out of hand and some forms of sexual harassment in online classrooms have been reported. None of the new online learning technologies address the emerging issues of power, gender, and safety in online classrooms. Instructors should set the tone o...|$|E
40|$|Social Networking Applications {{has gained}} {{tremendous}} response {{from all the}} sections of people across the entire world from last few years. Social networking has crossed all the boundaries and glued whole world population together. Users of OSN (Online Social Networking) sites can re-connect with school friends, find some activity or even life partners, and make new friends. OSN has also revolutionized the business community. Now the companies leverage OSN’s credibility and build their reputation, get invaluable information about the customers. The companies are also using OSN for the advertising and the recruitment processes. However, posting of user information on OSN poses greater threats/risks as identity theft, <b>online</b> <b>stalking,</b> and information leakage. The volume and accessibility of personal information available on social networking sites have attracted malicious people who seek to exploit this information. This imposes greater threat to the users ’ privacy and security. In this article many security and privacy challenges currently faced by OSN applications are mentioned. The distributed OSN architecture with an external control module is proposed and a prototype is also presented which overcomes many of the privacy, security, accessibility and identity challenges in different perspectives faced by current OSN applications...|$|E

50|$|Harassment directs {{multiple}} repeating obscenities and derogatory comments {{at specific}} individuals focusing, for example, on the targets' race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. This may also include stealing {{photos of the}} victim and their families, doctoring these photos in offensive ways, and then posting them on social media {{with the aim of}} causing emotional distress (see cyber bullying, cyber <b>stalking,</b> hate crime, <b>online</b> predator, and <b>stalking).</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{the virtual}} world {{becoming}} part of the social lives of adults and minors alike, new attack vectors emerged to increase the severity of human-related attacks to a level the community have not experience before. This article investigates and shares an outline on how technology could emerge further to counteract and mitigate the damage caused by online perpetrators. The review encourages approaching <b>online</b> harassment, <b>stalking,</b> bullying, grooming and their likes with an Incident Response methodology in mind. This includes a detection phase utilising automated methods to identify and classify such attacks, conduct digital forensic investigations to analyse the nature of the offence and reserve evidence, taking preventive measures as part of the reaction towards the problem such as filtering unwanted communications and finally looking at how we can rely on applicable computing to support and educate the victims...|$|R
40|$|Privacy {{has become}} a major concern in Online Social Networks (OSNs) due to threats such as {{advertising}} spam, <b>online</b> <b>stalking</b> and identity theft. Although many users hide or do not fill out their private attributes in OSNs, prior studies point out that the hidden attributes may be inferred from some other public information. Thus, users' private information could still be at stake to be exposed. Hitherto, little work helps users to assess the exposure probability/risk that the hidden attributes can be correctly predicted, let alone provides them with pointed countermeasures. In this article, we focus our study on the exposure risk assessment by a particular privacy-sensitive attribute - current city - in Facebook. Specifically, we first design a novel current city prediction approach that discloses users' hidden `current city' from their self-exposed information. Based on 371, 913 Facebook users' data, we verify that our proposed prediction approach can predict users' current city more accurately than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we inspect the prediction results and model the current city exposure probability via some measurable characteristics of the self-exposed information. Finally, we construct an exposure estimator to assess the current city exposure risk for individual users, given their self-exposed information. Several case studies are presented to illustrate how to use our proposed estimator for privacy protection...|$|E
40|$|This Note {{examines}} online {{harassment and}} <b>online</b> <b>stalking</b> throughout the world, including the current landscape of Internet communication, {{the effects of}} cyberharassment and cyberstalking on its victims, and both the difficulties in defining these crimes in criminal codes and the difficulties in inspiring law enforcement to investigate complex internet crimes. Specifically, this Note discusses the problems inherent in current cyberharassment and cyberstalking treaties and legislation within the United States, Canada, and Australia. For example, this Note analyzes how these jurisdictions define cyberharassment and cyberstalking, how these definitions are inadequate for dealing with current forms of cyberharassment and cyberstalking (both due to inconsistencies between the definitions, as well as inherent roadblocks in proving the crimes as defined), and how the seriousness of these crimes as defined discourage law enforcement from using extensive resources to investigate these crimes. This Note then proposes a Model Statute that would amend existing U. S. federal law to consolidate definitions of cyberharassment and cyberstalking, to address existing difficulties in proving cyberharassment and cyberstalking crimes, and to address the ambivalence by law enforcement to investigate instances of cyberharassment and cyberstalking. These amendments would both empower citizens to better understand what conduct constitutes cyberharassment or cyberstalking, to more easily prove when cyberharassment and cyberstalking have or have not occurred, and to better empower law enforcement to delve into complex online investigations for cyberharassment and cyberstalking crimes...|$|E

A target's understanding of why cyberstalking {{is happening is}} helpful to remedy and take protective action to restore remedy. Cyberstalking {{is an extension of}} physical stalking. Among factors that motivate stalkers are: envy, pathological obsession (professional or sexual), unemployment or failure with own job or life; intention to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior; the stalker is delusional and believes he/she [...] "knows" [...] the target; the stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify his/her status; belief {{they can get away with}} it (anonymity).|$|R

The federal {{government}} also filed a brief recommending that the Supreme Court grant the writ of certiorari, arguing that the North Carolina Supreme Court incorrectly decided the case {{in favor of the}} respondents. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 28, 2016. The Court agreed to hear arguments for the case on December 22, 2016, and set the date for arguments as February 27, 2017. Amicus briefs in support of Packingham were filed by the libertarian Cato Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union. The North Carolina Supreme Court filed a brief supporting the respondents, urging the importance of protecting minors in the Internet age from being <b>stalked</b> <b>online.</b> The oral argument took place on February 27, 2017.|$|R
40|$|Context: <b>Online</b> {{harassment}} and <b>stalking</b> {{have been identified}} with growing accordance as anti-social behaviours, potentially with extreme consequences including indirect or direct physical injury, emotional distress and/or financial loss. Objective: As part of our ongoing work to research and establish better understanding of cyberstalking, this study aims to investigate the role of Police, Mobile Operators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and owners/administrators of online platforms (e. g. websites, chatrooms) in terms of intervention in response to offences. We ask to what different authorities do people report incidents of cyberstalking? Do these authorities provide satisfactory responses or interventions? And {{how can this be}} improved? Furthermore, we discuss the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to encourage the implementation of cyberstalking-aware schemes by service providers to support victims. In addition, CSR {{can be used as a}} means to measure the effects of externality factor in dictating the relationship between the impact of a given individuals' privacy loss and strategic decisions on investment to security controls in an organisational context. Method: A mixed method design has been used in this study. Data collection took place by means of an online survey made available for three years to record both qualitative and quantitative data. Overall, 305 participants responded from which 274 identified themselves as victims of online harassment. Result: Our results suggest that most offences were communicated through private channels such as emails and/or mobile texts/calls. A significant number of victims did not report this to their service provider because they did not know they could. While Police were recognised as the first-point-of-contact in such cases, 41. 6 % of our sample did not contact the Police due to reasons such as fear of escalation, guilt/sympathy and self-blaming. Experiences from those who have reported offences to service providers demonstrate that no or very little support was offered. Overall, the majority of participants shared the view that third-party intervention is required on their behalf in order to mitigate risks associated with cyberstalking. An independent specialist anti-stalking organisation was a popular choice to act on their behalf followed by the Police and network providers. Conclusion: Incidents are taking place on channels owned and controlled by large, cross-border international companies providing mobile services, webmail and social networking. The lack of support offered to victims in many cases of cyberstalking can be identified as Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI). We anticipate that awareness should be raised as regarding service providers' liability and social responsibility towards adopting better strategies...|$|R
