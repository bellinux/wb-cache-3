50|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{occurred during}} the flight, but none had {{a major impact on}} the mission. On 22 October 1989, an alarm woke the shuttle crew when the gas generator fuel pump system A heaters on Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) 2 failed to recycle at the upper limits of the system. There were also some minor problems with the Flash Evaporator System for cooling the orbiter, and the cryogenic <b>oxygen</b> <b>manifold</b> valve 2, which was left closed {{for the rest of the}} mission. A Hasselblad camera jammed twice, and a spare camera had to be used.|$|E
40|$|Pressure losses reduced without {{degrading}} combustion stability. Injection Posts form {{forest in}} cavity between <b>oxygen</b> <b>manifold</b> and secondary faceplate. Cavity is fuel manifold; fuel floods post forest and enters each post through side holes in shroud. Injector designed for improved assembly and maintenance. Posts accessible from primary combustion chamber side and changed for flow adjustment...|$|E
40|$|A LOX/GH 2 swirl {{injector}} {{was designed}} for a 10 : 1 propellant throttling range. To accomplish this, a dual LOX (liquid <b>oxygen)</b> <b>manifold</b> was used feeding a single common vortex chamber of the swirl element. Hot-fire experiments were conducting for rocket chamber pressures from 80 to 800 psia at a mixture ratio of nominally 6. 0 using steady flow, single-point-per-firing cases as well as dynamic throttling conditions. Low frequency (mean) and high frequency (fluctuating) pressure transducer data, flow meter measurements, and Raman spectroscopy images for mixing information were obtained. The injector design, experimental setup, low frequency pressure data, and injector performance analysis will be presented. C efficiency was very high (approximately 100 %) at {{the middle of the}} throttle-able range with somewhat lower performance at the high and low ends. From the analysis of discreet steady state operating conditions, injector pressure drop was slightly higher than predicted with an inviscid analysis, but otherwise agreed well across the design throttling range. Analysis of the dynamic throttling data indicates that the injector may experience transient conditions that effect pressure drop and performance when compared to steady state results...|$|E
40|$|The {{cell stack}} can be {{operated}} as {{a fuel cell}} stack or as an electrolysis cell stack. The stack consists {{of a series of}} alternate fuel cell subassemblies with intervening electrolysis cell subassemblies, and interspersed cooling plates. The water produced and consumed in the two modes of operation migrates between adjacent cell subassemblies. The component plates are annular with a central hydrogen plenum and integral internal <b>oxygen</b> <b>manifolds.</b> No fluid pumps are needed to operate the stack in either mode...|$|R
25|$|There {{are eight}} propellant-depletion sensors, four each for fuel and {{oxidizer}}. The fuel-depletion sensors {{are located in}} the bottom of the fuel tank. The oxidizer sensors are mounted in the orbiter liquid <b>oxygen</b> feed line <b>manifold</b> downstream of the feed line disconnect. During SSME thrusting, the orbiter general-purpose computers constantly compute the instantaneous mass of the vehicle due to the usage of the propellants. Normally, main engine cutoff is based on a predetermined velocity; however, if any two of the fuel or oxidizer sensors sense a dry condition, the engines will be shut down.|$|R
40|$|Emissions {{from modern}} SI-engines are reduced by a three way {{catalyst}}. However {{if there are}} leaks in the exhaust system before the catalyst emissions increase for two reasons. First the untreated emissions leak out. Second which is worse, due to waves in the exhaust system, oxygen leaks into the manifold and causes an oxygen sensor offset. The result is increased emissions as the air/fuel controller makes the engine run rich. Here a method to detect leakages in the exhaust manifold is presented. The sensors used are binary <b>oxygen</b> sensor(s), intake <b>manifold</b> pressure and temperature, and the air mass flow sensor. Injection time {{is also used to}} estimate air/fuel ratio. Experimental results are shown with measurements from a turbo charged SAAB SI production engine with wastegate...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNonsteroidal 2 -arylproprionic acids {{are widely}} used, over-the-counter, {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs. Photosensitivity is a commonly overlooked adverse {{effect of these}} drugs. Based on the combined use of cell viability assays and molecular modeling, we prove and rationalize the photochemical pathways triggering photosensitization for two drugs, ibuprofen and ketoprofen. As its parent compound benzophenone, ketoprofen produces singlet <b>oxygen,</b> upon triplet <b>manifold</b> population. However, ibuprofen and ketoprofen photodissociate and hence may generate two highly reactive radicals. The formation of metastable aggregates between the two drugs and B-DNA is also directly probed by molecular dynamics. Our approach characterizes the coupled influence of the drug's intrinsic photochemistry and the interaction pattern with DNA. The photosensitization activity of nonsteroidal 2 -arylproprionic acids, being added to gels and creams for topical use, should be crucially analyzed and rationalized to enact the proper preventive measures...|$|R
5000|$|The SBEC {{controlled}} the ignition, {{as well as}} the opening and closing of the fuel injectors. During cold startup, wide-open throttle and deceleration, it did this based on [...] "open-loop", pre-programmed operating parameters. During normal idle and cruising, it began [...] "closed-loop" [...] operation, during which the module acted based upon inputs from a variety of sensors. The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the <b>Oxygen</b> sensor (O2), <b>Manifold</b> Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and Coolant Temperature sensor (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC's outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve. The latter controlled idle characteristics. However, the SBEC also {{controlled the}} operation of the charging system, air conditioning system, cruise control and, in some vehicles, transmission shifting. By centralizing control of these systems, the operation of the vehicle was simplified and streamlined.|$|R
