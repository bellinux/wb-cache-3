5|$|Babangida's {{fortunes}} {{started to}} change {{towards the end of}} 1998. Having missed {{the start of the season}} with malaria, Babangida gradually lost his starting line-up position as Morten Olsen was looking to improve on the team's inconsistent performances both in the domestic league and in Europe. Babangida started two of his team's opening Champions League games. The European season, however, ended in disappointment as Ajax finished bottom <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>group</b> behind Olympiacos, Dinamo Zagreb and Porto. Overall, Babangida appeared in 18 league games for Ajax that season, starting only seven. He didn't feature in the Dutch Cup final where Ajax managed to retain the trophy after beating Fortuna Sittard in the final.|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{began the}} 2015–16 season again {{attempting}} {{to qualify for}} the Champions League. They knocked out Stjarnan from Iceland and Qarabağ from Azerbaijan in the early qualifying rounds, but lost 4–3 on aggregate to Swedish side Malmö FF in the final play-off round. This meant for the second successive season, Celtic dropped into the Europa League. Celtic's Europa League campaign was poor and littered with individual errors which contributed to dropped points in every match. Celtic failed to qualify after finishing bottom <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>group,</b> and was the first time Celtic went through a group stage of a European competition without recording a single victory.|$|E

As group winners, Barcelona would avoid being drawn with other group winners, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich, but they could still be drawn against runners-up such as Chelsea, Internazionale and Arsenal. The draw eventually paired them with Olympique Lyonnais and, as group winners, they were given the right to play the second leg at home.|$|E

A group of European-Americans that became stuck in the valley in 1849 while looking for a shortcut to the gold fields of California gave the valley its name, even though only one <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>group</b> died there. Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable ore to be mined was borax, which was transported out of the valley with twenty-mule teams. The valley later {{became the subject of}} books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism blossomed in the 1920s, when resorts were built around Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.|$|E
