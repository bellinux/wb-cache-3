2500|$|By the 1950s, Afro-Cuban jazz {{had been}} using modes {{for at least a}} decade, as much of it {{borrowed}} from Cuban popular dance forms which are structured around multiple ostinatos with only a few chords. A case in point is Mario Bauza's [...] "Tanga" [...] (1943), the first Afro-Cuban jazz piece. Machito's Afro-Cubans recorded modal tunes in the 1940s, featuring jazz soloists such as Howard McGhee, Brew Moore, Charlie Parker, and Flip Phillips.

2500|$|Willi Apel and Robert Snow assert a {{scholarly}} consensus that Gregorian chant developed around 750 from {{a synthesis of}} Roman and Gallican chants, and was commissioned by the Carolingian rulers in France. Andreas Pfisterer and Peter Jeffery have shown that older melodic essentials from Roman chant are clear in the synthesized chant repertory. There were other developments as well. Chants were modified, influenced by local styles and Gallican chant, and fitted into {{the theory of the}} ancient Greek octoechos system <b>of</b> <b>modes</b> <b>in</b> a manner that created what later {{came to be known as}} the western system of the eight church modes. The Metz project also invented an innovative musical notation, using freeform neumes to show the shape of a remembered melody. This notation was further developed over time, culminating in the introduction of staff lines (attributed to Guido d'Arezzo) in the early 11th century, what we know today as plainchant notation. The whole body of Frankish-Roman Carolingian chant, augmented with new chants to complete the liturgical year, coalesced into a single body of chant that was called [...] "Gregorian." ...|$|E
60|$|Secondly, {{neither can}} our complex ideas <b>of</b> <b>modes,</b> <b>in</b> {{reference}} to the essence of anything really existing, be false; because whatever complex ideas I have of any mode, it hath no reference to any pattern existing, and made by nature; it {{is not supposed to}} contain in it any other ideas than what it hath; nor to represent anything but such a complication of ideas as it does. Thus, when I have the idea of such an action of a man who forbears to afford himself such meat, drink, and clothing, and other conveniences of life, as his riches and estate will be sufficient to supply and his station requires, I have no false idea; but such an one as represents an action, either as I find or imagine it, and so is capable of neither truth nor falsehood. But when I give the name FRUGALITY or VIRTUE to this action, then it may be called a false idea, if thereby it be supposed to agree with that idea to which, in propriety of speech, the name of frugality doth belong, or to be conformable to that law which is the standard of virtue and vice.|$|E
