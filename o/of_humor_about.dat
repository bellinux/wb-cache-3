500|$|In {{the days}} leading up to Kim Possibles premiere, {{television}} critics speculated whether or not the show will attract a prominent male audience large enough to be successful despite its female lead, attributing failure to achieve this with the cancellation of the female-led animated series Madeline. Ultimately, Kim Possible premiered to both widespread acclaim and strong viewership. The series continued to garner critical acclaim throughout its run, earning significant praise for its dialogue, animation and characters. Describing the show as [...] "infectious", Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote, [...] "Blessed with a modern sense of humor and hip -- but not too hip -- vocabulary, Kim Possible should appeal to the tweens (ages 9-13) it clearly targets", while dubbing Rufus the series' breakout star. Writing for The New York Times, Julie Salamon also enjoyed Rufus, penning, [...] "I probably would have liked Kim Impossible even if one of its lead characters hadn't been a naked mole rat. But the cheerful presence of Rufus (the mole rat) in this new animated series from Disney signals that the show's executive producer and director, Chris Bailey, doesn't mind getting cute in obvious ways." [...] The Herald-News Dave Mason wrote that Kim Possible [...] "combines drama with humor at a fast, fun pace." [...] In his book The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present, television historian Tim Brooks appreciated the series for having [...] "a marvelous sense <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>about</b> itself." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} verbal {{humor in}} entertainment media and examines polarizing representations of English on Korean television. English {{is a source}} of stress as well as a medium <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> Language anxiety <b>about</b> English speaking skills is frequently focalized and viewed as a personal challenge by Korean celebrities, but they often transform their linguistic ‘complex’ into humorous talk. This study argues that using English, possibly the most revered and yet the most feared language in Korea, in humor is sociolinguistically significant, embodying attitudinal, emotional, and experiential ambivalence about English in globalization‐minded contemporary Korea. The findings of the study suggest that generation‐conscious ageism regarding English proficiency typically characterizes senior citizens as sociolinguistically underperforming, which sometimes forces them to be in a vulnerable position both in familial and social contexts. Increasing use of English on Korean television divides bilingual viewers and monolingual viewers and whether one can be entertained and humored by television programs may become another English‐related stratification variable in Korea...|$|R
