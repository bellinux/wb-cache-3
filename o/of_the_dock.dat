5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E
50|$|From 1802 to 1939, {{the area}} was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> busiest <b>docks</b> in <b>the</b> world.

5|$|After passing Carlyon Bay {{the path}} {{comes to the}} much busier china-clay {{exporting}} port of Par, where it goes inland <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> site. After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints' Way, a coast-to-coast path across Cornwall, at Polmear. It then follows the cliff tops through Polkerris and around Gribbin Head. From here to Polperro is designated as a heritage coast.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Liverpool <b>Docks</b> were {{controlled}} by <b>the</b> <b>Docks</b> Committee between 1825 and 1857.

5|$|Shinanos launch on 8 October 1944, with Captain Toshio Abe in command, was {{marred by}} what some {{considered}} an ill-omened accident. During the floating-out procedure, one of the caissons at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> unexpectedly lifted as the water rose {{to the level of}} the harbor (no one had checked to ensure that all the caissons were properly ballasted with seawater). The sudden inrush of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E
5|$|The basin {{entrance}} and passage were sited {{so that their}} foundations rested on hard rock. After the tide had been excluded, pits and borings were made to determine {{the nature of the}} bottom. A much narrower dock had been planned, but it was decided to move the south wall further south. A mole was added running along the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> which increased the length of the quays.|$|E
5|$|A mill {{was built}} on Welhay stream but this was {{replaced}} by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead {{for access to the}} channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer sea wall was built allowing the local marshes to be drained and increased the land available for farming. The dominant architecture is early Victorian, with some buildings maintaining their original features. The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> pier and the rail link to Bristol. The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830, to provide accommodation and catering for travellers on the steamers from Bristol, Wales and Ireland.|$|E

5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through the dock, and a wharf for the canal was constructed at the eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was provided on its north side.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Second World War had {{finished}} the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, {{and if it is}} broke we still won't fix it'. At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E
5|$|Development {{within the}} Albert Dock was rapid {{and the newly}} renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready {{in time for the}} 1984 Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race. The race was a big success for the city with over one million {{visitors}} into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to Granada Television.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty {{serving as}} a base for boats of the British Atlantic Fleet. The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool, notably during the May Blitz of 1941. In the {{aftermath}} of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> began in 1981, when the Merseyside Development Corporation was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Wilmington, North Carolina on May 23, 2012 at EUE/Screen Gems Studios, with the working title Caged Heat. Cinematographer John Toll opted {{to for the}} first time in his career work with digital cameras, as he found them more {{convenient}} for a visual effects-heavy production. Toll shot the film primarily on the Arri Alexa camera. From June 4 through June 6, 2012, filming took place in Cary, North Carolina at the Epic Games headquarters and SAS Institute, with a large Christmas tree set up on the front lawn. A scene was also shot at the Wilmington International Airport. The Port of Wilmington served as a location for the oil tanker in the climactic battle, along with a soundstage recreation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock.</b> The crumbling house itself was filmed in a hydraulic-powered giubo platform that could bend and split into two pieces. All the interior footage had practical effects, including debris and explosions, with computer graphics used only to add exteriors and Iron Man's armor.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E

30|$|To {{carry out}} <b>the</b> blind <b>docking</b> protocol, <b>the</b> entire surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CYP 3 A 4 {{was divided into}} 90 focus docking regions. For each region, <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> mass of three solvent exposed {{neighboring}} atoms was used as <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> box. <b>The</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> cube were 90 × 90 × 90 points with grid spacing of 0.03 nm. Clustering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> poses was performed using a 0.2 nm RMSD cut-off. To identify the most preferred binding locations, we combined all docking results and ranked them with the lowest binding energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>docking</b> cluster. As we are not only interested in the binding energies as indicators for adequate binding, we defined a hit as <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> run that includes at least 20 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total population in its largest cluster. Finally, the solvent-exposed atoms {{that were used to}} construct <b>the</b> <b>docking</b> boxes have been used as markers for the binding locations.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was the restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt {{was removed from the}} dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E
5|$|Spurred by {{the success}} of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion {{refurbishment}} a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the Merseyside Maritime Museum completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by Merseyside County Council had previously been located in the pilotage building and a salvage shed nearby. Also in 1986 work began on the largest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the mezzanine level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to 'sales day at Harrods'.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> water level according to weather conditions.|$|E
