5|$|Frances is {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to impact the entire archipelago since 1866. On September 4, teams from the Ministry of Works, the Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Health</b> Services, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force were used to clear roadways of tree debris while utilities attempted to restore power and water in New Providence. The Family Islands were surveyed on September 5 and 6, when {{it was noted that}} major damage occurred within the island group. Telecommunications were restored to most of the island chain within 24 hours. As of September 21, electricity had been restored to half of the Bahamians who had lost power. Western sections of Grand Bahama Island remained without power into Hurricane Jeanne, which was the most significantly impacted island. The onion crop was expected to be late in 2005 due to the loss of seedbeds and seedlings during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E

There is also a long term concern that the oil may have wiped out the main food source for some sea life in the area.

500|$|A patent {{application}} for the isolated BRCA1 gene and cancer-cancer promoting mutations, {{as well as}} methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Health</b> Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics in 1994; [...] over the next year, Myriad, in collaboration with other investigators, isolated and sequenced the BRCA2 gene and identified relevant mutations, and the first BRCA2 patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and the other institutions in 1995. [...] Myriad is the exclusive licensee of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs. [...] This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy over high prices and the inability to get second opinions from other diagnostic labs, which in turn led to the landmark Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit. [...] The patents begin to expire in 2014.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{sustainability}} {{as a business}} opportunity {{has led to the}} formation of organizations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the Society for Organizational Learning, the Sustainable Business Institute, and the World Council for Sustainable Development. The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of green-collar workers. [...] Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability, and led to emergence of the concept of [...] "embedded sustainability"—defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as [...] "incorporation <b>of</b> <b>environmental,</b> <b>health,</b> and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium". Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation. Nadya Zhexembayeva's 2014 research further suggested that innovation driven by resource depletion can result in fundamental advantages for company products and services, as well as the company strategy as a whole, when right principles of innovation are applied.|$|E

40|$|The socio-political context <b>of</b> modern <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> {{disasters}} {{tends to}} be defined as being {{outside the scope of}} official public health and epidemiological investigations into the causes of such disasters. On the other hand, popular accounts of these disasters tend to focus exclusively on the role of particular individuals and/or political actors, while minimizing the role of ecological factors. It is argued that an exclusive focus on either set of causal factors gives an incomplete or distorted picture of the origins <b>of</b> an <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> disaster. In this paper, a socio-ecological analysis is developed to demonstrate how the largest outbreak of waterborne E. coli O 157 :H 7 in Canadian history was the emergent product of a complex interplay and intertwining of social and ecological processes. The socio-ecological autopsy approach that is developed here traces the social and ecological chain of events that ultimately led to the outbreak and demonstrates, in particular, the need for investigative analysis to focus on the socio-ecological "incubation" <b>of</b> an <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> disaster. Drawing from both the social sciences (particularly, the sociology of disasters and organizational sociology), and from the ecological sciences (particularly disease ecology), the analysis developed here responds to the call for the application of a more transdisciplinary approach to the study <b>of</b> contemporary <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> problems.
