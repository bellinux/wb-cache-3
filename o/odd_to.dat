5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least <b>odd,</b> <b>to</b> ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|Captain Waggett, the stuffy English {{commander}} of the local Home Guard, orders <b>Odd</b> <b>to</b> guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a party in which whisky must be served. Taking the hint, the sergeant allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage to offload {{a large number of}} cases before the ship goes down. Campbell had been sent to his room by his mother for a prior transgression, but is persuaded to leave and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also fortifies the teetotal Campbell's courage enough so he can stand up to his mother regarding Catriona.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{governors}} of Wisconsin served for two-year terms, but in 1967 {{the state constitution}} was amended to change this to four. Jeremiah McLain Rusk served one three-year term in the 1880s as the constitution was amended during his first term to move elections from <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> even years, and all officers were allowed to serve an extra year, rather than have their terms cut a year short. Patrick Lucey, elected in the 1970 election, was the first governor to serve a four-year term. Governors of Wisconsin are not term limited.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} scenes then follow whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks <b>Odd</b> <b>to</b> meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who travel}} between worlds {{are advised to}} limit their {{interactions}} with the inhabitants of foreign worlds {{in order to maintain}} the world order. For this reason, the main characters change their appearance in certain worlds to avoid standing out. In the worlds based on The Little Mermaid and The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sora, Donald, and Goofy transform into undersea creatures and Halloween monsters, respectively. For The Lion King, they transformed into animals (or, in Donald and Goofy's case, less humanoid forms) because Nomura felt that it would appear <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> have Sora and the others interact in their standard forms, since no humans appear in that film.|$|E
25|$|Though Leslie {{does not}} possess or {{understand}} some human ideas like love, {{he does have}} prejudices against others. Charlie tries and fails to explain what bigotry is to the lizard after Leslie speaks badly of fish. Leslie thinks they are dirty and too numerous.

25|$|Bridge 8: Euler walks are {{possible}} if exactly zero or two nodes have an odd number of edges. If we have 2 nodes {{with an odd}} number of edges, the walk must begin at one such node and end at the other. Since there are only 4 nodes in the puzzle, the solution is simple. The walk desired must begin at the blue node and end at the orange node. Thus, a new edge is drawn between the other two nodes. Since they each formerly had an odd number of edges, they must now have an even number of edges, fulfilling all conditions. This {{is a change in}} parity from an <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> even degree.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, Newton or New York {{remain the}} same and are not transliterated to Njuton or Njujork, transliterated forms would seem very <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> a Slovene. However, the unit of force is written as njuton as well as newton. Some {{geographical}} names are transliterated (e.g., Philadelphia – Filadelfija; Hawaii – Havaji). Other names from non-Latin languages are transliterated in a fashion {{similar to that used}} by other European languages, albeit with some adaptations. Japanese, Indian and Arabic names such as Kajibumi, Djakarta and Jabar are written as Kadžibumi, Džakarta and Džabar, where j is replaced with dž. Except for ć and đ, graphemes with diacritical marks from other foreign alphabets (e.g., ä, å, æ, ç, ë, ï, ń, ö, ß, ş, ü) are not used as independent letters.|$|E
25|$|Allen first hosted The Linit Bath Club Revue on CBS, {{moving the}} show to NBC and {{becoming}} The Salad Bowl Revue (in a nod to new sponsor Hellmann's Mayonnaise, which was marketed by {{the parent company of}} Linit) later in the year. The show became The Sal Hepatica Revue (1933–34), The Hour of Smiles (1934–35), and finally Town Hall Tonight (1935–39). In 1939–40, however, sponsor Bristol-Myers, which advertised Ipana toothpaste as well as Sal Hepatica during the program, altered the title to The Fred Allen Show, over his objections. Allen's perfectionism (<b>odd</b> <b>to</b> some, considering his deft ad-libs) caused him to leap from sponsor to sponsor until Town Hall Tonight allowed him to set his chosen small-town milieu and establish himself as a bona fide radio star.|$|E

500|$|Composer Mark Snow {{worked with}} {{producer}} Ken Horton to create Smallvilles score. Snow composed music {{as he watched}} the picture, and tweaked his performance when he reviewed his initial recordings. He then sent the music to the producers, who sent it back for recomposition if needed. Individual episodes have their own soundtrack, comprising one (or more) songs. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music looked for songs for the soundtrack. Their choices were discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured their rights. Although Snow said it initially seemed <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> combine two types of music on a [...] "typical action-adventure" [...] television show, [...] "the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score".|$|E

For realism, Joe is voiced by child actor Jones rather than an actress as had usually been {{the case for the}} representation of younger characters on earlier Supermarionation series. On the subject of female casting, Gerry Anderson recalled, [...] "...it always sounded rather <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> me. It never sounded like a real little boy...

The US CD single also contained remixes by Trak Starz, Gabriel & Dresden, Bloodshy & Avant and Kanye West. The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix was later included in the track list of In the Zone. The remix removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called the remix [...] "excellent", noting that it is [...] "so frenetic you barely notice Ms. Spears and Madonna– it's <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> hear two such ubiquitous figures sounding so anonymous."

They also added [...] "Androgynous Girls" [...] as a b-side to the album's second single three months later. [...] "The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able {{to have a lot of}} fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> be on the radio," [...] Higgins said.

500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} {{was praised}} by reviewers, especially {{in comparison to}} the single-player [...] "Story Mode".

Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence involved was bemoaned for contributing an imbalance in the game, with the random availability of quality items giving players an unfair advantage. The [...] "reversal of fortune" [...] space, which initiates a minigame by which the victor would receive another player's stars or coins, was criticised for similar reasons, as it potentially penalises players who do well in the game. The minigames were mainly met with a positive reaction, with critics praising their simplicity. The grouping feature in the minigames were also welcomed for contributing a new dynamic of gameplay, although Bramwell commented that [...] "It might seem a little <b>odd</b> <b>to</b> gang up with your competitors in some cases".|$|E
