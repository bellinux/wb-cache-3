5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in {{the study}} <b>of</b> <b>partial</b> {{differential}} equations. For many classes <b>of</b> <b>partial</b> differential equations, such as linear elliptic equations, {{it is possible to}} consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution <b>of</b> <b>partial</b> differential equations.|$|E

Crucial {{parts of this}} tech-nique are, among others, the estimation of the parameters (instantaneous fre-quency and amplitude and the initial phase <b>of</b> a single <b>partial</b> tone at a given time) and the tracking of the temporal evolution <b>of</b> corresponding <b>partials</b> by means <b>of</b> these parameters. In this thesis we use the Ambiguity Function (a {{member of the family}} of bilinear time-frequency distributions) for the estimation of frequency and amplitude. The initial phase is calculated from the Analytic Signal. Finally, we show how a Hidden Markov Model can be used for the tracking <b>of</b> <b>partials.</b> In addition to the aforementioned parameters, the Ambiguity Function provides us with an estimator for the chirp rate, which can be used to improve the tracking <b>of</b> <b>partials.</b> A prototype application developed for this thesis using Matlab ® shows an im-provement of the estimators and the assignment <b>of</b> <b>partials</b> to trajectories com-pared to more traditional methods...|$|R

Here, we report that when the RAP mechanism is suppressed, ∼ 44 % twins in NC Cu produced zero-macrostrain via the CSTP mechanism. This indicates that both RAP and CSTP are major mechanisms to generate zero-macrostrain twins.

The minimal degree of an interpolating deterministic system is called the algebraic degree or McMillan degree <b>of</b> the <b>partial</b> covariance sequence and is easy to compute. The solutions <b>of</b> the <b>partial</b> stochastic realization problem have to satisfy the same interpolation conditions and have to fulfill a positive realness constraint. The minimal degree of a stochastic realization is called the positive degree. In the literature, solutions <b>of</b> the <b>partial</b> realization problem are parameterized by the Kimura-Georgiou parameterization. Solutions <b>of</b> the <b>partial</b> stochastic realization problem are then obtained by checking the positive realness constraint for the interpolating solutions <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>partial</b> realization problem. In this paper, an alternative parameterization is developed for the solutions <b>of</b> the <b>partial</b> realization problems.

5|$|The Prague Spring {{reforms were}} a strong attempt by Dubček to grant {{additional}} {{rights to the}} citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act <b>of</b> <b>partial</b> decentralization of the economy and democratization.

After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring, though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} rocks {{which make}} {{up some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain are unusual in that they have an acid-neutralizing chemical substance like typical ocean-island basalts but a low percentage of strontium as found at mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, the strontium-bearing volcanic rocks comprising Bowie Seamount also contain lead. Therefore, the magma mixtures that formed Bowie Seamount seem to have originated from varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>partial</b> melting of a depleted source in the Earth's mantle and basalts which had distinctly high lead isotopic ratios. Estimates during geological studies indicate that the abundance of the depleted-source component ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the erupted material.|$|E
