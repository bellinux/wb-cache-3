5|$|The oldest {{documented}} {{description of}} hare coursing {{is the work}} known in English as On Coursing. It was written by Arrian a Greek historian of the Roman period, circa 180AD and is known in Anicent Greek as Kynegetikos and in Latin as Cynegeticus. Arrian felt compelled to describe the sight hunt and sighthounds because the Ancient Greeks only knew the scent hunt; On Coursing complements Xenophon's classic work <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>subject,</b> Cynegeticus (On Hunting). William Dansey, an English clergyman, translated On Coursing in 1831.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, Edward Gibbon had {{observed}} {{that there was}} something wrong with the numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written <b>on</b> <b>that</b> <b>subject.</b> A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who was meant to be writing his biographies in 305-6. Then in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve at least some of the six Scriptores as distinct persons and in favor of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the Scriptores work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter (editor of the Augustan History and of the Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae) proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate (useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda).|$|E
