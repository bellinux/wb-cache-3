25|$|The CASI {{began as}} two {{separate}} measures that {{were developed to}} assist clinicians in obtaining information about youths from their caregivers. Although a variety of checklists were already available, most were not clearly connected to the diagnostic system used by psychiatry and many other professions. The authors saw this need and began to create a symptom checklist in 1984 {{that was based on}} the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Their goal was to obtain information about children who were receiving special education services so that they could assign them into groups based on their learning and behavioral problems that were more relevant to conventional psychiatric diagnoses (need citation). In this way, the measures helped gather information that helped the clinician form a diagnostic impression. The items also rated the severity of the symptoms. Adding them created a severity score that help guide selection of treatment targets. The original motivation for developing the checklist was to aid with research and gathering of fairly large amounts of data in schools; however, the creators soon saw the possible application of these symptom inventories in clinical settings. To that end, they began work in 1986 on an instrument that would be used by teachers and parents to give a comprehensive look at a youth's emotional and behavioral symptoms. This led to the earliest measure related to the CASI- the Stony Brook Child Symptom Inventory-3 (CSI-3). In 1987 this was followed by the CSI-3R based on the revised third edition of the DSM (DSM-III-R). The CSI-3R included both teacher and parent checklists. The teacher checklist focused on youth behaviors more likely take place in a school setting. In 1990, Dr. Gabrielle Carlson adapted the parent checklist from the CSI-3R for use with adolescents, which became the first version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adolescent</b> Symptom Inventory (ASI-3R). After the fourth edition of the DSM was published in 1994, the CSI-4 was developed in response to those changes. The CSI-4 was available in both Spanish and English. In 1995, the ASI was also updated to the ASI-4 to account for modifications in the DSM.|$|E

40|$|Background: Malaria causes 216 {{million cases}} and an {{estimated}} 655000 deaths in 2010 in the world. 80. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 109 billion population of India lives in malaria risk areas. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} determine the knowledge, attitude and practices of malaria transmission and its prevention among <b>the</b> school going <b>adolescents.</b> Methodology: A cross sectional study was conducted among school going <b>adolescents</b> in <b>the</b> rural area <b>of</b> District Wardha, Maharashtra, Central India. 1096 adolescents from eight government secondary schools were randomly selected. A pre-designed, pre-tested questionnaire was used for data collection. Data thus generated was entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Epi Info 6. 04 software package. Chi square value was used for testing the statistical significance. Results: <b>The</b> mean age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school going <b>adolescents</b> was 13. 45 ± 1. 91, for boys 13. 43 ± 1. 99 and 13. 48 ± 1. 85 year old for girls. About 84. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents heard about the malaria disease and. 8. 6 % were aware about the causative agent. Transmission of malaria by mosquito bite was known to 69. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents.</b> This was found significantly associated with male gender (X 2 = 4. 21, p = 0. 03). Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> had misconception regarding <b>the</b> mode <b>of</b> transmission of malaria like houseflies (32. 8 %). Nearly half (51. 1 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> had knowledge <b>of</b> symptoms of malaria as fever. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> were aware about <b>the</b> new strategy <b>of</b> insecticide treated bed nets. Majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> (57. 7 %) knew commonest breeding habits of mosquitoes as dirty stagnant water. <b>The</b> main source <b>of</b> information about malaria to most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> was television and radio (51. 7 %). About 47. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> practiced <b>the</b> prevention <b>of</b> breeding places <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosquitoes by cleaning the surrounding. Nearly one fifth (20. 7 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> were using mosquito net. During the study, 66 (6. 02 %) adolescents were suffering from fever out of that 12. 1 % adolescents had taken self medication. Conclusion: Despite widespread knowledge about <b>the</b> morbidity <b>of</b> malaria, understanding about its transmission, treatment and prevention was low. It is imperative to involve the health workers to provide active support and empower teachers with information about malaria causation and prevention strategies so that such knowledge could be passed on to learners. </p...|$|R

Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming {{of one of his}} movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting.

While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann’s children were often naked because “it came natural to them.” This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked when she was growing up. Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives.” One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides [...] "naked play", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye.
