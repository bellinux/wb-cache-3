5|$|Lead {{compounds}} {{are used}} as, or in, coloring agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its <b>optical</b> <b>characteristics</b> and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E

25|$|Historically, an {{association}} between the color of blood and rust occurs in the association of the planet Mars, with the Roman god of war, since the planet is an orange-red, which reminded the ancients of blood. Although {{the color of the}} planet is due to iron compounds in combination with oxygen in the Martian soil, it is a common misconception that the iron in hemoglobin and its oxides gives blood its red color. The color is actually due to the porphyrin moiety of hemoglobin to which the iron is bound, not the iron itself, although the ligation and redox state of the iron can influence the pi to pi* or n to pi* electronic transitions of the porphyrin and hence its <b>optical</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{infrared}} (IR) {{remote controls}} use light, they require {{line of sight}} to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, {{just like any other}} light source. If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance when controlling equipment in another room or installed in a cabinet, many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an IR receiver, picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control. Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the <b>optical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the phototransistor. However, it's easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most extreme}} forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who {{resisted}} total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially František Kupka, and those considered Orphists by Apollinaire (Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and Duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. Kupka’s two entries at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, Amorpha-Fugue à deux couleurs and Amorpha chromatique chaude, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. Both Duchamp in 1912 and Picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. Beginning in 1912 Delaunay painted {{a series of}} paintings entitled Simultaneous Windows, followed by a series entitled Formes Circulaires, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the <b>optical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. In 1913–14 Léger produced a series entitled Contrasts of Forms, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. His Cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. Apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract Cubism in Les Peintres cubistes (1913), writing of a new [...] "pure" [...] painting in which the subject was vacated. But {{in spite of his}} use of the term Orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.|$|E

30|$|Another {{reason for}} the low {{repeatability}} is that {{the condition of the}} low-density InAs QD for single-photon source devices is strict, so a small deviation of deposition may affect the micro-PL seriously. The micro-PL spectra of samples 3 and 4 at 80 K are shown in Figure  4 c,d. The sharp single peak indicates that sample 4 has a good single-photon characteristic. The multiple peaks of sample 3 demonstrate that a slight change (0.025 ML) of deposition may determine the <b>optical</b> <b>characteristic,</b> so the critical growth parameters obtained from the reference sample ex situ make the repeatability low.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{synthesis}} of nanoparticles via arc electrical discharge method {{get a lot}} of interest because this method needs low cost equipment and is environmentally friendly. In this study, {{synthesis of}} titanium-based nanoparticles carried out by direct current (DC) arc discharge in different liquids. The purpose of research is investigating the effect of liquid medium on size, crystal structure and optical properties of synthesized colloidal nanoparticles. Deionized water and three different organic liquids including ethanol, methanol and acetone were used as arc discharge medium. The arc discharge created with applying 40 A current between two pure titanium electrodes immerged in 4 cm depth of liquid. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-visible spectroscopy were used for characterization of size and morphology and optical properties of nanoparticles respectively. However the morphology of particles is independent of liquid medium and approximately all particles are almost spherical but the average size of particles are different which among them the colloidal nanoparticles synthesized in acetone demonstrate the smallest size. According to optical transmission spectra, nanoparticles synthesized in water indicate <b>optical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of titanium oxide. Also these colloidal nanoparticles sediment after about two days. Colloidal nanoparticles synthesized in organic liquids especially acetone demonstrate high stability without any sedimentation. In addition, nanoparticles synthesized in ethanol, methanol, and acetone indicate <b>optical</b> <b>characteristic</b> of metallic nanostructure. Finally water is suitable to formation of titanium oxide nanoparticles and acetone is determined as the best medium for preparation of stable colloidal solution of titanium nanoparticles...|$|R
