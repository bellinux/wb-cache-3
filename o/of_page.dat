5|$|Past here, Skyline Drive {{continues}} along a southerly track. At the Milam Gap Parking, a trail leads {{east to the}} Rapidan Camp, where President Herbert Hoover had {{a summer}} residence from 1929 to 1932. The road passes Hazeltop before it passes through Bootens Gap, where it straddles the boundary <b>of</b> <b>Page</b> and Greene counties. The roadway traverses Bush Mountain before coming to Bearfence Mountain Parking at Bearfence Mountain. Skyline Drive continues to the south to Lewis Mountain, where a campground, picnic grounds, lodging, and restrooms are located. The road heads along the border between Rockingham and Greene counties as it runs southerly. The drive continues to the south-southwest and reaches South River, which is home to restrooms and picnic grounds. The roadway heads southwest and comes to an interchange with US 33 at the Swift Run Gap Entrance Station, which is situated in Swift Run Gap east of Elkton and west of Stanardsville.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and {{his wife in the}} Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>page</b> 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E

40|$|Benefiting {{from the}} growth of {{techniques}} <b>of</b> dynamic <b>page</b> generation, the amount and the complexity <b>of</b> Web <b>pages</b> increase explosively. The structures <b>of</b> Web <b>pages</b> which are dynamically generated by the same templates are thus similar {{to one another and}} are usually assembled by a set of fundamental information clusters These neighboring information clusters usually represent the similar semantics and form a larger cluster with the more generalized information. The hierarchical structure generated by information clusters in a bottom-up manner is called the information hierarchy <b>of</b> a <b>page.</b> In this paper, we study the problem of mining the information hierarchies <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> in Web sites to recognize the information distribution <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> within the multi-level, multi-granularity configurations. Explicitly, we propose an information clustering system that applies a top-down information centroid searching algorithm and a multi-granularity centroid converging process on the document object model (DOM) trees <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> to build the information hierarchies <b>of</b> <b>pages.</b> Experiments on several real news Web sites show the high precision and recall rates of the proposed method on determining information clusters <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> and also validate its practical applicability to real Web sites. 1...|$|R
