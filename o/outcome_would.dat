5|$|As 91 {{votes are}} needed to elect the Governor from the 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote {{would result in a}} 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> result in his winning 93–87.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasingly}} unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman {{administration was}} beset {{with a series}} of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate {{in the wake of the}} death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the threat of nuclear weapons played an important part in the <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not expect much from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, Austrian) position in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; but for some Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations, and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things to go too far, and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E

He also expressed doubt about Sisi's commitment to democracy, and argued that the Field Marshal bears a measure of direct and indirect responsibility for the human rights violations carried out during the period of the interim government. he denounced what he deemed to be the interim government's hostility toward the goals of the revolution.|$|E
25|$|O'Sullivan's {{original}} {{conception of}} manifest destiny {{was not a}} call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that {{the expansion of the}} United States would happen without the direction of the U.S.government or the involvement of the military. After Americans immigrated to new regions, they would set up new democratic governments, and then seek admission to the United States, as Texas had done. In 1845, O'Sullivan predicted that California would follow this pattern next, and that Canada would eventually request annexation as well. He disapproved of the Mexican–American War in 1846, although he came to believe that the <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> be beneficial to both countries.|$|E
25|$|Under {{head coach}} Bill Finn, and {{featuring}} early stars like three-time All-American Aleta Mills, Jacqui Phillips, Samatha Louras and goalie Becky Trudel, the Minutemen {{finished second in}} the East Region and received an autobid to the third-ever ACHA National Tournament, in Muskegon, Michigan. UMass performed well at nationals, finishing second in their four-team group after wins over Northern Michigan and St. Cloud State. While that <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> have meant a trip to the semifinals under subsequent formats, in 2003 it meant that the Minutemen were dumped in the third-place game, where they dropped a decision to West Los Angeles College. Despite the disappointing finish, the program had announced its arrival in a way few have, before or since.|$|E

25|$|It was {{the first}} meeting between the divisional rivals that season. The Eagles were in third place in the NFC East, behind the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins; the Giants were in fourth. The teams went into the game in similar situations, but heading in {{different}} directions. They had playoff hopes, especially since this {{was the first}} 16-game NFL season, but likely would have to settle for a wild card berth due to the solid lead the powerful Dallas Cowboys had in the division. Given the similarity of their records, it was likely the <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> have playoff implications, since the first tie-breaker for a wild card spot is the head-to-head record.|$|E
25|$|Czechoslovakia had a modern, well-prepared {{military}} and Hitler, on entering Prague, conceded that a war {{would have cost}} Germany much blood. But the decision by France and Great Britain not to defend Czechoslovakia {{in the event of}} war (and the exclusion from the equation of the Soviet Union, whom Chamberlain distrusted) meant that the <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> have been uncertain. This event forms the main part of what became known as Munich betrayal (Czech: Mnichovská zrada) in Czechoslovakia and the rest of Eastern Europe, as the Czech view was that Britain and France pressured them to cede territory in order to prevent a major war that would involve the West. The Western view is that they were pressured in order to save Czechoslovakia from total annihilation.|$|E
25|$|In reality, for MACSOG, {{the point}} was moot. Suspicions abounded within the {{organization}} that Operation Timberwork had been penetrated by communist dich van agents. The intelligence returns from the northern agent teams had been strangely lax and {{more than three-quarters of}} the agents inserted had been captured either during or not long after their arrival. The fact that SOG had slavishly followed the CIA's failed formula for three years was not considered a contributing factor. The unit was more concerned over Washington's continuous rejection of one of the original goals of the operation, the formation of a resistance movement by possible dissident elements within North Vietnam. Washington's stated goal in the conflict was a free and viable South Vietnam, not the overthrow of the Hanoi regime. The conundrum was {{what would happen if the}} program had succeeded. The best possible <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> have been a repeat of the ill-fated Hungarian uprising of 1956, brutally crushed by the Soviet Union, and about which the U.S. could do nothing.|$|E

40|$|Many {{adolescents}} {{choose not}} to tell teachers when they have been bullied. Three studies with 12 - 16 year-old English adolescents addressed possible reasons. In study 1, students (N = 411, 208 females/ 203 males) identified reasons with no prompting. Three perceived negative outcomes were common; peers would disapprove, disclosers would feel weak/undermined, and disclosers desired autonomy. In study 2, students (N = 297, 153 females/ 134 males/ 10 unspecified) indicated how much {{they believed that the}} perceived negative <b>outcomes</b> <b>would</b> happen to them, and a substantial proportion did so.

25|$|In December 2012, Friedkin {{revealed}} that the film rights were in fact owned by Universal, as the Paramount lease had expired after 25 years.

Friedkin also indicated that restoration of Sorcerer would require a considerable amount of work, stating that he does not possess any prints in good quality. Furthermore, he added that Paramount was responsible for creating one between the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012, and he was trying to locate it, noting the difficulties related to obtaining the print as the studio no longer possesses an adequate capacity to deal with this matter and off-shore companies involved in the legal matters were now greatly reduced in staff and stated that is the reason why acquiring the film's print is a time-consuming process.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} a person {{awaiting}} trial has a valid reason, protected under the due process clause, to refuse antipsychotic drugs, referencing Washington v. Harper (1990) and Bell v. Wolfish (1979). Therefore, once Riggins' requested termination of the medication, the State was obligated to establish both {{the need for the}} antipsychotic drug and its medical appropriateness for Riggins' safety and that of others as the less restrictive alternative available. If the state had done this, due process would have been satisfied. The State {{might have been able to}} justify the treatment, if medically appropriate, if it set forth that the adjudication of guilt or innocence could not be established by using less intrusive means. Since the trial court did not do this and allowed the drug's administration to continue without making any of the determinations stated above, it is very likely that this error violated Riggins' trial rights established by the Constitution. However, this is only speculative as there is no way to know what the <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> have been if the proper course had been followed.|$|E
25|$|In some matters, Lever was keen {{to allow}} the {{residents}} of Port Sunlight a degree of democratic control, and this seems to {{have led to a}} common conviction that he was in favour of women’s suffrage: a belief that possibly stems from a situation arising in connection the Bridge Inn, a Port Sunlight temperance “pub” that was opened in I900. Lever was a lifelong teetotaller, and he naturally assumed that the Bridge would be “dry”. Within two years of its opening, however, representations were made to change its status to a licensed house. Lever promptly announced that he would not impose his own views, and that the issue would be decided by a referendum; insisting somewhat unconventionally for that time that women would take part. With the added proviso that the Bridge would only become a true British “pub” if a supermajority of 75% was in favour, Lever probably felt confident that the <b>outcome</b> <b>would</b> support his abstemious sentiments, but in the event more than 80% voted for a liquor license and even though some people petitioned Lever urging him to use his absolute authority in Port Sunlight and ignore the referendum, he refused to do so.|$|E
