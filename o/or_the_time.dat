5|$|The Islamic Andalusi philosopher Averroes or Ibn Rushd (11261198) {{criticized the}} {{argument}} on its methodology. Averroes, an avid Aristotelian, argued that God's existence {{has to be}} shown {{on the basis of}} the natural world, as Aristotle had done. According to Averroes, a proof should be based on physics, and not on metaphysical reflections as in the Proof of the Truthful. Other Muslim philosophers such as Al-Ghazali (10581111) attacked the argument over its implications that seemed incompatible with God as known through the Islamic revelation. For example, according to Avicenna, God can have no features or relations that are contingent, so his causing of the universe must be necessary. Al-Ghazali disputed this as incompatible with the concept of God's untrammelled free will as taught in Al-Ghazali's Asharite theology. He further argued that God's free choice can be shown by the arbitrary nature of the exact size of the universe <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of its creation.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E

25|$|Binaries {{provide the}} best method for astronomers to {{determine}} the mass of a distant star. The gravitational pull between them causes them to orbit around their common center of mass.

25|$|Different sets of {{elements}} {{are used for}} various astronomical bodies. The eccentricity, , and either the semi-major axis, , or the distance of periapsis, , are used to specify the shape and size of an orbit.

Either the longitude at epoch, , the mean anomaly at epoch, , <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of perihelion passage, , are used to specify a known point in the orbit.

25|$|This song {{is divided}} in three movements, and makes {{reference}} to several different concepts. Foremost, white holes are highly theoretical celestial bodies that spew out matter. In other words, they are anti-black holes, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> reversal of black holes, {{and are the}} point in which matter which travels a black hole would exit. Finally, the colonist exits the black hole through a white hole and reaches the Andromeda Galaxy, passing through the fictional Planet Y, which is already populated. He decides to continue his search. Vocals on this song were provided by Timo Kotipelto (from Stratovarius and Kotipelto), Erik Norlander performs a synthesizer solo and Arjen Lucassen provides a guitar solo. The demo version of the song had vocals by Robert Soeterboek.|$|E

25|$|In other words, {{because the}} eclipse season (34 days long on average) {{is longer than}} the synodic month (one lunation, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for the Moon {{to return to a}} {{particular}} phase and about 29.5 days), the Moon will be new or full at least two, and up to three, times during the season. Eclipse seasons occur slightly shy of six months apart (successively occurring every 173.31 days - half of an eclipse year), the time it takes the Sun to travel from one node to the next along the ecliptic. If the last eclipse of an eclipse season occurs {{at the very beginning of}} a calendar year, it is possible for a total of seven eclipses to occur since there is still time before the end of the calendar year for two full eclipse seasons, each having up to three eclipses.|$|E

25|$|An avid {{follower}} of General De Gaulle during the war, he nevertheless denounced, in De Gaulle <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> of Contempts, the presence within the General's entourage, {{at least in}} 1942, of royalists or people closely linked to extreme-right pre-war leagues (Claude Hettier de Boislambert, admirer of Cagoule; colonel Pierre Fourcade, former member of this organization; Pierre Guillain de Bénouville, former member of Action Française, instigators {{of the events of}} 6 February 1934; the General's nephew, Michel Cailliau). According to Jean Pierre-Bloch the alignment of General de Gaulle with the Republican cause was purely tactical and the Resistance had been usurped by de Gaulle. In Pierre-Bloch's view the Gaullists held a distorted view of the resistance, presenting themselves as the only great force of the Resistance, along with the Communists, forgetting the Socialists and Christian Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Multiband {{compressors}} {{are primarily}} an audio mastering tool, but their inclusion in digital audio workstation plug-in sets is increasing their use among mix engineers. On-air signal chains of radio stations commonly use hardware multiband compressors to increase apparent loudness {{without fear of}} overmodulation. Having a louder sound is often considered an advantage in commercial competition. However, adjusting a radio station's multiband output compressor requires some artistic sense of style, plenty of time, and good ears. This is because the constantly changing spectral balance between audio bands may have an equalizing effect on the output, by dynamically modifying the on-air frequency response. A further development {{of this approach is}} programmable radio output processing, where the parameters of the multiband compressor automatically change between different settings according to the current programme block style <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of day.|$|E
