5|$|This is the set {{of points}} in 3-{{dimension}}al Euclidean space found exactly <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> away from the origin. It is called the 2-sphere, S2, for reasons given below. The same idea applies for any dimension n; the equation x02 + x12 + ⋯ + x'n2 = 1 produces the n-sphere as a geometric object in (n + 1)-dimensional space. For example, the 1-sphere S1 is a circle.|$|E
5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length {{is one that is}} lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> of Hubble time.|$|E

5|$|Dedaković's second-in-command, Branko Borković, {{was another}} former JNA {{officer who had}} volunteered for service in Vukovar. The two men {{established}} a unified command structure, organised the defenders into a single brigade and implemented an integrated defence system. A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> within the 204th Brigade. The defenders used a network of cellars, canals, ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects <b>one</b> <b>unit,</b> while a double tap selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were <b>one</b> <b>unit,</b> and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E

5|$|The {{existing}} 11th Special Air Service Battalion {{was renamed}} the 1st Parachute Battalion and, {{together with the}} newly raised 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, formed {{the first of the}} new airborne formations, the 1st Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Richard Nelson Gale, who would later command the 6th Airborne Division. The 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions were formed from volunteers, between the ages of twenty-two and thirty-two, who were already serving in infantry units. Only ten men from any <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> were allowed to volunteer.|$|E
5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals <b>one</b> <b>unit,</b> a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
5|$|All four Galilean moons {{are bright}} {{enough that they}} could be sighted from Earth without a telescope, if they were farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily visible with even low-powered binoculars.) They have {{apparent}} magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.|$|E

5|$|Brigadier Richard N. Gale, {{who would}} later command the 6th Airborne Division, took command of the 1st Parachute Brigade on its {{formation}} in September 1941. A triangular brigade formation with three battalions, Gale decided that rather than dividing the 11th Special Air Service Battalion among the brigade's battalions, he would keep the already trained unit together. On 15September it was renamed the 1st Parachute Battalion, which, together with the newly raised 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, now formed the 1st Parachute Brigade. These battalions were formed from volunteers aged between twenty-two and thirty-two years of age. Only men in infantry units were selected and only ten men from any <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> were allowed to leave. Early in 1942 the brigade was joined by the 4th Parachute Battalion, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, and the 1st (Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers (RE). The 4th Parachute Battalion left the brigade in July {{to become the first}} battalion in the 2nd Parachute Brigade.|$|E
5|$|By 2001, {{the notable}} successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as Monsters, Inc. and, Shrek, respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis: The Lost Empire {{led to a}} growing {{perception}} that hand-drawn animation was becoming outdated and falling out of fashion. In March 2002, just after the successful release of Blue Sky Studios' computer-animated feature Ice Age, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing it to <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation. Morale plunged to a low {{not seen since the}} start of the studio's ten-year exile to Glendale in 1985. The Paris studio was also closed in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 2805, Earth is an {{abandoned}} planet covered in trash, with its people evacuated by megacorporation Buy-N-Large on giant starliners. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> who has gained sentience {{and is able}} to stay active using parts from other units. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.|$|E

5|$|In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in {{accordance}} with a new war establishment. Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops (instead of the previous 10). Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type landing ship and <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> in the 'Dutch' type landing ship. The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer, 12 motorcycles (six with sidecars), two 15 hundredweight (cwt) trucks, and one 3-ton truck. These vehicles were only provided for administration and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Heroes of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures and enemies. Unlike prior {{games in the}} series, which are typically action role-playing games, Heroes is a real-time strategy game (RTS), in which the player controls up to 25 units in battles on fixed maps. Units are controlled via the Nintendo DS touch screen, selected by tapping on them and sent to destinations or to attack by tapping on their target. The game world is divided into an isometric grid, with <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> allowed per space. The Nintendo DS's second screen shows {{a map of the}} current mission, including which parts of the map can currently be seen by the player's units and which parts are covered by fog of war. Individual units and enemies are shown on the map in the visible areas.|$|E
5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned {{to sit next to}} the Genesis console and featured a top-loading disc tray in place of the motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD in <b>one</b> <b>unit</b> and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E
