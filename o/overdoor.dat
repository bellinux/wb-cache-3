5|$|The House of Rohan {{owned the}} palace until the French Revolution, {{when it was}} confiscated, {{declared}} bien national ("state owned"), and finally auctioned off on 8August 1791. Bought by the municipality, it became the new town hall (hôtel deville) the same year, succeeding the Neubau. Much of the furniture {{and many of the}} works of art in the Palais were sold, and in 1793 the eight life-sized mural portraits of prince-bishops decorating the Salle des évêques (Bishops' Hall) were destroyed. They were replaced in 1796 by allegories of civic virtues painted by Joseph Melling. Only the portrait of Armand Gaston, the builder of the palace, was later restored to its original place with a 1982 replica of Hyacinthe Rigaud's lost painting. Melling also replaced the <b>overdoor</b> portraits of kings of France, decorating the same room with paintings of vases.|$|E
5|$|This {{was one of}} {{the private}} rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of a}} , with a trellis pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (illustrated below), giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior. The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain <b>overdoor</b> and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E
5|$|The red canopy {{bed in the}} King's bedchamber is a 1989 copy of a bed kept in the Château d'Azay-le-Rideau, {{thought to}} be {{very similar to the}} lost original. The portraits of kings Louis XIV and Louis XV of France in the library are copies made in 1950 of originals by Hyacinthe Rigaud kept in the Palace of Versailles. These 20th-century copies are {{replacements}} for the 18th-century copies of the same paintings that were destroyed during the French Revolution {{at the same time as}} the portraits of the prince-bishops in the Bishops' Hall (see above, History). The <b>overdoor</b> paintings in the antechamber of the prince-bishop are also 20th-century copies, replacing 18th-century copies of French Baroque masters such as Antoine Coypel, Charles Le Brun, and Charles de La Fosse, that were destroyed in 1944. These paintings represent biblical stories; the lost first copies were made in 1737–1740 in Versailles. The other paintings on the walls belong to the Musée des beaux-arts, including Louis XV offrant la Paix à L'Europe ("Louis XV presenting Peace to Europe", 1737) by François Lemoyne, on display in the Garde-robe du prince-évêque, and La déification d'Énée ("The Deification of Aeneas", 1749) by Jean II Restout, on display in the Chambre du prince-évêque.|$|E
500|$|Carving and {{plasterwork}} {{also became}} a feature of estate houses. Some of the finest domestic wood carving is in the Beaton panels made for Arbroath Abbey, which were eventually moved {{to the dining room}} of Balfour House in Fife. Carvings at Huntly Castle, rebuilt for George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly in the early seventeenth century, focused on heraldic images. Their [...] "popish" [...] overtones led to them being damaged by an occupying Covenanter army in 1640. From the seventeenth century there was elaborate use of carving in pediments and fireplaces, with heraldic arms and classical motifs. Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs. William Bruce favoured Dutch carvers for his realisation of Kinross House, where there are festoons, trophies and cornucopia around the doorways and gates. This may have included the work of Jan van Sant Voort, a Dutch carver known to have been living in Leith, who supplied Bruce with a carved heraldic <b>overdoor</b> in 1679 and who worked on Bruce's rebuilding of Holyrood Palace. From 1674 the London plasterers George Dunsterfield (fl. 1660–76) and John Houlbert (fl. 1674–79) worked for Bruce at Thirlestane, Berwickshire and at Holyroodhouse. Dunsterfield was also active at Balcaskie, Fife and probably at Kellie Castle.|$|E

50|$|His {{commissions}} {{included the}} design of a children’s playroom aboard the SS United States, illustrations for a 1952 children’s book, The Little Car That Wanted a Garage, wall murals, and decorative design elements such as a sculpted <b>overdoor</b> sailing ship.|$|E
50|$|The <b>overdoor</b> {{is usually}} {{architectural}} in form, but {{may take the}} form of a cartouche in Rococo settings, or it may be little more than a moulded shelf for the placement of ceramic vases, busts or curiosities. An overmantel serves a similar function above a fireplace mantel.|$|E
50|$|After {{undergoing}} a major renovation in 1994, Meridian House's principal rooms retain their architectural detail {{as well as}} some of the original decorative features, such as the 18th century European <b>overdoor</b> paintings and antique brass hardware and lighting fixtures. The classical symmetry of the Louis XVI style is reflected throughout the house.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is divided on both main levels using a central hall plan, with two rooms to each side. The east side features a stair-hall, with a fanlight-topped doorway connecting {{it to the}} main hall. The Federal style woodwork of the {{interior is}} refined. Of special note are the carved <b>overdoor</b> panels.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} related to other Claverack federal residences in terms of layout, and {{interior}} trim details, including refined fluting on stair spandrels {{similar to those found}} in the James Vanderpoel house (House of History), Plumb-Bronson mansion, and another privately owned Claverack house. The east front parlor features related fluting in the <b>overdoor</b> panels.|$|E
50|$|Maes {{made several}} designs for {{decorative}} paintings. Sotheby’s sold a {{design for a}} ceiling design on 8 July 2009 in London (lot 121). Two other designs for decorative paintings by Maes are known: the Death of Achilles (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) and a design for an <b>overdoor</b> of Minerva flanked by the four Cardinal Virtues (Leiden University print room).|$|E
50|$|In 1744, {{at the age}} of 23, he {{inherited}} the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. He continued the Heidecksburg construction project his father had begun. His father had built the exterior of the castle, John Frederick took up decorating the interior. He commissioned frescoed ceilings and <b>overdoor</b> ornaments. In 1750, the ballroom was completed by Gottfried Heinrich Krohne. It is considered a prime example of Rococo interior design in Germany.|$|E
50|$|The UK based HEVAC Air Curtain Group {{describes}} <b>overdoor</b> heaters {{as small}} electric or water heated fanned units {{with a low}} air volume flow rate. They are intended to be installed at doorways having low pedestrian traffic where the door is mainly closed, and are useful in providing warmth. However, {{they should not be}} seen as an alternative to an air curtain, which also serves to separate the indoor and outdoor air spaces.|$|E
50|$|Hallfield House is {{constructed}} from deeply coursed, squared gritstone with a stone slate roof. The building has four bays {{and consists of}} three storeys with an attic. Most of {{the windows in the}} main house are mullioned. One of the highlights of the interior is a 17th-century plaster <b>overdoor</b> in one of the downstairs rooms which is decorated with lilies and roses, the room also has a frieze adorned with fish, fruit and mermaids playing harps under an ornamental cornice.|$|E
50|$|A firebox or firepit is {{the part}} of the {{fireplace}} where fuel is combusted, in distinction from the hearth, chimney, mantel, <b>overdoor</b> and flue elements of the total fireplace system. The firebox normally sits on a masonry base at the floor level of the room. Some fireboxes are large in proportion so that a person could actually walk inside, or in extreme cases have a small meeting using built-in benches inside. An example of the latter oversize construction {{can be found in the}} great hall of Muchalls Castle in Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{first floor}} apartment, {{consisting}} of a salon, bedroom and bathroom, is the Chinese Apartment. It features a lowered ceiling, and combines classicist elements and far eastern patterns, with classicist and English furniture in a Chinese style. On the first floor we can also see a complex of classicist reception rooms created for the Duchess, among those the most noteworthy two-storey Ballroom, ornamented with honey-coloured, polished wood carvings, and white engravings in the <b>overdoor</b> and frieze parts, all by Bauman; the Great Dining Room and chapel were all designed by Chrystian Piotr Aigner and Bauman.|$|E
50|$|The Liberation of Saint Peter is a fresco {{painting}} by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael {{and his assistant}} Giulio Romano. It was painted in 1514 as part of Raphael's commission to decorate with frescoes the rooms that are {{now known as the}} Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. It is located in the Stanza di Eliodoro, which is named after The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple. The painting shows how Saint Peter was liberated from Herod's prison by an angel, as described in Acts 12. It is technically an <b>overdoor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The palace is {{generally}} entered through the Entrance Hall, where the restrained {{form of the}} classical external colonnade was continued into the interior. The walls of the rectangular room were subdivided by ten pairs of Corinthian columns made of white stucco marble with gilded capitals. Three <b>overdoor</b> reliefs with themes from the myth of Bacchus reflected the vineyard theme created outside. Georg Franz Ebenhech was responsible for gilded stucco works. The strict classical elegance was relieved by a painted ceiling executed by the Swedish painter Johann Harper, depicting the goddess Flora with her acolytes, throwing flowers down from the sky.|$|E
5000|$|From 1938 to 1941 she was {{the artist}} in {{residence}} at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. She describes this period as [...] "the most profitable and enjoyable three years of my life." [...] In 1939 she was commissioned by the federal Treasury Section of Fine Arts to paint a mural, [...] "Missouri Livestock," [...] for the post office in La Plata, Missouri. Two years later she collaborated with Henry Kreis {{on a series of}} low-relief granite sculptures depicting the benefits of social security for the <b>overdoor</b> panels of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services building in Washington, D.C.|$|E
50|$|Mylnhurst is {{constructed}} from course squared stone with a slate roof which has multiple ridge stacks upon it, however the very tall chimney stacks were removed after being damaged in a gale in 1962. The house has much ornate stonework including elaborately carved pillars which support an oriel {{window on the}} south front of the house. There is a castellated tower integrated into the building {{on the north side}}. The two storey stable block on the north side has an archway and oriel window. The highlight of the interior is the ground floor front room which has a cross beam ceiling, moulded cornice, wooden fireplace and <b>overdoor</b> dating from around 1900.|$|E
5000|$|Fabing {{arranged}} {{for the construction of}} the present house in 1859, before he entered into the gasworks business. [...] Three stories tall and built of brick, Fabing's house {{is one of the most}} distinctive pieces of architecture in the city. Most surviving buildings in Fremont are no older than the late nineteenth century, and various vernacular styles are prevalent; the 1850s Second Empire architecture of the Fabing House is radically different from many surrounding structures. Among its prominent features are a square tower with a mansard roof, an ornamental <b>overdoor,</b> a large bracketed cornice with dentils, elaborate metalwork and dormer windows, a multi-part frieze, and decorative hoodmolds.|$|E
5000|$|Burton Court {{contains}} architectural {{pieces from}} the Norman, Medieval, Regency and Victorian periods. The hall dates to the early 14th century, {{but much of the}} house remaining today was added in the 18th century. Remodeling occurred in 1808, which was followed by restorations in 1865, and also in 1912 when the architect Clough Williams-Ellis added the Tudor Revival front. The house is framed in timber. Exterior brick work has been stuccoed. There is a dovecote with a lantern roof. [...] Windows of note are a two-storey bay and an elliptically shaped one. Additional exterior elements are stone mullioning, Doric pilasters, and a moulded architrave. Inside, there are purlins, an <b>overdoor,</b> and a cantilevered stair.|$|E
5000|$|Gerard Rijsbrack was {{successful}} in France where he enjoyed royal patronage. Like his compatriot Pieter Boel in the 17th century, Rysbrack received various commissions to produce paintings for the menagerie at Versailles. [...] The artist also received a royal commission for <b>overdoor</b> paintings of hunting scenes for the Chateau de la Muette, originally the hunting lodge of the French king but used by [...] Louis XV to entertain his mistresses. Rijsbrack received 700 pounds for each hunting piece between 1749 and 1751. Between 1748 and 1751 he also made paintings for the king’s mistress Madame de Pompadour, destined for the Ermitage of Pompadour and the Palace of Versailles. He received 4,460 pounds for his paintings for the Ermitage.|$|E
50|$|From {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{at first}} in {{interiors}} such as the Palazzo Sampieri, Bologna, where Annibale Carracci provided <b>overdoor</b> paintings, they developed into a minor genre of their own, in which the trompe l'oeil representations of stone bas-reliefs, or vases of flowers, in which Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer specialized, were heightened by sotto in su perspective, in which the light was often painted to reproduce the light, diffused from below, that was entering the room from its windows. Overdoors of such flower pieces, allegorical subjects, and landscapes were favoured through {{the end of the}} 18th century. French, Dutch and Flemish animalier artists such as Jean-Baptiste Oudry and Jan Weenix were often commissioned to paint sets of overdoors with groups of live or dead game and dogs for country houses or hunting lodges.|$|E
50|$|The {{adjoining}} room served as both an audience {{room and the}} Dining Room. It is decorated with paintings by French 18th-century artists, including Jean-Baptiste Pater, Jean François de Troy, Pierre-Jacques Cazes, Louis Silvestre, and Antoine Watteau. However, here, as {{in the majority of}} the rooms, the carved putti, flowers and books on the <b>overdoor</b> reliefs were the work of Glume, and the ceiling paintings emphasise the rococo spirit of the palace. This exuberant form of ornamentation of rococo, Rocaille, was used in abundance on the walls and ceiling in the music room. Much of the work was by the sculptor and decorator Johann Michael Hoppenhaupt (the elder). A 1746 fortepiano by Gottfried Silbermann which once belonged to Frederick the Great remains as a nostalgic reminder of the room's original purpose.|$|E
5000|$|A few {{still lifes}} by him are known. A flower still life {{painting}} of Flowers in a porcelain bowl dated 1721 was sold at Bonhams. It represents flowers {{in a bowl}} placed on a stone plinth. [...] A similar painting dated 1728, which was an <b>overdoor</b> piece, was sold by Christie’s. [...] These still lifes are painted with a broad brush and less detail than the paintings in the National Maritime Museum.Several hunting still lifes and scenes with live animals in old collections in the Czech Republic and Poland bear the signature J. Bouttats. Often they are catalogued as works by Johann Baptist Bouttats. However, {{in view of the}} delicate hand and bright palette and the fact that all these paintings are located in Central Europe, this J. Bouttats was likely a different painter.|$|E
50|$|The House of Rohan {{owned the}} palace until the French Revolution, {{when it was}} confiscated, {{declared}} bien national ("state owned"), and finally auctioned off on 8August 1791. Bought by the municipality, it became the new town hall (hôtel deville) the same year, succeeding the Neubau. Much of the furniture {{and many of the}} works of art in the Palais were sold, and in 1793 the eight life-sized mural portraits of prince-bishops decorating the Salle des évêques (Bishops' Hall) were destroyed. They were replaced in 1796 by allegories of civic virtues painted by Joseph Melling. Only the portrait of Armand Gaston, the builder of the palace, was later restored to its original place with a 1982 replica of Hyacinthe Rigaud's lost painting. Melling also replaced the <b>overdoor</b> portraits of kings of France, decorating the same room with paintings of vases.|$|E
50|$|This {{was one of}} {{the private}} rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz.

5000|$|The hôtel {{was built}} for a wig-maker, Abraham Peyrenc de Moras, who had speculated {{successfully}} in the ill-fated paper money schemes of John Law that had ruined many, {{at a time when}} the Faubourg Saint-Germain was still suburban in character. His house, the most superb in the neighborhood, was built as a free-standing structure, not entre cour et jardin ("between entrance court and garden") with party walls against adjoining buildings, as hôtels in more densely built quarters of Paris were traditionally built since the seventeenth century. The house is still surrounded by three hectares/7.3 acres of grounds. The house had boiseries carved in the full-blown rococo manner and has two elliptical salons that form attached pavilions at the corners of the garden front. There were sixteen medallions or <b>overdoor</b> paintings by François Lemoyne, premier peintre du roi, enframed in the paneling.|$|E
