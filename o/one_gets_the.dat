25|$|Suppose {{we want to}} {{differentiate}} f(x) = x2 sin(x). By using the product rule, <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> derivative (x) = 2x sin(x) + x2 cos(x) (since the derivative of x2 is 2x and the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function).|$|E
25|$|For graphs {{drawn in}} the plane without crossings, Fáry's theorem states that <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> same class of planar graphs {{regardless}} of whether the edges of the graph are drawn as straight line segments or as arbitrary curves. But this equivalence does not hold true for other types of drawing. For instance, although the crossing number of a graph (the minimum number of crossings in a drawing with arbitrarily curved edges) may be determined in NP, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals to determine whether there exists a drawing achieving a given bound on the rectilinear crossing number (the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross in any drawing with edges drawn as straight line segments {{in the plane}}).|$|E
25|$|For {{quotient}} rings R/I, {{the change}} of rings is also very clear. An R-module is an R/I-module precisely when it is annihilated by I. The submodule annI(M) = { m in M : im = 0 for all i in I } is a left submodule of the left R-module M, and is the largest submodule of M that is an R/I-module. If M is an injective left R-module, then annI(M) is an injective left R/I-module. Applying this to R=Z, I=nZ and M=Q/Z, <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> familiar fact that Z/nZ is injective as a module over itself. While {{it is easy to}} convert injective R-modules into injective R/I-modules, this process does not convert injective R-resolutions into injective R/I-resolutions, and the homology of the resulting complex is one of the early and fundamental areas of study of relative homological algebra.|$|E

500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta. Lieberstein is also the actor who plays Toby Flenderson. It took Lieberstein and Celotta {{four or five days}} to write this episode. Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was {{inspired}} by the days that he was an administrative assistant for Countrywide Home Loans. Farrell recalled watching the company try new online initiatives and seeing them all be unsuccessful. The talking head interview wherein Michael compares Holly to a baker came after what the writers call [...] "blitzes", in which all the writers write a talking head on a specific topic, such as [...] "Michael's feelings to Holly". Then they all read all of them out loud and see which <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> biggest reaction. The YouTube video of Ryan being arrested was set on a private account. After [...] "Goodbye, Toby" [...] aired, the video was released to the public. When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was difficult to get a badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons. During one of the takes wherein Michael is singing his parody songs, Carell grabbed a guitar and played an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but that scene was cut because it did not match Michael's character. After filming, the editors had about 72 minutes of material that they needed to cut down into 40 minutes.|$|E
