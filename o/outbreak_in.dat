5|$|A {{total of}} 57people were killed across four states and 18counties, with {{hundreds}} of others injured. The outbreak, at the time, was the deadliest {{in the era of}} modern NEXRAD doppler radar, which was fully implemented in 1997. The event was the second deadliest in February since 1950 behind the February 1971 Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak, which killed 123, the deadliest <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super Outbreak, and was at the time the deadliest tornado <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> the US overall since the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak which killed 90 people. This record would not be surpassed until the 2011 Super Outbreak which killed 324 people. Damage from tornadoes was estimated at over $500 million (2008 USD).|$|E
50|$|Most tornado <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> North America {{occur in}} the spring, {{but there is a}} {{secondary}} peak of tornado activity in the fall which is less consistent but can include exceptionally large and/or intense <b>outbreaks.</b> <b>In</b> 1992, an estimated 95 tornadoes broke out in a record 41 hours of continuous tornado activity from November 21 to 23. This is also among the largest-known <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> areal expanse. Many other very large <b>outbreaks</b> have occurred <b>in</b> autumn, especially in October and November.|$|R

25|$|Recent {{examples}} include US95/96-US strain, associated with global <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> the mid- to late-1990s; Farmington Hills virus associated with <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> Europe and the United States in 2002 and in 2004; and Hunter virus which {{was associated with}} <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> Europe, Japan and Australasia. In 2006, there was another large increase in NoV infection around the globe. Reports have shown {{a link between the}} expression of human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and the susceptibility to norovirus infection. Studies have suggested the viral capsid of noroviruses may have evolved from selective pressure of human HBGAs.|$|R
5|$|After a 1990 Dutch elm disease <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> Portland, {{including}} one diseased tree at Park and Market in the South Park Blocks, the elm trees have been immunized with Tiabendazole.

30|$|To our knowledge, {{there have}} been only a few reports on the {{aetiology}} of seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> NHs, but none includes a detailed molecular characterization of the influenza circulating strains (Neemuchwala et al. 2015; Mubareka et al. 2013). Here, we describe a cross-sectional study of the occurrence of 2014 – 2015 ILI <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> 12 sentinel NHs in Corsica, France. The main objective was to study the molecular epidemiology of the influenza <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> NHs to determine whether multiple influenza strains were involved <b>in</b> these <b>outbreaks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fourteen <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> Hungary between 2005 and 2008 {{caused by}} extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) were epidemiologically {{investigated}} and the isolated pathogens {{were characterized by}} molecular techniques. Ten of the fourteen <b>outbreaks</b> occurred <b>in</b> adult wards and four in neonatal units affecting a total number of 73 patients. The 54 % [40] of the patients developed bloodstream infections and 21. 9 %– 21. 9 % [16] pneumonia and surgical site infections, respectively. The overall rate of mortality proved high: 36. 9 % [27]. <b>Outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> adults affected more patients, had higher attack rates, were more prolonged in duration and had a 6. 9 -fold higher mortality rate than <b>outbreaks</b> observed <b>in</b> neonates. The <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> neonates were caused by SHV-type ESBL-producing klebsiellae, while in the “adult outbreaks” exclusively CTX-M-type ESBL-KP strains were involved. While the outbreak strains isolated from neonatal units could be assigned {{to a variety of}} pulsotypes, the previously described K. pneumoniae epidemic clones, ST 15 and ST 147, could be identified among the pathogens causing <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> adult units...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent public {{attention}} on drinking water supplies {{in the aftermath}} of waterborne infection <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> Walkerton and North Battleford raises questions about safety. We analyzed information on waterborne outbreaks occurring between 1974 and 2001 in order to identify apparent trends, review the current status of monitoring and reporting, and {{gain a better understanding of}} the impact of drinking water quality on public health and disease burden. Methods: Data from outbreak investigations, published and unpublished, were categorized by the type of drinking water provider and were assessed to be definitely, probably or possibly waterborne in nature. Results: The final data set consisted of 288 outbreaks of disease linked to a drinking water source. There were 99 <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> public water systems, 138 <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> semi-public systems and 51 <b>outbreaks</b> <b>in</b> private systems. The main known causative agents of waterborne disease <b>outbreaks</b> were (<b>in</b> descending frequency of occurrence) Giardia, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Norwalk-like viruses, Salmonella and hepatitis A virus...|$|R
5|$|Oral {{transmission}} {{is an unusual}} route of infection, but has been described. In 1991, farm workers {{in the state of}} Paraíba, Brazil, were infected by eating contaminated food; transmission has also occurred via contaminated açaí palm fruit juice and garapa. A 2007 <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> 103 Venezuelan school children was attributed to contaminated guava juice.|$|E
5|$|Several highly lethal viral {{pathogens}} {{are members}} of the Filoviridae. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever, and include the Ebola and Marburg viruses.

Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, there were 252 cases including 227 deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in North America on May 21, 2009, with Warner Bros. setting the American premiere on May 14, 2009, at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Elsewhere, Sony Pictures Entertainment released the film in most overseas territories on different dates in June. One exception was Mexico, however, because of the swine flu <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> the country, which forced Sony to push the release date to July 31, 2009.|$|E
40|$|Since late 2007, several {{outbreaks}} of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection {{have emerged in}} Thailand.

5|$|After his acquittal, Blackburn {{remained}} in Canada to avoid arrest and prosecution by U.S. authorities. When {{he learned of}} a yellow fever <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> New Orleans and the Texas Gulf Coast, Blackburn wrote to President Andrew Johnson on September 4, 1867, asking permission {{to return to the}} U.S. and help treat the disease. Not waiting for Johnson's response—which never came—Blackburn returned to the U.S., arriving in Louisville on September 25, 1867, en route to New Orleans. After rendering aid during the epidemic, he and his family moved to an Arkansas plantation owned by his wife.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an <b>outbreak.</b> <b>In</b> one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E

5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie <b>Outbreak.</b> <b>In</b> the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E

Another <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> Nepal leads to more questions when an infected person who should have died somehow survived.|$|E
5|$|In Syria {{difficulties}} in executing immunization {{programs in the}} ongoing civil war led to a return of polio, probably in 2012, acknowledged by the WHO in 2013. 15 cases were confirmed among children in Syria between October and November 2013 in Deir Ezzor. Later, two more cases, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, were identified. It was the first <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> Syria since 1999. Doctors and international public health agencies report more than 90 cases of polio in Syria, with fears of contagion in rebel areas from lack of sanitation and safe-water services.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> 2003 {{and the threat}} of terrorism. In December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and as many as 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the different communities.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{there were}} 56 tornadoes {{confirmed}} during the outbreak, including three EF3 tornadoes reported across three states, {{as well as}} three EF4 tornadoes; two in Alabama and one in Kansas, the first such tornadoes since {{the introduction of the}} Enhanced Fujita Scale. Total damages were estimated at over $580million from tornadoes alone, making it the fourth-costliest tornado <b>outbreak</b> <b>in</b> US history (the figure not including damage from other thunderstorm impacts including hail and straight-line winds). Insured losses in the state of Georgia topped $210million, making this outbreak the costliest in that state's history.
