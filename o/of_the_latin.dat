5|$|All {{copies of}} Hymn {{are found in}} manuscripts of the Historia ecclesiastica or its {{translation}}, where they serve as either a gloss to Bede's Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, {{in the case of}} the Old English version, a replacement for Bede's translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede's work, the Hymn does not appear to have been transmitted with the Historia ecclesiastica regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the Hymn in manuscripts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Historia. In three cases, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43, and Winchester, Cathedral I, the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript's main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin Historia: nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> text; closely related copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Historia sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the Historia ecclesiastica is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Christian {{tradition}} {{says that}} Christianity reached {{the shores of}} Kerala in AD 52 {{with the arrival of}} Thomas the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ.

5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is the interdependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> American tyrant and United States imperialism.

5|$|From 1210 on, Michael I Komnenos Doukas {{was engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of expansion, chiefly at the expense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Kingdom of Thessalonica to his east; after initial reverses, much of Thessaly was conquered. By 1214, Dyrrhachium and Corfu had been recovered from the Latins as well. The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's repudiation of the allegiance he had sworn to the Latin Empire, but historian Philip Van Tricht argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> Empire until 1217. Michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215. As Michael II was illegitimate and too young, Theodore had no trouble in sidelining the boy. According to the hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, {{the boy and his}} mother spent the duration of his reign exiled in the Peloponnese.|$|E
50|$|Shortly afterwards, {{however, the}} Volsci formed an {{alliance}} with the Hernici and sent ambassadors to seek <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latins.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Latins,</b> having been defeated by Rome the previous year, were so outraged by the Volsci attempts to lure them into another war, that they seized the Volscian ambassadors, delivered them to the consuls in Rome, and advised them that the Volsci together with the Hernici were fomenting war. The Roman senate, so thankful at <b>the</b> assistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Latins,</b> returned 6,000 prisoners to <b>the</b> <b>Latin</b> towns and in return <b>the</b> <b>Latins</b> sent a crown <b>of</b> gold to <b>the</b> Temple <b>of</b> Jupiter Optimus Maximus in Rome.
