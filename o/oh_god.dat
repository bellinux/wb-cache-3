25|$|In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express {{certainty}} that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims {{that there is}} no such thing as a faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day's time that those two, like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other's lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: Ah guarda sorella—"Ah look sister"). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio—"I feel, <b>oh</b> <b>God,</b> that my foot is reluctant"). As the boat with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: Soave sia il vento—"May the wind be gentle"). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the women (like all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?—"Oh, poor little ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman").|$|E

[...] He urged teammates to wear batting helmets when playing their positions, [...] "It wasn't just one, it was many.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Voices Carry" [...] was {{directed}} by D.J. Webster, and filmed at Dorchester's Strand Theater, Davio's Restaurant, and W. Brookline St in Boston. The clip incorporates dialogue and acting, and resembles a mini-movie. The plot centers on the band's lead singer, Aimee Mann, who appears as a musician with an abusive boyfriend, played by actor Cully Holland. He mistreats her for playing in a rock band, and demands that she change her look to fit in his upper-class lifestyle. The video uses spoken dialogue in between to interrupt the musical parts, including Mann's boyfriend demanding: [...] "Why can't you for once do something for me?". At the end, the couple attend a concert at Carnegie Hall where the boyfriend is angered to notice part of Mann's rattail sticking {{out from under her}} cap. At her breaking point, Mann lashes out at him, jumping up from her seat in the audience and yelling the lyrics—"He said, shut up! He said, shut up! <b>Oh</b> <b>God,</b> can't you keep it down?..."—as she removes her cap to reveal her spiky, rat-tailed hair, while the boyfriend now hides his face in embarrassment {{and the rest of the}} audience watches in shock.|$|E

These two characters are among the foodies that Marge, Bart, and Lisa meet at the Ethiopian restaurant. In the episode, they rhyme a hip hop song that according to Selman is [...] "all bragging about how awesome and cool you are as a foodie." [...] It was co-written by the duo, and {{was inspired by the}} song [...] "Empire State of Mind". [...] Selman has commented that [...] "In animated TV shows, whenever you're trying to show people having fun doing their new thing , it just kind of becomes a boring montage. And we've done so many montages on The Simpsons over 25 years, it's like, <b>oh,</b> <b>God,</b> no more montages. [...] So we were like, 'Why not do a silly rap song?' Rapping is sort of inherently boastful, and there's something about being a foodie that's inherently boastful. It's like the boastfulness links those things. So Tim and Eric perform a food rap song in the show—an extremely silly rap song, and the name is intentionally silly: 'Blogging a Food Blog.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues.
