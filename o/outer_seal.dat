The latter fully expected to meet with a clumsy forgery; but the instant his eyes fell on the phraseology, he perceived that the will had been drawn by one expert in the law.

The explosive hatch design used the 70 bolts of the original design, but each quarter-inch (6.35 mm) titanium bolt had a 0.06 in hole bored into it to provide a weak point. A mild detonating fuse (MDF) was installed in a channel between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>seal</b> around the periphery of the hatch.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas buffered sealing system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the <b>outer</b> <b>seal</b> face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|E

40|$|Simulation of {{unsteady}} viscous turbomachinery flowfields {{is presently}} impractical as a design tool {{due to the}} long run times required. Designers rely predominantly on steady-state simulations, but these simulations do not account {{for some of the}} important unsteady flow physics. Unsteady flow effects can be modeled as source terms in the steady flow equations. These source terms, referred to as Lumped Deterministic Stresses (LDS), can be used to drive steady flow solution procedures to reproduce the time-average of an unsteady flow solution. The goal of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using inviscid lumped deterministic stresses to model unsteady combustion hot streak migration effects on the turbine blade tip and <b>outer</b> air <b>seal</b> heat loads using a steady computational approach. The LDS model is obtained from an unsteady inviscid calculation. The LDS model is then used with a steady viscous computation to simulate the time-averaged viscous solution. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional applications are examined. The inviscid LDS model produces good results for the two-dimensional case and requires less than 10 % of the CPU time of the unsteady viscous run. For the three-dimensional case, the LDS model does a good job of reproducing the time-averaged viscous temperature migration and separation as well as heat load on the <b>outer</b> air <b>seal</b> at a CPU cost that is 25 % of that of an unsteady viscous computation...|$|R

40|$|Part 1 of this two-part paper {{presented}} experimental results for externally-induced (EI) ingress, where the ingestion of hot gas through the rim seal into the wheel-space {{of a gas}} turbine {{is controlled by the}} circumferential variation of pressure in the external annulus. In Part 2, experimental results are presented for rotationally-induced (RI) ingress, where the ingestion is controlled by the pressure generated by the rotating fluid in the wheel-space. Although EI ingress is the common form of ingestion through turbine rim seals, RI ingress or combined ingress (where EI and RI ingress are both significant) is particularly important for double seals, where the pressure asymmetries are attenuated in the annular space between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>seals.</b> In this paper, the sealing effectiveness was determined from concentration measurements, and the variation of effectiveness with sealing flow rate was compared with theoretical curves for RI ingress obtained from an orifice model. Using a non-dimensional sealing parameter, Φ, the data could be collapsed onto a single curve, and the theoretical variation of effectiveness with Φ was in very good agreement with the data {{for a wide range of}} flow rates and rotational speeds. It was shown that the sealing flow required to prevent RI ingress was much less than that needed for EI ingress, and it was also shown that the effectiveness of a radial-clearance seal is significantly better than that for an axial-clearance seal for both EI and RI ingress...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Probe Missions to the Giant Planets, Titan and VenusSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopA feasibility study of the small Venus entry capsule and the scientific observation by the water-vapor balloon are described in this paper. Though Venus is the nearest planet to the Earth, it is still filled with mysteries and surprises. The atmosphere observation under the thick cloud on the venusian surface is of great scientific interests. Because a super-pressure type of the balloon can travel long time a wide area by strong winds on the Venus, it is considered to be of prime candidate for the atmosphere observations. A water-vapor super-pressure balloon is advantageous to obtain buoyancy force in the hot Venus atmosphere. At the entry to the Venus, the liquid-phase water is adhered to a number of the water-absorption films layered inside of the <b>outer</b> <b>sealing</b> film. The heat required for the water vaporization is supplied from the ambient environment during the ascending phase. Recently, IC chips, batteries, and solar arrays that function under the high-temperature environment ranging 180 to 220 ?C have been developed and been in practical use. By use of solar arrays, the electric power is supplied to the onboard instruments without any extra cooling system, which enables long-term observation. Then the target altitude is determined to be from 35 to 37 km considering the operation range of the high-temperature electronics. A small entry capsule with the 20 m-long water-vapor balloon accommodated in it is separated from a 150 kg small spacecraft and carries out direct entry from the interplanetary transfer orbit at the velocity of 11. 5 km/s.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} simple successful porcine cryopreservation protocol that prevented contact between embryos and liquid nitrogen, avoiding potential contamination risks. In vivo-derived blastocysts were collected surgically from donor pigs, and two porcine embryo vitrification protocols (one used centrifugation to polarize intracytoplasmic lipids, whereas the other did not) were compared using the Cryologic Vitrification Method (CVM), which used solid surface vitrification. The CVM allowed embryos to be vitrified, without any contact between embryos and liquid nitrogen. Both protocols resulted in similar in vitro survival rates (90 % and 94 %) and cell number (89 ± 5 and 99 ± 5) after 48 h in vitro culture of vitrified and warmed blastocysts.
