5|$|Hamnet Shakespeare (baptised 2 February 1585– buried 11 August 1596) was {{the only}} son of William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway, and the fraternal twin of Judith Shakespeare. He died at age 11.

5|$|On 23 February 1915, a Court of Inquiry was held, {{at first}} meeting in {{confidence}} {{but then in}} public sessions. It prepared a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, {{the cause of the}} mutiny was not conclusively established. The focus of the report was <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists Gregory Paul and Per Christiansen of the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark {{proposed}} that large ceratopsians such as Styracosaurus {{were able to}} run faster than an elephant, based <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> ceratopsian trackways which did not exhibit signs of sprawling forelimbs.|$|E
5|$|Seven of the calendrical crescents (red) are {{accompanied}} by other glyphs (green).

5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and {{breaks down the}} mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{prevented}} {{this action}} and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically advantageous {{position in the}} Naushahra Sector, was captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between Mirpur and Poonch and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> enemy approaches.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, a Lebanese man was {{detained}} by Cyprus police <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned to blow up a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E

5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} {{the crash of}} Flight 1907 began to emerge, the investigation seemed {{to be at least}} partly focused <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E
5|$|In late February, ground sensors {{detected}} the 66th Regiment, 304th NVA Division preparing {{to mount an}} attack on the positions of the 37th ARVN Ranger Battalion on the eastern perimeter. On the night of 28 February the Combat Base unleashed artillery and airstrikes <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> North Vietnamese staging areas and routes of advance. At 21:30, the attack came on, but it was stifled by the small arms of the Rangers, who were supported by thousands of artillery rounds and air strikes. Two further attacks later in the morning were halted before the North Vietnamese finally withdrew. NVA, however, was not through with the ARVN troops. Five more attacks against their sector were launched during the month of March.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese had defended {{strongly}} {{in order to}} allow an orderly evacuation of personnel and stores, and with the Australians unable to concentrate sufficient combat power rapidly enough to ensure a decisive result, they were largely able to achieve this objective. Unfazed by the loss of their base-camps, the bulk of the communist force remained intact and later carried out a highly successful ambush by 274 VC Main Force Regiment on 12 June. Seven Australians were killed and three wounded from the HQ 1 ATF Defence and Employment Platoon in this subsequent action, with the bulk of the casualties occurring when an RPG-7 exploded on a box of M18A1 Claymores sitting atop an M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier, igniting them with catastrophic consequences. Operations in Long Khanh continued however, and the Australians established a number of ambushes <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> withdrawal routes, although little contact subsequently occurred.|$|E

5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments <b>on</b> <b>possible</b> reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E
