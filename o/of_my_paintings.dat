500|$|McCartney became {{interested}} in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England. In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted {{in his hometown of}} Liverpool. McCartney said, [...] "I've been offered an exhibition <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.|$|E

[...] As Koger explained, [...] "the single thread running through all <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> is nostalgia for paradise." [...] The theme of the SG's design is [...] "good versus evil, heaven versus hell, {{and the power of}} music in the universe to rise above it all as a force of good". The centrepiece on the face is a cherub holding a triangle, surrounded by yellow stars on a celestial blue background ("a Fool hallmark"). The angel's curly hairstyle was inspired by Clapton's hairstyle at the time. Flames come up {{from the bottom of the}} guitar (the bass-bout with the volume and tone controls) and the treble point has rainbow-coloured arcs. The pick guard contains a landscape with mountains and a red sun on the horizon, a [...] "Dutch miniature" [...] representing paradise.

5000|$|A {{couple of}} years ago I started some <b>paintings</b> that had <b>my</b> own <b>paintings</b> in them, and which were similar to the Matisse studios. There was one {{difference}} that I think shows up mostly in the Look Mickey: When I reproduce one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>paintings</b> in <b>my</b> painting, it's different from Matisse reproducing one of his paintings in his painting, because even though in both paintings the depicted painting is submerged {{for the good of the}} whole work, it's much more so in Matisse. I wanted <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> to read as individual paintings with the work, so that there would be some confusion. There’s no remove in my work, no modulation or subtlety of line, so the painting-of-a-painting looks exactly like the painting it's of. This is not true, of course, of many early - including Renaissance - [...] depictions of paintings on walls, where there’s always a remove indicated through modulation, or some other way of showing that the depicted painting is not pasted on the picture or something like that.

40|$|This project explores {{painting}} {{in relation to}} concepts	of tangata whenua	(people of the land), whakapapa (genealogy) and turangawaewae	(a place to stand) that is informed by cultural, historical and spiritual	connections	to whenua (land). 	The project	focuses on articulating	my	desire to imbue the work {{with a sense of}} wairua (spiritual	essence) 	and mauri (living	life principle) that may	communicate	a	transcendental sensibility or quality to the viewer.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Ruddell {{made a major}} shift in his work, turning towards figurative fine art. Essentially leaving the {{illustration}} scene. Since this shift, Ruddell has been exhibiting and showing in museums, galleries, universities and exhibitions across the United States.

40|$|My work {{is about}} discovery: an {{exploration}} of colors, patterns and the language of paint. By working from objects of femininity such as makeup and clothing, I’m investigating how illusion functions in society {{as well as how}} functions in the simplistic sense of handling paint. I am intrigued by how paint can be manipulated to create a reality that only exists on the surface of a painting. I am fascinated with the appeal of beauty and illusion. While some are absolutely disgusted with society’s standards of a woman’s obligation towards her appearance, others find it a magnificent treat to play with makeup, clothes, and jewelry. I have deliberately chosen to work with colors and patterns that evoke a sense <b>of</b> playfulness. <b>My</b> <b>paintings</b> and drawings salute the nature of dress up, reflecting the delight one finds sequined slippers, satin dresses, and gold high-heeled shoes...|$|R
40|$|The {{journey of}} this {{research}} began with exploring the notion of invisible space which cannot be perceived by the human eye, {{and the process of}} image visualisation expressed through <b>my</b> abstract <b>paintings,</b> which is supported by my theoretical research. ‘Invisible Space’, the title <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> recent <b>paintings,</b> evokes the notion of a very small space such as a cell or nerve tissues which form part of the human body and have the potential to simultaneously symbolise a cosmological space. In my practice, I adopt painting as a pertinent method to realise my subjects and motifs. I consider how my painting is situated in contemporary art theory and practice by exploring artists and writers relevant to my underlying concept. I explore how my subject is presented in painting and drawing, and how my research can be developed logically and systematically in response to my practice. In this report, I analyse the three key elements: 1) abstraction that explores macro & micro space; 2) colour experiments and 3) cultural traditions and gesture through Korean Monochrome painting...|$|R
