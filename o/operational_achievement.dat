40|$|In {{the context}} of {{aircraft}} engineering and maintenance, No Fault Found (NFF) is {{a chain of events}} that develops from a pilot experiencing a system malfunction with postflight maintenance failing to reproduce the reported symptoms. Without any repair being undertaken, the malfunction may be experienced again on subsequent flights. This present significant cost impacts to the industry that includes financial, reduced <b>operational</b> <b>achievement,</b> airworthiness challenges and potential flight safety issues. One of the major causes identified for NFF occurrence within electronic, mechanical and hydraulic products are faults that are intermittent in nature. This makes it difficult to use systematic fault detection techniques effectively, as system are subject to unknown disturbances and model uncertainties. The philosophy behind this criterion is that the designed model-based Fault Detection (FD) observer should be robust to disturbances but sensitive to intermittent faults where the occupance of intermittent faults can be alarmed by the use of an adaptive threshold. The aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the development of such methodologies and to examine its performance in a real-world test bed.

40|$|Summary: Strategy {{development}} and evaluation in {{military operations in}} the battlefield is highly complex activity and requires a systematic approach for detailed analyses on {{the internal and external}} key environmental factors, which can be both qualitative and quantitative. This study proposes a newly structured Quantified SWOT Analytical Method for strategy {{development and}} evaluation to provide <b>operational</b> <b>achievement.</b> In the proposed methodology, while SWOT analysis supports the decision situation by structuring the decision hierarchy, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) measures the relative importance of the SWOT factors in this hierarchy. Using the quantitatively evaluated SWOT factors weighted by AHP, operational strategies can be developed for the purpose of building on the strengths, eliminating the weaknesses, exploiting the opportunities and/or countering the threats with the highest weights. The assigned relationships between the SWOT factors and alternative strategies allow the ranking of these strategies that yields the selection of the applicable strategies in practice. An illustrative case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology. The results show that this methodology helps the commanders to manage the complexity of the battlefield and to organize indefinite strategic decision-making process in the battlefield...|$|E

40|$|The Tenth Cruiser Squadron {{provided}} a vital element to the Blockade of Germany, patrolling the seas between northwest Scotland, Iceland and Greenland. It {{was the longest}} continuous naval operation of the war lasting from 1914 - 1917. The Squadron’s resources were armed merchant cruisers manned by Naval Reservists and Mercantile Marine ratings all commanded by a Flag Officer and Royal Naval Commanding Officers. The thesis follows the Royal Navy’s deliberations to establish its Reservist elements and how the Navy assumed {{the men of the}} Mercantile Marine could be brought into naval service. A parallel debate in Parliament considered the viability of taking up ocean liners for conversion to armed merchant cruisers. Both sets of discussions lasted nearly fifty years. Most existing Squadron literature is chronological, drawing heavily on official reports of proceedings. This thesis concentrates on analysing personal diaries and biographies and is focused on the crews’ daily work to reveal a broad picture of life in the Squadron. Topics included are pay, accommodation, feeding scales, daily routines, promotion, pastoral and medical welfare, and recreation. These issues were in addition to the daily threats from surface and submarine attack and the constant debilitating bad weather. Although deemed successful, the thesis concludes, the blockade could have been tightened sooner if the Government had used statistics already held on imports and exports. The conclusion is also made that the Royal Navy’s failure to understand fully the shipping industry’s unique facets and the merchant seaman, created problems that could have been avoided. The Squadron’s <b>operational</b> <b>achievement</b> was intercepting nearly 13, 000 suspect vessels. Its patrols performed a constabulary function which encouraged ships to call voluntarily at examination ports to be searched effectively.

The Study investigated the <b>operational</b> <b>achievements</b> of the Commission and the obstacles to achieving the mandate of the EFCC. This study adopted a qualitative research approach through a single case study design. Data were obtained using multiple sources (interviews, documentary evidence and observations) to answer the research questions. In all, 12 interviews were carried out during a period of three months.

Strong core radiation peaking is observed in H-mode discharges at a low gas fuelling rate (i. e. below 0. 5 x 10 (22) Ds(- 1)) and low ELM frequency (typically less than 10 Hz), even when the tungsten influx from the diverter is constant.

40|$|The {{launch of}} Surrey’s UoSAT- 12 in April 1999 heralded {{a new era}} in small-satellite Earth observation. The UoSAT- 12 mission, Surrey’s first mini-satellite, {{supports}} a variety of payloads, including a 10 -m panchromatic imager and a 32 -m multispectral imager - both built at Surrey using COTS technology. In building these imagers, Surrey applied the lessons learned over sixteen microsatellite missions, and took advantage of the minisatellite class platform, which can support larger payloads and more complex missions. In the year since launch, UoSAT- 12 has succeeded in a series of demonstrations of key remote-sensing technologies and techniques including autonomous station keeping, repeat ground track maintenance, high-speed communications, slewing and ground target tracking. This paper reviews these <b>operational</b> <b>achievements</b> and also describes next-generation remote sensing missions under development at Surrey. Spurred by the outstanding success of UoSAT- 12, Surrey is already planning more ambitious remote sensing missions. Already, minisatellite advances are feeding back into microsatellites, such as an enhanced microsatellite with 12 -m panchromatic and 24 -m multispectral imaging. Future minisatellite missions are pushing the boundaries further, including 4 -m panchromatic and 13 -m multispectral payloads based on COTS technology. Planned missions and future concepts are presented which include use of pushbroom imagers, development of new imagers, Earth observations constellations and improved data handling as applied to small satellites. UoSAT- 12 has proven that small satellites can offer rapid development, cost-constrained Earth observations missions.
