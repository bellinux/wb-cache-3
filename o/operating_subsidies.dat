5|$|The board approves WMATA's annual budget. The {{budget was}} $2.10 billion {{in fiscal year}} 2010. In fiscal year 2010, 31.1% of {{revenues}} came from capital contributions, 20.2% from passenger revenues, 32.1% from local jurisdiction <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies,</b> 3.5% from interest income, 1.9% from advertising revenue, 1.1% from rental revenue, and 0.1% from other sources.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Package 3 is a {{political}} agreement between all the major projects on what to spend public funding for transport in Oslo and Akershus on. The agreement was made in 2007, and consists of 53 billion Norwegian krone (NOK), which will be shared between investments in road infrastructure, public transport infrastructure, and <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> for Ruter. Financing comes from the state, the counties and from toll roads. The agreement states the major investments which are planned during a 20-year period. In addition, the previous agreement, Oslo Package 2, still has funding for some smaller projects.|$|E

25|$|Following a {{government}} decision that <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> for long distance passenger trains would cease, Sunday, 26 April 1987 saw dining cars, sleeping cars, nearly 100 jobs and $4 million in operating costs removed from this service and until Sunday, 20 March 1988, the train offered a biscuits and fruit juice fare served from the guards van.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{an airport}} is {{estimated}} to cost NOK530 million and have an annual operating cost of NOK28 million. An economic analysis showed that the airport would have a negative net present value for society of NOK1014 million, excluding <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> for the airline. There is little time gain from the project as travelers to Oslo would have to fly via Sørkjosen to Tromsø and there change aircraft, instead of taking direct flights from Alta. Only passengers having Tromsø as travel target would have a gain from an airport. Avinor has recommended not upgrading the Kautokeino Airport.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, the Ribu Commission was {{established}} to look into building a new railway north of Fauske. The commission made no clear recommendation {{as to whether the}} line should be built, but stated although it had a cost of NOK4.4 billion and would need <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies,</b> it would provide a positive economic impact on the region, particularly if additional industrial and commercial investments were made along the route. Parliament did not make a decision when it debated the commission's report in 1983. Instead, a new report was issued in 1992. This time it was planned as a high-speed railway, but in 1994, the project was rejected by Parliament.|$|E

50|$|The {{trail was}} {{originally}} the Grand River Valley Railroad, constructed in 1868-69. Service {{on the line}} ended in 1983, after the state ended an <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> for the railroad line.|$|R
25|$|Since 2002, the M-line Trolley {{is free to}} the public, {{thanks to}} a joint <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> {{received}} from Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) and the Uptown Improvement District. DART designates the streetcar as route 825 at transit stops.|$|R
25|$|Financing. Investments {{are mostly}} {{financed by the}} {{government}} {{with the support of}} external donors. The private sector makes a limited contribution to finance, mostly through a single BOT that has so far been awarded for a US$160 million wastewater treatment plant. Between 2005 and 2010 Egypt received more than 1bn Euro in external aid for water supply and sanitation, out of which 30% were grants and the remainder soft loans with an average interest rate of 1%. This corresponds to EUR 200 million per year, corresponding to only about 10% of the government's investment budget for the sector in 2009/10. According to the Ministry of Housing, government subsidies to water and wastewater utilities amounted to more than 15 billion Egyptian pounds (USD 2.5bn) in 2009/10, including EP 13.4bn (USD 2.2bn) investment subsidies, EP 0.66 bn (USD 0.1bn) <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> and EP 1 bn (USD 0.2bn) repair and rehabilitation subsidies.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourteen}} FUNN centers {{were located}} in Ålesund, Alta, Bø, Gjøvik, Grimstad, Kirkenes, Kristiansund, Mo i Rana, Narvik, Sarpsborg, Sogndal, Steinkjer, Stord and Tromsø. Each consisted of two Norsk Data minicomputers, one running Sintran III and one running Ndix, a ND-developed variant of Unix. The computers were owned by the company A/S ND-FUNN, based in Mo i Rana and which was wholly owned by Norsk Data. It received share capital from ND {{in such a way}} that ND received an identical tax break. The share capital was then used to purchase computers from Norsk Data. The centers were connected to each other. The centers were separate limited companies with various local owners which were responsible for operating the computers and selling the processing capacity to local customers and projects. The centers were not to receive any <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> from the government or Norsk Data. Five years after installation the computers would be handed over free of charge from ND-FUNN to the respective centers. Each center was required to purchase services from Norsk Data for NOK1.075 million per year, on an irrevocable contract which lasted five years.|$|E
500|$|Norving {{announced}} on 10 December 1987 {{that they would}} terminate all operations outside Finnmark. This took effect on 8 January 1988, leaving Rørvik without a scheduled services. Manning of the airport was reduced from eight to six, but the airport remained open from 08 to 23. From the summer schedules of 1988, Rørvik was included in Widerøe's services along the Helgeland coast. [...] The airport had 7,244 passengers in 1988, and the combined subsidies per passengers was NOK511. This included NOK1.3 million in state <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> to the airport, {{in addition to an}} operating deficit of NOK1 million covered by the municipality.|$|E
50|$|Danish Dance Theatre {{receives}} an annual <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> from the Ministry of Culture. Since the company’s funding represents approximately half the financial support that other comparable Nordic companies receive, {{it is necessary}} to have additional financial backing from private companies, foundations and endowments.|$|R
50|$|The {{service was}} popular with riders, However, it ended {{as rapidly as}} it began in 1979 due to poor {{trackage}} and loss of the <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> from PennDOT. For commuters traveling from Allentown/Bethlehem and Philadelphia, it had proved faster {{to drive to the}} village of Center Valley instead and board trains there.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} 1988 Pilgrim Partnership Agreement, Rhode Island {{provides}} capital funding (including some of its federal formula funds) for MBTA {{expansion in}} the state. Massachusetts (through the MBTA) provides the <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> for MBTA Commuter Rail service in return. Rhode Island also pays Amtrak to allow the MBTA to use its tracks.|$|R
2500|$|Since the [...] "forward funding" [...] {{reform in}} 2000, the MBTA is funded {{primarily}} through 16% {{of the state}} sales tax excluding the meals tax (with minimum dollar amount guarantee), which is set at 6.25% statewide, and therefore equal to 1% of taxable non-meal purchases statewide. The authority is also funded by passenger fares and formula assessments of the cities and towns in its service area (excepting those which are assessed for the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority). Supplemental income is obtained from its parking lots (reserved for passengers), renting space to retail vendors in and around stations, rents from utility companies using MBTA rights of way, selling surplus land and movable property, advertising on vehicles and properties, and federal <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> for special programs.|$|E
2500|$|Delhi example. Between 2011 and 2013 Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has {{increased}} its revenues by 50 percent and reduced <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies</b> from the National Capital Territory of Delhi. It owes [...] in debt, but hopes that the debt will be converted into a grant. The utility focuses on improving its customer database, meter reading through hand-held devices, billing and bill collection under a new manager, Debashree Mukherjee, who took {{the helm of the}} utility in 2012. As of 2004, in Delhi revenues were just sufficient to cover about 60% of operating costs of DJB; maintenance was, as a result, minimal. In the past, the Delhi utility has relied heavily on government financial support for recurrent and capital expenditures in the magnitude of [...] per year and [...] respectively. Accounts receivable represent more than 12months of billing, part of it being non-recoverable. The average tariff was estimated at 0.074/m³ in 2001, compared to production costs of 0.085/m³, the latter probably being a very conservative estimate that {{does not take into account}} capital costs.|$|E
2500|$|The California High-Speed Rail Authority {{was created}} in 1996 {{by the state to}} {{implement}} an extensive [...] rail system that is estimated to cost about $40 billion. Once built, the system will not require <b>operating</b> <b>subsidies,</b> and it is expected to generate $1 billion in annual profits. Construction has been approved with the passing of proposition 1A, in which a $9.95billion general obligation bond was authorized by voters. The system would provide high-speed service between and among major cities, like Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, and would allow travel between Los Angeles' Union Station and San Francisco's Transbay Terminal in two and a half hours. On 2 December 2010, the California High-Speed Rail Authority announced the first section of the Californian High-Speed Rail network had been selected and construction was to start in 2012, but delays postponed it to 2015. The line will run from near Madera south to Bakersfield, with stations at Fresno and Hanford, at a length of 105km running through a rural part of the San Joaquin Valley. The line will connect with traditional Amtrak lines at each end. In December 2010, that funding was doubled after the newly elected governors of Ohio and Wisconsin decided to cancel right of way projects which had been allocated $1.2bn of funding by the federal government. Of that amount, $616m was then granted to California in addition to funding already promised, which, when combined with a state bond issue to match the new funding, provided over $1.2bn in addition funding. This will be used to add an additional 88km of track, bringing the line to the edge of Bakersfield.|$|E
50|$|HACLA funds {{come from}} five main sources: HUD's annual <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy,</b> HUD's annual Capital Fund, Section 8 {{administrative}} fees, rent from public housing residents plus other program and capital grants from various sources. HACLA continues to explore alternative funding sources and has built numerous key partnerships with City and State agencies, nonprofit foundations, community-based organizations and private developers.|$|R
50|$|The service became {{unprofitable}} for CP in 1974 and {{the federal}} government stepped in, providing an <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> to maintain the service. In 1976, the service (and the vessel Princess of Acadia) were transferred to Canadian National Railway and in 1977 was grouped under a separate subsidiary CN Marine. In 1986 this subsidiary was made a separate Crown corporation, Marine Atlantic.|$|R
5|$|NYC Ferry was to cost $325 {{million with}} the city {{contributing}} an additional <b>operating</b> <b>subsidy</b> of $10 million to $20 million per year.
