40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the <b>opening</b> <b>delay</b> and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, fuel oil inlet passage diameter, fuel oil outlet passage diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the <b>opening</b> <b>delay,</b> while the fuel oil inlet passage diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay. A small control piston diameter together with a small fuel oil inlet passage diameter contribute to a short <b>opening</b> <b>delay,</b> however, they lead to a significant increase in the closing delay. Moreover, a small closing delay prefers a large fuel oil inlet passage diameter. The selected Pareto optimum achieved a significant reduction in both the <b>opening</b> <b>delay</b> and the closing delay under three different rail pressures...|$|E
30|$|Row {{precharge}} and row <b>opening</b> <b>delay</b> for DDR 3 SDRAM are {{memory and}} clock frequency dependent. For a 64 -bit 7 - 7 - 7 memory, the delay {{because of a}} row opening and precharging is three times {{higher than that of}} a column access. One feature of the burst accesses is that the subsequent column access time for consecutive locations is hidden and the only case where this access time is influencing the data retrieval delay is for the first column from the burst.|$|E
30|$|The {{bandwidth}} {{toward the}} memory is visibly improved by an optimal data arrangement and efficient retrieval scheme. When {{compared to a}} linear address approach the proposed scheme realizes 2 × up to 3 × more efficient retrieval.

The number of read commands on the address bus is drastically reduced when using the proposed method as compared to a linear addressing approach.

30|$|At the moment, the DDR 3 {{memories}} are preferred for such implementations {{thanks to their}} fast memory access, high bandwidth, relatively large storage capability, and affordable price. The major bottlenecks of external SDRAM memory in a H. 264 decoder are numerous accesses to implement the motion compensation (MC) and accesses to multiple memory rows to reach columns of pixels. This last bottleneck, known as cross-row memory access, {{is a problem for}} both access time and power utilization. The row precharge and row <b>opening</b> <b>delay</b> for DDR 3 SRDAM are memory and clock frequency dependent. For a 64 -bit 7 - 7 - 7 memory it takes about three times more time to read a data from an unopened row than from an already opened one [6]. This, together with the DDR 3 optimized burst access are the facts that drove us to look into a more efficient memory access for MC.|$|E
40|$|The <b>opening</b> <b>delay</b> of a {{discharge}} {{reed valve}} for compressors {{caused by the}} stiction force of the oil film between the reed and the valve seat is investigated. The coupling simulation algorithm including models of cavitation in the oil film is developed. In order to check the validity, the numerical simulation is performed under several conditions of a model experiment. The coupling model consists of the reed deformation, the gas flow, and the oil film flow with cavitation. The two-dimensional reed deformation is expressed by expanding natural modes that are obtained by the finite element method using shell elements. The gas flow is expressed by the thermodynamic model under the assumption of the internal reversible process. The two-dimensional oil film pressure distribution is obtained by solving numerically the Reynolds’ equation through the finite volume method. On the model of cavitation in the oil film, {{in addition to the}} case in which cavitation is not taken into account, two cavitation models are tested; the static cavitation model (Reynolds’ condition) in which the minimum oil pressure is set to absolute zero, and the dynamic cavitation model in which the oil film pressure can fall to the absolute negative (tensile in the liquid) due to the direct simulation of the bubble expansion. Comparisons on the <b>opening</b> <b>delay</b> time between simulation results and the experimental result show that the static cavitation model gives the earlier delay time than that in the experiment, and the dynamic cavitation model which simulates the absolute negative pressure in the oil film reproduces accurately the experimental delay time. The simulation through the dynamic cavitation model also reproduces well behaviors of cavitation and blow-by flow (oil film rupture) in the oil film captured by the high-speed camera in the experiment. The relation among the pressure, the thickness, and the cavitation area of the oil film that are obtained in the simulation shows the mechanism of the oil film rupture (valve opening), i. e., the cavitation bubbles promote the increase of the oil film thickness during the stiction and the increased oil film thickness causes the recovery of the oil film pressure, and the subsequent blow-by flow (oil film rupture) ...|$|E
30|$|In the setup, a {{laser beam}} of 266  nm {{wavelength}} from an Nd:YAG laser (Model LAB 190, Spectra Physics Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA.) {{was transformed into a}} planar laser sheet using a cylindrical lens. The laser beam was shaped into a planar sheet with a width of 5  cm and thickness of 15  μm at focus using the combination of cylindrical plano-convex and spherical plano-convex lenses of suitable focal lengths. For imaging purposes, a high-speed gated ICCD camera (Model- 4 Quik E/digital HR) from Stanford Computer Optics Inc. (Berkeley, CA, USA) with a minimum gate time of 1.2  ns was employed. The camera was connected to the computer and Nd:YAG laser for external trigger. After each laser pulse, the camera shutter <b>opening</b> <b>delay</b> was set to 50  ns and the optimized exposure time was fixed to 25  ns throughout the experiment. To filter out other stray light, an acetone LIF filter (LaVision GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) was placed in front of the camera.
