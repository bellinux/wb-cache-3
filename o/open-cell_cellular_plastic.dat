40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{experimental and}} computational testing of regular <b>open-cell</b> <b>cellular</b> structures behaviour under impact loading. <b>Open-cell</b> <b>cellular</b> specimens made of aluminium alloy and polymer were experimentally tested under quasi-static and dynamic compressive loading {{in order to}} evaluate the failure conditions and the strain rate sensitivity. Additionally, specimens with viscous fillers have been tested to determine the increase of the energy absorption due to filler effects. The tests have shown that brittle behaviour of the cellular structure due to sudden rupture of intercellular walls observed in quasi-static and dynamic tests is reduced by introduction of viscous filler, {{while at the same}} time the energy absorption is increased. The influence of fluid filler on <b>open-cell</b> <b>cellular</b> material behaviour under impact loading was further investigated with parametric computational simulations, where fully coupled interaction between the base material and the pore filler was considered. The explicit nonlinear finite element code ls-dyna was used for this purpose. Different failure criteria were evaluated to simulate the collapsing of intercellular walls and the failure mechanism of cellular structures in general. The new computational models and presented procedures enable determination of the optimal geometric and material parameters of cellular materials with viscous fillers for individual application demands. For example, the cellular structure stiffness and impact energy absorption through controlled deformation can be easily adapted to improve the efficiency of crash absorber...|$|R

40|$|One {{purpose of}} this work was to examine if a {{modification}} of the exterior insulation finishing system can lower the number of outer walls damaged by damp. The modification is the cut of the <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> which is 45 degrees instead of a horizontal cut. One other purpose was; is <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> or mineral wool better as insulation to minimize the dampness {{in this type of}} outer walls? A third purpose was to examine if there is any difference of dampness in the outer walls if using a gravel bed or concrete stones next to the outer wall. To examine these three purposes a laboratory experiment with three test walls with an exterior insulation finishing system was built. The difference between the three walls was the insulation. One wall was built with mineral wool with a horizontal cut, one with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a horizontal cut and the third with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a cut of 45 degrees. Simulations of pelting rain and measurements of dampness were carried out for 21 days. The measurements were taken at the same time every evening. After 21 days small samples of tree from the walls was weight, dried in an oven and then weight again to get the quantity of moisture in the samples before they were dried. A diffusion calculation of two outer walls, one with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> and one with mineral wool, was completed to examine the difference between the relative humidity in the walls. An identical calculation without a plastic film was executed too. The result of the calculations showed a minimal difference in the walls built with a plastic film. When the film was removed the result presented critical values. The result of the laboratory experiment indicates that the test wall with the cut of 45 degrees is better than the walls with a horizontal cut of the insulation. The differences were minimal but possible to read. Some critical, too high, values regarding the moisture content in wood were found and they came from the sills in the walls that had insulation with horizontal cuts. Of the two insulation types the result of calculations and laboratory experiment shows a minimal difference but they both indicates a better result for the mineral wool. The conclusion of this work indicates that <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a 45 degree cut is slightly better than the horizontal cut. The comparison of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> and mineral wool indicates that the mineral wool is better. Another conclusion of this work is that the material on the ground next to the outer wall did not alter the dampness in the wall...|$|R

The consistent tangent stiffness operators are derived and the equations are fully implemented in a nonlinear two-dimensional finite-element solution scheme for the coupled displacement/rotation problem.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the constitutive modelling of dissipative <b>open-cell</b> structural <b>cellular</b> solids under primarily finite compressive deformations {{and the corresponding}} non-linear finite element implementation. A thermodynamically consistent, mechanistic approach presented in Hard of Segerstad et al. [Hard of Segerstad, P., Larsson, R., Toll, S., 2008. A constitutive equation for <b>open-cell</b> <b>cellular</b> solids, including viscoplasticity, damage and deformation induced anisotropy. International Journal of Plasticity. 24, 896 - 914. ] is adopted for modelling the initial linear-elastic response and the subsequent plateau behaviour. In these regions the cellular solid is considered as a network of struts, where each strut connects two vertex points. A hypothesis is proposed that the vertex points move affinely in the finite strain regime, where the struts buckle plastically. The strut deformation is further assumed to be one-dimensional and depend directly on the macroscopic deformation; thus {{the description of the}} strut response requires only a scalar valued response function. Owing to this simple ansatz, the introduction of multiple non-linear mechanisms, such as hyperelasto-viscoplasticity and damage becomes feasible for large scale computations. An additional hyperelastic volumetric response, activated near the point-of-compaction, is introduced for two reasons, (i) to capture the stiffness recovery at high compressive volumetric deformations, where the struts come into contact, and (ii) to prevent numerical instability. The model is implemented as a user defined constitutive driver in the implicit version of the finite element code ABAQUS and tested experimentally for an open-cell aluminium alloy foam (Duocel 6101 - 0, 40 ppi). All material parameters are determined by a simple compression test, and subsequently used to simulate the indentation of a rigid sphere into a foam cylinder. The model accurately captures the experimental load-displacement relation and the deformed geometry. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{transmission}} in planar <b>open-cell</b> <b>cellular</b> solids is analysed using {{a recent}} theory developed for marginally rigid granular assemblies. This {{is made possible}} by constructing a one-to-one mapping between the two systems. General trivalent networks are mapped onto assemblies of rough grains, while networks where Plateau rules are observed, are mapped onto assemblies of smooth grains. The constitutive part of the stress transmission equations couples the stress directly to the local rotational disorder of the cellular structure via a new fabric tensor. An intriguing consequence of the analysis is that the stress field can be determined {{in terms of the}} microstructure alone independent of stress-strain information. This redefines the problem of structure-property relationship in these materials and poses questions on the relations between this formalism and elasticity theory. The deviation of the stress transmission equations from those of conventional solids has been interpreted in the context of granular assemblies as a new state of solid matter and the relevance of this interpretation to the state of matter of cellular solids is discussed.

40|$|Background: The most energy {{efficient}} houses today are so called passive houses. These houses achieve high energy-efficiency partly by having well insulated walls. U-value describes {{the amount of}} heat transfered through a building element, the more insulation, the smaller U-value. A typical passive house wall have a U-value of 0. 10 W/m 2,Â°C. The passive houses are primarily made as small family houses {{and not as a}} block of apartments. This is partly because the bigger houses often are made of prefabricated walls, which at present times are not made with enough insulation. One construction method common in prefabrication is a sandwich-construction with two layer of concrete surrounding a core of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic.</b> Skanska is making this type of walls in a factory on Gotland. We wanted to combine the energy efficiency of passive housing with the efficiency of prefabricated sandwich-walls. Aims: To present a suggestion of a sandwich-construction made with concrete and <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,Â°C, that could be implemented in the factory on Gotland. Methods: By analyzing systems of today we developed two different models that have a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,Â°C. The first system was developed from a system used in Skanskaâs factory on Gotland and the second one was based on a system delivered by Halfen DEHA. This was made through empirical tests and theoretical calculations. We compared the developed systems in terms of the conditions in Skanskaâs factory on Gotland. Result and discussion: The system based on Halfen DEHA needs a larger amount of shackles, than the system developed from Skanskaâs present system. This leads to the need of thicker insulation to achieve the desired U-value. The reason is that the Skanska-based system uses a combination of shackles and <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> to carry the loads of the coating layer while the Halfen DEHA depends on the shackles alone. We believe that the first of our two developed systems is the best in terms of the ease in adopting to the production method in Skanskaâs factory. The second system is safer in terms of controlling the production and has the possibility to have an air gap. Conclusion: In the rapport we present a sandwich-construction system that has a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,Â°C, that we believe would work for prefabrication of wall structures and could be easily adopted in Skanskaâs factory on Gotland...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} for modelling {{the response of}} <b>open-cell</b> <b>cellular</b> solids at finite strains is developed. The model framework comprises a mechanistic formulation where the cellular solid is considered as a network of struts, each connecting two vertex points. A hypothesis is proposed that the vertex points move affinely in the finite strain regime, where the struts buckle in compression. Owing to this simple ansatz, important material behaviour, such as the linear-elastic response and plateau behaviour, are easily captured. Other important phenomena, such as initial anisotropy and deformation induced anisotropy are inherent within the method, {{and it is possible}} to include multiple nonlinear mechanisms, such as hyperelasto-(visco) plasticity and damage, in a straightforward fashion. First, a hyperelastic equation is developed in order to evaluate the suggested kinematic approach. The model is implemented at material point level. The model parameters are identified for a flexible, open-cell, polyeter urethane foam and the equation is validated against a variety of experiments. Next, a micropolar hyperelastic model is proposed for capturing length-scale effects associated with couples carried by the struts. The modelâs capability is demonstrated through numerical simulations. Finally, an {{approach for}} capturing the inelastic response is presented.

The proposed methodology consists of determining the mass loss {{as a function of the}} thermal evolution by applying a mass conversion directly using thermogravimetric data under non-oxidative conditions. In order to verify this simplified method, an experimental programme based on 100 mm thick samples of rigid polyisocyanurate foam was conducted using a Cone Calorimeter, obtaining measurements of mass loss and temperature within the core of the material. A Monel plate was used on top of the sample in order to represent a simpler boundary condition by eliminating the smouldering process of the charred material. Although the pyrolysis rates using this methodology did not provide a perfect fit with experimental data, they showed similar trends, with a slightly delayed prediction but still accurate magnitude.

An experimental device was constructed to measure the permeability of the scaffold variants at different levels of compressive strain (0, 14, 29 and 40 % while a low-density <b>open-cell</b> foam <b>cellular</b> solids model utilizing a tetrakaidecahedral unit cell was used to accurately model the permeability of each scaffold variant at all level of applied strain. The results of both the experimental and the mathematical analysis revealed that scaffold permeability increases with increasing pore size and decreases with increasing compressive strain. The excellent comparison between experimentally measured and predicted scaffold permeability suggests that cellular solids modelling techniques can be utilized to predict scaffold permeability under a variety of physiological loading conditions as well as to predict the permeability of future scaffolds with a wide variety of pore microstructures...|$|R
40|$|The {{sponsors}} {{of this project}} have been using the rigid heavily-crosslinked polyurethane foam detailed in this study for load-bearing applications. One of the main requirements of this material is that it must possess excellent recovery properties following extensive compressive periods over several years. For such long loading regimes, there is need for detailed understanding of the compressive behaviour of this material, and its subsequent recovery upon release. More recently, {{there has been a}} growing interest in replacing the polyurethane foam with an alternative <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> that possesses similar, if not identical, compressive recovery and behaviour. Attention was focused on the other primary polymer contingent, a polyethylene foam. A polyimide foam was also considered as it was already being used in applications {{similar to those of the}} polyurethane foam. The structures of the foams were investigated by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Image Analysis. The deformation mechanisms that occur during the application of a compressive force were examined visually via a scanning electron microscope compression rig. The mechanical analysis involved stress-strain testing whereby three stages of compression were identified (âlinear elastic, stress plateau and densificationâ), as described in the literature. Quadratic relationships were found to exist between the foam density and the âelastic modulus, plateau modulus and the compressive strengthâ respectively. Such relationships had previously been found to exist in the literature, but not for the rigid variety of foam at such a broad range of densities. Further analysis included a detailed study of the recovery of the polyurethane (100 kg m[sup]- 3 to 800 kg m[sup]- 3) foams, a lightly-crosslinked polyethylene foam and a non-crosslinked polyimide foam. The foam samples were compressed by strains which spanned their linear elastic and stress plateau regimes i. e. by 2. 5...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{demand for}} {{temporary}} buildings has increased {{during the last}} few years. The main reason for this increase is the need for temporary housing. Â This thesis contains the development of a construction solution that locks, joins and seals sandwich panels together in temporary buildings. This solution also explains how to mount, de-mount and re-mount the buildings and was developed in cooperation with the commissioning company Swetech Design AB. Â  The project has been limited to just the horizontal joints of Swetech Design ABÂ´s sandwich panels. Â The panels which the construction solution is going to be applied on have the dimensions of 2703 mm in height, 2297 mm in width and a thickness of 206 mm. The core consists of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> that is laminated with a material that consists of fiberglass and polyester. Â  The pre-study consisted of literature studies of various types of joints, the important properties needed in order to make an airproof construction and the various building requirements for temporary residents. The pre-study also consisted of a visit to the module building company Mobile Composite Solutions (MCS) which helped in acquiring knowledge of mounting big units and the manufacturing technique RTM. Even inventories in different branches were made, to get knowledge around the different possibilities and variations of locking, sealing and joining parts. Â  After the completion of the pre-study a requirements specification and two function analysis where made that put demands and requirements on the concept solution and expressed the concept in terms of functions instead of solutions. The requirements specification and the function analysis became the base of the idea generating phase. This phase resulted in partial solutions and complete solutions which were then combined together to establish different concepts. Through elimination methods, screening tools and discussions together with the commissioning company a final concept was chosen. The concept is built on a tension joint in combination with a sealing profile and a locking device made of an angle steel, bolt and nut which can join and seal the sandwich panels. Â  The concept has been visualized in the form of sketches, CAD-model, a physical model on a cut-out between two sandwich panels in scale 1 : 1, basic drawings and a component list. A proposal for continued work has also been presented in order to assure that the construction meets all the requirements listed in the requirements specification and {{to make it possible for}} the commissioning company to implement the concept...|$|R
