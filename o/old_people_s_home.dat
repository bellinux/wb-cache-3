40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} was to provide {{theoretical}} and empirical knowledge of interactions involved in the encounters between older persons experiencing activity limitations in their home environments and the service organisation related to home modification services, {{in the context of}} one Swedish municipality. A transactional perspective was used, meaning that the focus was on driving forces and relationships connecting different aspects and actors involved in <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>s</b> encounters with the service organisation related to home modification services. Four studies were included in the thesis. Different designs were chosen in the four studies to get a comprehensive understanding of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>s</b> <b>home</b> modification processes. The designs included explorative quantitative design, case study design, longitudinal in-depth interview study and critical discourse study. Findings from all studies were ultimately integrated and analysed, using the concepts of place integration and practical rationalities as theoretical tools for analysis. A general finding from the studies was that the older persons aspiration to create possibilities for action was a strong driving force throughout their home modification processes. An additional general finding was that the strategies used to create possibilities for action were expressions of practical rationalities resulting from relationships between the older persons values and their experienced scopes of action. The findings also demonstrate how the relationship between <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>s</b> practical rationalities and different professionals practical rationalities directed the home modification process through a process of negotiations. A conclusion from this thesis is that an approach that recognises the changing characters of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>s</b> ongoing lives and their interconnectedness to the service organisation is needed to provide home modification services that meet needs satisfactorily and are empowering to older persons experiencing activity limitations in their homes...|$|R

40|$|Background: It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that Bangladesh has a high prevalence of illness among its <b>older</b> <b>people</b> {{and that the government}} healthcare services offer them inadequate support. Despite this, however, information about <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>s</b> health and illnesses as a function of health promotion is scant. Aims: To examine the impact of a health promotion intervention on health in old age; to examine associations between bone and joint diseases and health-related quality of life; and to study associations between social capital and quality of life among <b>older</b> <b>people</b> in rural Bangladesh. Methods: This thesis is compiled based on two intervention studies and two cross-sectional studies. Data for Studies I, III and IV were derived from the Primary Healthcare in Later Life: Improving Services in Bangladesh and Vietnam (PHILL) project. Data for Study II were derived from the Poverty and Health in Aging (PHA) project. The projects were located in one of the 64 districts of Bangladesh and situated 70 kilometers southeast of the capital Dhaka. In the PHILL project, eight villages were selected through simple random selection and all the <b>older</b> <b>people</b> (≥ 60 years) who were residing in the selected villages (n= 1, 135) were chosen for the study. In PHA (n= 850) <b>older</b> <b>people</b> were selected through simple random selection from two purposively selected research blocks. Health promotion interventions in PHILL included physical activity, advice on healthy food intake and other aspects of management. To create an enabling environment, social awareness was provided by means of information about the contribution of and challenges faced by <b>older</b> <b>people</b> at home and in the community, including information about their health and healthcare. The intervention activities were provided to <b>older</b> <b>people</b> themselves, their caregivers, household members, community people, and healthcare providers for a period of 15 months. During analyses, participants in the intervention area were further stratified into compliant (n= 315) and non-compliant (n= 110) groups based on reported compliance with the intervention activities. Arthritis-related illness and bone and joint diseases were indicated by the presence of any form of arthritis, joint and back pain. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using a multi-dimensional generic instrument. Quality of life was assessed using a single global question. Results: Study I revealed that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> who adhered to health promotion activities reported significantly less arthritis-related illness and less healthcare expenditure. Study II showed that bone and joint diseases were significantly associated with various dimensions and overall HRQoL. Furthermore, being an elderly woman and being a woman with self-reported joint and back pain were associated with lower scores in various dimensions of HRQoL. Study III indicated that, in the non-compliant group, the probability of increased HRQoL scores was less likely only in overall HRQoL. In the control group, the probability of increased scores was less likely in the physical, social, spiritual, environment dimensions and overall HRQoL. Study IV revealed that low social capital, both at the individual and community levels, was significantly associated with poor quality of life. Conclusions: This thesis suggests that the provision of community-based health promotion intervention among <b>older</b> <b>people</b> could help to both reduce the burden of arthritis-related illness and its related healthcare expenditure, and improve their health-related quality of life...|$|R

Kiinnostuksen kohteena oli se, millaisia selityksiä, tulkintoja ja merkityksiä ikäihmiset antavat yksinäisyydelle ja toisaalta myös se, miten he puhuvat ja kirjoittavat yksinäisyydestä. Tätä iäkkäiden ihmisten näkökulmasta tarkastelua yksinäisyyttä suhteutettiin mediassa esillä olleeseen yksinäisyyskeskusteluun. Tutkimuksessa tarkasteltiin sitä miten ja millaisena yksinäisyys on esillä kahdessa suomalaisessa lehdessä. Tutkimus osoitti, että yksinäisyys saa tilanteesta ja ympäristöstä riippuen erilaisia merkityksiä ja sitä tulkitaan eri tavoin. Iäkkäät ihmiset itse yhdistivät yksinäisyyden erilaisiin menetyksiin sosiaalisissa suhteissa ja toimintakyvyssä sekä muutoksiin omassa itsessä ja omassa luonteessa. Myös yhteiskunnan kielteisten asenteiden sanottiin aiheuttavan yksinäisyyden tunteita. Lehtiteksteissä yksinäisyyden syiden nähtiin olevan ikäihmisten huonossa yhteiskunnallisessa asemassa, omaisten välinpitämättömyydessä ja yleisissä ikääntymiseen kuuluvissa muutoksissa. Iäkkäät ihmiset puhuivat ja kirjoittivat yksinäisyydestä, samoin kuin lehdissä yksinäisyyttä käsiteltiin monien muiden kielteisenä koettujen asioiden yhteydessä. Ikäihmiset nostivat esille arvottomuuden, turhuuden ja ulkopuolisuuden kokemukset. Myös turvattomuuden tunteet ja masentuneisuus kietoutuivat yksinäisyyteen. Lehdissä yksinäisyyttä tarkasteltiin usein toisen ihmisen näkökulmasta ja siitä kirjoitettiin dramaattiseen sävyyn. Yksinäisyyden kuvaukset olivat voimakkaita ja yhdistyivät ulkopuolisuuden ja erillisyyden kuvauksiin. Yksinäisyyden kokeminen myönteisenä yhdistyi omavalintaisuuteen niin iäkkäiden ihmisten omassa puheessa kuin lehtiteksteissä. Ikäihmiset perustelivat yksinäisyyden myönteisyyttä monin tavoin, eikä myönteisyys näyttänyt olevan selviö. Lehdissä yksinäisyyden kokeminen myönteisenä näytti olevan mahdollista vain taiteellisten ja luovien ihmisten kohdalla. Vaade yksinäisyyden lievittämisestä oli esillä erityisesti lehtiteksteissä. Vaade osoitettiin yhteiskunnalle, omaisille ja iäkkäille ihmisille itselleen. Ehdotetut keinot lievittää yksinäisyyttä paikantuvat sosiaalisen aktiivisuuden lisäämiseen. Sitä vastoin iäkkäät ihmiset itse korostivat yksinäisyyden lievittämisessä sellaisen tekemisen merkitystä, jota voi tehdä yksin. Tutkimus osoitti, että yksinäisyys on hyvin yksityinen ja yksilöllinen kokemus. Yksinäisyys määrittyy kussakin asiayhteydessä ihmisen oman kokemuksen perusteella, eivätkä keinot sen lievittämiseksi voi olla vain yhdenlaisia. Yksinäisyyden kokemus ei kuitenkaan synny tyhjiössä. Siihen vaikuttavat ympäröivän yhteiskunnan yksinäisyydelle antamat merkitykset ja selitykset sekä yhteiskunnallinen tilanne ja ilmapiiri. Lehtikirjoitukset osaltaan muun median kanssa muokkaavat julkisuudessa esillä olevaa kuvaa yksinäisyydestä. Yksinäisyyteen liitetty vahva yhteiskunnallinen ulottuvuus tarjoaa haasteen myös terveydenhuollon ja sosiaalialan toimijoille. The {{loneliness}} of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> {{has often been}} under discussion in the media {{during the last few}} years. In the media, as well as in previous studies, {{it has been suggested that}} loneliness is a very common phenomenon in old age, and therefore its negative effects touch <b>older</b> <b>people</b> widely. When people talk about loneliness, they often also talk about many other negative matters. Living alone, difficulties in getting help and insecurity connected with them, as well as depression, suicides and experiences of rejection have been debated. However, the meanings of loneliness for <b>older</b> <b>people</b> themselves have not been widely discussed in the media or addressed in academic studies. Fairly little is known about how <b>older</b> <b>people</b> themselves describe their loneliness or what kinds of images the media constructs about the {{loneliness of}} <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> The purpose of this study is to provide new information about the interpretations, meanings and explanations that are given to the loneliness of <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> The purpose was to determine how <b>older</b> <b>people</b> themselves describe and explain their loneliness and, on the other hand, what kinds of meanings and interpretations they give to loneliness. Furthermore, the loneliness of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> was examined from the perspective of newspaper and magazine texts. As a whole, the data in this study were fairly diverse. There were three data sets in which loneliness was examined from a personal point of view. Two of them were interviews and the third consisted of texts written by the <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> The first data set comprised interviews with women aged over 90 years, who had never been married, were childless and living alone (N = 24). The interviews focused on discussion about being alone. The second set of interview material was collected from the <b>older</b> <b>people</b> who participated in the group activity aimed at alleviating loneliness (15 women, 5 men). The participants were aged over 75 years, and they lived independently alone in their own homes or with a spouse or a child. The texts of the <b>older</b> <b>people</b> who participated in the groups formed the third data set (N = 90). Loneliness in public discussion was studied by using texts addressing the loneliness of <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> drawn from Helsingin Sanomat and the ET magazine (N = 154). Discourse analytic tools were used in the analysis of the data. Many meanings were connected with loneliness and it was interpreted in different ways depending on the contexts. Older people themselves explained that their loneliness was the result of diminished social relationships and weakening physical ability. Also negative attitudes of society towards <b>older</b> <b>people</b> as well as changes in identity and behaviour with age were interpreted as the causes of loneliness. In the newspaper and magazine texts the causes of loneliness were explained by a lack of human relationship and meaning in life, neglect by relatives as well as the low status of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> in society. Loneliness was also simply described as an inevitable part of ageing. Both in the interviews and texts written by the <b>older</b> <b>people</b> and the newspaper and magazine texts many negative connotations were attributed to loneliness. The elderly people identified loneliness with uneventfulness and with the experience of being an outsider. The lonely person may also have experienced that he/she was unnecessary, useless and worthless after losing his/her place in the community, or more widely in society. Loneliness is also constructed as an issue that causes anxiety: loneliness was connected with depression, feelings of insecurity, and longing for earlier human relationships or unattainable dreams. It seemed that it was difficult to verbalize and describe loneliness, and so different metaphors and quotations were used. The descriptions of loneliness were characterized by some kind of stagnation. Loneliness was often considered from the position of an outsider in the newspaper and magazine texts. The descriptions of loneliness and the meanings that were given to it were often strong and sometimes even dramatic. Loneliness was also connected with experiences of worthlessness, being an outsider and isolation from other people and social activities. Positive loneliness was strongly based on voluntariness in both the <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>s</b> talk and in the media texts. It seemed that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> felt it necessary to justify a positive notion of loneliness in many ways. In the newspaper and magazine texts positive loneliness was permissible only for creative and artistic people. In the newspaper and magazine texts the responsibility for alleviating loneliness was heavily debated and it was delegated to society, relatives and the lonely persons themselves. On the whole, some of the suggestions were fairly naive or perfunctory. In the <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>s</b> own talk or writings, activities which were possible to do alone were mentioned as resources for alleviating loneliness or keeping the feeling of loneliness at bay. However, part of the responsibility for alleviating loneliness was also assigned to society. Based on this study, loneliness is constructed as a context-bound concept with many meanings and interpretations. In different situations and contexts it is interpreted in different ways. Even though loneliness is a highly private and subjective experience, it is not born in a vacuum. It is affected by the surrounding society and the meanings and explanations of loneliness and ageing given by the media. The social situation and atmosphere in society influence how personal loneliness is explained and interpreted...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{the present}} thesis is to {{illuminate}} {{the meaning of the}} patients experiences of acute or planned orthopaedic surgery. The thesis comprises four studies (I-IV) which are all based on data collected from interviews with participants living through acute (I) or planned surgery within an urban region of Sweden (II-IV). The first study (I) The role of interactive affirmation in psychosocial rehabilitation following orthopaedic injuries was conducted in order to conceptualize the process of recovering from injuries. A constant comparative analysis of the transcribed interviews (16) revealed that confirmation of self-identity was important for taking an active role in recovery and rehabilitation. The second study (II) explored <b>older</b> <b>people</b> <b>s</b> experiences of their lived bodies during the perioperative period for hip or a knee replacement. A qualitative longitudinal study was conducted. Audio taped interviews were carried out with 12 <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> on five different occasions during the perioperative period. The data was analysed using a latent qualitative content analysis. The perioperative period of a hip or knee replacement can be regarded as a process of transition, which includes six critical phases. Although the recipients of care were at a new starting point, they struggled to regain a physical state where they were in charge and control of their lives. The third (III) study, In the hands of formal carers: older patients experiences of care across the perioperative period for hip and knee replacement was aimed to highlight the meaning of care provided by formal carers in relation to a replacement intervention of the hip or knee. A phenomenological hermeneutical approach was selected to capture the patients experiences (12) from the time they were placed on the waiting list until one year after the operation (5 interviews/person). Initially, the operation itself was regarded as the key for reaching the goal of a good self-ruling every-day life. The findings indicate that provision of care characterized by continuous guidance from formal carers with expert knowledge of care and replacement interventions across the entire perioperative period was desired. The fourth study (IV) focuses on twelve patients contemplations related to the hip or the knee replacement operation. A phenomenological hermeneutical approach was chosen in order to illuminate the meaning of contemplations related to the hip and knee replacement intervention (5 interviews/person). The findings indicate that the operation was a thorough life event including contemplations about life and death and about hope and fear. The overall conclusions of the thesis were living through the perioperative period for an acute or planned orthopaedic surgical intervention as a transition in life including different phases. Across the period the need of autonomy, continuity and mutual relationship with formal carers emerged within the phenomenon living through the perioperative period for acute or planned orthopaedic surgery. To support individuals across this period a perioperative education for the patients could be of importance. To know what the operation realistically will bring about, and about the care offered for support across the perioperative period with accessible guidance by competent formal carers appears to be significant information for the patients...|$|R

On the basis of in-depth interviews gathered in Southern California, this study compares and contrasts the experiences of Latina transnational mothers and Latino transnational fathers. The findings show that the mothers face greater challenges due to cultural gender ideologies about women s and men s roles and attitudes that continue to see women s migration as less socially acceptable than men s migration. The study reveals that the transnational mothers tend to be single parents, and hence they rely on alternative childrearing arrangements. In contrast, transnational fathers, whose migration is seen as a fulfillment of the provider role, rely on female spouses back home to care for their children and to assist in the cultivation of father/child bonds. The study also addresses how the gendered, unregulated paid work immigrant women perform in the U.

The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to find out who supports <b>older</b> <b>people</b> at home after discharge from hospital and if sources of support have changed between the 1980 s and the 1990 s. Background. More and more <b>older</b> <b>people</b> are being discharged from hospital earlier and this creates additional pressures on families, community health and social services and the independent care sector. The research was concerned with how sources of support may have changed in a 10 -year period. Methods. A comparison is made of two separate nonrandom samples, taken 10 years apart, of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> following discharge from hospital. Interviews were conducted in participants' homes to establish levels of dependence and the source of support given in response to the need for help with personal and domestic activities of daily living. Results. Although limited by the use of relatively small, nonrandom samples, the research found that proportions needing help with domestic activities were higher than those needing help with personal activities of daily living. Although dependence for help with bathing had declined between the 1980 s and 1990 s, help was still needed with bathing and dressing. Unmet need for help with bathing remained a problem in the 1990 s. A growing role for home helps was identified, especially in personal care (bathing and dressing), where support from district nurses had declined. By the 1990 <b>s,</b> <b>home</b> helps were doing less cooking and housework, including heavy laundry. Relatives were doing more of most domestic activities except shopping, which was being carried out by home helps. Conclusions. The paper concludes by arguing that hospitals should consider if pressures to discharge <b>older</b> <b>people</b> more quickly might hinder the discharge planning process and communication between hospital and community sectors...|$|R

In the current study, we investigate {{the extent to which}} national variation in perceptions of <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> competence is systematically related to national variation in the extent to which <b>older</b> <b>people</b> participate in paid and volunteer work. METHOD: We used multilevel regression to analyze data from the European Social Survey and test the relationship between perceptions of <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> competence and <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> participation in paid and volunteer work across 28 countries. We controlled for a number of potentially confounding variables, including life expectancy as well as the gender ratio and average education of the older population in each country. We controlled for the average objective cognitive abilities of the older population in a subsample of 11 countries. RESULTS: Older people were {{perceived as}} more competent in countries in which more <b>older</b> <b>people</b> participated in paid or volunteer work, independent of life expectancy and the average education, gender makeup, and average cognitive abilities of the older population.

However, health seeking behaviour of Thai <b>older</b> <b>people</b> is not well documented. This qualitative study aimed to describe health seeking behaviour of overweight hypertensive <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> Seven <b>older</b> women and three men participated in this study through purposive sampling. Qualitative data were gathered via in-depth interviews and were analyzed using content analysis. The results of this study illustrated that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> started to seek health care after understanding the need to seek health care due to the severity of their symptoms. The <b>older</b> <b>people</b> began illness management by using their knowledge to take care of themselves. If management was ineffective, they would seek health care from professional health care providers and traditional healers. Additionally, family members play important roles in the health seeking behaviour of <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> In particular, Thai <b>older</b> <b>people</b> with hypertension and overweight demonstrate various health seeking behaviours that are useful to health care providers in providing appropriate care to these <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> aiming to promote better health of the <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research which {{explores the}} importance and feasibility of involving <b>older</b> <b>people</b> as equal partners in the creative design of digital devices for an ageing population. In exploring this topic, I have carried out two preliminary studies, a pilot study and a major empirical study. Firstly, I invited three groups of <b>people,</b> including very <b>old</b> <b>people,</b> active <b>older</b> <b>people</b> and postgraduate students, to evaluate a mock-­‐up model of an interactive device intended for <b>older</b> <b>people</b> that was designed using a standard design process. The {{results of this study}} suggested that products without an adequate contribution from <b>older</b> <b>people</b> would not always meet their needs. Secondly, I carried out observations of very <b>old</b> <b>people,</b> active <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> and young designers to identify factors that influence the way in which both <b>older</b> <b>people</b> and young designers can be involved in the creative design process. These factors included experiences with technology, processes and approaches currently applied with <b>older</b> <b>people</b> and designers, factors that stimulate or inhibit creativity, and practical constraints such as health issues. The results of these observations fed into the design of a pilot study, where I tested the content of a creative design process and a procedure for analysing data for the main empirical study. The main study involved three creative workshops where the same creative methods were employed with different sets of people: young designers, mixed groups (with <b>older</b> <b>people</b> and designers) and <b>older</b> <b>people</b> only. The results show that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> are able to participate in a creative design process; however, certain practical constraints have to be taken into account. Also, <b>older</b> <b>people</b> perform better when they work together with designers. Finally, the mixed groups with <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> who have relevant life experiences, and designers, who are familiar with the newest technology, may be more suitable for designing appropriate products for the older population.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve primary care for community-dwelling <b>older</b> <b>people</b> in the Netherlands. First, by {{studying}} the effectiveness of multifactorial care on health and daily functioning of community-dwelling <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> second by exploring {{the value of the}} multifactorial care by investigating experiences of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> with this nurse-led multifactorial care, and third by assessing per capita healthcare costs of <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> We evaluated the effects of nurse-led multifactorial care in a cluster randomized controlled trial. 11 practices (n= 1, 209 participants) were randomized to the intervention group, 13 practices (n= 1, 074 participants) were randomized to the control group. We found no evidence that a one-year individualized multifactorial intervention program with nurse-led care coordination resulted in prevention or postponement of new disabilities in community-dwelling <b>older</b> <b>people</b> at increased risk of functional decline. One explanation might be that by conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment many geriatric conditions were detected, yet resulted in low recognition rates of these geriatric conditions by <b>older</b> <b>people</b> themselves. Nevertheless, <b>older</b> <b>people</b> appreciated nurse-led multifactorial care, especially because of the feeling of being looked after. Hospitalization costs were the most important contributor to the overall healthcare costs of <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> Especially <b>older</b> <b>people</b> who encounter functional decline had the highest healthcare costs. Further studies should focus on shared decision making and collaboration with <b>older</b> <b>people</b> to improve overall quality of care...|$|R

By {{becoming}} aware of culturally influenced attitudes about <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> and how these attitudes are reflected in the ways <b>older</b> <b>people</b> are viewed, treated, and cared for in society, the healthcare profession can better understand how to provide high-quality care. By applying an ethnographic approach in textual reality, this paper explores how newspaper articles focusing on health portray <b>older</b> <b>people</b> in society, using Finland as an example. The data consist of articles selected from three of the main Finnish daily newspapers during a 3 -month period in the spring of 2012. The findings show that, overall, the society regards <b>older</b> <b>people</b> and their care as important. However, there were suggestions of paternalistic attitudes towards <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> Furthermore, the perceptions regarding different groups of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> could lead to the possibility of inequality.

However, these studies do not take into account intra-household distribution of wealth and income. Since, in many households, resources are directed away from <b>older</b> <b>people</b> and towards children and those of working age, such studies should not be interpreted as providing evidence that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> themselves are better-off than the general population.
