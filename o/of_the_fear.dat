5|$|The PlayStation 3 port {{received}} less favorable reviews {{than the other}} two versions, but still had positive reviews overall. It contained a different longer bonus mission than the one included in the Xbox 360 port, but the chief complaints of the negative reviewers were downgraded graphics and long loading times. GameSpot has given the port a 7.1, making it the third lowest rating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>F.E.A.R.</b> franchise in GameSpot.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Rooster Teeth Productions created P.A.N.I.C.S. or PANICS, {{an acronym}} for People Acting Normal In Crazy-Ass Situations, is a comic science fiction series based on F.E.A.R. The series was {{produced}} primarily by using the machinima technique of synchronizing video footage from video games to pre-recorded dialogue and other audio. The series was produced {{at the request of}} Monolith Productions {{as a part of a}} tie-in with the Director's Edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>F.E.A.R.,</b> which the Rooster Teeth team used to produce the series. The mini-series consists of five episodes. Four of these have been released on the Rooster Teeth website, and one — episode 0, a prequel — originally shipped exclusively with the F.E.A.R. Director's Edition DVD. It is also included with the game's digital release on GOG.com.|$|E
5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The Iroquois {{signed the}} Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands {{south of the}} Ohio to the British. European {{expansion}} into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others. These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. Settlers {{had to deal with}} harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.|$|E

However, if one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> became so dominant within a person that it eclipsed <b>the</b> other <b>fears,</b> <b>the</b> person was mentally unhealthy. Each fear thereby came with its own type <b>of</b> disorder: when <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> love was dominant, Riemann spoke of schizoid people; when it was <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loneliness, he spoke of depressed persons; fear of change corresponded with obsessive characteristics; and fear of constancy brought out [...] "hysterical" [...] personalities.|$|R
