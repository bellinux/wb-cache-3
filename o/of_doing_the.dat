5|$|Massaro was a {{contestant}} on CBS's , {{which was}} the fifteenth season of the show, in 2007. Massaro approached the WWE with the idea <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> show, and after going through the casting process, she found out she made the show ten days before {{she had to leave}} for China to film. Prior to the experience, Massaro had never been camping before, so to train for the show she had to get used to being outside. She was assigned to the Zhan Hu tribe in the first episode and quickly began quarreling with fellow contestant Dave Cruser. In the second episode, Massaro was voted off after six days with a 6–1 vote.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed <b>of</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>The</b> inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E

After Lisa's hair was {{revealed to be}} green, Zara and Abby accuse Steph <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> hair wrong on purpose and make her leave the house claiming she was jealous of Lisa's good looks, Steph was devastated about losing her friends. An oblivious Steph did not realised that she is being stalked by serial killer, Toby Mills (Henry Luxemburg). It {{was part of a}} storyline that had been running in the background for while. He attacked her, and proceeds by stabbing her in the head and leaving her to die. Steph was then found unconscious and she woke up a week later in hospital where she was diagnosed with epilepsy. Steph {{was the only one of}} Toby's victim to survive an attack.|$|E

Indeed, two of the Great Western Railway’s earliest broad-gauge locomotives, North Star and Lord of the Isles, which had been set aside at Swindon Works, were cut up in 1906 for lack of space and several other relics were similarly lost in subsequent years.|$|E
25|$|The {{frame was}} made by {{electroplating}} gold onto the inside of an epoxy resin cast. B.J.S. Electroplating Co., a precious-metal electroformers, was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to make a fibreglass-reinforced polyester mould of a wax model of the coronet that Louis Osman had made using a wooden template. From this mould a negative epoxy resin cast was produced. B.J.S. involved Engelhard Industries {{to assist in the}} electroforming of the cast. David Mason was Head of Research at Engelhard and was assigned the task <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> electroforming at the company's headquarters in the Forest of Dean. Until then, electroforming an object of that size had never been attempted anywhere in the world, {{and it was the first}} crown to be made in this way.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only were}} the weapons of German tanks improving, so was their armour. Soviet firing tests against a {{captured}} Tiger I heavy tank in April 1943 showed that the T-34's 76mm gun could not penetrate {{the front of the}} Tiger I at all, and the side only at very close range. A Soviet 85mm antiaircraft gun, the 52-K, was found capable <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> job, and so derivatives of it were developed for tanks. The resulting tank gun could penetrate the side armour of the Tiger I from a distance of 800 meters and the turret side from a distance of 600 meters. It was still not enough to match the Tiger, as a Tiger could destroy the T-34 from a distance of 1,500 to 2,000 meters, but it was a noticeable improvement.|$|E
40|$|In {{the test}} {{period of the}} Weir {{constructed}} in the estuary of Nagara River in 1994, the block of salt water in the upstream region of the Weir and <b>the</b> drop <b>of</b> <b>DO</b> in <b>the</b> bottom layer were observed. The necessity to research for these problems was pointed out. Investigation on the open channel flow was mainly conducting on its physical feature until now. The study {{on the quality of}} water was disregarding. Especially, our knowledge on DO in open channel flow is poor. Therefore, the object of this investigation is to examine <b>the</b> mixing <b>of</b> <b>DO</b> in <b>the</b> flow with the abrupt drop experimentally. The used experimental flume is made by acryl resin with the length 6 m and the width 15 cm. Increasing the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>DO,</b> <b>the</b> experiments are conducted to use the water which make <b>the</b> <b>DO</b> decrease to about 50 % <b>DO</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water in the ordinary temperature by using the Sodium Sulfite.

Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, [...] "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers...
