40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{illuminate}} the importance of assumptions made regarding boundary and initial conditions on the predicted performance of regional <b>ozone</b> <b>control</b> strategies. A computationally efficient approach to depicting the response of an air basin to emission controls is developed. The problem of ozone isopleth generation is addressed using a large Eulerian grid-based photochemical airshed model that is distributed over a grid system of 64 different ROG and NO_x control combination points that were run simultaneously on a parallel computer. This method is used for the Los Angeles area to examine the effect on predicted ozone concentrations of alternative assumptions about how boundary conditions at the edge of the air basin will change as a result of changed recirculation of pollutants from within the airshed plus emission decreases upwind. We show that an accurate forecast of the effect of future emission control programs on pollutant inflows across the boundaries of the Los Angeles modeling region is absolutely critical to selection of a successful <b>ozone</b> <b>control</b> strategy for the Los Angeles area...|$|E

In order to evaluate the effects of ozone oxidative preconditioning on carbon tetrachloride-mediated hepatotoxicity, the following experimental protocol was designed: group 1 (negative control, sunflower oil i. p.); group 2 (CCl 4 in sunflower oil, 1 ml kg− 1 i. p.); group 3 (15 ozone–oxygen pretreatments at a dose of 1 mg kg− 1 via rectal insufflation Y CCl 4 as in group 2); group 4 (<b>ozone</b> <b>control</b> group, 15 ozone–oxygen pretreatments Y sunflower oil i. p.). Ozone pretreatment prevented glycogen depletion (as demonstrated by biochemical and histopathological findings) and avoided lactate overproduction associated with the hepatotoxic effects of CCl 4. The administration of CCl 4 increased lipid peroxidation (as measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and uric acid levels and inhibited superoxide dismutase activity. All these deleterious effects induced by CCl 4 were prevented by ozone pretreatment.

The mission has the following four major objectives: 1) Track the ozone layer to determine if it is recovering as predicted. The four Aura instruments, HIRDLS, OMI, MLS, and TES will measure ozone, key source, radical, reservoir, tracer gases, and aerosols. Aura's unique design allows for major <b>ozone</b> <b>controlling</b> gases to be measured within the same air mass within a few minutes.

Major pollution sources include urban, industrial and biomass burning regions. Tropospheric trace gases will be measured, using TES and OMI, at an average spatial resolution of about approximately 15 km with near global coverage. 3) Measure key upper tropospheric atmospheric constituents that influence climate. The Aura instruments will monitor O 3, H 2 O, CO, cirrus ice, and aerosols.

Non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), as key precursors of ozone, were found to be the limiting factor in photochemical ozone formation for large areas in the PRD. For source apportioning of NMHCs as well as <b>ozone</b> pollution <b>control</b> strategies, it is necessary to obtain typical seasonal and diurnal patterns of NMHCs with a large pool of field data. To date, few studies have focused on seasonal and diurnal variations of NMHCs in urban areas of Guangzhou.

The diurnal variations of most anthropogenic NMHCs typically showed two-peak pattern with one at 8 : 00 in the morning and another at 20 : 00 in the evening, both corresponding to traffic rush hours in Guangzhou, whereas isoprene displayed a different bimodal diurnal curve.

Oak trees (Quercus) emit an order of magnitude more isoprene than most other emitting tree species, and are by far the largest source of biogenic isoprene in the eastern US. We used Landsat TM data to measure oak tree abundance near Oak Ridge. Tennessee, to estimate fluxes of isoprene. The Landsat classification was performed using multi-date data: supervised classification techniques, and an iterative approach. Training sites were selected based on transect data, and ten vegetation classes were mapped. A supervised classification algorithm called the Spectral Angle Mapper was used to classify the data. Empirical vegetation emission data were used to estimate the isoprene flux from each of the vegetation classes. The resultant isoprene flux maps were compared with concentrations measured in the field, and a good correspondence was observed. We also compare the Landsat classification with three other landcover schemes including the USGS’s Global Landcover Classification, which is based on AVHRR data.
