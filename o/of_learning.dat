5|$|Certain types <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> are possible, {{respective}} to each applicable type <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> {{only within}} a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E

40|$|The utility {{problem in}} speedup {{learning}} describes a common behavior <b>of</b> machine <b>learning</b> methods: the eventual degradation of performance due to increasing amounts <b>of</b> <b>learned</b> knowledge. The shape <b>of</b> the <b>learning</b> curve (cost <b>of</b> using a <b>learning</b> method vs. {{number of training}} examples) over several domains suggests a parameterized model relating performance to the amount <b>of</b> <b>learned</b> knowledge and a mechanism to limit the amount <b>of</b> <b>learned</b> knowledge for optimal performance. Many recent approaches to avoiding the utility problem in speedup learning rely on sophisticated utility measures and significant numbers of training data to accurately estimate the utility of control knowledge. Empirical results presented here and elsewhere indicate that a simple selection strategy of retaining all control rules derived from a training problem explanation quickly defines an efficient set of control knowledge from few training problems. This simple selection strategy provides a low-cost alternative to exa [...] ...|$|R
