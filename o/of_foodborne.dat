25|$|A main aim of {{this study}} was to compare if {{foodborne}} illness incidence had increased over time. In this study, similar methods of assessment were applied to data from circa 2000, which showed that the rate <b>of</b> <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis had not changed significantly over time. Two key estimates were the total number of gastroenteritis episodes each year, and the proportion considered foodborne. In circa 2010, it was estimated that 25% of all episodes of gastroenteritis were foodborne. By applying this proportion of episodes due to food to the incidence of gastroenteritis circa 2000, there were an estimated 4.3 million (90% CrI: 2.2–7.3 million) episodes <b>of</b> <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis circa 2000, although credible intervals overlap with 2010. Taking into account changes in population size, applying these equivalent methods suggests a 17% decrease in the rate <b>of</b> <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis between 2000 and 2010, with considerable overlap of the 90% credible intervals.|$|E

40|$|Data from {{population-based}} {{studies and}} national surveillance systems were collated and analyzed {{to estimate the}} impact of disease and risks associated with eating different foods in England and Wales. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 1, 724, 315 cases <b>of</b> indigenous <b>foodborne</b> disease per year resulted in 21, 997 hospitalizations and 687 deaths. The greatest impact on the healthcare sector arose from foodborne Campylobacter infection (160, 788 primary care visits and 15, 918 hospitalizations), while salmonellosis caused the most deaths (209). The most important cause <b>of</b> indigenous <b>foodborne</b> disease was contaminated chicken (398, 420 cases, risk [cases/million servings] = 111; case-fatality rate [deaths/ 100, 000 cases] = 35, deaths = 141). Red meat (beef, lamb, and pork) contributed heavily to deaths, despite lower levels of risk (287, 485 cases, risk = 24, case-fatality rate = 57, deaths = 164).

25|$|If {{irradiation}} was {{to become}} common in the food handling process {{there would be a}} reduction of the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>foodborne</b> illness and potentially the eradication of specific pathogens. However, multiple studies suggest that an increased rate of pathogen growth may occur when irradiated food is cross-contaminated with a pathogen, as the competing spoilage organisms are no longer present.

25|$|The largest {{recorded}} outbreak <b>of</b> <b>foodborne</b> botulism in the United Kingdom {{occurred in}} June 1989. A total of 27 patients were affected; one patient died.

Control measures included the cessation of all yogurt production by the implicated producer, the withdrawal of the firm's yogurts from sale, the recall of cans of the hazelnut conserve, and advice to the general public to avoid the consumption of all hazelnut yogurts.|$|E
25|$|In produce, {{microorganisms}} {{attach to}} the surfaces and biofilms develop internally. During the washing process, biofilms resist sanitization and allow bacteria to spread across the produce. This problem {{is also found in}} ready to eat foods because the foods go through limited cleaning procedures before consumption Due to the perishability of dairy products and limitations in cleaning procedures, resulting in the buildup of bacteria, dairy is susceptible to biofilm formation and contamination. The bacteria can spoil the products more readily and contaminated products pose a health risk to consumers. One bacteria that can be found in various industries and is a major cause <b>of</b> <b>foodborne</b> disease is Salmonella. Large amounts of salmonella contamination {{can be found in the}} poultry processing industry as about 50% of salmonella strains can produce biofilms on poultry farms. Salmonella increases the risk <b>of</b> <b>foodborne</b> illnesses when the poultry products are not cleaned and cooked correctly. Salmonella is also found in the seafood industry where biofilms form from seafood borne pathogens on the seafood itself as well as in water. Shrimp products are commonly affected by salmonella because of unhygienic processing and handling techniques The preparation practices of shrimp and other seafood products can allow for bacteria buildup on the products.|$|E

25|$|The main causes were Norovirus, {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp., {{although the}} causes of approximately 80% of illnesses were unknown. Approximately 25% (90% CrI: 13%–42%) of the 15.9 million episodes of gastroenteritis that occur in Australia were estimated to be transmitted by contaminated food. This equates {{to an average of}} approximately one episode <b>of</b> <b>foodborne</b> gastroenteritis every five years per person. Data on the number of hospitalisations and deaths represent the occurrence of serious foodborne illness. Including gastroenteritis, non-gastroenteritis and sequelae, there were an estimated annual 31,920 (90% CrI: 29,500–35,500) hospitalisations due to foodborne illness and 86 (90% CrI: 70–105) deaths due to foodborne illness circa 2010. This study concludes that these rates are similar to recent estimates in the US and Canada.|$|E
