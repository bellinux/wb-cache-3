Its major application limits are all in situations in which {{the real estate market}} doesn’t offer a sufficient number <b>of</b> <b>comparables</b> to implement statistical tools. In low-transaction real estate markets, the most effective appraisal method is the market comparison approach (MCA). The application limits of MCA depend on the degree of similarity between the properties’ characteristics and the reliability of the prices <b>of</b> <b>comparables.</b> In this paper, we introduce some rational measurements in order to guarantee a scientific approach to MCA is associated with the correct prices.

5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns <b>of</b> <b>comparable</b> size.|$|E
