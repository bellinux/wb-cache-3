5|$|The {{sources for}} this war are mostly of Byzantine origin. Foremost among the {{contemporary}} Greek texts is the Chronicon Paschale by an unidentified author from around 630. George of Pisidia wrote many poems and other works that were contemporary. Theophylact Simocatta has surviving letters {{along with a}} history that gives the political outlook of the Byzantines, but that history <b>only</b> <b>really</b> covers from 582 to 602. Theodore the Synkellos has a surviving speech, which was made during the Siege of Constantinople in 626, that contains useful information for some events. There are some surviving papyri from Egypt from that period.|$|E
5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these <b>only</b> <b>really</b> mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Artillery had {{available}} a {{total of}} 676 howitzers and field guns: 310 Krupp 75mm field guns, partly produced in licence; 52 105mm Bofors howitzers, the <b>only</b> <b>really</b> modern pieces; 144 obsolete Krupp 125mm guns; 40 150mm sFH13's; 72 Krupp 150mm L/24 howitzers and 28 Vickers 152mm L/15 howitzers. As antitank-guns 386 Böhler 47mm L/39s were available, which were effective weapons but too few in number, being only at {{a third of the}} planned strength; another three hundred antiquated 6 Veld (57mm) and 8 Staal (84mm) field guns performed the same role for the covering forces. Only eight of the 120 modern 105mm pieces ordered from Germany had been delivered {{at the time of the}} invasion. Most artillery was horse-drawn.|$|E

25|$|The centre <b>only</b> <b>really</b> {{came under}} larger {{development}} {{when it was}} purchased by the Universities Superannuation Scheme group in 1990. Thenceforth, a refurbishment program was undertaken, including the addition of large roof windows, which admitted more light into the centre. USS also created the Sherwood Square area and added the popular Frog Clock.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{included}} in the 1996 and 1999 World Cup squads, he <b>only</b> <b>really</b> established himself in the team in the 1999–2000 Carlton and United Series along {{with the emergence of}} his younger brother, fast bowler Brett Lee.

25|$|The bowling {{was less}} successful. In a hot and dry summer, Burtt bowled {{almost twice as}} many overs as anyone else on the touring side, and took 128 wickets {{at an average of}} 22.88. No other bowler managed more than the 62 of Cresswell, though Wisden {{reckoned}} Cowie, whose 59 wickets cost 27 runs each, was the <b>only</b> <b>really</b> menacing bowler in the side. Burtt and Cowie were the only successes at Test level, and in both cases their average runs per wicket was over 30.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Sasha Sokolov:It seems he was <b>only</b> <b>really</b> {{appreciated}} by professionals. Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally. I can {{understand the value of}} his texts, but I don't understand how they were made.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptians overran most of Syria and its {{hinterland}} with ease. The {{strongest and}} <b>only</b> <b>really</b> significant resistance {{was put up}} at {{the port city of}} Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege, which lasted from 3 November 1831 to 27 May 1832. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically {{during the course of the}} siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden.|$|E

25|$|Heine now had {{to search}} for a job. He was <b>only</b> <b>really</b> suited to writing but it was {{extremely}} difficult to be a professional writer in Germany. The market for literary works was small and it was only possible to make a living by writing virtually non-stop. Heine was incapable of doing this so he never had enough money to cover his expenses. Before finding work, Heine visited the North Sea resort of Norderney which inspired the free verse poems of his cycle Die Nordsee.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} areas of Edinburgh, Corstorphine escaped {{widespread}} industrialisation in the nineteenth century. It <b>only</b> <b>really</b> started to become absorbed into the Edinburgh urban area within the mid-twentieth century. But even before then, there was a changeover into a middle-class dormitory area for Edinburgh workers. By the late twentieth century, Corstorphine had an ageing demographic. In 1961, Queen Margaret College (now QMU) obtained land up {{on the edge of}} Corstorphine next to Clermiston, and set up a campus there. This was closed in 2007, when they moved all their facilities out to Musselburgh.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, Yardley played {{regularly}} in that county's second eleven {{for two years}} before making his first-class debut against Nottinghamshire in August 1967; he made 3 and 4. Despite one further appearance that season, his first-class career <b>only</b> <b>really</b> took off in 1968, when he was a fixture in the first team from late July onwards, despite a modest top score of 43 not out from his 17 innings. 1969 was another mediocre season, but in 1970 Yardley really came good, making 762 first-class runs and averaging over 40.|$|E

25|$|Dunedin {{was linked}} to Christchurch by rail in 1878, with a link south to Invercargill {{completed}} the following year, and the first railway workshops were opened at Hillside in South Dunedin in 1875. Early plans were for a grand main station on Cumberland Street, but these did not get further than the laying of a foundation, and a simple temporary weatherboard station was built next to the site in 1884. It took close to 20 years for government funding to be allocated, and planning <b>only</b> <b>really</b> commenced as the 19th century was drawing to a close.|$|E
25|$|David Denton (4 July 1874 – 16 February 1950) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer. An attacking batsman, {{he had a}} {{long career}} with Yorkshire and played eleven Tests for England. His nickname of 'Lucky' came from his habit of surviving the numerous chances, that his attacking batting style naturally created for the opposition. He was a fine deep fielder, and was said to be an excellent judge of a high catch, but did little bowling: his <b>only</b> <b>really</b> significant contribution with the ball came in 1896, when he took 5–42 against South of England. He also had one first-class stumping to his name, against Cambridge University in 1905.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down. Barristers once enjoyed {{a monopoly on}} appearances before the higher courts, but in Great Britain this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are <b>only</b> <b>really</b> trained for advocacy, {{are not prepared to}} provide general advice to members of the public.|$|E
