At that time, she got underway to participate in some amphibious exercises conducted nearby during the third week in April. Barnstable County visited Washington, D.C., in May; and, early in June, she made two short cruises to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and back to Little Creek while serving as a training platform for NROTC midshipmen. The ship remained in port during July, but, in the first part August, she took up midshipman training once more with a voyage back to Halifax, this time by way of New York City. Refresher training occupied her during the rest of August and the first week in September and then she underwent two successive availabilities in preparation for <b>overseas</b> <b>assignment</b> at the beginning of 1976. That maintenance work ended late in October, and Barnstable County resumed local training operations out of Little Creek in November. Early in December, a board of inspection and survey visited the ship, and she carried out her last underway period of the year on the 8th and the 9th in conjunction with that inspection.|$|E

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of Chinese multinationals, increasingly large number of Chinese expatriates work overseas. However, {{little research has been}} conducted to investigate Chinese expatriates’ adjustment to <b>overseas</b> <b>assignments.</b> Drawing on prior studies in the areas of linguistics, communication, and business, the current study examines the impact of the English-language proficiency on the Chinese expatriates’ adjustment to <b>overseas</b> <b>assignments.</b> A Chinese multinational in the information technology industry, Company ABC, was selected as a subject company. Quantitative research method was adopted. The quantitative data were collected through a survey of 190 Chinese expatriates from Company ABC. Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient was performed to examine the relationships between English-language proficiency and variables related to the Chinese Expatriates’ Adjustment to <b>Overseas</b> <b>Assignments.</b> The findings show that English-language proficiency was found to enhance Chinese expatriates’ adjustment moderately. Moreover, further analysis indicates that different type of English-language proficiency affects different aspect of Chinese expatriates’ adjustment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{researcher}} uses a qualitative research design {{to discover what}} makes hotel expatriates remain in their <b>overseas</b> <b>assignments.</b> In-depth interviews, participant observations, and personal documents are used as data collection methods. Four hotel expatriates are recruited as participants of the study. The collected interview transcripts and fieldnotes are further analyzed {{through the use of}} grounded theory. Five selective codes found as the dominant themes in this study are hotel expatriates ’: (a) personality characteristics, (b) motivations to work overseas, (c) challenges derived from <b>overseas</b> <b>assignments,</b> (d) competencies, and (e) roles/identities in <b>overseas</b> <b>assignments.</b> These five main themes are further analyzed and concluded with a coherent theory that explains why hotel expatriates remain in their assignments.

500|$|In 1867, {{the high}} command {{decided to send}} Delphin back to the Mediterranean. She {{was sent to the}} Königliche Werft in Danzig for a {{reconstruction}} that would make the vessel more suitable for an extended <b>overseas</b> <b>assignment.</b> This included replacing old or damaged hull timbers, installing a new deck, and rebuilding the crew spaces to make them more habitable. On 1 May 1868, Delphin was finally recommissioned for her assignment, but conflicts in the Reichstag (Diet of the Realm) over budgets forced the navy to cancel Delphins deployment to save money. Accordingly, she was placed out of service temporarily. In August, Delphin was recommissioned and on the 21st, began the voyage to the Mediterranean. While en route, damage to her engine forced her to stop in Algiers for repairs. She finally reached Constantinople on 17 October, and on 24 October she steamed to the mouth of the Danube at Sulina. She steamed about [...] upstream to the town of Giurgiu before returning to Constantinople. She made a similar trip up the Danube in 1869, and also stopped in Varna, Bulgaria {{on the way back to}} Constantinople.|$|E
500|$|Major General Wilhelm D. Styer, the Chief of Staff of the Army Service Forces, {{decided that}} Marshall would be {{replaced}} by Nichols. Marshall {{would be replaced}} given an overseas posting. He was informed by Nichols on June; to him it seemed he was [...] "getting fired", although he had previously {{expressed a desire to}} Groves for just such an <b>overseas</b> <b>assignment.</b> Indeed, when first assigned to the project, both Nichols and Groves had also have expressed a preference for an overseas combat assignment. Nichols had [...] "liked working for him and was happy to have him as a buffer between Groves and myself", because Groves was [...] "abrasive and often very critical". Marshall asked Nichols to transfer his secretary, Virginia Olsson, to Oak Ridge when the Manhattan District headquarters moved there, leaving Nichols's own secretary, Anne Phillips, in the New York office. [...] "This concern for personnel", Nichols noted, [...] "was typical of Marshall". Since the Manhattan District had been officially created on 13 August 1942, Marshall chose to formally leave on 13 August 1943, so that he had held the job for exactly one year.|$|E

Application of the model to Nigeria leads the authors to predict that short-term <b>overseas</b> <b>assignments</b> in that country should be very stimulating and professionally rewarding. The authors then overview their actual assignments in Nigeria and share with readers their assessment of those experiences. The paper concludes {{with a discussion of}} the implications of the model and the experiences in Nigeria. I...|$|R

Partially as a result of this, Superman was killed in Superman #75 instead, dying in Lois' arms after a battle royal with the monster Doomsday. After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark's former college girlfriend, the mermaid Lori Lemaris). Lois eventually decided to take an <b>overseas</b> <b>assignment</b> to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her.

2500|$|Upon Franklins {{arrival in}} New York, a long-brewing {{controversy}} over the ship's crew's conduct during her struggles finally came to a head. Captain Gehres had accused {{many of those who}} had left the ship on 19 March 1945 of desertion, despite the fact that those who had jumped into the water to escape had done so to prevent a likely death by fire, or had been led to believe that [...] "abandon ship" [...] had been ordered. While en route from Ulithi Atoll to Hawaii, Gehres had proclaimed 704 members of the crew to be members of the [...] "Big Ben 704 Club" [...] for having stayed with the heavily damaged warship, but investigators in New York discovered that only about 400 were actually onboard Franklin continuously. The others had been brought back on board either before or during the stop at Ulithi. All of the charges against the men of her crew were quietly dropped. Captain Gehres retired as a Rear Admiral, never taking an <b>overseas</b> <b>assignment</b> or command of another US Navy ship again.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, the tax-free {{allowances}} paid during <b>overseas</b> <b>assignments</b> (especially {{the housing}} allowances) are {{generally considered to}} be an incentive to serve overseas, as they can be quite generous. While this situation may be advantageous to some personnel during their <b>assignment</b> <b>overseas,</b> these tax-free allowances are not considered to be part of one's salary, therefore they are not counted when computing a civil service annuity at retirement. CONUS locality adjustments, however, are counted when computing annuities.|$|R
