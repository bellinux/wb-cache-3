5|$|The loop {{was created}} in 1974 when I-196 was {{completed}} {{south of the city}} <b>of</b> <b>Holland.</b> From that point, the old route of M-21 inside the cities to US31 was redesignated as a business loop of I-196 with the state taking control of Washington Avenue to the downtown area. Then from downtown looping back up to Chicago Drive, the business loop used the old M-21. Along Washington Avenue and Chicago Drive between junctions with US31, the highway bore a concurrent Bus. US31 designation. The concurrent trunkline inside the downtown area <b>of</b> <b>Holland</b> was transferred to the City <b>of</b> <b>Holland</b> in 2005, and BL I-196 was rerouted to follow US31. In 2016, the section of the business loop that runs concurrently with US31 was designated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.|$|E

5|$|On {{the south}} side <b>of</b> <b>Holland,</b> US31 and I-196 {{separate}} as the Interstate turns northeasterly around the city to continue to Grand Rapids. US31 follows the BL I-196 freeway northward into Holland around {{the north side of}} the West Michigan Regional Airport. The business loop has an interchange for A-2 (Blue Star Highway) and Washington Avenue before the freeway ends in the southern reaches <b>of</b> <b>Holland.</b> The trunkline then runs as a divided highway northward, bypassing downtown Holland to the east and intersecting M-40. Northeast of downtown Holland, BL I-196 leaves US31 and the LMCT at an interchange to follow an expressway along the route of Chicago Drive while US31 turns northwesterly on its own expressway alignment.|$|E

5|$|It is {{distinguished}} by its position against the French absolute monarchy, support for religious tolerance, including for Jansenism, support for democratic reforms {{such as the}} introduction of parliaments, support for the American independence and the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791. The newspaper preferred to praise the changes in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) more than those in France, criticizing {{the violence of the}} French Revolution, and contrasting it with the peaceful transformation in Poland. This relative lack of support for the French Revolution may explain why the paper was abolished on 23 April 1798, three years after the invasion of the Netherlands by France and the Batavian Revolution. It reappeared as the Nouvelles politiques publiées à Leyde in October, but it was seen as no longer independent. Under a new name—Journal politique publié à Leyde—it lasted from 1804 until 1811, but it never regained its audience and its quality, and disappeared after the annexation <b>of</b> <b>Holland</b> by the French Empire. A new Leyden Gazette briefly appeared after the liberation <b>of</b> <b>Holland</b> in 1814.|$|E
