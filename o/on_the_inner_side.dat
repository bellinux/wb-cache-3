5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side</b> of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter. The ears mostly lack hair and {{end in a}} rounded tip. The tragus (a projection <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side</b> of the outer ear) is thin {{for most of its}} length, ends in an angular tip, and has a flange at the medial side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E

5|$|The slender teeth had {{slightly}} curved crowns, {{which were}} oval in cross-section. The {{teeth in the}} lower jaw may have been 20–30% smaller {{than those in the}} upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical. Under each active tooth there was a column of nine replacement teeth within the jaw. With 68 columns in the upper jaws and 60 columns in the lower jaws, these so-called dental batteries (also present in hadrosaurs and ceratopsians) comprised a total of more than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually.

5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side</b> of the outer ear, is long and reaches {{to the middle of}} the ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus aelleni is a small, brown Miniopterus species. The head may be {{slightly}} lighter in color than the body. Some {{hairs on the}} underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus griveaudi is similar in color, but M.manavi is darker and M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis are lighter. The tragus (a projection <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side</b> of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, the base is narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, {{the sides of the}} tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus brachytragos is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with short}} and {{relatively}} thin fur. The fur of the upperparts is dark brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus mahafaliensis is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side</b> of the outer ear) is short and has a broad base, sometimes with a crest at the side. It ends in a pointed to slightly rounded tip, which is covered with hairs that are not readily visible to the unaided eye. The short tragus easily distinguishes M.brachytragos from other Malagasy Miniopterus. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium {{are attached to the}} upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side.

5|$|Oryzomys antillarum was a {{medium-sized}} rodent, about {{as large as}} O.couesi. According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side</b> and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered {{because they had been}} preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris natator, for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.|$|E

5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side</b> of the outer ear) is about half {{as long as the}} ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens.

Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E
5|$|The incisors {{are large}} and ungrooved. Their enamel is orange, but paler on the lowers. The {{orientation}} of the upper incisors is opisthodont, with the cutting edge oriented backwards. The molars are brachydont (low-crowned) and have two rows of main cusps separated by deep valleys and complemented by a network of crests and smaller cusps. The first upper molar is broader than in T.talamancae. As in this species, but unlike in many other rice rats, including H.alfaroi, the mesoflexus on the second upper molar, which separates the paracone (one of the main cusps) from the mesoloph (an accessory crest), is not divided in two by an enamel bridge. The hypoflexid on the second lower molar, the main valley between the cusps, is very long, extending more than halfway across the tooth; in this trait, it is similar to T.talamancae but unlike H.alfaroi. Each of the upper molars has three roots (two on the outer and one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side)</b> {{and each of the}} lowers has two (one at the front and another at the back).|$|E

5|$|The moat was {{situated}} {{at a distance}} of about 20m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20m wide and as much as 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side,</b> serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top {{so as not to be}} used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.|$|E

The eastern, southeastern and southern sides were fronted by a ditch of some , with the excavated soil dumped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side</b> and used to elevate the city wall. A small citadel was located in the southwestern corner of the town. The port was separated from the main town by a wall, and was situated in an excavated basin (today a swamp) and probably separated from the sea by an artificial mole and protected by extensions of the city walls. The entrance to the harbour was from the west, offering protection from both the wind and the coast's shoals.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a {{medium-sized}} species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish brown to gray. It is larger and darker than Paratriaenops auritus and P.furculus.

The extinct Triaenops goodmani, which is known only from three mandibles (lower jaws), is also larger. In the complexly shaped noseleaf (a group of fleshy structures around the nose and mouth), T.menamena has the trident structure characteristic of Triaenops and Paratriaenops: three adjacent lancets (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In T.menamena, the two outer lancets are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three lancets are more equal in Paratriaenops. The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal process and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process. The ears are small and broad and contain notches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>side.</b> The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6mm long. The wing membrane is dark and translucent {{and the end of}} the tail usually projects from the uropatagium (tail membrane). Males average slightly larger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305mm (10.6 to 12.0in).|$|E
