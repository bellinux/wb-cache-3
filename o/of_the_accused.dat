Only one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused,</b> Alice Grey, was found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether {{invocation of}} Miranda rights could be implied from the behavior or ambiguous words <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused.</b> It concluded (in line with previous {{cases such as}} Davis v. United States) that there was good reason why invoking these rights should require an unambiguous act <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused,</b> including certainty for police, prosecutors, and accused, and social benefit in law enforcement.|$|E
50|$|A {{conviction}} may {{be reversed}} if, in <b>the</b> discretion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court, <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> {{was not given}} an adequate time to prepare a defense, and this was material in depriving <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> a fair trial.|$|R

5|$|Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> women, Laing and Nicholas Lawson, were imprisoned {{again in}} 1708–1709 after charges of {{witchcraft}} were levelled against them by Cowper and another local minister. They were released in April 1709 and pardoned after Queen Anne issued an Act of Indemnity. Another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> women, Janet Horseburgh, sued the bailies {{responsible for her}} incarceration; she received an apology and monetary recompense.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{were cleared}} by Phips' proclamations, leading Stoughton to storm from the court. His {{replacement}} {{on the court}} was more inclined to mercy for the accused.

5|$|In 2008, the Supreme Court of India {{directed}} {{that the}} case be transferred from police investigation to a committee appointed by the court, the Special Investigation Team, because the police {{had become one of}} the riot cases. The team was led by ex-Central Bureau of Investigation director R. K. Raghavan, and the case was the sixth Gujarat riots case assigned to them for investigation. Taking into account the findings about telephone records of various activists, Kodnani and other major leaders were included in the report for the first time. The Special Investigation Team's findings added 24 more names to the 46 people arrested by the police. Before the trial began, 6 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> died. In 2009 the trial started, during which three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> died, thus the final report covered 61 people.|$|E

The event that seems to have triggered Nowell's investigation, culminating in the Pendle witch trials, occurred on 21 March 1612.|$|E
5|$|Police {{continued}} to arrest homosexuals in large numbers, routinely bringing paddy wagons to gay bars and arresting their patrons. Charges were usually dismissed but those arrested often lost their anonymity when newspapers printed their names, addresses and places of employment. Officers also notified the employer and family <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused,</b> causing serious damage to their reputations.|$|E
5|$|Police {{discovered}} {{a number of}} articles in the Scorpio used to kidnap the couple—parts of Babli's anklet, two buttons from Manoj's shirt, and torn photographs of the couple. Manoj's purse was found on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Court {{makes it}} a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner.

5|$|A {{consensus}} formed {{within the}} European diplomatic community in Constantinople that the persecution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> Jews {{had to be}} stopped. This opinion was held not only by Lord Ponsonby, but also by von Stürmer, whose correspondence revealed {{that he was not}} at all convinced of the innocence of the Jews; by the French ambassador Edouard Pontois, whose government stood by the French consuls who supported blood libels in Rhodes and Damascus; and by the Prussian ambassador Hans von Königsmark. Consequently, the way was open for Lord Ponsonby, by far the most powerful diplomat in Constantinople, to intervene unopposed on behalf the Jews of Rhodes.|$|E
50|$|During high-publicity court cases, {{the media}} are often accused of {{provoking}} an atmosphere of public hysteria akin to a lynch mob which not only makes a fair trial nearly impossible but means that regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> {{will not be able}} to live <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> their life without intense public scrutiny.|$|R

5|$|A {{group of}} judges, {{including}} Efraín Rivera Pérez, a former {{judge of the}} Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and Héctor Laffitte, former federal judge, expressed themselves {{in favor of the}} amendments. Also, former two-time Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department, Pedro Toledo, expressed himself in favor of the amendments. He added that some guidelines could be needed to allow judges to define the issue of the dangerousness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{sometimes}} gruesome testimony {{it was generally}} believed the hearings were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, both {{of whom had been}} acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused</b> gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the hearings. A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable.|$|E

5|$|Each man was {{subsequently}} released August 10 on $3,000 bail. The charge of murder was later amended to manslaughter by {{the grand jury}} indictment. The trial was convened November 26 under Judge Harding, with the widow of Patrick Langan, one of those slain on August 1, named as prosecutor. Of the 20 subpoenaed by the prosecution to {{bear witness to the}} peaceful nature of the protest, only six appeared to testify. Three admitted to seeing violence committed by the mob prior to the shooting. Many more testified on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused.</b>|$|E
5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that {{there ought to be a}} political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused,</b> the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E
5|$|The four {{civilians were}} tried on December 13. The {{principal}} prosecution witness, a servant of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>accused,</b> made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. In {{the face of}} this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.|$|E
