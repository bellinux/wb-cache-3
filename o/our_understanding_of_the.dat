5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental to <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse {{under the influence of}} gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E

5|$|Archeological {{data from}} the Late Pleistocene in South Asia is vital for <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{evolution}} of modern human behavior and how early humans spread through the Old World. In prehistoric times, the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over the continental shelf shared between the two countries, which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. Being only around 70 m deep, significant reductions in sea level due to climate change, in at least the past 500,000 years, periodically caused the continental shelf to be exposed, forming a land bridge approximately 100km wide and 50km long.|$|E

Other smaller storms and eddies were found throughout the banded clouds (see animation on the right). Two new, small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, were discovered orbiting just outside the ring, making them the first of Jupiter's moons to be identified by a spacecraft. Athird new satellite, Thebe, was discovered between the orbits of Amalthea andIo.|$|E

25|$|The {{chronology}} of this era is particularly uncertain due to difficulties in <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text, <b>our</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material {{culture of the}} Early Dynastic period and {{a general lack of}} radiocarbon dates for sites in Iraq. Also, the multitude of city-states made for a confusing situation, as each had its own history. The Sumerian king list is one record of the political history of the period. It starts with mythological figures with improbably long reigns, but later rulers have been authenticated with archaeological evidence. The first of these is Enmebaragesi of Kish, c. 2600 BC, said by the king list to have subjected neighboring Elam. However, one complication of the Sumerian king list is that although dynasties are listed in sequential order, some of them actually ruled at the same time over different areas.|$|E
