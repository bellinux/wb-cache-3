5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E

40|$|This {{resource}} sheet examines expenditure {{related to}} child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect {{that is made}} by departments responsible for child protection services in Australia. It finds that the direct economic costs <b>of</b> child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect are substantial. The additional costs associated with long-term effects <b>of</b> child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect make the prevention <b>of</b> child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect a priority. More importantly, the prevention <b>of</b> child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect is a critical priority because of the social costs <b>of</b> child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect and the imperative to prevent children from experiencing its devastating effects.
