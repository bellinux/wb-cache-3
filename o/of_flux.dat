5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E
5|$|As {{had been}} the case at Northwestern, Notre Dame's {{football}} program {{was in a state}} <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> when Parseghian arrived. While Notre Dame built a proud history under Rockne and Frank Leahy, its two most successful coaches, the late 1950s and early 1960s had been a disaster. The team had finished 5–5 in 1962 under Joe Kuharich, who lost the confidence of his players and Notre Dame's administrators during his four years as coach. Kuharich's surprise departure {{at the end of that}} season to become supervisor of officials in the National Football League, a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, left the program in disarray. Devore, a long-time Notre Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963. Notre Dame managed only a 2–7 finish that year.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) <b>of</b> <b>flux.</b> Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride.

5|$|On July7, the typhoon {{entered the}} Philippine area of Responsibility and was {{assigned}} the local name Falcon. Chan-hom's eye briefly improved in structure before entering a state <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> and collapsing later that day; convection {{on the northern}} side of the storm diminished simultaneously. The 65km (40mi) wide eye soon re-established itself and slowly contracted to a diameter of 40km (25mi) by July8. A large storm, gale-force winds extended 445km (275mi) from Chan-hom's center on July9. Late on July9 into July10, Chan-hom passed between the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Miyako-jima. The typhoon reached its peak strength during this time with estimated winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg). Featuring multiple intense feeder bands and a well-defined 27km (17mi) eye, the JTWC assessed Chan-hom to have peaked as a Category4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with one-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (140mph).|$|E

5|$|Owing in part {{to their}} vast size, abyssal plains are {{believed}} to be major reservoirs of biodiversity.

5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer <b>of</b> <b>flux.</b> This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

5|$|When flux tubes {{loaded with}} the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere, they go through a {{reconnection}} process, which separates the magnetic field from the plasma. The former returns to the inner magnetosphere in the form <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma, while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail {{in the form of}} plasmoids—large blobs of plasma. The reconnection processes may correspond to the global reconfiguration events also observed by the Galileo probe, which occurred regularly every 2–3 days. The reconfiguration events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic field strength and direction, as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma, which often stopped co-rotating and began flowing outward. They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere. The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind.|$|E

5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} {{itself around}} Ravenshoe, Queensland, {{the next three}} months was a period <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> for the battalion, with many men taking leave or being discharged due to tropical diseases or injuries from the previous campaign. The battalion was brought up to strength with a large draft of volunteers from the 11th Motor Regiment, a motorised Militia light horse unit consisting largely of Queenslanders and New South Welshmen. A period of rest and reorganisation followed during which the units of the 2nd AIF were converted to the Jungle Division establishment. After this, large scale divisional manoeuvres took place in mid-July, after which the battalion received orders to sail for overseas again. Embarking upon the transport Canberra from Townsville, they arrived in Port Moresby in early August. After a period in which the 18th Brigade was held back in reserve at Port Moresby to defend the approaches to Lae, in December 1943 the 2/10th was sent into the Finisterre Mountains, where they joined the rest of the 7th Division whose campaign through the Markham and Ramu Valleys had culminated in heavy fighting around Shaggy Ridge during the first months of 1944. This proved to be the most significant action for the 2/10th and in May 1944 they withdrawn to Australia, being transported home on the Duntroon.|$|E

On September 2010, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums - Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive - notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band would discuss the prospect of new material, but with uncertainty. Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and that single one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material was in a state <b>of</b> <b>flux,</b> some being accepted by Keenan as potential A Perfect Circle material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.|$|E

After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} structure, {{the early months}} of the battalion's {{existence}} was a period <b>of</b> <b>flux.</b> The early 2nd AIF infantry battalions were established with a structure that was unique to the Australian Army; however, shortly after formation it was decided that they would adopt the British Army battalion structure. Thus, by December 1940, the 2/9th had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel and consisted of four rifle companies (each consisting of three platoons with three sections), a battalion headquarters, a support company, and a headquarters company consisting of six platoons performing specialist roles including signals, mortar, and anti-tank. The four rifle companies were designated 'A' through to 'D'. The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 9th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were black over light blue, in a horizontal rectangular shape, although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included the old cruiser , Bahias sister , the eight new destroyers of the Pará class.

These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's torpedoes. These could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.|$|E
