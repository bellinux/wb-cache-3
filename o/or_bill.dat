5|$|In 1775, Carl Linnaeus was {{the first}} to scientifically {{describe}} a halfbeak, Esox brasiliensis. In 1775 Peter Forsskål described two more species as Esox, Esox far and Esox marginatus. It was not until 1816 that Georges Cuvier created the genus Hemiramphus; from then on, all three were classified as Hemiramphus. In 1859, Gill erected Hemiramphidae, deriving its name from Hemiramphus, the family's type genus. The name comes from the Greek hemi, meaning half, and rhamphos, meaning beak <b>or</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head <b>or</b> <b>bill</b> shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
5|$|To {{become law}} <b>or</b> <b>bill,</b> a {{constitutional}} amendment {{had to have the}} assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could veto the annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E

5|$|The Latchkey is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The premise of the plot focuses on two businessmen who are friends Will (<b>or</b> <b>Bill</b> in some publications) and John. Will gives John {{the key to his}} apartment so he had stay there while Will goes on vacation. The landlady of the house leases the apartment to two ladies. John decides to go to Will's apartment and lets himself in with the key and finds the two girls asleep. They awake and take him for a burglar and threaten to kill him and John pleads for mercy instead of addressing the misunderstanding. John is later revealed to be her employer after he is caught opening a safe in the office the next morning. The film was released on August 26, 1910 and was met with positive reviews by the trade publications. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

The legislation provides that {{the name of a}} famous musical group cannot be used by a group of performers unless they include at least one member of the original group. The intent of the legislation is to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices, and to protect the livelihood of musicians who were in famous musical groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the Senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion <b>or</b> <b>bill</b> on the same {{legislative}} day. A legislative day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment; hence, {{it does not necessarily}} coincide with the calendar day. The length of these speeches is not limited by the rules; thus, in most cases, senators may speak {{for as long as they}} please. Often, the Senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits. In other cases (for example, for the budget process), limits are imposed by statute. However, the right to unlimited debate is generally preserved.|$|E
25|$|Wager of law was a {{possible}} defense, {{at least in}} certain cases of detinue sur trover. Wager of law was a complicated medieval legal procedure which was used when other forms of proof were lacking. It involved the bringing forth of witnesses who would swear under oath, to God that the facts alleged in the writ <b>or</b> <b>bill</b> of complaint were true. Lacking such witnesses, the action would fail. This was locked into the old methods of proof, which were in turn, tied to the old forms of action. The records show a certain hardening of the courts toward this defense in the mid-fourteenth century. Wager of law was not used in debt on a covenant. Wager of law was abolished by statute in 1833. Prosser describes trover and wager of law in this way: Trover, as it developed, had certain definite procedural advantages over the older forms of action, {{not the least of}} which was that it avoided wager of law, a form of licensed perjury which made detinue singularly unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant.|$|E

Two more new compositions were attempted: [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" [...] and [...] "One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)". Dylan was satisfied with [...] "One of Us Must Know"; the January 25 take was released as a single {{a few weeks later}} and was subsequently selected for the album.|$|E
500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They thought I was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank <b>or</b> <b>Bill</b> picking it up. We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E
50|$|Section 57 also {{provides}} that, following the election, if the Senate {{a third time}} rejects the <b>bill</b> <b>or</b> <b>bills</b> that were {{the subject of the}} double dissolution, the Governor-General may convene a joint sitting of the two houses to consider the <b>bill</b> <b>or</b> <b>bills,</b> including any amendments which have been previously proposed in either house, or any new amendments. If a bill is passed by an absolute majority of the total membership of the joint sitting, it is treated {{as though it had been}} passed separately by both houses, and is presented for royal assent. The only time this procedure was invoked was in the 1974 joint sitting.|$|R

500|$|A solid backfield {{anchored}} by Zach Zwinak, {{a trio of}} established tight ends plus a promising newcomer, and a veteran offensive line highlighted the projected success offensively, while a new coordinator (John Butler), a [...] "borderline All-American" [...] linebacker (Glenn Carson), and lots of potential both on the defensive line and in the secondary, the latter of which was [...] "dramatically improved", highlighted projected progress defensively. Also, a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed, which provided intrigue entering the season. For Penn State to achieve success, they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions. SBNation.com asserted, [...] "If either Hackenberg or Ferguson gets hurt, {{and the other one}} stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak <b>or</b> <b>Bill</b> Belton (who missed four games last year) gets hurt ... if basically any linemen get hurt (and linemen often get hurt) ... this house of cards comes tumbling down." [...] ESPN.com reporter Josh Moyer wrote, [...] "In short, like last year, PSU {{is a bit of a}} wild card. If it receives strong efforts from its quarterback and the front seven, it should surpass last year's record. If it doesn't, it might be fortunate to get to seven wins." ...|$|E
500|$|Accounts {{note that}} King Richard fought bravely and ably during this manoeuvre, unhorsing Sir John Cheyne, a {{well-known}} jousting champion, killing Henry's standard bearer Sir William Brandon and coming within a sword's length of Henry Tudor before {{being surrounded by}} Sir William Stanley's men and killed. The Burgundian chronicler Jean Molinet says that a Welshman struck the death-blow with a halberd while Richard's horse was stuck in the marshy ground. It was said that the blows were so violent that the king's helmet was driven into his skull. The contemporary Welsh poet Guto'r Glyn implies a leading Welsh Lancastrian Rhys ap Thomas, {{or one of his}} men, killed the king, writing that he [...] "killed the boar, shaved his head". The identification in 2013 of King Richard's body shows that the skeleton had 11 wounds, eight of them to the skull, clearly inflicted in battle and suggesting he had lost his helmet. Professor Guy Rutty, from the University of Leicester, said: [...] "The most likely injuries to have caused the king's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull—a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon, such as a halberd <b>or</b> <b>bill,</b> and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon." [...] The skull showed that a blade had hacked away part of the rear of the skull. Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle.|$|E
