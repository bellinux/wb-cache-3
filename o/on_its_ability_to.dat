5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} depends <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods {{that allow them}} to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{turn of the}} 16th and 17th centuries brought changes that, for {{the time}} being, {{weakened}} the Commonwealth's powerful neighbors (The Tsardom of Russia, The Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire). The resulting opportunity for the Polish–Lithuanian state to improve its position depended <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> overcome internal distractions, such as the isolationist and pacifist tendencies that prevailed among the szlachta ruling class, or the rivalry between nobility leaders and elected kings, often intent on circumventing restrictions on their authority, such as the Henrician Articles.|$|E
40|$|Projects {{are carried}} out by {{temporary}} organizations. These organizations can function independently or in cooperation with stationary organizations. To enable efficient project and program management, these differences in organization structure have to be considered. This paper therefore contrasts organizations formed to carry out activities at project sited based on forms of employment, work processes and resource networks used. Findings indicate that temporary organizations that are dominated by stationary “parent” organizations often rely <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> secure access to crucial resources and to identify suitable work processes. “Pure” or virtually “pure” temporary organizations instead rely on their employees’ skills and contacts to develop suitable routines and gain access to resources...|$|R

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the British economy {{depended}} <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{trade with}} the British Empire, particularly the valuable colonies in British India. The intercontinental trade was conducted by the governors of India, the Honourable East India Company (HEIC), using their fleet of large, well-armed merchant vessels known as East Indiamen. These ships were of between 500 and 1200 nominal tons burthen (bm) and could carry up to 36 guns for defence against pirates, privateers and small warships. They were not, however, capable under normal circumstances of fighting off an enemy frigate or ship of the line. Their guns were usually of inferior design, and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship. The East Indiamen sought {{to ensure the safety}} of their cargo and passengers, not defeat enemy warships in battle. Despite these disadvantages, the size of East Indiamen meant that from a distance they appeared quite similar to a small ship of the line, a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon. At the Bali Strait Incident of 28 January 1797 an unescorted convoy of East Indiamen had used this similarity to intimidate a powerful French frigate squadron into withdrawing without a fight. In February 1799 an attack by a combined French-Spanish squadron on the assembled convoy at Macau was driven off in the Macau Incident without combat by the small Royal Navy escort squadron.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reviewed}} {{the development of}} bioretention systems with a focus <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> control phosphorus in stormwater. Bioretention systems takes {{full advantage of the}} matrix-microbes-plant system with simultaneous removal of organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, total suspended solids (TSS), heavy metal, and pathogens. But phosphorus removal has been found inconsistent in bioretention systems, which can be observed phosphorus leaching in some systems. The phosphorus forms in stormwater, the distribution and transfer pathways of phosphorus in bioretention system need to be figured out and simulated in order to solve the phosphorus leaching. Some new matrix materials, such as aluminum-based water treatment residual, were also employed to adsorb and trap the phosphorus in stormwater. The latest study progress and further research needs of bioretention systems were summarized...|$|R

25|$|From a {{practical}} standpoint, knowing {{how the system}} responds to a sudden input is important because large and possibly fast deviations from the long term steady state may have extreme effects on the component itself and on other portions of the overall system dependent on this component. In addition, the overall system cannot act until the component's output settles down to some vicinity of its final state, delaying the overall system response. Formally, knowing the step response of a dynamical system gives information on the stability of such a system, and <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> reach one stationary state when starting from another.|$|E
25|$|The SLA {{believed}} that its future depended <b>on</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> acquire new members and realized that, {{because of the}} killing of Marcus Foster, few if any people in the Bay Area underground wished to join them. Cinque suggested moving the organization to his former neighborhood in Los Angeles, where he had friends whom they might recruit. However, they relocated in a sloppy manner and had much difficulty in becoming established on their new turf. The SLA relied on commandeering housing and supplies in Los Angeles, and thus alienated {{the people who were}} ensuring their secrecy and protection. At this stage, the imprisoned SLA member Russell Little said that he believed the SLA had entirely lost sight of its goals and had entered into a confrontation with the police rather than a political dialogue with the public.|$|E

40|$|Reading online poses {{a number}} of {{technological}} challenges. Advances in technology such as touch screens, light-weight high-power computers, and bi-stable displays have periodically renewed interest in online reading over the last twenty years, only to see that interest decline to a small early-adopter community. The recent release of the Kindle by Amazon is another attempt to create an online reading device. Has publicity surrounding Kindle and other such devices has reached critical mass {{to allow them to}} penetrate the consumer market successfully, or will we see a decline in interest {{over the next couple of}} years echoing the lifecycle of Softbook ™ and Rocket eBook ™ devices that preceded them?
