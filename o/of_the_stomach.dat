5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} to the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, {{which is on the}} pleotelson.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Capsaicin-sensitive afferents {{have been}} implicated in <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> visceral {{sensorimotor}} functions. AIM: To study <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> capsaicin on <b>the</b> sensorimotor function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal <b>stomach</b> in humans. METHODS: In 10 healthy subjects, a gastric barostat was used to study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> saline or capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce on the sensitivity to gastric distension and on gastric accommodation to a meal. RESULTS: <b>The</b> administration <b>of</b> capsaicin {{was accompanied by a}} relaxation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal <b>stomach.</b> After capsaicin, <b>the</b> compliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal <b>stomach</b> was increased and higher perception scores were reached for the same distending pressures. Dosing with capsaicin significantly decreased the pressures and corresponding wall tensions at the discomfort threshold. Gastric accommodation to a meal was not altered by capsaicin. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> acute administration <b>of</b> capsaicin decreases proximal gastric tone, inhibits phasic contractility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximal <b>stomach</b> and increases sensitivity to proximal gastric distension. These data suggest <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> vanilloid receptor 1 in <b>the</b> modulation <b>of</b> gastric sensorimotor function in humans. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{earliest}} cases of rumination {{was that of}} a physician in the nineteenth century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who acquired the condition as the result of experiments upon himself.

As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E
