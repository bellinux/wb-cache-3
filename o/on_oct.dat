Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his Inuit friend Tookoolito. He seemed to improve for a few days, and was even able to go up on deck. Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him.

25|$|A second {{attempt on}} Sinyavino was being {{prepared}} to start <b>on</b> <b>Oct.</b> 20, but was pre-empted by the German offensive towards Tikhvin <b>on</b> <b>Oct.</b> 16, which intended to encircle 54th Army {{on the way}} to cutting all possible supply routes to Leningrad and linking up with the Finnish Army.
