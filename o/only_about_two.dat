5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E
25|$|The Prussian {{system was}} put into effect in the 1830s. However, they were highly {{dependent}} on good weather and daylight to work and even then could accommodate <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> words per minute. The last commercial semaphore link ceased operation in Sweden in 1880. As of 1895, France still operated coastal commercial semaphore telegraph stations, for ship-to-shore communication.|$|E

25|$|In November 2004, in a rematch, Hill lost to Sodrel by a razor-thin {{margin of}} about 1,500 votes (about {{a half of}} a {{percentage}} point). There was a recount following reports of voting irregularities, namely malfunctioning voting machines {{in at least three}} counties. Hill gained <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> dozen votes in the recount, however, and conceded the election in early December 2004.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} side, the 4.5 inch gun {{was criticized for}} {{insufficient}} power of its high-explosive shell. The shell was produced from low grade ("19 ton") steel, which necessitated thick walls. As a result, it carried <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> kg of TNT or substitute, in fact less than the 105 mm high-explosive shell. Additionally, {{it was felt that}} having a small number of guns of atypical caliber unnecessarily complicated logistics.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the musicians}} who joined Ellington at this time created a {{sensation}} in their own right. The short-lived Jimmy Blanton transformed the use of double bass in jazz, allowing it {{to function as a}} solo/melodic instrument rather than a rhythm instrument alone. Terminal illness forced him to leave by late 1941 after <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> years. Ben Webster, the Orchestra's first regular tenor saxophonist, whose main tenure with Ellington spanned 1939 to 1943, started a rivalry with Johnny Hodges as the Orchestra's foremost voice in the sax section.|$|E

25|$|O'Keeffe {{accepted}} an offer by Mabel Dodge {{to come to}} New Mexico for the summer. Stieglitz took advantage of her time away to begin photographing Norman, and he began teaching her {{the technical aspects of}} printing as well. When Norman had a second child she missed <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> months before returning to the gallery on a regular basis.

25|$|The virus {{replicates}} {{in those}} bone marrow cells, which disrupts {{the development and}} replication of leukocytes (white blood cells), eosinophils, and basophils. Because of this, thrombocytopenia could also a potential result. Erythrocytes, which are enucleated red blood cells, seem to be infected while they are erythroblasts, their nucleated precursor stage. The virus stays in these red blood cells without harming it for up to four months. Here, it is protected from the immune system's attacks. Antibody to the virus is found <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> weeks after symptoms begin to show, but the virus can still be found in blood cells for about six weeks.|$|E
25|$|The one {{exception}} to the supposed 'look but don't touch'-policy was the so-named boat no. 10, which was slowly appearing due to apparent soil erosion. For five days, archaeologists carefully examined the midsection of the ship. They uncovered wooden planks, disintegrated rope, and reed bundles. Wood-eating ants had reduced much of the ship's hull to frass (ant excrement), but the frass had retained {{the shape of the}} original hull. The midsection of this boat revealed the construction methods used and confirmed the oldest ‘planked’ constructed boat yet discovered. The boat's construction revealed it had been constructed from the outside in, as there was no internal frame. Averaging 75ft long and 7–10ft wide at their greatest width, these boats were <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> feet deep, with narrow prows and sterns. Several boats were white-plastered, as were the Abydos tombs, and no. 10 was painted yellow.|$|E

25|$|Since 1980, China's energy {{production}} has grown dramatically, {{as has the}} proportion allocated to domestic consumption. Some 80 percent of all power is generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at hydroelectric installations; <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> percent is from nuclear energy, mainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang. Though China has rich overall energy potential, most {{have yet to be}} developed. In addition, the geographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively far from their major industrial users. Basically the northeast is rich in coal and oil, the central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has immense hydroelectric potential. But the industrialized regions around Guangzhou and the Lower Yangtze region around Shanghai have too little energy, while there is relatively little heavy industry located near major energy resource areas other than {{in the southern part of}} the northeast.|$|E

500|$|In February 1932, after <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> {{weeks of}} {{experimentation}} with neutrons, Chadwick {{sent a letter}} to Nature titled [...] "Possible Existence of a Neutron". He communicated his findings in detail in an article sent to Proceedings of the Royal Society A titled [...] "The Existence of a Neutron" [...] in May. His discovery of the neutron was a milestone in understanding the nucleus. Reading Chadwick's paper, Robert Bacher and Edward Condon realised that anomalies in the then-current theory, like the spin of nitrogen, would be resolved if the neutron has a spin of 1/2 and that a nitrogen nucleus consisted of seven protons and seven neutrons.|$|E
500|$|The Southern Scenic Route links Fiordland and Dunedin via the Catlins. Here it runs {{northeast}} to southwest as {{an alternative}} road to State Highway 1, which skirts the Catlins to the northwest. This section of the Southern Scenic Route—formerly designated State Highway 92 but no longer listed as a state highway—winds {{through most of the}} small settlements in the area, and was only completely sealed during the late 1990s (a stretch of about [...] southwest of Tautuku was surfaced with gravel prior to that time). The settlements of Owaka, Maclennan, Papatowai, Tokanui, and Fortrose all lie on this route. A coastal route also parallels the inland highway between Waikawa and Fortrose, but <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> thirds of this road is sealed.|$|E
500|$|The {{first phase}} of the case took three years, mainly in {{preparation}} for trial. During the trial, Boldt heard testimony from about fifty witnesses and admitted 350 exhibits. The evidence showed that the state had shut down many sites used by Indians for net fishing while allowing commercial net fishing elsewhere on the same run. At most, the tribes took <b>only</b> <b>about</b> <b>two</b> percent (2%) of the total harvest. There was no evidence presented by the state that showed any detrimental actions by Indians toward the harvest. Both expert testimony and cultural testimony was presented, with tribal members relating the oral history dealing with the treaties and fishing rights. Additionally, Boldt found that the tribe's witnesses were more credible than those of the state, finding that the tribe's expert witnesses were [...] "exceptionally well researched".|$|E
