5|$|Near Benton, Fishing Creek's pH {{ranges from}} around 5.6 to 7.25, while near Bloomsburg, {{a wider range}} has been recorded, from 5.8 to 8.5. Near Camp Lavigne, it ranges from 5.5 to 7.1. East Branch Fishing Creek is the only stream in the {{watershed}} whose pH drops below 5.5; it can fall as low as 4.9. West Creek and Coles Creek are the least acidic streams in the watershed, with pH levels usually above 6.3 and often above 7. Typically, the creek and its tributaries are not at risk of becoming too acidic for the optimal health of fish, but in early spring during snowmelts, the levels approach the limit that brook trout can tolerate.

The present research, presents a methodology for estimating the happening <b>of</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rains</b> using satellite imagery of water vapor and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2). Initially, the proposed methodology applies k-means clustering method followed by Haar wavelet transform in order to compute normality for water vapor and NO 2 satellite imagery.

50|$|An early {{example of}} an {{emission}} trading system has been the sulfur dioxide (SO2) trading system under the framework <b>of</b> the <b>Acid</b> <b>Rain</b> Program <b>of</b> the 1990 Clean Air Act in the U.S. Under the program, which is essentially a cap-and-trade emissions trading system, SO2 emissions were reduced by 50% from 1980 levels by 2007. Some experts argue that the cap-and-trade system of SO2 emissions reduction has reduced the cost <b>of</b> controlling <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> {{by as much as}} 80% versus source-by-source reduction. The SO2 program was challenged in 2004, which set in motion a series of events that led to the 2011 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR).
