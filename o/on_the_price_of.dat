5|$|The {{measures}} of taxation in {{the reign of}} Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.|$|E
5|$|The {{market was}} also the {{location}} for public punishment of wrongdoers, and stocks and a pillory were set at a prominent position at {{the eastern end of}} the Guildhall. The stocks were used for the punishment of relatively minor offences such as breaching the regulations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> bread, public brawling or incivility to the Mayor; wrongdoers would on occasion also be paraded around the market wearing paper hats bearing details of their offence. The pillory was used for more serious offences such as sedition. On at least two occasions in the late 16th century people convicted of sedition were nailed to the pillory by their ears; on completion of their time on the pillory their ears were cut off. Public whippings of criminals were also conducted in the marketplace. Although not all executions in the period are recorded, it is known that public hangings also took place in the market square and around the market cross.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E

We apply this method to provide an ex post evaluation of two almost simultaneous mergers in the Hungarian retail gasoline market. We show that both mergers resulted in a significantly positive but economically negligible price effect, but while the first merger affected only <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> buyer firm's stations, the second had an effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> seller's stations and of its competitors.

40|$|The global {{development}} of biofuel has been accelerating {{in the last}} few years. However, with the expansion of first generation biofuel (grain based), its impacts on food price, food security and environment start to loom, and have drawed many debates.
