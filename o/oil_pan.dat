5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and <b>oil</b> <b>pan.</b> The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
5|$|Once steel {{supplies}} {{had been}} agreed, an initial tranche of $35 million in funding {{was provided by}} the government Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which owned and manage the operation of the pipelines through its subsidiary organizations, the Defense Plants and the Defense Supplies corporations. In turn, the actual construction and operation of the pipelines would be carried out by the War Emergency Pipelines company (WEP), a non-profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest oil companies in the United States: Atlantic Refining, Cities Service Oil, Consolidated Oil, Gulf <b>Oil,</b> <b>Pan</b> American Petroleum and Transportation, Standard Oil, Tidewater Associated Oil, Shell Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil, Sun Oil and the Texas Pipe Line Company. The WEP was led by W. Alton Jones and Burt Hull, both with extensive backgrounds in the industry, with Oscar Wolfe as its chief engineer. The company established its offices in Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|The Arrow Sport F was {{specifically}} built {{to accommodate the}} low-cost, yet heavy Arrow F V-8 engine, an aircraft modification of the Ford V-8. The engine was designed by Ford Engineer David E. Anderson with an aluminum <b>oil</b> <b>pan,</b> aluminum cylnders, and a 2:1 gear reduction to drive the prop at reasonable rpm ranges. The engine weighed 402lbs for 85hp vrs 182lbs for an equivalent Continental aircraft engine.|$|E

50|$|While small single-piston engines can {{commonly}} be laid on a {{table for}} repair, a large engine is normally meant to be supported from its engine mounts or from the flywheel transmission case mounts, and fragile components such as <b>oil</b> <b>pans</b> and valve covers would be crushed if the large engine were placed on a flat surface.|$|R
25|$|There are {{alternatives}} to a block heater that offer {{some of the}} same benefits. These include heaters attached to the engine's <b>oil</b> <b>pan,</b> usually with magnets. Dipstick heaters can be installed in place of the engine's oil dipstick. Heated blankets are available for the entire engine area, as well. A timer can be used with any of these heaters, so that it {{does not have to be}} left on all the time. This can help lower the electrical costs of using a block heater.|$|E
25|$|As the prototypes took shape, the {{exterior}} lines resembled {{more of a}} Ferrari or Porsche than a typical GM car, but the tight budget was taking its toll on the design, particularly on Aldikacti's dream of a high performance, aluminum-block V6; the cost of developing a new engine {{would be more than}} the production of the whole car itself. Instead, Aldikacti was forced to settle for the already manufactured four-cylinder engine GM produced for the Pontiac, the “Iron Duke,” nicknamed for its heavy iron block. This engine was too blocky to fit into the tiny car so it was equipped with a smaller <b>oil</b> <b>pan,</b> causing the engine to always run a quart low.|$|E

50|$|In 1986 and 1987, the 4.3L engine saw engine design {{upgrades}} {{similar to}} the Chevrolet small block V8. In 1986, the rear main crankshaft oil seal was changed from a two piece to a one piece seal. Some 1985 model year vehicles would have a 1986 engine due to service replacement - cylinder blocks were shipped with <b>oil</b> <b>pans.</b> 1987 saw new center bolt valve covers and hydraulic roller lifters.|$|R

2500|$|... 1965 {{also added}} another 350hp small block engine (Option L79) which used {{hydraulic}} rather than solid lifters, a milder camshaft and a modestly redesigned smaller <b>oil</b> <b>pan.</b> Otherwise, the 350hp engine was cosmetically and mechanically {{identical to the}} 365hp engine (Option L76) solid lifter engine. The smaller <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> allowed this high output small block 350hp engine to be ordered with optional Power Steering {{for the first time}} amongst the optional stable of higher output small block engines. Power steering was previously only available with the lower 250hp and 300hp engines.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} 383 engines {{available for the}} 1969 model year: 2-barrel and 4-barrel. [...] The 2-barrel was rated at 290 hp. The four barrel engine was rated at 330 hp and was identified by the [...] "pie tin" [...] on the air cleaner as [...] "383 / FOUR BARREL". The 330-hp engine was unique to the Charger model in 1969. While this engine was available with an un-silenced air cleaner option, it differed internally from the 335-hp 383 [...] "Magnum". In 1969 the B-series engines were all painted Chrysler Engine Turquoise {{with the exception of}} the 383 four speed, 440 Magnum, These engines were painted Chrysler High-Performance Orange. Differing from the 426 Hemi which was painted Street Hemi Orange. The 335-hp 383 Magnum engines were also painted Chrysler High-Performance Orange. The 383 Magnum motor was used in Road Runners and Super Bees, but did not appear in a Charger body until 1971. Differences between the 330-hp 383 4-barrel and 335-hp 383 magnum were mostly internal. Both versions used the Carter AVS carb and the larger exhaust manifolds from the 440 Magnum engines, but the Magnum had a windage tray in the <b>oil</b> <b>pan,</b> a different camshaft profile, and different valve springs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine block}} was revised with {{structural}} reinforcing ribs up front eliminating the two freeze plugs (on {{the front and}} back) along with an alloy <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> (for the S10, Blazer, and Jimmy). The 1996+ cast aluminum <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> has 12 bolts where a 16 bolt <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> from the earlier 4.3 does not interchange. These 4.3L (1996-2000) came with a redesigned 4L60-E with a removable bellhousing which bolts to the <b>oil</b> <b>pan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> is attached with a gasketed bolted joint. Some crankcase designs fully surround the crank's main bearing journals, whereas many others form only one half, with a bearing cap forming the other. Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> itself (in which case the <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> is a casting in its own right). Both the crankcase and any rigid cast <b>oil</b> <b>pan</b> often have reinforcing ribs cast into them, as well as bosses which are drilled and tapped to receive mounting screws/bolts for various other engine parts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name of the}} bun {{comes from}} its method of cooking. The buns are lined up in an <b>oiled,</b> shallow, flat <b>pan.</b> Typical {{commercial}} pans {{are more than a}} metre in diameter. The buns are lined up in the pan with the [...] "knot", where the dough is folded together, facing downwards and thus in direct contact with the <b>oiled</b> <b>pan</b> and fried into a crispy bottom during the cooking process. Water is sprayed on the buns during cooking to ensure the top (which is not in contact with the <b>pan</b> or the <b>oil)</b> is properly cooked. After frying, the bottom of the bun becomes crunchy, and the gelatin melts into soup. This combination gives the shengjian its unique flavour. Because the buns are tightly lined up in the pan, they become somewhat cube-shaped after cooking. While waiting to be served, the chef may flip the buns so that the fried base faces upwards to prevent the crispy bottom from getting soggy in the process of cooling.|$|R

5000|$|The 426 Hemi, in [...] "street Hemi" [...] form, was {{produced}} for consumer automobiles from 1965 through 1971. There were many {{differences between the}} Hemi and the Wedge-head big-block, including cross-bolted main bearing caps and a different head bolt pattern. There were also many differences between the racing Hemi's and the street Hemi, including {{but not limited to}} compression ratio, camshaft, intake manifold, exhaust manifold. Some 1960s NASCAR and NHRA Hemi engines featured magnesium cross-ram intake manifolds and magnesium <b>oil</b> <b>pans</b> in an attempt to reduce the massive weight of the overall engine, along with chain-driven internal dry-sump oil systems. Today, aftermarket blocks, heads, intakes, rods and pistons are usually made of aluminum.|$|R
