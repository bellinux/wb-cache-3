5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>tests</b> {{that may}} {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism, especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.|$|E
5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper per gram of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all <b>other</b> <b>tests</b> could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E

After completion of his training, on 1 May 1937, Singh was posted to the 5th Battalion of the same regiment. Despite his earlier hostility to schooling, Singh took education seriously and passed the Indian Army Class Certificate of Education. After clearing a few <b>other</b> <b>tests,</b> {{he was promoted to}} lance naik (lance corporal) on 7 August 1940. During his tenure with the 5th Battalion of the 1st Punjab, he saw action on the North-West Frontier.|$|E
5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in <b>other</b> <b>tests</b> the Laika performed {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able to}} scent-detect and identify the many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E
5|$|After their {{fitting-out}} stage, the {{two ships}} were put through sea trials {{to ensure they}} met their contracted specifications. The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off Rockland, Maine beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, <b>other</b> <b>tests</b> were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar. Although Michigan was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying {{the completion of the}} trials until 20–24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910—making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's —and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.|$|E

5|$|By this stage, Yorkshire {{regarded}} Yardley as {{the heir}} to Brian Sellers as captain, and the England Test selectors also began to prepare him to assume the England captaincy. At {{the end of the}} 1938 season, Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice-captain to Wally Hammond. He made a good start to the tour, scoring centuries in his first two innings, both surpassing his previous highest score. Wisden noted that he made a good impression on spectators in these early matches. In his fourth match, he captained the MCC in Hammond's absence for the first time. When Len Hutton was injured in a tour match and missed the first Test, Yardey made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in the second innings. Hutton returned for the second match, and the successes of other batsmen meant that Yardley was not required in the <b>other</b> <b>Tests</b> on the tour. However, he scored a third century when he captained the MCC against Border.|$|E
5|$|Davidson {{reached his}} all round peak during the 1960–61 home series against West Indies and was {{regarded}} as the key player in Australia's victory. In the First Test in Brisbane, Davidson became {{the first player to}} take ten wickets and accumulate more than a hundred runs in a match despite a broken finger on bowling hand. He took 5/135 and 6/87 and after scoring 44 in the first innings, made 80 in a counter-attacking seventh-wicket partnership of 134 with captain Richie Benaud as Australia sought victory in the run-chase rather than attempt to survive for a draw. Davidson was run out for 80 as Australia lost their way in the final minutes, causing the first Tied Test in history. He took five-wicket hauls in the three <b>other</b> <b>Tests</b> that he played, including Australia's victory in the Fifth Test to take the series 2–1. Despite missing a Test due to injury, he scored 212runs at 30.28 and took 33 wickets at 18.55, almost half the average of the next best bowler. He ended the first-class season with 551 runs at 55.10 and 45 wickets at 20.62.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. <b>Other</b> <b>tests</b> may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on <b>other</b> <b>tests.</b> These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent {{studies have shown that}} lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common brown lemur and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.|$|E
5|$|Macartney scored 2,207 runs {{during the}} tour {{at an average}} of 45.04. During the English season, he reached the peak of his {{performance}} as an all-rounder, taking 38 wickets. He made six centuries, including two in one match against Sussex. Apart from his 99 at Lord's, Macartney did not pass 34 in the <b>other</b> <b>Tests</b> and ended with 197 runs at 32.83. He did not bowl heavily during the series, taking six wickets at 23.66. It was not a happy tour for the Australians; without the senior players, there were frequent reports of drunken brawls and verbal abuse towards the locals. Macartney was one of only four players to accept the guaranteed tour fee of 400 pounds; the others signed up to a percentage share of the profits and the commercial failure of the tour left them with {{less than half of the}} flat fee.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>tests</b> are {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|The Victorian was {{not called}} during the 1960–61 Australian season, but his {{performances}} were ineffective {{and he was}} repeatedly hampered by injuries. In particular, a strained achilles tendon restricted his speed and penetration, particularly in the lead-up to the opening Test. Meckiff played in the First and the Third Tests, taking two wickets at 117.00 and scoring 12 runs at 6.00; {{he was unable to}} complete either match, sustaining injuries during the second innings of both fixtures. These fitness problems resulted in his omission for the three <b>other</b> <b>Tests.</b> During the summer, Meckiff's bowling was passed by Col Egar, who later ended his career. He noted that the umpire had told him there was little point in changing his action.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue. Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans. A variety of <b>other</b> <b>tests</b> including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E
5|$|William Easton, an {{insurance}} executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed {{to heart disease}} after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo, {{where he and his}} janitor, Hank, awaken in vises designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into oxygen masks strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath for long and is killed by the vise. William's <b>other</b> <b>tests</b> force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a hanging room, a steam room, and a shotgun aimed at seats of a carousel. It is shown that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.|$|E

5|$|The {{capsizing}} of {{the battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull it free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about <b>other</b> <b>tests,</b> although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.|$|E
5|$|While {{en route}} to the final Test in Jamaica, the West Indies team stopped in Panama and Costa Rica where {{official}} functions were held in Headley's honour. In Jamaica, where there was widespread jubilation, Headley attended several receptions and celebrations. When the cricket resumed, Headley scored 64, 72 and 55 in three innings against MCC for Jamaica. With the Test series level, it was agreed that the final match of the series would be played until one team won, regardless of how long it took—the <b>other</b> <b>Tests</b> had been limited to four days each. On the first three days, England scored 849. In reply West Indies could only manage 286, with Headley out for ten runs. England batted again, to set West Indies an eventual victory target of 836. This time, Headley batted for 390 minutes, faced 385 balls and hit 28 fours while scoring 223. He and Karl Nunes added 227 for the second wicket. Headley played the hook very effectively and hit many short deliveries for runs. When Headley was stumped, he had made what was at the time the fourth highest individual score in all Test cricket and the highest in a second innings. When West Indies still needed 428 runs, rain fell for two days and the match had to be abandoned after its ninth scheduled day. Headley ended the series with 703 runs at an average of 87.87.|$|E
