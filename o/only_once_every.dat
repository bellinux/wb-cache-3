5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form on planet Earth. They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean and generally form <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} {{agricultural}} societies, Torajans dance and sing during harvest time. The Ma'bugi dance celebrates the thanksgiving event, and the Ma'gandangi dance is performed while Torajans are pounding rice. There are several war dances, {{such as the}} Manimbong dance performed by men, followed by the Ma'dandan dance performed by women. The aluk religion governs when and how Torajans dance. A dance called Ma'bua can be performed <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 12 years. Ma'bua is a major Toraja ceremony in which priests wear a buffalo head and dance around a sacred tree.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E

5|$|Collisions of solitary stars {{within the}} Milky Way occur <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> -; far less {{frequently}} than {{the appearance of}} novae. Collisions occur with greater frequency in the dense core regions of globular clusters (cf. blue stragglers). A likely scenario is a collision with a binary star system, or between two binary systems containing white dwarfs. This collision can leave behind a close binary system of two white dwarfs. Their orbit decays and they merge through their shared envelope. However, a study based on SDSS spectra found 15 double systems of the 4,000 white dwarfs tested, implying a double white dwarf merger every 100 years in the Milky Way. Conveniently, this rate matches the number of Type Ia supernovae detected in our neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E

50|$|Until 1758, Montem {{was held}} {{annually}} in January. The timing was {{then moved to}} the more clement weather of Whitsun Tuesday and the festival became biennial. In 1778, the frequency was reduced further so that Montem was <b>only</b> celebrated <b>once</b> <b>every</b> three years.|$|R
5|$|The Perfect Storm {{originated}} from a cold front that exited {{the east coast}} of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened {{as a result of the}} temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States. It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 50 to 100 years. Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are rare}} events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is {{estimated}} that they recur at any given place <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 360 to 410 years, on average. The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7min 32s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7min 2s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra. The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7min 29s. For comparison, the longest total eclipse of the 20th century at 7min 8s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there are no total solar eclipses over 7min in duration in the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|ARMs {{that allow}} {{negative}} amortization will typically have payment adjustments that occur less frequently than {{the interest rate}} adjustment. For example, the interest rate may be adjusted every month, but the payment amount <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 12 months.|$|E

25|$|Until 1715, {{the council}} met twice a week. After this date, {{financial}} {{decisions were made}} by the king in one-on-one meetings with the contrôleur général des finances, and the council merely rubber-stamped their decisions without much debate. Under the Regent Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and then under Louis XV, the council met every Tuesday. From around 1728–1730, its rhythm slowed to less than once a week, and during the years 1730–1740, it met <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Gestation lasts between 257 and 270 days, so {{that the}} young are born between May and June, and results in {{the birth of a}} single calf.

25|$|The {{best known}} SWP {{publication}} is the monthly newspaper Socialist Worker. In {{recent years the}} paper has sought to change itself from a narrow party publication to a broader, full colour, anti-capitalist 'paper of the movements', occasionally including contributors from the wider Irish left. Socialist Worker was for a period the most frequently published Marxist newspaper in Ireland, published fortnightly from 1995, and weekly {{for a brief period}} in 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.

25|$|During the {{communist}} era, travelling to the West {{was a long}} process for Hungarian citizens. The {{first step was to}} obtain an invitation, preferably from a relative in the country to be visited, and a promise of full financial support. With such an invitation, and assuming he could get a passport, a Hungarian could travel westwards once a year. However, in the absence of such an invitation, he could travel to the West <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> three years. The Communist-era visa restrictions restricted Hungarian artists and musicians since it hindered their ability to travel abroad. As a result, many chose to leave Hungary and settle in the West, such as famed cellist János Starker, who emigrated to the United States in 1948 because it was impossible for him to tour abroad with a Hungarian passport.|$|E
25|$|Drinking water. Despite clear improvements, {{the quality}} of service remains insufficient. For example, few cities enjoy {{continued}} service, and water pressure is often inadequate. In Riyadh water was available <b>only</b> <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days. This is still better than in 2008, when the respective figures were 5 and 23 days. While systematic data on service quality are now available for several cities, they are not publicly available. In some localities groundwater used for drinking water supply is naturally contaminated with levels of fluoride {{in excess of the}} recommended level of 0.7 to 1.2mg/l. For example, a 1990 study showed that the fluoride level in drinking water in Mecca was 2.5mg/l. In Riyadh the level of fluoride is reduced far below the recommended level by blending groundwater with desalinated seawater.|$|E
