5|$|In 1922, as {{an interim}} measure {{before the first}} {{specially}} designed definitives were ready, a series of contemporary stamps of King George V were overprinted. The unoverprinted stamps were issued and in use in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland between 1912 and 1922 and continued in use in Great Britain and Northern Ireland until 1936. Three printing firms held <b>overprinting</b> contracts: Dollard Printing House Ltd., Alex. Thom & Co Ltd., and Harrison & Sons. In June 1925 the Government Printers, Dublin Castle, obtained the contract and completed all <b>overprinting</b> until 1937, when the final, high-value stamps were issued.|$|E
5|$|Companies closely {{associated}} with camouflage patterns include 6876, A Bathing Ape, Stone Island, Stüssy, Maharishi, mhi, Zoo York, Addict, and Girbaud, using and <b>overprinting</b> genuine military surplus fabric; others use camouflage patterns in bright colours such as pink or purple. Some, such as Emma Lundgren and Stüssy, have created their own designs or integrated camouflage patterns with other symbols.|$|E
5|$|Tracks {{discovered}} by Matthew Mossbrucker (Morrison Natural History Museum, Colorado) suggest that Stegosaurus lived in multiple-age herds. One group of tracks is interpreted as showing {{four or five}} baby stegosaurs moving in the same direction, while another has a juvenile stegosaur track with an adult track <b>overprinting</b> it. Stegosaurus may have preferred drier settings than other common Morrison Formation dinosaurs, such as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus.|$|E
50|$|In philately, private <b>overprints</b> or {{commercial}} <b>overprints</b> are <b>overprints</b> applied to postage stamps, postal stationery or revenue stamps by {{anyone other than}} the official stamp-issuing entity. These <b>overprints</b> have principally {{been used as a}} security measure, however, propaganda and commemorative examples are also known. When <b>overprinted</b> for security purposes, they serve a similar function to perfins. It is important to distinguish between private <b>overprints</b> and private cancellations.|$|R
50|$|Stamps of France {{were issued}} in 1925 with <b>overprint</b> ALAOUITES. These were soon {{superseded}} by stamps of Syria bearing the same <b>overprint.</b> In July 1931, stamps of Syria were issued with <b>overprint</b> LATTAQUIE. Since 1 March 1937, stamps of Syria without <b>overprint</b> {{have been in}} constant use.|$|R
50|$|Another example, from New Zealand, is four stamps <b>overprinted</b> for an {{industrial}} exhibition held in Auckland in 1913. The accompanying image shows genuine <b>overprints,</b> and forged <b>overprints</b> from an internet auction. A New Zealand dealer prices {{a set of}} postally used stamps with genuine <b>overprints</b> at NZD 1600, while the same four stamps, postally used without the <b>overprint,</b> are priced at NZD 8. This indicates the potentially lucrative payoff for forgers.|$|R
5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green <b>overprinting</b> of trails and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.|$|E
5|$|These {{were the}} major stamp {{productions}} for everyday use. Commemorative stamps {{first appeared in}} 1929, and these now appear several times a year, celebrating many aspects of Irish life, such as notable events and anniversaries, Irish life and culture, and many famous Irish people. Some definitive and commemorative stamps have been produced in miniature sheet, booklet and coil configurations {{in addition to the}} common sheet layout. Postage dues and airmails complete the stamp issues of the two, sequential, Irish stamp-issuing authorities. Two styles of watermark were used though the overprinted issues came with the watermarks of the British stamps provided for <b>overprinting</b> by the British Post Office.|$|E
25|$|Colour maps {{were sent}} to {{commercial}} printers for printing in five colours, with the <b>overprinting</b> being added after the map had been printed. This process was chosen as it gave a higher quality for the fine line-work than the industry standard four-colour process (CMYK). As computer and software technology has advanced, and the cost reduced, many clubs {{are now in a}} position to print their own maps. This enables clubs to print the six colours together (map and <b>overprinting</b> symbols) using that same four-colour process, but with a reduction in quality over traditional printing. Printing costs can be minimised by using standard stock sizes of paper e.g. A4 or Letter. It is important to use the correct type of paper: both the weight and the coating affect the usability of the final map.|$|E

25|$|In {{a repeat}} of Japanese wartime {{monetary}} policy, the government defaulted on its promises to redeem its banknotes in silver or gold coin while promising to maintain the two-to-one peso to dollar parity. This decision, compounded with the deliberate <b>overprinting</b> of fiat banknotes, resulted in the peso dropping in value by almost 67% against the US dollar within the first three hours of opening day. The government effort to maintain the peg devastated the gold, silver and dollar reserves of the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{map scale}} is 1:15000, with a {{permitted}} enlargement to 1:10000 (with symbols at 150%). Other map scales may {{be provided for}} various purposes, for example Sprint maps use a scale of 1:5000 or 1:4000. The map is printed in five colours, which cover the main groups: Land forms, rock and boulders, water and marsh, vegetation, and man-made features. There are additional specifications for technical symbols, and an extra colour for <b>overprinting</b> symbols. The symbols used should be explained in a legend.|$|E
25|$|The Australian National Flag may be {{used for}} {{commercial}} or advertising purposes without formal permission as long as the flag is used in a dignified manner and reproduced completely and accurately; it should not be defaced by <b>overprinting</b> with words or illustrations, it should not be covered by other objects in displays, and all symbolic parts of the flag should be identifiable. It also must sit first (typically, left) where more than one flag is used. For this reason the Collingwood Football Club had to reverse its logo, which features the flag.|$|E
50|$|Around 1887, various {{postage stamps}} were <b>overprinted</b> {{with a large}} R to specify fiscal use only. Some were also {{additionally}} <b>overprinted</b> REVENUE ONLY. apart from the initial <b>overprint</b> to confirm this. All <b>overprinted</b> issues were withdrawn on 30 June 1900, the day before a new vertical design was issued, again portraying Sir Charles Brooke. These remained in use until the Rajah's death, and in 1918 this set was reissued with the portrait of the new monarch, his son Sir Charles Vyner Brooke. Some of these were also <b>overprinted</b> with provisional surcharges in 1934. The 1900 and 1918 sets also exist <b>overprinted</b> CUSTOMS diagonally.|$|R

25|$|Malta {{first issued}} revenue stamps in 1899, when {{the island was}} a British colony. From that year to 1912, all revenue issues were postage stamps overprinted accordingly, with the <b>overprinting</b> being done either locally or by De La Rue in London. Postage stamps also became valid for fiscal use from 1912–13, so no new {{revenues}} were issued until 1925–30, when a series of key type stamps depicting King George V were issued. These exist unappropriated for use as general-duty revenues, or with additional inscriptions indicating a specific use (Applications, Contracts, Registers or Stocks & Shares). The only other revenues after this series were £1 stamps issued in 1941, 1948 and 1954. Postage stamps remained valid for fiscal use until at least the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1850s, Evans {{designed}} book-covers known as yellow-backs, a [...] "book bound in yellow-glazed paper over boards". He perfected the method {{and became the}} printer of choice for many London publishers; by 1853 he was the chief yellow-back printer in the city. He developed the yellow-back as he disliked the white paper book-covers that became soiled and discoloured; {{as a result of}} this aversion he experimented with yellow paper by treating before adding the printed illustration. Often yellow-backs were used for unsold editions, so that they functioned as reprints or waste; typically [...] "enormous number of these covers" [...] were left behind for publishers. Other terms for the books were [...] "Penny dreadfuls", [...] "railway novels" [...] and [...] "mustard plaisters". For the illustrations, Evans commissioned artists such as George Cruikshank, Phiz, Randolph Caldecott and Walter Crane. Evans' first cover was brightly coloured, utilising only reds and blues, <b>overprinting</b> blue over black to create what appeared as a black background. He continued the practice of using red and blue, engraving [...] "in graduation" [...] for lighter tints of reds used for faces and hands, and engraving the blue blocks in a manner that created textures and patterns. Evans realised books that may have been unsuccessful in a first printing were easy to sell with well-designed cover art.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{invention}} of the typewriter, a [...] "neutral" [...] quotation mark form (') was created to economize on the keyboard, by using a single key to represent: the apostrophe, both opening and closing single quotation marks, single primes, and on some typewriters the exclamation point by <b>overprinting</b> with a period. This is known as the typewriter apostrophe or vertical apostrophe. The same convention was adopted for quotation marks.|$|E

2500|$|New {{regulations}} removed special postal privileges {{enjoyed by}} {{officials of the}} East India Company. Stamps for official use were prepared and carefully accounted for, to combat abuses by officials. In 1854 Spain had printed special stamps for official communications, but in 1866 India was the first country to adopt the expedient of <b>overprinting</b> [...] "Service" [...] on postage stamps and [...] "Service Postage" [...] on revenue stamps. This innovation was later widely adopted by other countries.|$|E
2500|$|Shortages developed, so stamps {{also had}} to be improvised. Some [...] "Service Postage" [...] overprinted rarities {{resulted}} from abrupt changes in postal regulations. New designs for the four-anna and six-anna-eight-pie stamps were issued in 1866. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of stamps to meet the new rates. Provisional six-anna stamps were improvised by cutting {{the top and bottom}} from a current foreign-bill revenue stamp and <b>overprinting</b> [...] "Postage". India was the first country in the Commonwealth to issue airmail stamps.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{declaration}} of Proclamation № 1081 by President Ferdinand Marcos on September 23, 1972, the Central Bank was to demonetize the existing banknotes in 1974, pursuant to Presidential Decree 378. All the unissued Pilipino Series banknotes (except the one peso banknote) were {{sent back to the}} De La Rue plant in London for <b>overprinting</b> the watermark area with the words [...] "ANG BAGONG LIPUNAN" [...] and an oval geometric safety design.

The last <b>overprinted</b> stamps were the Waterlow & Sons re-engraved King George V 2/6, 5/- and 10/- values that appeared in 1934 and were <b>overprinted</b> in 1937 for use in Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|In 1892, the Navigation and Commerce {{issue for}} French Oceania became available, and in 1893, {{two kinds of}} <b>overprint</b> were applied to the {{remaining}} stocks of regular and postage due French Colonies stamps; one type was a slanted <b>overprint</b> reading [...] "TAHITI" [...] {{and the other was}} a horizontal [...] "1893 / TAHITI". For some values of stamps, very few were left to be <b>overprinted,</b> and genuine <b>overprints</b> are quite rare, the rarest being the horizontal <b>overprint</b> on the 25c yellow at around US$20,000.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first attempt}} at a {{national}} currency was during the American Revolutionary War. In 1775 the Continental Congress, {{as well as the}} states, began issuing paper currency, calling the bills [...] "Continentals". The Continentals were backed only by future tax revenue, and were used to help finance the Revolutionary War. <b>Overprinting,</b> as well as British counterfeiting, caused the value of the Continental to diminish quickly. This experience with paper money led the United States to strip the power to issue Bills of Credit (paper money) from a draft of the new Constitution on August 16, 1787, as well as banning such issuance by the various states, and limiting the states' ability to make anything but gold or silver coin legal tender on August 28.|$|E
2500|$|The Pilipino series {{banknotes}} is {{the name}} {{used to refer to}} Philippine banknotes issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines from 1969 to 1973, during the term of President Ferdinand Marcos. [...] It was succeeded by the Ang Bagong Lipunan Series of banknotes, to which it shared a similar design. The lowest denomination of the series is 1-piso and the highest is 100-piso. This series represented a radical change from the English series. The bills underwent Filipinization and a design change.After the declaration of Proclamation № 1081 on September 23, 1972, the Central Bank demonetized the existing banknotes (both the English and Pilipino series) on March 1, 1974, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 378.
