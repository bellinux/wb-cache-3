The song contains humorous and ironic references to sex and death, and many versions have appeared following efforts to bowdlerise this song for performance in public ceremonies. In private, students will typically sing ribald words.|$|E

500|$|According to Richard Dawkins, a {{distinction}} between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, [...] "I am agnostic {{only to the extent}} that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden." [...] Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; [...] "Temporary Agnostics in Practice" [...] (TAPs), and [...] "Permanent Agnostics in Principle" [...] (PAPs). He states that [...] "agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability.", and considers PAP a [...] "deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting".|$|E
500|$|When Clayton first {{joined the}} fledgling U2, {{he did not}} have formal {{training}} in the bass. In the band's early years, he generally played simple parts in 4/4 time, usually strings of steady 8th notes. Bono said of Clayton's early bass playing, [...] "Adam used to pretend he could play bass. He came round and started using words like 'action' and 'fret' and he had us baffled. He had the only amplifier, so we never argued with him. We thought this guy must be a musician; he knows what he's talking about. And then <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> discovered he wasn't playing the right notes. That's what's wrong, y'know?" [...] His style has remained subtle and primarily supportive, but gradually become more sophisticated by integrating elements of Motown R and reggae and by offering more variety in his basslines.|$|E
500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet." ...|$|E

Director Imtiaz Ali was not a well-known figure before its production, with only one feature credit to his name, but Kapoor agreed to the film after being impressed with his [...] "mind-blowing" [...] script.

Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC commented that the role required a mixture of naivety and spontaneity, and was impressed with Kapoor's effort.

And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis.

2500|$|Once the bótides commotion is over, {{the three}} bands parade the clay-strewn streets playing the famous [...] "Graikoí" [...] festive march.

2500|$|In their maps of Greater Germany, German {{textbooks}} {{included the}} Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Bohemia-Moravia, the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, and western Poland from Danzig (now Gdańsk) to Kraków.

2500|$|The Fallen Lords was {{originally}} conceived by Jason Jones as Bungie were {{nearing the end}} of development of Marathon Infinity in late-1995. They had planned to do another first-person shooter as their next game.

As such, he approached his colleagues with the question [...] "What do you think about having this world with 100 guys fighting 100 other guys in 3D?" [...] Bungie had worked on several 3D action games for Mac OS, and Jones' idea was to bring that experience to a real-time strategy game rather than another first-person game. The team agreed with Jones that their new shooter could end up as being very similar to Quake, and, as such, after working on the project for two months, Jones explains [...] "in <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> switched our project from a shooter game that would have had us chasing our competition's tail to what has basically become Myth." ...|$|E
