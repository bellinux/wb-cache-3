5|$|Thorkildsen's {{relationship}} with the Norwegian hurdler Christina Vukicevic generated some unwanted publicity <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part.</b> When Thorkildsen and Vukicevic won the King's Cup {{for men and women}} respectively at the 2006 Norwegian championships, Thorkildsen left the stadium to avoid photographers, whom he had shown the finger the previous day. In March 2011 Vukicevic and Thorkildsen announced in the Norwegian media that they no longer were a couple.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part.</b> It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|After two years, {{the account}} went viral in 2011. While Capone {{remained}} anonymous, games journalists, such Kotaku and GameSetWatch, began {{to cover his}} tweets and journalists, such as Leigh Alexander (Gamasutra) and Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb), reposted his content. Journalists did not view the parody as a mockery but instead as representative of a growing dissatisfaction over clichéd trends in the mainstream games industry. In this way, the account led to greater respect for Molyneux's temerity. Kotaku wrote that Capone's account displayed uncharacteristic creativity <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part,</b> but Capone countered by saying that most game designers have endless game ideas and that real skill rests in applying them well.|$|E

Lofgren maintained a close musical relationship with Young, appearing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Tonight's the Night album and tour among others.

5|$|During the war, {{the musical}} life of Britain was {{drastically}} curtailed. The LSO was helped to survive by large donations from Sir Thomas Beecham, who also subsidised the Hallé and the Royal Philharmonic Society. For a year {{he took the}} role, though not the title, of chief conductor of the LSO. In 1916 his millionaire father died and Beecham's financial affairs became too complicated for any further musical philanthropy <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part.</b> In 1917 the LSO's directors agreed unanimously that they would promote no more concerts {{until the end of}} the war. The orchestra played for other managements, and managed to survive, although the hitherto remunerative work for regional choral societies dwindled to almost nothing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between Lie and Gerhardsen grew cooler. Gerhardsen was becoming far more amenable to the Soviets {{in part due to}} the influence of his wife, Werna, who was highly sympathetic to the Soviet Union (some even claiming she was a KGB informant). Gerhardsen had grown more and more frustrated at Lie's hard-line tactics against communists and perceived Soviet sympathisers, as well as his attempts to stifle foreign policy debate within the Central Committee. Lie <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part</b> grew embittered over what he perceived was the Gerhardsen-couple protecting key leftists, such as Trygve Bull. According to Bull, Lie and Gerhardsen hardly spoke to each other after 1957.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most eminent gardeners of his day. He {{maintained}} close relations with other important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen such as William Coys, John Gerard, John Tradescant the elder (who was a close friend), Vespasian Robin, and the Frenchman Matthias de Lobel (also known as Matthias de L'Obel or Matthaeus Lobelius). Together, they belonged to the generation that began to see extraordinary new plants coming from the Levant and from Virginia, broadly speaking. In his writings, de Lobel frequently mentioned the Long Acre garden and praised Parkinson's abilities. Parkinson, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part,</b> edited and presented in Theatrum Botanicum the papers of de Lobel, who had spent the final years of his life in Highgate supervising the gardens of Edward la Zouche, the 11th Baron Zouche.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} {{listed in the}} Court of Common Pleas as Tichborne v. Lushington, {{in the form of}} an action for the {{ejectment}} of Colonel Lushington, the tenant of Tichborne Park. The real purpose, however, was to establish the Claimant's identity as Sir Roger Tichborne and his rights to the family's estates; failure <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part</b> would expose him as an impostor. In addition to Tichborne Park's , the estates included manors, lands and farms in Hampshire, and considerable properties in London and elsewhere, which altogether produced an annual income of over £20,000, equivalent to several millions in 21st-century terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} against the king {{at the general}} council had shown Atholl that James was {{not only on the}} back-foot but his political standing had received a huge set-back and may have convinced the earl that James's death was now a viable course of action. Atholl had seen how assertive action by two of his brothers at different times had allowed them {{to take control of the}} kingdom and that as James's nearest adult relative, the earl must have considered that decisive intervention <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part</b> at this time could prove to be equally successful.|$|E
5|$|Though Roshan {{maintained}} that they parted amicably, the media {{reported that the}} split was due to infidelity <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part,</b> linking him with several actresses, most notably his Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut. Roshan denied {{having an affair with}} the actress, and filed a lawsuit against her in 2016 accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment. Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover-up their affair for the benefit of his divorce proceedings. Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{did work}} for {{publishers}} other than Marvel during the 1980s, {{as when he}} drew several pages of Batman #400 in 1986 and Action Comics Annual #1 in 1987. The latter {{is viewed as a}} turning point in Adam's drawing style, characterized by bulkier figures of Batman and Superman, though Adams explains that this was in part due to the influence of The Dark Knight Returns, and that the overall change in art was style partly due to deliberate experimentation <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>part,</b> and partly to Dick Giordano's inking, which exhibited a different line weight. That same year, he illustrated Gumby Summer Fun Special #1 by Comico Comics, a job he obtained through Comico editor Diana Schutz, an old friend who noticed the incidental images of Gumby that Adams had included in the pages of Longshot. Adams, who did not harbor fond memories of that cartoon as a child, and who feared he would be typecast as a Gumby artist if he took the job, told Schultz he would only do it if she could get Bob Burden to write it, on the assumption that Schultz would decline this condition. Schultz, who initially wanted Mark Evanier for the job, considered this, and eventually agreed to it after contacting Burden, who was enthusiastic about the idea. That book, which demonstrated Adams' versatility in handling comedy as well as superheroics, garnered him and Burden a 1988 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue. Adams would later illustrate a second Gumby book, Gumby's Winter Fun Special, which was written by Steve Purcell.|$|E

30|$|Once the new parts {{have been}} {{assigned}} to the technicians, we schedule the work as follows. For each technician, <b>his</b> new <b>parts</b> are added to his waiting queue and then the waiting queue is ordered by customer required date (CRD), with the most urgent part being {{at the top of}} the queue. We stipulate that each technician finishes working <b>on</b> <b>his</b> current <b>part</b> (or works on it until it is interrupted) before moving onto the first <b>part</b> in <b>his</b> waiting queue, even if the first part in the waiting queue is more urgent than <b>his</b> current <b>part</b> (this simplifying assumption is to avoid situations where, due to an urgent arrival, a technician stops working <b>on</b> <b>his</b> current <b>part</b> when it is almost finished).|$|R
