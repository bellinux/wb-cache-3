25|$|Due to spin-orbit coupling, undoped GaAs {{single crystal}} {{exhibits}} much larger Faraday rotation than glass (SiO2). Considering the atomic arrangement is different along the (100) and (110) plane, {{one might think}} the Faraday rotation is polarization dependent. However, experimental work revealed an immeasurable anisotropy in the wavelength range from 880–1,600nm. Based on the large Faraday rotation, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to use GaAs to calibrate the B field of the terahertz electromagnetic wave which requires very fast response time. Around the band gap, the Faraday effect shows resonance behavior.|$|E
25|$|Light {{restriction}} in the evening, {{sometimes called}} darkness therapy or scototherapy, is another treatment strategy. Just as bright light upon awakening should advance one's sleep phase, bright {{light in the}} evening and night delays it (see the PRC). It is suspected that DSPD patients may be overly sensitive to evening light. Thus, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> advised to keep lights and computer screens dim for the last hours before bedtime and even wear amber-colored (blue-blocking) goggles.

25|$|Some of Tchaikovsky's piano works can be {{challenging}} technically; nevertheless, they are mostly charming, unpretentious compositions intended for amateur pianists. It would therefore be easy to dismiss the entire œuvre as mediocre and merely competent. While this view could hold true to some point, there is more attractive and resourceful music {{in some of these}} pieces than <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> inclined to expect. The difference between Tchaikovsky's pieces and many other salon works are patches of striking harmony and unexpected phrase structures which may demand some extra patience but will not remain unrewarded from a musical standpoint. Many of the pieces have titles which give imaginative pointers on how they should be played.|$|E

If so, the only remaining way that the <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> reached (and the Good, if that {{is the same as the}} One) is through the possibility of some nonverbal, 'intuitive' access.

500|$|Leo Depuydt of Brown University {{found it}} ridiculous {{that in the}} Gospel of Jesus' Wife, the word [...] "my" [...] in the phrase [...] "my wife" [...] is written in bold, as if to stress the idea that Jesus was married. Depuydt {{also said that he}} had never seen bold writing used in a single Coptic text before. He wrote: “The effect is {{something}} like: ‘My wife. Get it? MY wife. You heard that right.’ The papyrus fragment seems ripe for a Monty Python sketch…. If the forger had used italics in addition, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> in danger of losing one’s composure.” Christian Askeland's linguistic analysis of the text shows that it is in a dialect which fell out of use well before AD 741. He concluded that the text must have been written on a fragment of medieval papyrus by a modern forger. Dr. Askeland also found it suspicious that the author of the fragment wrote the same letter in different ways. In addition, Askeland showed that the fragment is [...] "a match for a papyrus fragment that is clearly a forgery." [...] This second fragment, containing part of the Gospel of John, belongs to the same anonymous owner, and is now overwhelmingly considered a fake. This is because that fragment of the Gospel of John appeared to have been copied from every second line of an online translation of John's Gospel in an ancient Coptic dialect called Lycopolitan; also, the Lycopolitan language died out prior to the sixth century, and the John fragment was carbon-dated to somewhere between the seventh and ninth centuries. Askeland argues that the John fragment was written by the same person, in the same ink, and with the same instrument as the Gospel of Jesus' Wife. [...] Professor King felt that these concerns were legitimate, but that there was still a chance that the gospel was authentic. The Atlantic reported that despite Kings' reservations, the text was widely considered a fake. King later conceded, saying that evidence suggests that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife is a forgery.|$|E
