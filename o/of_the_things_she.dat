5|$|Stefani {{first came}} {{face to face}} with {{designing}} clothes when she and her mother would sew clothes for themselves when she was young. Stefani comes from a long line of seamstresses, as even her great-grandmother would sew clothes. Stefani made most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> wore onstage during concerts. When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she felt she lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to ready-to-wear clothing. Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer. Goco later parted ways with L.A.M.B.|$|E
25|$|The false interpreters {{of nature}} declare that {{quicksilver}} {{is the common}} seed of every metal, not remembering that nature varies the seed according to the variety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> desires to produce in the world.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Elbe {{regularly}} {{presented as}} a woman, attending various festivities and entertaining guests in her house. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> liked to do was disappear into the streets of Paris in the throngs of revelers during the Carnival, wearing her modeling fashions. Elbe was sometimes introduced by Gottlieb as her own sister when {{she was dressed in}} female attire. Only her closest friends knew once she had transitioned.|$|E
60|$|But {{she broke}} in impetuously, drawing {{away from him}} as she spoke, and his heart sank with foreboding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> was about to inquire.|$|R
5000|$|Annie: Annie {{is shown}} as an {{inquisitive}} and adventurous young girl that enjoys singing, dancing, collecting photographs and other mnemonics that remind her <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she’s</b> learned.|$|R
60|$|The monosyllable was mysterious to her. But for <b>the</b> wild improbability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> {{would have}} {{wondered}} whether indeed {{he knew her}} secret. She brushed the idea away. It was impossible.|$|R
500|$|Camila, General Canales's daughter, is (somewhat reluctantly) {{rescued by}} Miguel Angel Face, when {{none of her}} {{relatives}} will take her in upon the flight of her father. Eventually Angel Face chooses Camila over his former master, the President. The two marry and she gives birth to his son, but only once Angel Face has disappeared. She and her son, whom she names Miguel, are last seen having moved to the countryside to escape the President's influence. She is the very picture of the adolescent who has been denied even the smallest margin of liberty, as critic Callan observes: [...] "when Camila {{was thought to be}} dying a priest came to administer the sacrament of Penance. Her girlish faults stand out in the contrast with the evil that weighs upon the city. Indeed, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> mentions in her confession is no fault at all: she went horseback riding astride, in the presence of somegbujyvj Indians." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Eric Kripke {{felt that}} Ellen brought a [...] "maternal energy" [...] to the series, and {{described}} the character as [...] "a lioness, which is tough and badass and 'You touch my children, I will kill you.'" [...] Likewise, actress Samantha Ferris described her as a [...] "gun-toting, beer-slinging, bar-owning broad" [...] with a [...] "very maternal core". Ferris also feels that, despite Ellen having gone through a lot in her life, she is cautious rather than jaded, and is [...] "very protective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> has in her life", especially her daughter Jo and the Winchesters. Thus, her main concern is Jo's safety, which prompts her to forbid her daughter from going on hunts. When she realizes that she can no longer stop Jo from doing what she wants, Ellen becomes her hunting partner, deciding {{it is the best}} way to look after her. By the time of Ellen's final appearance, actress Alona Tal came to view their characters more as equals rather than mother and daughter.|$|E
2500|$|She {{suggests}} that a true account must somehow connect these three uses of the concept, though later students of intention have sometimes denied this, and disputed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> presupposes under {{the first and third}} headings. It is clear though that it is the second that is crucial to her main purpose, which is to comprehend the way in which human thought and understanding and conceptualisation relate to the [...] "events in a man's history", or the goings on to which he is subject.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Jo {{glanced over}} her shoulder, {{but no one was}} in sight; and rather liking <b>the</b> joke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>she</b> laughed back, saying, [...] "Well, if you won't mention it, I think I will;" [...] and with two nimble steps was in the willow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't think Aunt Mary {{will ever}} let them, she hates the country; {{and though she}} likes {{to have a place}} for <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>she</b> does not want to live there, {{especially}} where {{there are so many of}} us; and then, Felix's situation!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her Kate was at last avenged. The {{woman stood}} there in her {{solitude}} for some minutes thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had done. <b>The</b> man had injured her,--sorely,--and she had punished him. He had richly deserved the death which he had received from her hands. In these minutes, as regarded him, there was no remorse. But how should she tell the news to her child? The blow which had thrust him over would, too probably, destroy other life than his. Would it not be better that her girl should so die? What could prolonged life give her that would be worth her having? As for herself,--in these first moments of her awe she took no thought of her own danger. It did not occur {{to her that she}} might tell how the man had ventured too near the edge and had fallen by mischance. As regarded herself <b>she</b> was proud <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had accomplished; but how should she tell her child that it was done? ...|$|R
2500|$|In May 2005, Adel Smith, {{president}} of the Union of Italian Muslims, launched a lawsuit against Fallaci charging that [...] "some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> said in her book The Force of Reason are offensive to Islam". Smith's attorney cited 18 phrases, most notably a reference to Islam as [...] "a pool that never purifies". Consequently, an Italian judge ordered Fallaci to stand trial in Bergamo on charges of [...] "defaming Islam". The preliminary trial began on 12 June, and on 25 June, Judge Beatrice Siccardi decided that Fallaci should indeed stand trial beginning on 18 December. Fallaci accused the judge of having disregarded the fact that Smith had called for her murder and defamed Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the pier}} is another world of English shale beach and cold sea. [...] Here lives Mrs. Bag Bag, {{seemingly}} a bag lady whose {{life has been}} spent collecting “little things.” [...] In actuality, Mrs. Bag Bag is {{the very essence of}} magic and art, a Muse. [...] (There are nine muses. [...] Stinkfoot has nine cast members. [...] Stinkfoot himself disappeared nine years earlier. [...] Nine is used symbolically throughout the show. [...] Vivian used the number 9 in all he did after marrying Ki whose favorite number was 9. [...] If not 9 itself, then a number that could be reduced to 9, i.e.: 27 garden gnomes in Sir Henry at Rawlinson End.) [...] Nine years before one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> collected was an egg which had hatched into a parakeet she’d named Polly. [...] Isaiah the Flounder, a doleful beach-dweller, is enamored of Polly and pleads with her in a show stopping duet (No Time Like the Future), but Polly senses she was meant for more…but what? [...] (Imagination) [...] Mrs. Bag Bag knows, but will not say. [...] Just as Screwy always tells the truth, so too does Mrs. Bag Bag, but Mrs. Bag Bag’s truths are oblique, couched in riddles and rhymes. [...] (Sphinx & Minx) [...] The bane of Mrs. Bag Bag’s existence, Elma the Electrifying Elver, lives here too. [...] A gorgeous creature of absolute certainty and complete self-absorption, she lives in or out of the sea.|$|E

6000|$|To her sister, Mary Fielding, Fanny {{said little}} or nothing of her coming marriage, but to Florence, who, as {{regarded}} that event, {{was in the same}} position as herself, she frequently did express her feelings, declaring how awful to her was <b>the</b> responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> was about to do. [...] "Of course that's quite true," [...] said Florence, [...] "but it doesn't make one doubt that one is right to marry." ...|$|R
60|$|A sudden gravity descended upon Jill. The {{words had}} {{reminded}} her <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>she</b> was perpetually striving {{to keep out}} of her thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Might {{he never}} have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let him go to Nottingham?" [...] was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>things</b> <b>she</b> asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} {{to put it into}} her power to do some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> wants. She wants to see the world for instance. I {{should like to}} put money in her purse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I can’t {{tell you}} all the things she’d say, but I think I can tell you most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> wouldn’t. She wouldn’t reason out her conduct as you {{seem to me to}} do.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then as it's one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> {{has never}} told me either, we shall {{probably}} never know it; and we may regard it as none of our business. There are many things," [...] said Mrs. Assingham, [...] "that we shall never know." ...|$|E
6000|$|What {{would they}} think? How would they look? What conceivably might they not say? Something <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had done, became manifest to her. She felt first intimations of regret. They {{would all be}} watching, Mother, Daffy, Lady Petchworth. She would reappear with this victim visibly suffering beside her. What could she say to straighten his back and lift his chin? She could think of nothing. Ahead at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaded path {{she could see the}} copious white form, the agitated fair wig and red sunshade of Lady Petchworth---- ...|$|R
50|$|Although Greta's {{grandparents}} Katherine (Ellen Burstyn) and Joseph (Michael Murphy) are initially {{concerned about}} her boyfriend's criminal past, Julie proves himself worthy of their trust and demonstrates that he truly does care for Greta. Joseph tells him about Greta's father, who committed suicide in front of Greta when she was very young. Julie also demonstrates his respect for Greta when she attempts to lose her virginity to him. He tells her {{he will not be}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> checks off <b>of</b> her 'To Do List' and {{that it has to be}} another time.|$|R
60|$|Speechless I {{stared at}} her a moment, so taken was I with <b>the</b> immensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> suggested. Fear, amazement, and joy jostled one another for <b>the</b> {{possession}} <b>of</b> my mind.|$|R
6000|$|And yet to {{what end}} was all her study, she thought, during these later years? Could it be applied to doing him good? Her {{indifferent}} talent as a musician seemed the only talent which gave him joy. He cared nothing--knew nothing, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> loved and thought about! ...|$|E
60|$|When she arose {{only the}} ashen stake {{lay on the}} ground, the meat was gone. So she went back, to fast through the night with Ugh-lomi; and Ugh-lomi was angry with her, because she had no food for him; but she told him nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> had seen.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Lander {{had taken}} twice of a {{specific}} for what she called her nerve-fag before her husband came with Clementina, and had rehearsed aloud many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> meant {{to say to the}} girl. In spite of her preparation, they were all driven out of her head when Clementina actually appeared, and gave her a bow like a young birch's obeisance in the wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mis'ess's niece is upon <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things,</b> and <b>she</b> says that's {{enough that}} I've offered ye, you great miser, and she won't pay any more." [...] These were the waggoner's words.|$|R
60|$|He left {{a tumultuous}} Cynthia, amazement and repentance {{struggling}} with anger, which forbade her calling him back: pride in her answering to pride in him, and she rejoicing fiercely {{that he had}} pride. Had he but known it, every step he took away from her that evening was a step in advance, and she gloried {{in the fact that}} he did not once look back. As she walked toward Coniston, the thought came to her that <b>she</b> was rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had stirred up, perhaps forever, and the thrush burst into his song once more.|$|R
50|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with Closer magazine, Merna said {{that having a}} breast enlargement at <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> twenty-one was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best <b>things</b> <b>she</b> ever did and that it gave her so much confidence.|$|R
60|$|She {{asked them}} about the social life in the village, and they told her that a good many new people had really settled there, {{but they did not}} know whether she would like them; they were not the old Hatboro' style. Annie showed them some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> had brought home, {{especially}} Roman views, and they said now she ought to give an evening in the church parlour with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he added, [...] "some of {{her ideas}} and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> says might jar on you, but that doesn't count for very much, after all. The girl's staunch all through, {{and the way}} she has stuck to Winthrop in his trouble {{and the way she}} has run the farm would compel the respect of any one who {{understood}} what she has had to put up with." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her sharply. It was three weeks since his first visit, and she had then less than seven pounds. Suspicion seized him. He remembered some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> had said. He put two and two together. He {{wondered}} whether she had made any attempt to find work. Perhaps she had been lying to him all the time. It was very strange that her money should have lasted so long.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] Mary assured him, laughing. [...] "It was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>things</b> <b>she</b> mentioned. When I {{told her that}} I should ask any one to tea I liked she was {{positively}} indignant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Murder, quotha! Who {{talks of}} murder?" [...] Her shrewd eyes searched his face. [...] "How came you by your {{knowledge}} that this courier rode to Mr. Wilding?" [...] {{she asked him}} suddenly, and the swift change that overspread his countenance showed {{her that she had}} touched him in a tender spot, assured her <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had suddenly come to suspect--a suspicion which at the same time started from and explained much that had been mysterious in Richard's ways of late. [...] "You had knowledge of this conspiracy," [...] she pursued, answering her own question before he had time to speak, [...] "because you were one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspirators." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} written by Lori McKenna. In an {{interview}} with CMT published in July 2016, McKenna revealed the song was written for her husband and their five kids and is her list <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to make sure}} she’d told them.|$|R
