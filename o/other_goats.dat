60|$|Now, {{what must}} we {{conclude}} {{with respect to}} such sexual differences as these? No one will pretend that the beards of certain male goats, or the dewlaps of the bull, or the crests of hair along the backs of certain male antelopes, are of any use to them in their ordinary habits. It {{is possible that the}} immense beard of the male Pithecia, and the large beard of the male orang, may protect their throats when fighting; for the keepers in the Zoological Gardens inform me that many monkeys attack each other by the throat; but it is not probable that the beard has been developed for a distinct purpose from that served by the whiskers, moustache, and other tufts of hair on the face; and no one will suppose that these are useful as a protection. Must we attribute all these appendages of hair or skin to mere purposeless variability in the male? It cannot be denied that this is possible; for in many domesticated quadrupeds, certain characters, apparently not derived through reversion from any wild parent form, are confined to the males, or are more developed in them than in the females-- for instance, the hump on the male zebu-cattle of India, the tail of fat- tailed rams, the arched outline of the forehead in the males of several breeds of sheep, and lastly, the mane, the long hairs on the hind legs, and the dewlap of the male of the Berbura goat. (18. See the chapters on these several animals in vol. i. of my 'Variation of Animals under Domestication;' also vol. ii. p. 73; also chap. xx. on the practice of selection by semi-civilised people. For the Berbura goat, see Dr. Gray, 'Catalogue,' ibid. p. 157.) The mane, which occurs only in the rams of an African breed of sheep, is a true secondary sexual character, for, as I hear from Mr. Winwood Reade, it is not developed if the animal be castrated. Although we ought to be extremely cautious, as shewn in my work on 'Variation under Domestication,' in concluding that any character, even with animals kept by semi-civilised people, has not been subjected to selection by man, and thus augmented, yet in the cases just specified this is improbable; more especially as the characters are confined to the males, or are more strongly developed in them than in the females. If it were positively known that the above African ram is a descendant of the same primitive stock as the other breeds of sheep, and if the Berbura male-goat with his mane, dewlap, etc., is descended from the same stock as <b>other</b> <b>goats,</b> then, assuming that selection has not been applied to these characters, they must be due to simple variability, together with sexually- limited inheritance.|$|E

5000|$|A {{study by}} Queen Mary University reports that goats try to {{communicate}} {{with people in the}} same manner as domesticated animals such as dogs and horses. Goats were first domesticated as livestock more than 10,000 years ago. Research conducted to test communication skills found that the goats will look to a human for assistance when faced with a challenge that had previously been mastered, but was then modified. Specifically, when presented with a box, the goat was able to remove the lid and retrieve a treat inside, but when the box was turned so the lid could not be removed, the goat would turn and gaze at the person and move toward them, before looking back toward the box. This is the same type of complex communication observed by animals bred as domestic pets, such as dogs. Researchers believe that better understanding of human-goat interaction could offer overall improvement in the animals' welfare. The field of Anthrozoology has established that domesticated animals have the capacity for complex communication with humans when in 2015 a Japanese scientist determined that levels of oxytocin did increase in human subjects when dogs were exposed to a dose of the [...] "love hormone", proving that the Human Animal Bond does exist. This is the same affinity that was proven with the London study above; goats are intelligent, capable of complex communication, and able to form bonds.

40|$|AbstractThe insulin-like {{growth factor}} binding {{proteins}} (IGFBPs) are determinants of local IGF-effects {{and thus have}} an impact on growth and metabolism in vertebrate species. In farm animals, IGFBPs are associated with traits such as growth rate, body composition, milk production, or fertility. It may be assumed, that selective breeding and characteristic phenotypes of breeds are related to differential expression of IGFBPs. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of selective breeding on blood IGFBP concentrations of farm animals. Breeds of the sheep, goat, and cattle species were investigated. IGFBP- 3, - 2, and - 4 were analyzed with quantitative Western ligand blotting (qWLB), enabling comprehensive monitoring of intact IGFBPs with IGF-binding capacity. We show that in sera of all species and breeds investigated, IGFBP- 3, - 2, and - 4 were simultaneously detectable by qWLB analysis. IGFBP- 3 and the total amount of IGFBPs were significantly increased (P< 0. 05) in Cameroon sheep, if compared to 3 of 4 other sheep breeds, as well as in Dwarf goats versus Toggenburg and Boer goats (P< 0. 01). IGFBP- 2 was elevated in Cameroon sheep and Boer goats, if compared to other breeds of these species (P< 0. 01), respectively. Holstein Friesian dairy cows had higher levels of IGFBP- 4 (P< 0. 05), if compared to conventional crossbreeds of beef cattle. In Dwarf goats the ratio of IGFBP- 3 /IGFBP- 2 was about 3 -fold higher than in <b>other</b> <b>goat</b> breeds (P< 0. 001). The total IGFBP amount of Toggenburg goats was reduced (P< 0. 05), compared to the <b>other</b> <b>goat</b> breeds. In conclusion, our data indicate that common and specific features of IGFBP fingerprints are found in different ruminant species and breeds. Our findings may introduce quantitative Western ligand blotting as an attractive tool for biomarker development and molecular phenotyping in farm animal breeds...|$|R
