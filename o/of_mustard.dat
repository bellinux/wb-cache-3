5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies <b>of</b> <b>mustard</b> gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning <b>of</b> <b>mustard</b> seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E

5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United States should tell Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those <b>of</b> <b>mustard</b> gas and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1986 U.S. attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production <b>of</b> <b>mustard</b> gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denying it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. A number of assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in Misrata, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.|$|E

40|$|Mustards, {{including}} sulfur mustards {{and nitrogen}} mustards, form {{a class of}} cytotoxic, vesicant chemical warfare agents. Mustards have also been used to treat cancer and played {{a vital role in}} the development of chemotherapy. Additionally, because of their destructive properties, ease of synthesis, and the lack <b>of</b> effective antidotes, <b>mustards</b> are unquestionably terrorist threats. Therefore, quick and convenient detection <b>of</b> <b>mustards</b> is a critical issue. In the present study, we achieved detection <b>of</b> various <b>mustards</b> on the basis of their chemical reactivity by using engineered alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) protein pores as sensor elements. We describe four classes of reactions for detecting mustards. These reactions occur between mustards and thiol groups contributed by cysteine side-chains within the lumen of the alphaHL pore or on an internal molecular adapter. The approach is quick and straightforward. It can confirm the existence <b>of</b> <b>mustards</b> in as little as 10 min at 50 microM or lower...|$|R
