These {{can range from}} large quantities of weakly radioactive fresh fuel for power reactors, with the corresponding removal of highly radioactive spent fuel and <b>operational</b> <b>wastes,</b> to the shipment of small quantities of radioactive isotopes (“sources”) for medical, industrial or research purposes and their subsequent disposal.

In many of these cases, circumstances will dictate that consignments are dispatched overland, or by air, but there are some cases where a substantial maritime component is entailed and where there will be particular security and safety concerns that arise from that.

40|$|Operational {{radioactive}} waste is generated during routine operation of NPP. Process waste is mainly generated by treatment {{of water from}} reactor or ancillaries including spent fuel storage pools and some decontamination operations. Typical process wastes of pressurized water reactors (PWR or WWER) are borated water concentrates, whereas typical process wastes of boiling and RBMK type reactors are water concentrates with no boron content. NPP <b>operational</b> <b>wastes</b> are classified as low and intermediate level waste (LILW).

Currently the most promising solidification method for this waste is the vitrification technology. Vitrification of NPP operational waste is a relative new option being developed for last years. Nevertheless there is already accumulated operational experience on vitrifying low and intermediate level waste in Russian Federation at Moscow SIA ''Radon'' vitrification plant. This plant uses the most advanced type induction high frequency melters that facilitate the melting process and significantly reduce the generation of secondary waste and henceforth the overall cost. The plant was put into operation by the end of 1999. It has three operating cold crucible melters with the overall capacity up to 75 kg/h. The vitrification technology comprises a few stages, starting with evaporation of excess water from liquid {{radioactive waste}}, followed by batch preparation, glass melting, and ending with vitrified waste blocks and some relative small amounts of secondary waste. First of all since the original waste contain as main component water, this water is removed from waste through evaporation. Then the remaining salt concentrate is mixed with necessary technological additives, thus a glass-forming batch is formed. The batch is fed into melters where the glass melting occurs. From here there are two streams: one is the glass melt containing the most part of radioactivity and second is the off gas flow, which contains off gaseous and aerosol airborne. The melt glass is fed into containers, which are slowly cooled in an annealing tunnel furnace to avoid accumulation of mechanical stresses in the glass. Containers with glass are the final processing product containing the overwhelming part of waste contaminants. The second stream from melter is directed to gas purification system, which is a rather complex system taking into account the necessity to remove from off gas not only radionuclides but also the chemical contaminants. Operation of this purification system leads to generation of a small amount of secondary waste. This waste stream slightly contaminated with volatilized radionuclides is recycled in the same technological scheme. As a result only non-radioactive materials are produced. They are either discharged into environment or reused. Based on the experience gained during operation of vitrification plant one can conclude on high efficiency achieved through vitrification method. Another significant argument on vitrifying NPP operational waste is the minimal impact of vitrified radioactive waste onto environment. Solidified waste shall be disposed of into a near surface disposal facility. Waste forms disposed of in a near-surface wet repository eventually come into contact with groundwater. Engineered structures used or designed to prevent or postpone such contact and the subsequent radionuclide release are complex and often too expensive. Vitrification technologies provide waste forms with excellent resistance to corrosion and gave the basic possibility of maximal simplification of engineered barrier systems. The most simple disposal option is to locate the vitrified waste form packages directly into earthen trenches provided the host rock has the necessary sorption and confinement properties. Such an approach will significantly make simpler the disposal facilities thus contributing both to enhancing safety and economic al efficiency...|$|E

Current railcar inspection practices are intended to identify defects prior to failure, but they generally do not provide predictive maintenance capabilities due to the limitations of manual, visual inspection. As a result, automated condition monitoring technologies (ACMT) {{have been developed to}} monitor rolling stock condition and facilitate predictive maintenance strategies. Through improved railcar condition monitoring, these technologies have the potential to reduce: equipment-caused derailments and in-service failures (ISFs), train delays and variability in mainline operations, and <b>operational</b> <b>waste</b> in railroad terminals. In this thesis, I applied lean manufacturing methods to the railcar maintenance process, quantifying both direct and indirect waste. To assess benefits to mainline efficiency, I used dispatch simulation software to quantify the length and variability of equipment-caused ISFs as a function of traffic level. To assess benefits to terminal efficiency, I compared the railroad terminal to a manufacturing production system and used lean production techniques to identify sources of waste and variability. The results of these analyses indicate that the cost-savings from improved mainline and terminal efficiency through the use of ACMT are comparable in scale to the cost-savings from the potential reduction in equipment-caused derailments.

Two towns of peri-urban settlement in Thailand were investigated in case studies to compare eco-performance between the towns with and without implementation of the CBM program. MSW mass flows together with MSW utilization records were analyzed based on data in year 2013. Climate co-benefits from waste utilization activities were examined. Results from the study indicated that waste banks in the CBM program can effectively divert most of recyclables from entering landfills. The performance of “waste bank—recyclable recovery program” recycling rate from the case study with CBM is 172. 20 kg per member per year, which is about 926 % higher than average CBMs with MSW recycling in Thailand, {{and the success of}} CBM can be attributed to its curbside pickup service and fair-pricing of recyclables. The study also found that if the town decided to divert wastes from landfilling, carbon intensity of the MSW system would be 0. 47 tons of CO 2 -eq per ton of collected MSW. The landfilling cost would be approximately 7. 41 USD per ton of MSW as landfilling cost. With CBM programs, current MSW reutilization rate has achieved 9. 68 % of generated waste, and 16. 80 % of GHG emission has been avoided, along with a reduction in landfill costs of 11. 57 %.

The use of site-specific data on full scale waste treatment facilities and {{the adoption of a}} participatory approach for the definition of the most sensible LCA assumptions are used to assist local public administrators and stakeholders showing them that LCA can be <b>operational</b> to <b>waste</b> management at local scal...|$|R

The present paper proposes to illustrate how integrating a transport system from the start may influence <b>operational</b> choices of <b>waste</b> management...|$|R
