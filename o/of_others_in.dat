5|$|Following The Painted Hills in 1951, MGM {{executives}} felt Lassie had run her {{course and}} planned no future films featuring the character. MGM executives then sought {{a way to}} break Weatherwax's contract. Weatherwax was concerned about protecting Pal and the Lassie image he had created from future diminishment at the hands <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> lieu of US$40,000 in back pay owed him by the studio, Weatherwax bargained for and received the Lassie name and trademark.|$|E
5|$|The Manual of the Mother Church {{prohibits the}} church from {{publishing}} membership figures, {{but it does}} provide the names of Christian Science practitioners, Scientists trained to offer Christian Science prayer on behalf <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> 1941 there were 11,200 practitioners in the United States, against 965 in 2015 (1,249 worldwide). Stark writes that clusters of practitioners listed in the Christian Science Journal in 1998 {{were living in the}} same retirement communities.|$|E
5|$|The {{involvement}} of Dante and Petrarch {{in establishing the}} sestina form, together with the contributions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> the country, account for its classification as an Italian verse form—despite not originating there. The result was that the sestina was re-imported into France from Italy in the 16th century. Pontus de Tyard was the first poet to attempt the form in French, {{and the only one}} to do so prior to the 19th century; he introduced a partial rhyme scheme in his sestina.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum as well {{as other}} trilliums are a favored food of white-tailed deer. Indeed, if trilliums are {{available}} deer will seek these plants, with a preference for T. grandiflorum, to the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> the course of normal browsing, deer consume larger individuals, leaving shorter ones behind. This information can be used to assess deer density and its effect on understory growth in general.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 92 percent of {{assessed}} streams in the watershed of Muncy Creek are inhabited by trout. Of the inhabited streams, 82 percent are inhabited only by brook trout, nine percent are inhabited by only brown trout, and nine percent are inhabited by both brook trout and brown trout. A number of tributaries {{of the creek}} are designated as high-quality coldwater fisheries. These include Lick Run, Roaring Run, Rock Run, and Spring Run in Lycoming County and Big Run, Trout Run, and a number <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> Sullivan County.|$|E
5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> a wide variety of interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E

5|$|Hitler's {{leadership}} style {{was to give}} contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently. Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders. Bormann used his position to control {{the flow of information}} and access to Hitler, earning him enemies, including Himmler.|$|E
5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>in</b> the hope of {{reducing the risk of}} being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them more visible to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matt black was found to be the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our {{image of her}} is largely through the eyes <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> <b>in</b> {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction {{of the effect of}} consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E

In 2008, the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina indicted {{two members of}} the VRS for war crimes committed against Bosniaks in September 1992, citing the killing of 23 Bosniak civilians and wounding of a number <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> 2010, the Prosecutor's Office began an investigation against seven members of the ARBiH, HVO, and HOS on suspicion that they committed war crimes between 27 May and 29 October 1992 against 35 Serb civilians, including the murder of at least 15.|$|E
5|$|The fake will {{in which}} the Shunzhi Emperor had {{supposedly}} expressed regret for abandoning Manchu traditions gave authority to the nativist policies of the Kangxi Emperor's four regents. Citing the testament, Oboi and the other regents quickly abolished the Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus. Over the next few years, they enhanced {{the power of the}} Imperial Household Department, which was run by Manchus and their bondservants, eliminated the Hanlin Academy, and limited membership in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers to Manchus and Mongols. The regents also adopted aggressive policies toward the Qing's Chinese subjects: they executed dozens of people and punished thousands <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> the wealthy Jiangnan region for literary dissent and tax arrears, and forced the coastal population of southeast China to move inland in order to starve the Taiwan-based Kingdom of Tungning run by descendants of Koxinga.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} {{increased}} environmental {{concern in the}} Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near Leningrad, Moscow, and Odessa and collected data on the prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the Kyshtym disaster, which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an explosion at a nuclear plant. Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's antinuclear petition. Soviet political elites did not share the concerns <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> Soviet Union, however; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Coon {{decides to}} rid the town of Mysterion, enlisting the help of Professor Chaos (Butters) and his sidekick General Disarray (Dougie). Unlike the Coon, Professor Chaos and General Disarray have become as {{familiar}} to the residents of South Park as Mysterion. Butters also wants to know the identity of Mysterion but can only narrow the list of suspects to the boys from Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class whose shapes do not differ greatly from that <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, he has nearly pinned down Coon's identity to a few fat celebrities, and Cartman. In a scheme to uncover Mysterion's identity, the Coon convinces Professor Chaos to threaten {{the destruction of a}} hospital unless Mysterion reveals his identity. After the Coon plants the TNT and leaves to buy detonators, Mysterion unexpectedly arrives. He points out that this is not Professor Chaos' usual style, and fights Professor Chaos and General Disarray on top of the building. A crowd forms below and cheers on Mysterion as the police take no actions, believing that their bullets are no match for Professor Chaos' aluminum foil armor. Dramatically, the Coon appears to fight on the side of Mysterion, with the hopes that he too will be hailed as a hero. At that point, Professor Chaos and General Disarray run off in defeat. After their victory, the Coon convinces Mysterion to unmask himself by claiming such threats to public safety will continue until Mysterion's secret is revealed.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer stereo vision and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where the camera was unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works <b>of</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E
5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> <b>In</b> any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E
