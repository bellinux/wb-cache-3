40|$|The {{water ice}} or <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> {{is one of}} the key {{properties}} of protoplanetary disks that determines the water content of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone. Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass accretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in the disk. We calculate the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> location from recent observations of mass accretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed dispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial disk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> locations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass accretion rates of 0. 4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> locations of 0. 2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> location among solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more realistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> is located up to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of N-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial planets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion in <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like dust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around sun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of low-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The closer-in <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the habitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars. Considering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host most of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are able to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution.

The regularity of the disk temperatures indicates an underlying structure that may be linked to the water <b>snow</b> <b>line.</b> If the dust is generated from collisions in an exo-asteroid belt, the dust will likely trace the location of the water <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> in the primordial protoplanetary disk where planetesimal growth was enhanced.

40|$|We {{model the}} {{evolution}} of the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> in a protoplanetary disc. If the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) drives turbulence throughout the disc, there is a unique <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> outside of which the disc is icy. The <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> moves closer to the star as the infall accretion rate drops. Because the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> moves inside the radius of the Earth's orbit, the formation of our water-devoid planet is difficult with this model. However, protoplanetary discs {{are not likely to be}} sufficiently ionised to be fully turbulent. A dead zone at the mid-plane slows the flow of material through the disc and a steady state cannot be achieved. We therefore model {{the evolution of}} the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> also in a time-dependent disc with a dead zone. As the mass is accumulating, the outer parts of the dead zone become self gravitating, heat the massive disc and thus the outer <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> does not come inside the radius of the Earth's orbit, contrary to the fully turbulent disc model. There is a second, inner icy region, within the dead zone, that moves inwards of the Earth's orbit after a time of about 10 ^ 6 yr. With this model there is sufficient time and mass in the disc for the Earth to form from water-devoid planetesimals at a radius of 1 AU. Furthermore, the additional inner icy region predicted by this model may allow for the formation of giant planets close to their host star without the need for much migration.

40|$|Molecular <b>snow</b> <b>lines</b> in protoplanetary disks {{have been}} studied {{theoretically}} for decades because of their importance in shaping planetary architectures and compositions. The water <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> lies in the planet formation region at < 10 AU, and so far its location has been estimated only indirectly from spatially-unresolved spectroscopy. This work presents a proof-of-concept method to directly image the water <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> in protoplanetary disks through its physical and chemical imprint in the local dust properties. We adopt a physical disk model that includes dust coagulation, fragmentation, drift, and a change in fragmentation velocities of a factor 10 between dry silicates and icy grains as found by laboratory work. We find {{that the presence of}} a water <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> leads to a sharp discontinuity in the radial profile of the dust emission spectral index α_mm, due to replenishment of small grains through fragmentation. We use the ALMA simulator to demonstrate that this effect can be observed in protoplanetary disks using spatially-resolved ALMA images in two continuum bands. We explore the model dependence on the disk viscosity and find that the spectral index reveals the water <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> {{for a wide range of}} conditions, with opposite trends when the emission is optically thin rather than thick. If the disk viscosity is low (α_visc < 10 ^- 3) the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> produces a ring-like structure with a minimum at α_mm 2 in the optically thick regime, possibly similar to what has been measured with ALMA in the innermost region of the HL Tau disk.

40|$|In a protoplanetary disk, {{the inner}} {{edge of the}} region where the {{temperature}} falls below the condensation temperature of water {{is referred to as}} the 'snow line'. Outside the <b>snow</b> <b>line,</b> water ice increases the surface density of solids by a factor of 4. The mass of the fastest growing planetesimal (the 'isolation mass') scales as the surface density to the 3 / 2 power. It is thought that ice-enhanced surface densities are required to make the cores of the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) before the disk gas dissipates. Observations of the Solar System's asteroid belt suggest that the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> occurred near 2. 7 AU. In this paper we revisit the theoretical determination of the <b>snow</b> <b>line.</b> In a minimum-mass disk characterized by conventional opacities and a mass accretion rate of 10 ^- 8 solar masses per year, the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> lies at 1. 6 - 1. 8 AU, just past the orbit of Mars. The minimum-mass disk, with a mass of 0. 02 solar, has a life time of 2 million years with the assumed accretion rate.

40|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that {{asteroid}} belts may be important both {{for the existence of}} life and perhaps even for the evolution of complex life on a planet. Using numerical models for protoplanetary discs we calculate the location of the <b>snow</b> <b>line,</b> and we propose that asteroid belts are most likely to form in its vicinity. We then show that observations of warm dust in exo-solar systems, thought to be produced by collisions between asteroids in a belt, indicate that asteroid belts (when they exist), indeed coincide with the radial location and the temperature of the <b>snow</b> <b>line.</b> Giant planets form outside the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> and prevent planet formation just inside of their orbit creating an asteroid belt there. However, the migration of giant planets through the asteroid belt likely disperses the compact formation. We examine existing observations of giant exo-planets and find that less than 4 % are at radial locations outside of the <b>snow</b> <b>line.</b> This definitely may be the consequence of observational selection effects. However, with this caveat in mind, we point out that the dearth of giant planets outside the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> may also suggest that compact asteroid belts are not common, and more speculatively that complex life may not expected in most of the currently observed systems.

Locating the CO <b>snow</b> <b>line,</b> where the CO gas column density is expected to drop substantially, based solely on CO emission profiles is challenging. This has prompted an exploration of chemical signatures of CO freeze-out. We present ALMA Cycle 1 observations of the N 2 H+ J= 3 - 2 and DCO+ J= 4 - 3 emission lines toward the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD~ 163296 at ~ 0. 5 " (60 AU) resolution, and evaluate their utility as tracers of the CO <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> location. The N 2 H+ emission is distributed in a ring with an inner radius at 90 AU, corresponding to a midplane temperature of 25 K. This result {{is consistent with a}} new analysis of optically thin C 18 O data, which implies a sharp drop in CO abundance at 90 AU. Thus N 2 H+ appears to be a robust tracer of the midplane CO <b>snow</b> <b>line.</b> The DCO+ emission also has a ring morphology, but neither the inner nor the outer radius coincides with the CO <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> location of 90 AU, indicative of a complex relationship between DCO+ emission and CO freeze-out in the disk midplane. Compared to TW Hya, CO freezes out at a higher temperature in the disk around HD 163296 (25 vs. 17 K in the TW Hya disk), perhaps due to different ice compositions. This highlights the importance of actually measuring the CO <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> location, rather than assuming a constant CO freeze-out temperature for all disks.

We demonstrate that the <b>snow</b> <b>line</b> radius is significantly larger than that predicted by a fully turbulent disc model, and that in our own solar system it remains outside of the orbital radius of the Earth.
