25|$|Henry VI, Part 1, {{possibly}} {{the work of}} a team of playwrights, whose identities we can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at. Some scholars argue that Shakespeare wrote less than 20% of the text.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of possible}} attack is the intercept-resend attack, where Eve measures the quantum states (photons) sent by Alice and then sends replacement states to Bob, prepared {{in the state}} she measures. In the BB84 protocol, this produces errors in the key Alice and Bob share. As Eve has {{no knowledge of the}} basis a state sent by Alice is encoded in, she can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> which basis to measure in, {{in the same way as}} Bob. If she chooses correctly, she measures the correct photon polarization state as sent by Alice, and resends the correct state to Bob. However, if she chooses incorrectly, the state she measures is random, and the state sent to Bob cannot be the same as the state sent by Alice. If Bob then measures this state in the same basis Alice sent, he too gets a random resultas Eve has sent him a state in the opposite basis—with a 50% chance of an erroneous result (instead of the correct result he would get without the presence of Eve). The table below shows an example of this type of attack.|$|E

500|$|Q. David Bowers said of {{the sudden}} passage of the {{legislation}} [...] "We can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> what happened behind the scenes". Carothers wrote that Kasson had opposed nickel coinage, but nevertheless introduced the bill for it during the rush of {{the final day of}} the congressional session, [...] "There was no report and no explanation... The influences that brought about the passage of the measure in this fashion were never revealed." [...] Numismatic historian Don Taxay suggested that by March 3, 1865, [...] "the wide circulation of the bronze cent and two-cent piece had made a three-cent coin superfluous." ...|$|E
500|$|But {{where he}} will be missed the most will be among {{those people who have}} been sharers of his bounty. [...] Their name is legion. [...] He gave quietly, but he gave liberally. [...] It was true of him that he did not let his right hand know what his left hand did. [...] Very {{frequently}} the recipient of his bounty could <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> from whence the gift came. [...] He aided the needy in distress in thousands of ways. [...] He seemed to have some occult way of finding out that people needed assistance at certain times, and then he knew how to come to their aid without offending. [...] Hundreds whom the public would never dream had needed his assistance blessed his name as they gazed upon his features for the last time, because he came to them in a substantial way at a critical time. [...] This is where and by whom he will be missed the most. [...] Truly he was a great man.|$|E
2500|$|What he meant, {{explains}} Merrill, is {{that this}} version of combat is informed only by popular culture—by what he deems [...] "the liberal mentality"—that can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> and has not experienced.|$|E

2500|$|Rickman said: [...] "I can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at the {{pressures}} of funding an independent theatre company in New York, but calling this production [...] "postponed" [...] does not disguise {{the fact that it}} has been cancelled. This is censorship born out of fear, and the New York Theatre Workshop, the Royal Court, New York audiences - all of us are the losers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{report has}} raised controversy. When Oregon radio station KATU asked for {{comment on the}} CNW report, Professor John Heywood (with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)) saw merit in the study saying, [...] "It raises...some good questions" [...] but [...] "I can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at how they did the {{detailed}} arithmetic.... The danger is a report like this will discourage the kind of thinking we want consumers to do [...] - [...] should I invest in this new technology, should I help this new technology?" ...|$|E

6000|$|She turned around, {{apparently}} reassured. [...] "You are not {{to think}} that I have been told anything," [...] she said; [...] "I have <b>only</b> <b>guessed.</b> But when I looked at you, as you came in, I was sure I had guessed aright." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>only</b> <b>guessed</b> it," [...] {{returned}} Ruth with a laugh, [...] "and, you know, {{more than}} once you have hinted {{to me that you}} had got on very well--that God had prospered you--I think these were the words you have sometimes used." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{there are}} general rules for when to use on'yomi {{and when to}} use kun'yomi, the {{language}} is littered with exceptions, {{and it is not}} always possible for even a native speaker to know how to read a character without prior knowledge (this is especially true for names, both of people and places); further, a given character may have multiple kun'yomi or on'yomi. When reading Japanese, one primarily recognizes words (multiple characters and okurigana) and their readings, rather than individual characters, and <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> readings of characters when trying to [...] "sound out" [...] an unrecognized word.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amendment}} passed 68 to 30 {{with all}} opposition coming from Republicans including Vitter (all four female Republicans, six other Republicans and all present Democrats voted for passage). Vitter's 2010 Democratic Senatorial opponent Charlie Melancon criticized Vitter for his vote saying, [...] "David Vitter {{has refused to}} explain why he voted to allow taxpayer-funded companies to sweep rape charges under the rug. We can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> what his reasons were." [...] However, The Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker argued that the 30 senators were being [...] "unfairly smeared for doing the harder thing, maybe even for the right reasons." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{continued}} to divide critics. In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is [...] "more fun {{to think and}} write about {{than it is to}} actually listen to" [...] and [...] "far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer". In 2016, Dorian Lysnkey wrote in the Guardian: [...] "At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they’d merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac. As for its alleged millennial anxiety, Yorke had given up on coherent lyrics so one can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at what he was worrying about." ...|$|E

"Yet in your candour, mejuffrouw, {{you have}} told me much," [...] he said quietly, [...] "confirmed much that I <b>only</b> vaguely <b>guessed.</b> The Stadtholder's life is in peril and you hold in your feeble little hands the threads of the {{conspiracy}} which threatens him ... is that not why you are here, mejuffrouw ... a prisoner, as you say, at the good-will of my employer? I am <b>only</b> <b>guessing,</b> remember, but on your face, meseems that I can read that I do guess aright." ...|$|R

50|$|On {{the origin}} of the name of the city Bobrovytsia there is no {{reliable}} data. There are <b>only</b> <b>guesses</b> that the settlement was called such from the beaver crafts made in the city, near the Bistrica River {{to the middle of the}} 19th century which was called Bobrovytsia.|$|R
2500|$|The cantata was {{a highly}} {{successful}} genre in the early 18th century. The French cantata, which {{should not be confused}} with the Italian or the German cantata, was [...] "invented" [...] in 1706 by the poet Jean-Baptiste Rousseau and soon taken up by many famous composers of the day, such as Montéclair, Campra, and Clérambault. Cantatas were Rameau's first contact with dramatic music. The modest forces the cantata required meant it was a genre within the reach of a composer who was still unknown. Musicologists can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at the dates of Rameau's six surviving cantatas, and the names of the librettists are unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The Athletic Times {{described}} Roose as [...] "dexterous though daring, valiant though volatile". Spectators, {{observes the}} DWB, [...] "could only gaze in wonder at his prehensile grip, the immense {{power of his}} punch, and the prodigious length of his goal kicks; they could <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at the uncanny intuition by which he divined the aims of his opponents, the swift agile mind that worked behind the small, narrow eyes." [...] Geraint Jenkins, an Aberystwyth historian who wrote a brief biographical sketch of the goalkeeper in 2000, adds that Roose boasted [...] "sharp eyesight, startling reflexes, competitive instinct and reckless bravery", and was altogether [...] "an extraordinarily daunting opponent".|$|E
2500|$|Hermocrates {{is one of}} {{the persons}} {{appearing}} in Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias. Plato originally might have planned a third dialogue named Hermocrates, but failed to compose it. F. M. Cornford writes: [...] "Since the dialogue that was to bear his name was never written, we can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> why Plato chose him. It is curious to reflect that, while Critias is to recount how the prehistoric Athens of nine thousand years ago had repelled the invasion from Atlantis and saved the Mediterranean peoples from slavery, Hermocrates would be remembered by the Athenians as the man who had repulsed their own greatest effort at imperialist expansion." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fisher's {{original}} (Lady tasting tea) {{example was}} a one-tailed test. The null hypothesis was asymmetric. The odds of guessing all cups correctly {{was the same}} as guessing all cups incorrectly, but Fisher noted that <b>only</b> <b>guessing</b> correctly was compatible with the Lady's claim. (See the quotations below about his reasoning.) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{specification}} {{of the range}} and the prior distribution of parameters strongly benefits from previous knowledge about {{the properties of the}} system. One criticism has been that in some studies the “parameter ranges and distributions are <b>only</b> <b>guessed</b> based upon the subjective opinion of the investigators”, which is connected to classical objections of Bayesian approaches.|$|R
2500|$|Newton further {{defended his}} work {{by saying that}} had he first heard of the inverse square {{proportion}} from Hooke, he would still have some rights to it in view of his demonstrations of its accuracy. Hooke, without evidence {{in favor of the}} supposition, could <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> that the inverse square law was approximately valid at great distances from the center. According to Newton, while the 'Principia' was still at pre-publication stage, there were so many a-priori reasons to doubt the accuracy of the inverse-square law (especially close to an attracting sphere) that [...] "without my (Newton's) Demonstrations, to which Mr Hooke is yet a stranger, it cannot believed by a judicious Philosopher to be any where accurate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} swamp forests {{have almost}} entirely been removed as the plain {{has been converted}} to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including {{a large number of}} fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the sarus crane (Grus antigone) and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much-hunted Schomburgk's deer. Today we can <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area [...] would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in Phragmites marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability—or inability—in animals. Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli et al. (1990) presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from whom to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one {{of a variety of}} mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and can <b>only</b> <b>guess.</b> They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the [...] "knower". By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001) found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached. William Field and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh have no doubt that bonobos have developed ToM and cite their communications with a well known captive bonobo, Kanzi, as evidence.|$|E
