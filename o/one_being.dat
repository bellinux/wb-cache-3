5|$|A rogue unit of insurgents {{headed by}} Algirdas Klimaitis and {{encouraged}} by Germans from the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst, started anti-Jewish pogroms in Kaunas (Kovno) {{on the night}} of 25–26 June 1941. Over a thousand Jews perished {{over the next few days}} in what was the first pogrom in Nazi-occupied Lithuania. Different sources give different figures, <b>one</b> <b>being</b> 1,500 and another 3,800, with additional victims in other towns of the region.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 960 sorties {{had been made}} during the trials, {{including}} 1,366 takeoffs and landings, {{by the end of}} evaluations in November 1965. One aircraft was destroyed in an accident and six others were transferred to the United States, assigned the US designation XV-6A Kestrel, and underwent further testing. The two remaining British-based Kestrels were assigned to further trials and experimentation at RAE Bedford with <b>one</b> <b>being</b> modified to use the uprated Pegasus 6 engine.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} five pioneer battalions {{were raised by}} the AIF during the war, with <b>one</b> <b>being</b> {{assigned}} {{to each of the}} five infantry divisions that the Australians deployed to the battlefield in France and Belgium. The battalions consisted of four companies, under a headquarters company. To identify the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's personnel, they were issued with a purple and white Unit Colour Patch. The colours were in common with other Australian pioneer battalions, while the horizontal oval shape denoted that the unit was part of the 3rd Division.|$|E

5|$|Almost every {{episode of}} Dexter's Laboratory {{is divided into}} three {{different}} stories/segments, each <b>one</b> <b>being</b> approximately 8 minutes in length. Occasionally, the middle segment centered on characters from the Dexter's Laboratory universe other than Dexter and his family. Two of these segments were shown primarily during the first season: Dial M for Monkey and The Justice Friends. Dial M for Monkey was the middle segment for the first six episodes of season one, and The Justice Friends took its place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, <b>one</b> <b>being</b> significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Born in Beaufort, North Carolina, Taylor {{attended}} East Carteret High School, {{where his}} pitching ability {{caused him to}} be chosen by the New York Yankees with the first overall selection in the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft. After two full seasons in the minor leagues, he injured his shoulder in a fight, and was ineffective after returning to baseball. He retired in 2000, having never played a game above Class AA. Taylor was the second of two players to be picked first overall in the MLB draft to never reach the major leagues, the other <b>one</b> <b>being</b> Steve Chilcott.|$|E

5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although {{only a few of}} those who have spinal fusion experience good results. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of <b>one</b> <b>being</b> better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E

A custom house was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay, and a dry dock, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay.

5|$|In 1500, {{inspired}} by Palkuriki Somanatha (a bilingual poet in Kannada and Telugu), Singiraja synthesised an account {{on the life}} of Basavanna titled Maha Basavaraja Charitra (or Singiraja Purana), using the protagonist's vachana poems and giving details of his 88famous deeds, as well as information about his opponents in the court of Southern Kalachuri King BijjalaII. An eminent poet of this time was Guru Basava, known for his authorship of seven famous poems (Sapta Kavya), all but <b>one</b> <b>being</b> written in the shatpadi metre. He expounded on religious teachings in the form of formal discussions between the guru and disciple. His kavyas (classical epic poems) deal with spiritualism and extrasensory perception.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} year in Leipzig, Bach {{composed}} chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday, but for Easter he returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Nine of his cantatas for consecutive occasions in the period between Easter and Pentecost are based on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, this <b>one</b> <b>being</b> {{the first of the}} series especially written for Bach. He had possibly commissioned them in 1724 for his first cantata cycle but not composed them at that time, because of his exceptional workload in creating the St John Passion.|$|E
