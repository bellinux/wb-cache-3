40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master's {{thesis is}} to assess how the first {{criterion}} {{of the notion of}} State aid laid down in Article 107 (1) TFEU, that of aid having been granted by the Member State or through State resources, is interpreted. The purpose is to assess what the basic rules governing the interpretation and application of the criterion are, how the criterion has been interpreted and applied in practice, and what problematic aspects and challenges the application of the criterion has brought about. Instead of attempting to identify an exhaustive list of aid schemes in which the assessment of the criterion has been relevant, the focus of this thesis is on its interpretation through a series of interesting categories of aid schemes and recent examples of cases. The analysis of the research question relies primarily on the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The main rule guiding the interpretation of the criterion is simple: it consists of two cumulative subconditions. In order to fulfil the public <b>origin</b> <b>criterion,</b> a measure must be imputable to the State and granted through State resources. The concept of State is interpreted broadly. Nevertheless, case law shows that the application of this test in practice is not necessarily as clear as it may seem. Although the Court of Justice of the European Union has rendered a number of significant judgments on the matter in recent years, what the first criterion of Article 107 (1) TFEU actually means remains unclear. Aid schemes can be very complex in one way or another. For example, they might involve intermediary bodies or areas previously uncontested {{from the point of view}} of State intervention in terms of State aid control. Sometimes it can prove challenging to apply principles already laid down in case law to other schemes in a consistent manner. The difficulty of assessing public undertakings' actions in terms of the fulfilment of the criterion lies in the necessity of case-by-case assessments of whether the State has influenced an undertakings' actions. Applying the indicators for imputability in a clear, consistent and detailed way may prove challenging. It is evident that the issue of forgone revenue can be relevant in more creative schemes than one would think. The issue of private bodies and private resources involved in aid schemes is particularly problematic due to the fluctuating results it has led to and the seemingly illogical outcomes of cases with very similar circumstances and effects. One of the challenges regarding the interpretation of the criterion is finding a balance between the influence of the organisational model chosen by the State for the execution of an aid scheme and the influence of the effects of the measure on its categorisation as State aid. Another important issue surrounding the interpretation of the criterion is whether its second leg, the requirement of the use of State resources, should be abandoned. Nevertheless, no clear signs of a permanent shift towards this approach have been witnessed. For the moment, the general principles surrounding the interpretation of the criterion are not so clear as to remove the need for a detailed case-by-case analysis of whether measures fulfil the criterion or eliminate the risk of surprising results for stakeholders and Member States. Clearer guidance on the interpretation of the criterion would be more than welcome in order to improve legal certainty...|$|E
40|$|What are infochemicals?Chemical {{compounds}} play {{an important}} role in interactions between organisms. Some of these chemicals are to the benefit (e. g. nutrients) or detriment (e. g. toxins) of an organism. Others are of benefit or detriment in an indirect way: through the behavioural response they elicit. The latter chemicals are termed infochemicals (chemicals that, in the natural context, convey information in an interaction between two individuals, evoking in the receiver a behavioural or physiological response that is adaptive to either one of the interactants or both; chapter 2). On an evolutionary time scale, the fate of an infochemical depends on selection pressures on each interactant. Selection pressure is determined by costs and benefits which result from all interactions of an organism in which the infochemical is involved. Yet, for pragmatic reasons, to analyse the function of an infochemical in the biology of an organism, a cost-benefit analysis is made for each interaction between two organisms separately. In this way the cost-benefit analysis is restricted to the smallest number of interactants possible, which ensures its simplicity. Consequently, for each interaction the infochemical is classified according to the corresponding costs and benefits for the two interactants (chapter 2; cf. Nordlund and Lewis, 1976). Moreover, classification also reflects whether the interaction under consideration is between conspecifics or between individuals of different species. This resulted in the terminology represented in Figure 1. 1 and Table 1. 1 (cf. chapter 2). Its structure and terms are based on those of semiochemicals. However, infochemical terminology differs from semiochemical terminology in two respects (chapter 2) :(1) Infochemical terminology regards compounds that convey information, whereas semiochemical terminology in addition also includes toxins (Whittaker and Feeny, 1971; Nordlund and Lewis, 1976; Nordlund, 1981). In some instances toxins or nutrients may convey information. If that is the case, these toxins and nutrients are classified as infochemicals when their role as information carrier is considered. When poisonous or nutritious aspects are considered, they are not classified as infochemicals, but as toxins and nutrients respectively. (2) Semiochemical terminology is based on origin of the compounds, in addition to the cost-benefit analysis. Although knowledge of the origin is Important to understand the interaction between two organisms, it may be very difficult to elucidate the origin (e. g. Brand et al., 1975; chapter 4). Therefore, application of the <b>origin</b> <b>criterion</b> may lead to ambiguities. Because the cost- benefit criterion by itself is good and useful, infochemical terminology is based on that criterion alone. Infochemicals in tritrophic systems. Infochemicals play a role in interactions between consecutive trophic levels (e. g plant-herbivore, phytophagous insect- entomophagous insect; Figure 1. 2) (e. g. Nordlund et al., 1981; Visser, 1986). Moreover, infochemicals may also mediate interactions between other trophic levels (e. g. plant-entomophagous insect; Figure 1. 2) (Price, 1981). Therefore, to understand the selection pressure on an organism, as a result of an infochemical, all trophic levels involved should be regarded. As a consequence, investigations of infochemicals in interactions between herbivores and their predators should also regard involvement of at least the first trophic level, the plant. The tritrophic system of this study: predatory mites, phytophagous mites and their host plants. The herbivore-predator system investigated most extensively in this thesis consists of phytophagous mites and predatory mites that occur in Dutch orchards. Figure 1. 3 a,b depicts the two most abundant phytophagous mites that occur as pest organisms in Dutch apple orchards: the apple rust mite, Aculusschlechtendali (Nalepa), and the European red spider mite, Panonychusulmi (Koch) (Van de Vrie, 1973; Van Epenhuijsen, 1981; Gruys, 1982). Several species of predatory mites occur in Dutch orchards. The most abundant of these are Typhlodromuspyri Scheuten (Figure 1. 3 c), Amblyseiusfinlandicus (Oudemans) and A. potentillae (Garman) (McMurtry & Van de Vrie, 1973; Overmeer, 1981; Gruys, 1982). All three species feed on P. ulmi and A. schlechtendali, as well as on other food sources such as several pollens (Overmeer, 1981; Kropczynska, 1970; Overmeer, 1985). In this system consisting of two phytophagous prey species and three predator species (Figure 1. 4 a), prey preference of the predators was investigated. Optimal foraging theory predicts that natural selection favours predators preferring prey species that are most profitable in terms of reproductive success (Krebs, 1978). Reproductive success is determined, among others, by development time, oviposition rate, mortality during development and offspring quality. Each of these components can be affected by the prey species consumed. As a first step in analysing which selection pressures may have moulded prey preference of the predatory mites in the system outlined above, I have tested whether prey preference is matched by the associated reproductive success. If this most simple explanation for prey preference does not hold, other explanations should be considered (see below). Do infochemicals play a role in prey preference ?Kairomones (Table 1. 1, Figure 1. 1) may inform predators on presence and identity of prey (Greany and Hagen, 1981) and thereby affect foraging decisions, such as where to search, how long to search at a specific site, which prey to accept and when to disperse on air currents (chapter 3). Investigation of the response to kairomones may therefore yield information on prey preference. However, the conclusion on prey preference must be restricted to the foraging phase that was studied. Relative costs involved in finding individuals of each prey species might differ for different foraging phases. Therefore, to obtain a comprehensive view of prey preference, several foraging phases should be investigated. Such analyses should be carried out independently to obtain complementary conclusions. In this study, prey preference was determined in three independent analyses. Two laboratory analyses were carried out:- Analysis of response towards volatile kairomones. This investigation regards decisions of the predators when prey individuals are not contacted, as is the situation after termination of aerial dispersal or after eradication of a prey patch. - Analysis of predation rates at different prey supplies. This relates to acceptance/rejection decisions during contacts with prey items. To complement the prey preference analyses carried out in the laboratory, an investigation was made under field conditions: - This was done by determination of diet composition by means of electrophoretic analysis of gut contents of field-collected predators. Spider-mite kairomones in a tritrophic context. Predatory mites distinguish plants infested by spider mites from clean plants by a volatile kairomone (e. g. Sabelis & Van de Baan, 1983). This kairomone seems to be a product of the interaction between plant and spider mites: after removal of spider mites from an infested plant, the plant remains attractive to the predators during several hours, whereas the mites alone do not remain attractive (Sabelis & Van de Baan, 1983; Sabelis et al., 1984 a). Current data on spider mite - predatory mite interactions do not explain the role of this infochemical in the biology of the spider mites (cf. chapter 3 for a review). It may, for instance, be an inevitable byproduct of damage inflicted on the plant by the spider mite, and/or have an indispensable function in the biology of the spider mite. Moreover, the plant may be involved in production of the infochemical. To elucidate the role of this volatile infochemical, its effects in interactions between plant and spider mite, between plant and predatory mite and between spider mites of one species should be investigated. Before this can be done, chemical identification of the infochemical is a necessary first step. These investigations were made for a tritrophic system consisting of Lima bean plants, the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychusurticae Koch and the predatory mite Phytoseiuluspersimilis Athias-Henriot (Figure 1. 4 b). This system was chosen for practical reasons. The plant and phytophagous mite can be reared throughout the year and therefore, this system is much more suitable to develop a method for the chemical analysis of spider-mite kairomones than a system in which the plant is a perennial. Origin and function of T. urticae kairomone in a tritrophic system. Two-spotted spider mites distinguish between a clean plant and a plant that is infested by conspecifics on the basis of a volatile infochemical (chapter 4). The spider mites move away from heavily infested leaves. This response is advantageous to spider mites on the infested leaf as well as to spider mites that avoid settling on these leaves: increased competition for food is avoided, cf. Wrensch and Young (1978). In addition, the spider mite that disperses thus avoids settling on a spot that has an increased risk of being detected by predatory mites (Sabelis and Van de Baan, 1983). Therefore, the infochemical in this interaction between conspecific spider mites is called a (+,+) dispersing pheromone. Biological evidence suggests that this pheromone is (at least partly) identical to the volatile kairomone to which predatory mites respond (chapter 4). Volatiles emitted from plants infested by T. urticae were identified and subsequent behavioural analyses resulted in identification of four kairomone components that attract the predatory mite P. persimilis : linalool (3, 7 -dimethyl- 1, 6 -octadiene- 3 -ol), methyl salicylate, (E) -β-ocimene (3, 7 -dimethyl- 1, 3 (E), 6 - octatriene) and 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3 (E), 7 -nonatriene. The structure of these compounds is shown in Figure 1. 5. At least two of these (linalool and methyl salicylate) are also components of a kairomone in the interaction between T. urticae and A. potentillae (when reared on V. faba pollen; see below) (chapter 4). Literature data on the behavioural response of T. urticae indicate that one of these kairomone components (linalool) is also a component of the (+,+) dispersing pheromone (Dabrowski and Rodriguez, 1971). All identified kairomone components are well-known in the plant kingdom. This suggests that the plant is involved in production of the infochemical, but it is no proof. It may for Instance be that spider-mite enzymes injected into the plant break down a plant compound. Investigation of e. g. site and moment of production and possible storage of precursors are needed as a next step to elucidate the role of the plant in kairomone production. However, suppose that it is the spider mite who produces the infochemical to serve as a dispersing pheromone. Then, it is not clear why this pheromone should necessarily consist of volatiles. As a result of the production of volatiles the spider mites incur more risks of being detected by predators than by production of non-volatile chemicals. Detection by predators inevitably leads to local extermination of spider mites (Sabelis and Van der Meer, 1986). For this reason it seems more likely that the volatiles are plant produced and that the spider mite makes the best of a bad job by using them as information to decide where not to colonize. To understand the evolution of plant-produced volatiles after herbivore attack, it is crucial to assess how they are produced, how much it costs to produce them and what the benefits are in terms of a lowered probability of herbivore attack. Involvement of volatile kairomones in prey preference of predatory mites. The response of T. pyri and A. potentillae to volatile kairomones is dependent on the diet of the predators. When reared on a carotenoid-poor diet these predators respond to the kairomones of more prey species than when reared on a carotenoid-rich diet (chapters 6, 7 and 8). Carotenoids are indispensable to A. potentillae because of their function in diapause induction (Overmeer, 1985 a). The function of these nutrients to T. pyri remains unknown (chapter 8). All prey species to whose kairomones carotenoid-deficient A. potentillae and T. pyri respond can relieve the lack of carotenoids. Carotenoid-containing A. potentillae and T. pyri only respond to the P. ulmi kairomone. The above observations were made for predators that were starved for 20 h. Longer starvation of predators reared on a carotenoid-rich diet also enlarges the number of prey species responded to. Investigations of the response to volatile kairomones indicates that A. potentillae and T. pyri (whether carotenoids are available or not) prefer P. ulmi to A. schlechtendali (chapters 6, 7 and 8) and that A. finlandicus has a reverse preference (chapter 11). This corresponds to conclusions from predation experiments performed at different composition of prey supply (chapters 9 and 11). The observed predation rates when mixed prey supplies were offered, were compared with a model provided with parameters estimated from experiments with each of both prey species alone. Amblyseiuspotentillae and T. pyri fed more on P. ulmi and A. finlandicus fed more on A. schlechtendali than was predicted by the model. This difference between observed and predicted predation rates cannot be explained by a change in behaviour of the prey species as a result of being together, nor by a change in walking behaviour of the predator. Therefore, these data indicate that A. potentillae and T. pyri prefer P. ulmi and that A. finlandicus prefers A. schlechtendali, in terms of a change in acceptance/rejection ratio ('success ratio'). Analysis of prey preference under field conditions showed that most T. pyri collected from apple leaves that widely varied in P. ulmi : A. schlechtendali numbers contained P. ulmi esterase, whereas A. schlechtendali esterase was present in a minor fraction of predators (chapter 10). Rust-mite esterase and P. ulmi esterase were found equally frequent in A. finlandicus. The data for A. finlandicus, obtained over a narrower range of prey-number ratios than for T. pyri, do not allow a definite conclusion on prey preference. However, they certainly do not cause rejection of the conclusion on prey preference as obtained in the laboratory analyses (chapter 11). No field data are available for A. potentillae. Because the conclusions on prey preference as determined in these independent analyses are consistent for each predator species, the inference on prey preference is firmly established. Prey preference and reproductive success of predatory mites in an orchard system with two species of phytophagous prey mites. Analysis of reproductive success of these three predator species, when feeding on either P. ulmi or A. schlechtendali, indicates that A. finlandicus selects the best prey species in terms of reproductive success. This predator species suffers high larval mortality on P. ulmi, but not on A. schlechtendali. This results in a much higher intrinsic rate of population increase when feeding on apple rust mites (chapter 12). Amblyseiuspotentillae and T. pyri would also do better by feeding preferentially on A. schlechtendali : development times when feeding on this prey species are shorter than when feeding on P. ulmi, whereas these prey species do not differentially affect mortality or oviposition rate (chapter 12). For A. potentillae this may not be the case at the end of the season because P. ulmi is a better prey species in terms of diapause induction. Thus, on the basis of current data, optimal prey-choice theory cannot satisfactorily predict actual prey peference of A. potentillae and T. pyri. Future investigations should concentrate on e. g. (1) possible effect of competition between prey species on prey availability, (2) possible effect of competition between predator species on prey availability, and (3) possible shift in prey preference during the season. ...|$|E

Since these droplets have S + Zn surface coatings with characteristics that fit a volcanic origin, {{the presence of}} similar coatings on dispersed droplets are taken as a good criterion of their volcanic <b>origin.</b> This <b>criterion</b> in concert with other criteria (homogeneity, absence of shocked relicts) that distinguish between volcanic and impact origins, has led to identification of a new ultramafic endogenous liquid that was erupted at Apollo 15. The brown glass droplets representing this liquid have a higher TiO 2 content and are more mafic {{than any of the}} Apollo 15 basalts...|$|R

Due to this safety the residence permit, based on article 29 d, of the Sierra Leonean are no longer valid. The project is meant to guide them pertaining their future. The research question is: what is effectiveness in the project “Sierra Leone, Future in Perspective and what factors can explain the level of effectiveness achieved in this process? Several network organizations {{are part of the}} project for their diverse expertise. The most important network organizations are Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg (GGZ), Stichting Rechtsbijstand Asiel (SRA) ABC Development, and Bureau Maatwerk bij Terugkeer. The counselors can send clients with serious traumas directly to GGZ, without talking to a doctor first. SRA will help with the flight story analysis and are open for questions and advise. ABC Development is the Sierra Leonean organizations, which helped with the meetings and send a delegation once in a while. Bureau Maatwerk bij Terugkeer is an organization which can help clients in setting up a future plan and providing with money and support in the country of <b>origin.</b> <b>Criteria,</b> indicators and conditions are used. The criteria are good guidance, good methodology and a successful return. The indicators measure these criteria. The conditions are possibly influencing the individual decision making process whether to return or not. All criteria used were relevant, but not all indicators and conditions. For example, the indicators for the successful return criteria; they must go back to the place they came from. If they hurt {{a lot of people in}} the place they came from, it wouldn’t be wise to send them back to that place, because people might want to take revenge. Also a few conditions were not relevant. Take gender for example; there were just about 3 women and 70 men, so you cannot make any judgments about that. ...|$|R

To do so, they should balance what to develop themselves {{and what to}} get from elsewhere, which may be software components or software services. These strategic decisions need to be aligned with business objectives and the capabilities and constraints of possible options. These sourcing options include: in-house, COTS, open source and outsourcing. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present an approach to support decision-makers in selecting appropriate types of origins in a specific case that maximizes the benefits of the selected business strategy. The approach consists of three descriptive models, as well as a decision process and a knowledge repository. The three models are a decision model that comprises three cornerstones (stakeholders, <b>origins</b> and <b>criteria)</b> and is based on a taxonomy for formulating decision models in this context, and two supporting models (property models and context models) ...|$|R
5000|$|As a {{literary}} theorist and critic, Gates has combined literary techniques of deconstruction with native African literary traditions; he draws on structuralism, post-structuralism, and semiotics to analyze texts and assess matters of identity politics. As a black intellectual and public figure, Gates {{has been an}} outspoken critic of the Eurocentric literary canon. He has insisted that black literature must be evaluated by the aesthetic criteria of its culture of <b>origin,</b> not <b>criteria</b> imported from Western or European cultural traditions that express a [...] "tone deafness to the black cultural voice" [...] and result in [...] "intellectual racism". In his major scholarly work, The Signifying Monkey, a 1989 American Book Award winner, Gates expressed what might constitute a black cultural aesthetic. The work extended application of the concept of [...] "signifyin'" [...] to analysis of African-American works. [...] "Signifyin'" [...] refers to the significance of words that is based on context, and is accessible only to those who share the cultural values of a given speech community. It is rooted African-American literary criticism in the African-American vernacular tradition.|$|R

TTR(Met 30) was not detected but other substitutions were demonstrated using isoelectric focusing techniques. One of the variants found is a basic TTR variant. The substitutions occurring in the variant TTRs of these two kindreds are not known and are presently under study...|$|R
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of interbeds in thick oil formations {{in one of}} the main reasons that cause the difference of remaining oil distribution. A quantitative method for predicting interbeds was proposed and the sedimentary <b>origin</b> and division <b>criterion</b> were demonstrated. The distribution of interbeds in different types of sedimentary sand bodies were predicted and analyzed by combining the theory of sedimentology and reservoir bed architectural-element analysis. The interbeds in a single well were recognized from high resolution well logs, and inter-well interbeds were predicted by using the methods of cyclothem correlation, physical properties truncation, and conditional simulation. Finally a 3 -D model of interbed was built. Application to the Gudao Oilfield was successful.|$|R
