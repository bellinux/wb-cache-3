5|$|Helium is {{the least}} {{water-soluble}} monatomic gas, {{and one of the}} least water-soluble of any gas (CF4, SF6, and C4F8 have lower mole fraction solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x2/10−5, respectively, versus helium's 0.70797 x2/10−5), and helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than that of any <b>other</b> <b>gas.</b> Helium has a negative Joule–Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule–Thomson inversion temperature (of about 32 to 50K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Saturn is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend from 6,630km to 120,700km outward from Saturn's equator, average approximately 20meters in thickness and are composed of 93% water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7% amorphous carbon. The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10m. While the <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is {{not well}} adsorbed by activated carbon. This should be of particular concern to those using the material in filters for respirators, fume hoods or <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> control systems as the gas is undetectable to the human senses, toxic to metabolism and neurotoxic.|$|E
25|$|Mining gas giants for helium-3 {{has also}} been proposed. The British Interplanetary Society's {{hypothetical}} Project Daedalus interstellar probe design was fueled by helium-3 mines in the atmosphere of Jupiter, for example. Jupiter's high gravity makes this a less energetically favorable operation than extracting helium-3 from the <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> giants of the solar system, however.|$|E
50|$|The {{purity of}} gas is an {{indication}} of the amount of <b>other</b> <b>gases</b> it contains. A high purity refers to a low amount of <b>other</b> <b>gases.</b> Gases of higher purity are considered to be of better quality and are usually more expensive.|$|R
5000|$|Alongside firedamp, other damps include blackdamp (carbon {{dioxide and}} <b>other</b> <b>gases),</b> poisonous, {{explosive}} stinkdamp (hydrogen sulfide), with its characteristic [...] "rotten egg" [...] odour, and the insidiously lethal afterdamp (carbon monoxide and <b>other</b> <b>gases)</b> produced following explosions of firedamp or coal dust.|$|R

25|$|Xenon short-arc lamps have a {{negative}} temperature coefficient like <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> discharge lamps. They are operated at low-voltage, high-current, DC and started with a high voltage pulse of 20 to 50kV. As an example, a 450 W lamp operates normally at 18 V and 25 A once started. They are also inherently unstable, prone to phenomena such as plasma oscillation and thermal runaway. Because of these characteristics, xenon short-arc lamps require a proper power supply.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourniquet}} cuff bladder {{requires a}} source of compressed gas to supply a carefully controlled amount of tourniquet pressure. The gas used may be ambient air, nitrogen, or some <b>other</b> <b>gas.</b> Most modern tourniquet systems utilize low-pressure gas provided by pumps, while a few systems use high-pressure gas sources. Note that nitrous oxide or oxygen should never be used to inflate the tourniquet cuff, because of the increased risk of fire.|$|E
25|$|Particulate {{scrubbers}} Wet scrubber {{is a form}} {{of pollution}} control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> streams. In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.|$|E

25|$|By the 1960s {{production}} of gas from coal was an obsolete technology. By 1963 the Geelong Gas Company had changed production methods, using an Onia Gegi reforming plant to convert hydrocarbon gases from the Shell oil refinery at Corio into town gas. The new reforming plant was visited by many <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> companies {{as an example}} of modern Syngas technology. The former coal carbonising equipment was only used when coke (a by-product of the gasification process) was required.|$|E
25|$|Simple-cycle or {{open cycle}} gas turbine plants, without a steam cycle, are {{sometimes}} installed as emergency or peaking capacity; their thermal efficiency is much lower. The high running cost per hour is {{offset by the}} low capital cost and the intention to run such units {{only a few hundred}} hours per year. <b>Other</b> <b>gas</b> turbine plants are installed in stages, with an open cycle gas turbine the first stage and additional turbines or conversion to a closed cycle part of future project plans.|$|E
25|$|High vacuum inside glass-walled {{cathode ray}} tubes permits {{electron}} beams to fly freely—without colliding into molecules of air or <b>other</b> <b>gas.</b> If {{the glass is}} damaged, atmospheric pressure can collapse the vacuum tube into dangerous fragments which accelerate inward and then spray at high speed in all directions. The implosion energy {{is proportional to the}} evacuated volume of the CRT. Although modern cathode ray tubes used in televisions and computer displays have epoxy-bonded face-plates or other measures to prevent shattering of the envelope, CRTs must be handled carefully to avoid personal injury.|$|E

25|$|An {{embolism}} is the lodging of an embolus, a blockage-causing {{piece of}} material, inside a blood vessel. The embolus {{may be a}} blood clot (thrombus), a fat globule (fat embolism), a bubble of air or <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> (gas embolism), or foreign material. An embolism can cause partial or total blockage of blood flow in the affected vessel. Such a blockage (a vascular occlusion) may affect {{a part of the}} body distant from where the embolus originated. An embolism in which the embolus is a piece of thrombus is called a thromboembolism. Thrombosis, the process of thrombus formation, often leads to thromboembolism.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{what is seen}} is not {{the black}} hole itself, but {{observations}} that are consistent only {{if there is a}} black hole present near Sgr A*. In the case of such a black hole, the observed radio and infrared energy emanates from gas and dust heated to millions of degrees while falling into the black hole. Although other possibilities exist for how these gases emanate energy, such as radiation pressure and interaction with <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> streams, interaction with a massive source of gravity is the simplest explanation. The black hole itself is thought to emit only Hawking radiation at a negligible temperature, on the order of 10−14 kelvin.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Uranus is heavily {{influenced}} by both its lack of internal heat, which limits atmospheric activity, and by its extreme axial tilt, which induces intense seasonal variation. Uranus's atmosphere is remarkably bland {{in comparison to the}} <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> giants which it otherwise closely resembles. When Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of ten cloud features across the entire planet. Later observations from the ground or by the Hubble Space Telescope made in the 1990s and the 2000s revealed bright clouds in the northern (winter) hemisphere. In 2006 a dark spot similar to the Great Dark Spot on Neptune was detected.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that the function of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is to improve the selectivity for methane [4]. Methane is inert compared to the <b>other</b> <b>gases</b> that are present. The PdO in the Pd/Al 2 O 3 layer can burn up the <b>other</b> <b>gases</b> (hydrogen, alcohol, carbon monoxide, etc.) completely, but not the methane that reaches the sensor part (SnO 2 thin layer). The formation of Pd changes the activity and selectivity of the Pd/Al 2 O 3 overlayer. Consequently, the selectivity decreases. Pd and PdO have different activation behaviors for hydrogen and <b>other</b> <b>gases</b> [31]. The PdO is necessary for the selective combustion and increases the selectivity.|$|R

25|$|A Stirling {{engine is}} a heat engine that {{operates}} by cyclic compression {{and expansion of}} air or <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> (the working fluid) at different temperatures, such {{that there is a}} net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanently gaseous working fluid. Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system, and regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the regenerator. The inclusion of a regenerator differentiates the Stirling engine from other closed cycle hot air engines.|$|E
25|$|The {{pipeline}} {{is operated}} {{at a higher}} pressure than <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> pipelines in the UK: 94 bar (1364 psi) instead of 85 bar (1231 psi). This pressure is higher than most standard pipelines worldwide and will increase the chance of pipe leak and corrosion, though other such high-pressure pipelines have been successfully run in Germany, for example. It is buried 1.2 metres underground {{for most of the}} route. National Grid replaced, levelled and cultivated the large amount of vegetation, subsoil and topsoil which had been removed to a width in places of a dual carriageway in an attempt to restore the land to its original condition. They consulted and used a wide range of environmental experts to help restore the environment.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, a new {{gas plant}} at Taylor, near Fort St. John, British Columbia, began {{supplying}} Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. This plant's practices differed from {{those used in}} Alberta {{in a number of}} ways. For example, although it generally required dehydration, sweetening and processing for liquid hydrocarbons, companies transported the natural gas from northeastern British Columbia long distances before processing it further. Consequently, while planning the Westcoast pipeline, the field operators agreed to process all the gas at a single facility, rather than have individual gas plants in every major production area. At 10 million cubic metres per day, the Taylor plant had the capacity to process as much natural gas as all eleven of the <b>other</b> <b>gas</b> plants operating in Canada combined. The plant was also by far Canada's most northerly. Heavily insulated buildings protected the processing facilities and allowed them to function at temperatures typical of more southerly climes.|$|E
