2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1957 the Italian teams quit Grand Prix racing citing {{increasing}} costs. In November 1957, with racing over, Gilera had McIntyre ride a 350 cc racer {{around the}} banked Monza circuit {{in an attempt to}} break the <b>one-hour</b> <b>speed</b> record, and he averaged [...] on the bumpy Monza surface. This record was not bettered until 1964, and then by Mike Hailwood at 144.8 on an MV Agusta, on the track at Daytona. In the 1961 Isle of Man TT Lightweight he raised the lap record to , and had a strong lead, when his engine seized, ending his race. Riding a Norton in the Senior TT he came second. He won the 1961 250cc Ulster Grand Prix. In the 1962 Isle of Man Lightweight TT, he raised the lap record to 99.61, and then retired with electrical problems. He also rode in Grand Prix races on Honda and Bianchi, making the podium in the Netherlands, Belgium, and East Germany.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Jenkins resumed racing. On July 20, 1951, his car skidded on {{a puddle}} of water and struck a row of course markers at a speed of nearly 200 mph. The {{radiator}} was punctured by the accident and Jenkins had to halt his overheating vehicle. He had stopped three minutes short of breaking a new <b>one-hour</b> <b>speed</b> record and {{at the age of}} 68, he {{decided it was time to}} retire.|$|E
50|$|In February 1964 during {{preparations}} for the US Grand Prix, Hailwood set a new <b>one-hour</b> <b>speed</b> record on the MV 500 cc recording an average speed of 144.8 mph on the oval-shaped, banked speed-bowl at the Daytona circuit. The previous record of 143 mph was set by Bob McIntyre on a 350 cc Gilera at Monza in 1957. Hailwood {{then went on to}} win the GP race, which carried World Championship points, in the afternoon of the same day.|$|E

5000|$|The Outdoor Life Network had Peyton fly {{throughout}} North America filming nature backdrops for a news info program. Peyton {{produced a}} <b>one-hour</b> show for <b>Speed</b> Vision titled [...] "The Rebirth of Civil Aviation". Peyton hosted BET's [...] "Jazz Central" [...] program, featuring {{many of his}} aerial [...] "Visual Music" [...] productions. This led to an appearance on the CNN Morning News, discussing music and aerial photography.|$|R
50|$|On {{the eastern}} end of the beach is Gongamati Reserved Forest, an {{evergreen}} mangrove forest and snippet of the original Kuakata. When the Rakhines settled in the area in 1784, Kuakata was part of the larger Sundarbans forest. However, the Sundarbans is now at a distance of <b>one-hour</b> by <b>speed</b> boat. As a mangrove forest, Gongamati, like the Sundarbans, offers some protection against tidal surges, however it too is being threatened by logging and deforestation. The best way to reach the forest is by foot or bike along the beach, where a flock of flag flying fishing boats can be seen trawling the coast. Choosing to visit Gangamati in the late afternoon is a perfect time to watch the sun cast shadows on the abstract exposed mangrove roots.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePeople {{with low}} vision, {{especially}} those with Central Field Loss (CFL), need magnification to read. The flexibility of Electronic Vision Enhancement Systems (EVES) offers several ways of magnifying text. Due to the restricted field of view of EVES, the need for magnification is conflicting {{with the need to}} navigate through text (panning). We have developed and implemented a real-time gaze-controlled system whose goal is to optimize the possibility of magnifying a portion of text while maintaining global viewing of the other portions of the text (condition 1). Two other conditions were implemented that mimicked commercially available advanced systems known as CCTV (closed-circuit television systems) —conditions 2 and 3. In these two conditions, magnification was uniformly applied to the whole text without any possibility to specifically select a region of interest. The three conditions were implemented on the same computer to remove differences that might have been induced by dissimilar equipment. A gaze-contingent artificial 10 ° scotoma (a mask continuously displayed in real time on the screen at the gaze location) was used in the three conditions in order to simulate macular degeneration. Ten healthy subjects with a gaze-contingent scotoma read aloud sentences from a French newspaper in nine experimental <b>one-hour</b> sessions. Reading <b>speed</b> was measured and constituted the main dependent variable to compare the three conditions. All subjects were able to use condition 1 and they found it slightly more comfortable to use than condition 2 (and similar to condition 3). Importantly, reading speed results did not show any significant difference between the three systems. In addition, learning curves were similar in the three conditions. This proof of concept study suggests that the principles underlying the gaze-controlled enhanced system might be further developed and fruitfully incorporated in different kinds of EVES for low vision reading...|$|R
