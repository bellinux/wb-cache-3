40|$|Abstract. The Stardust Mission {{collected}} {{samples from}} Comet 81 P/Wild 2 on 2 Jan 2004 and returned these samples to Earth on 15 Jan 2006. After recovery, a six month preliminary examination {{was done on}} {{a portion of the}} samples. Studies of the <b>organics</b> in the samples were made by the <b>Organics</b> Preliminary Examination Team (PET) - a worldwide group of over 55 scientists. This paper provides a brief overview of the findings of the <b>Organics</b> PET. <b>Organics</b> in the samples were studied using a multitude of analytical techniques including spatial deter-mination of C and heteroatom elemental abundances (STXM), functional group identification (micro-FTIR/Raman, C,N,O-XANES), and specific molecular identification of certain classes of <b>organics</b> (HPLC-LIF, L 2 MS, TOF-SIMS). Analyses were also made of spacecraft components and environmental samples collected near the recovered returned capsule to assess contami-nation issues. The distribution of <b>organics</b> (abundance, functionality, and relative elemental abundances of C,N,O) is heterogeneous both within and between particles. They are an un-equilibrated reservoir that experienced little parent body processing after incorporation into the comet. Some <b>organics</b> look like those seen in IDPs (and to a lesser extent, meteorites), while new aromatic-poor and highly labile <b>organics,</b> not seen in meteoritic materials, are also present. The <b>organics</b> are O,N-rich compared to meteoritic <b>organics.</b> Some of the <b>organics</b> have an interstellar heritage, as evidenced by D and 15 N enrichments...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{reports the}} {{adsorption}} mechanisms of aniline and toluene in dry and hydrated montmorillonite (MMT-Na and MMT-Na-W) and tetra-methylammonium-cation-modified MMT (MMT-TMA) as determined through density functional theory. These theoretical investigations explicitly demonstrate that cation-pi interactions between Na+/TMA(+) cations and aromatics play the {{key role in}} adsorption of <b>organics</b> over MMT-Na and MMT-TMA. Weak hydrogen bonds between the H atoms of <b>organics</b> and basal O atoms of tetrahedral silicate also stabilize the location of <b>organics.</b> The combination of interactions between water and basal O atoms and between <b>organics</b> and water molecules in hydrated MMT complexes strengthens the adsorption of <b>organics</b> on MMT, resulting in higher formation energies in hydrated organically intercalated MMTs than in the corresponding dry complexes. The adsorption of <b>organics</b> also changes frontier orbital distributions and consequently promotes the preferential occurrence of reactions on the <b>organics</b> {{rather than on the}} MMT layers. These adsorption mechanisms predicted by theoretical investigation can be used to explicate the adsorption of aromatic <b>organics</b> on aluminosilicates with different external environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{difference}} in membrane flux between direct membrane filtration and coagulation-membrane filtration, and investigates the removal of <b>organics</b> of different molecular weight by coagulation-membrane filtration process, in turn studies the fouling removal mechanism of coagulation process. The results indicate that for COD removal from raw water, coagulation is effective mainly on the <b>organics</b> of molecular weight higher than 10 kDa, and membrane filtration is effective mainly on the <b>organics</b> of molecular weight between 30 kDa and 100 kDa and higher than 100 kDa; as for UV 254 removal, coagulation is effective mainly on the <b>organics</b> of high molecular weight, and membrane filtration is effective mainly on the <b>organics</b> of molecular weight between 1 kDa and 100 kDa. Therefore, it proves that the high molecular <b>organics</b> are mainly responsible for the membrane fouling. </p...|$|R

5|$|In chemistry, {{one central}} issue was the {{distinction}} between <b>organic</b> and inorganic substances, especially {{in the context of}} <b>organic</b> transformations such as fermentation and putrefaction. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (vital) processes. However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field of <b>organic</b> chemistry—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that the <b>organic</b> world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the <b>organic</b> substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with diastase in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of enzymes was well established, though equations of chemical kinetics would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital <b>organic</b> material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the <b>organic</b> flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of <b>organic</b> material near continental margins.|$|E
