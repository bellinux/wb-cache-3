5|$|As soon as {{he arrived}} home, Etty began to work on {{ensuring}} he had at least <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He {{decided to return to}} a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness. Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo-Saxons, first published between 1799 and 1805, {{played a crucial role}} in promoting Anglo-Saxon studies, and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history, but his treatment of Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred. Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, there was not <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> of Æthelstan.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{miniature}} {{is an art}} form, {{which can}} be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes. The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was {{different from that of the}} nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in <b>one</b> <b>picture.</b> They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of using}} several {{exposures}} to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of luminance was pioneered {{as early as the}} 1850s by Gustave Le Gray to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea. Such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods, as the luminosity range was too extreme. Le Gray used one negative for the sky, and another one with a longer exposure for the sea, and combined the two into <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> in positive.|$|E
25|$|Music for {{parade and}} show bands is {{typically}} learned separately, in a concert band setting. It {{may even be}} memorized before any of the marching steps are learned. When rehearsing drill, positions and maneuvers are usually learned without playing the music simultaneously—a common technique for learning drill is to have members sing their parts or march to a recording produced during a music rehearsal. Many bands learn drill <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> or form at a time, and later combine these and add music.|$|E

25|$|Despite all the {{publicity}} she received, Cliff was actually quite camera shy, {{and in most cases}} the images of her pottery were what dominated the women's magazine of the day. <b>One</b> <b>picture</b> which shows Cliff informally was taken when a South African stockist of her ware, from Werner Brothers, visited the factory on a buying trip.

25|$|Les Baigneuses, {{along with}} other {{compositions}} by Gleizes and his fellow Salon Cubists from this period (1911-1912), tend to coordinate a variety of views of the same subject, or a multiplicity (in the Bergsonian sense) of different angles in <b>one</b> <b>picture.</b> This attempt clearly shows the importance of both the time element and the mobile properties in the sequence of events. According to Gleizes, the artist would accommodate either several successive moments in time projected onto a single space, or multiple spaces projected onto the canvas at the same time. These kinematic compositions that took into account both staticity and dynamism were not just a new description of the external world created by the artist, but also the inner world.|$|E
25|$|Mathis {{had been}} romantically linked to George Walsh and Rex Ingram; however, she {{returned}} from Italy engaged to an Italian cinematographer named Sylvano Balboni (sometimes spelled as Silvano Balboni). The couple married on December 20, 1924, at the Mission of St. Cecilia, in Riverside, California. After her return, First National hired her as editorial director. She also scripted several successful Colleen Moore pictures including Sally, The Desert Flower, and Irene. Mathis remained at First National for two years, but left over limitations and signed with United Artists; {{with her husband}} she made <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> for them, The Masked Woman. The Magic Flame (1927) would be her last picture, {{and one of her}} best, due in part to Ronald Colman's performance and Henry King's direction.|$|E

25|$|The wife of Walter James Ferris {{formally}} {{identified several}} Polaroid pictures found at Berdella's property as depicting her husband both alive and dead, and Paul Howell formally identified <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> {{of a young}} man hanging upside down in Berdella's basement as depicting his son. Several other Polaroid images depicted as-yet unidentified young men, and several detectives were assigned the task of identifying each individual depicted to determine if he was alive or dead, and if alive, the circumstances surrounding his depiction. As several of these images depicted a section of the body of the individual who had taken the photograph, on April 13, Berdella was ordered to pose nude for a series of photographs in order that portions of his body could be photographed in the precise angle depicted within these images for comparison with the original Polaroid images.|$|E
25|$|In August, the Talmadges {{left for}} California, where Norma's first role was in Captivating Mary Carstairs. The whole {{enterprise}} was a fiasco; the sets and costumes were cheap and the studio itself lacked adequate backing. The film was a flop, {{and the small}} new studio shut down {{after the release of}} Mary Carstairs. The demise of National Pictures Company left the family stranded in California after only <b>one</b> <b>picture.</b> Deciding it was smarter to aim high, they went to the Triangle Film Corporation, where D.W. Griffith was supervising productions. On the strength of The Battle Cry, Talmadge got a contract with Griffith's Fine Arts Company. For eight months, she starred in seven features for Triangle, including the comedy The Social Secretary (1916), a comedy written by Anita Loos and directed by John Emerson, that gave her an opportunity to disguise her beauty as a girl trying to avoid the unwelcome attentions of her male employers.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{overcome}} this issue is to avoid introducing threatening friends to desirable mates. In one study women were shown three pictures of the same female. In <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> the model was dressed conservatively, {{in the other two}} she was dressed provocatively, but in the third the model had been photoshopped to have a larger frame. All the women tested rated the thin, provocatively dressed women as the sexiest. Participants were also twice as likely to avoid introducing the model to their partners compared to the conservatively dressed model, who was rated as the least threatening. The authors interpreted these findings as, women who are dressed provocatively are seen as more promiscuous, so therefore {{are less likely to be}} introduced to partners due to the possibility of poaching. Not introducing an attractive female to a mate, minimises the likelihood that poaching will occur as it is a form of indirect aggression that minimises contact between a mate and a potential threat.|$|E

25|$|The daguerreotypes {{were not}} without drawbacks, however. The main {{difficulty}} {{was that they}} could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use negatives. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for portraiture. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one {{of two or more}} people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her genitals. Since <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s. Stereoscopy was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes, including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of three dimensional view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP.|$|E

500|$|Potter's {{source for}} the {{wildlife}} and the insect drawings in Mrs. Tittlemouse were those she had executed in her early adulthood, either directly from nature or by observing specimens in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The interest in the book's illustrations lies in the microscopic accuracy of the insects rather than in any human qualities exhibited by Mrs. Tittlemouse or Mr. Jackson. [...] Potter is uncharacteristically careless in the depiction of the insects however. They appear to be drawn for their own sake, or seem {{to be out of}} scale with the heroine, or to change scale without reason. The ladybird seems larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse, and the spider appears first larger than Mrs. Tittlemouse in <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> and then smaller in another. The bees are sometimes out of scale with both the toad and the mouse.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to his output the previous year, Cooper appeared in only <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> in 1937, Henry Hathaway's adventure film Souls at Sea. A critical and box-office failure, Cooper {{referred to it as}} his [...] "almost picture", saying, [...] "It was almost exciting, and almost interesting. And I was almost good." [...] In 1938, he appeared in Archie Mayo's biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo. Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay, the film became Goldwyn's biggest failure to that date, losing $700,000. During this period, Cooper turned down several important roles, including the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind. Cooper was producer David O. Selznick's first choice for the part. He made several overtures to the actor, but Cooper had doubts about the project, and did not feel suited to the role. Cooper later admitted, [...] "It {{was one of the best}} roles ever offered in Hollywood ... But I said no. I didn't see myself as quite that dashing, and later, when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection, I knew I was right." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, the {{character}} resembled a [...] "burlier leading man", described by Greno as [...] "a muscular commoner/farm boy". However, the directors had always envisioned Flynn as [...] "a dashing thief". To {{assist with the}} development of Flynn's design, Howard and Greno held a large meeting with thirty of Tangleds female employees. Calling it the [...] "Hot Man Meeting", the employees were encouraged to [...] "bring in pictures of their favorite hunky men". The Hot Man Meeting was created because the directors, who found that they were very much impressed with Rapunzel's design, felt that [...] "Flynn [...] to be up to [...] level". Greno described the Hot Man Meeting as [...] "crazy", elaborating, [...] "Photos of all the hottest men in Hollywood [...] being thrown around a room. Photos being torn in half and pasted back together. Eyes were ripped from <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> and put on another. Heads were torn from photos," [...] concluding, [...] "I've never seen anything like it." [...] Howard cited American actor Clark Gable and English footballer David Beckham among several celebrities by whom Flynn was influenced during the meeting, joking that the employees eventually [...] "started using Nathan and me as examples of what not to do".|$|E
500|$|A more {{favorable}} review came from Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Herald Tribune, who called Greed [...] "the most important picture yet produced in America... It is the <b>one</b> <b>picture</b> {{of the season}} that can hold its own {{as a work of}} dramatic art worthy of comparison with such stage plays as What Price Glory? and Desire Under the Elms." [...] The April 20, 1925, edition of The Montreal Gazette claimed it [...] "impresses as a powerful film" [...] and described the [...] "capacity audience" [...] screening as [...] "one of the few pictures which are as worthy of serious consideration...which offer a real and convincing study of life and character and that secure their ends by artistic and intellectual means rather than by writing down {{to the level of the}} groundlings." [...] The review went on to describe the direction as [...] "masterly", citing [...] "its remarkable delineation of character development and the subtle touches which convey ideas through vision rather than the written word, an all too-rare employment of the possibilities of the cinema play as a distinct branch of art capable of truthful and convincing revelation and interpretation of life's realities." [...] A review in Exceptional Photoplays stated that [...] "Mr. von Stroheim has always been the realist as Rex Ingram is the romanticist and Griffith the sentimentalist of the screen, and in Greed he has given us an example of realism at its starkest. Like the novel from which the plot was taken, Greed is a terrible and wonderful thing." ...|$|E
