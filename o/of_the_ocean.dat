5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants on the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E

5|$|Thermoremanent {{magnetization}} is {{the main}} source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust {{on both sides of the}} ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> can detect these stripes and infer the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.|$|E

An acoustic underwater search for underwater locator beacons attached to the aircraft's flight recorders ended 14 April, followed by a sonar survey of the seafloor near an area where acoustic detections were made.

5|$|Octopuses inhabit various regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean,</b> {{including}} coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some {{live in the}} {{intertidal zone}} and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies.|$|E
