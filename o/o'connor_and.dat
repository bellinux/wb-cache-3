5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day <b>O'Connor</b> <b>and</b> Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E

5|$|On August21, when Bret {{was first}} {{expected}} {{to approach the}} Texas coastline, the NHC issued a hurricane watch for coastal areas between the border of Mexico and Baffin Bay, Texas. Hours later, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm intensified and posed a more direct threat to the area. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were subsequently posted from Baffin Bay northward to Port Aransas. The following day, the hurricane warning was extended to include locations through Port <b>O'Connor</b> <b>and</b> the advisories were extended to Freeport. As Bret neared landfall, the hurricane watch between Port <b>O'Connor</b> <b>and</b> Freeport was discontinued. The hurricane warning for Port Aransas to Port O'Connor was discontinued hours after Bret made landfall and began to weaken. By late August23, all watches and warnings {{in relation to the}} hurricane were discontinued.|$|E

5|$|Lad: A Dog is a 1962 American drama film {{based on}} the 1919 novel {{of the same name}} written by Albert Payson Terhune. Starring Peter Breck, Peggy McCay, Carroll <b>O'Connor,</b> <b>and</b> Angela Cartwright, the film blends several of the short stories {{featured}} in the novel, with the heroic Lad winning a rigged dog show, saving a handicapped girl from a snake, and capturing a poacher who killed his pups and injured one of his owners. Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for the novel from Vanguard Productions, and acquired the film rights for the other two Lad novels from the late Terhune's wife.|$|E
5|$|Though the retirements of <b>O'Connor</b> <b>and</b> Garea left a void, talents such as Ox Baker, Tor Kamata, Al Perez, Rip Morgan, Samoan Joe, Johnny Garcia, Bruno Bekkar and A.J. Freely {{remained}} in New Zealand during the 1980s and early 1990s. Likewise, wrestlers from the World Wrestling Federation often toured New Zealand and Australia such as The Bushwhackers (formerly The Sheepherders) and Lanny Poffo. These stars {{continued to be}} seen in New Zealand via On the Mat until the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. She adds that between the title sentence and the end, Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight {{to the lives of}} his characters. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank <b>O'Connor</b> <b>and</b> Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant for their ability to compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E

5|$|As of , 35 {{individuals}} {{have served as}} mayor. There have been 36 mayoralties because Edwin M. Capps served two non-consecutive terms; he is counted chronologically as both the ninth and sixteenth mayor. The longest term was that of Pete Wilson, who served for eleven years over three terms prior {{to the establishment of}} successive term limits. The shortest term, not counting interim or acting mayors, was that of George P. Tebbetts, who served for less than two months before the position of mayor was abolished due to the bankruptcy of the city. Percy J. Benbough is the only mayor to have died in office. Two women have been elected mayor: Maureen <b>O'Connor</b> <b>and</b> Susan Golding consecutively. John F. Forward, Sr. and John F. Forward, Jr. are the only father and son to have both served as mayor.|$|E

5|$|Cordray {{announced}} his 2008 candidacy for Ohio {{state attorney general}} on June 11, 2008. He was endorsed by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. The vacancy {{in the office of}} the attorney general was created by the May 14, 2008, resignation of Marc Dann who was embroiled in a sex scandal. Several leading Republican party contenders such as Montgomery, Jim Petro, DeWine, Maureen <b>O'Connor,</b> <b>and</b> Rob Portman declined to enter the race. Cordray's opponents in the race were Michael Crites (Republican), and Robert M. Owens (Independent). Cordray had a large financial advantage over his opponents with approximately 30 times as much campaign financing as Crites. Crites' campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann—an association The Columbus Dispatch called into question—and promoting himself as having more years of prosecutorial experience. Cordray asserted that he managed the state's money safely despite the turbulence of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Warner Brothers {{purchased}} the film {{rights for the}} novel from Max J. Rosenberg, of Vanguard Productions, who had {{purchased the}}m from E. P. Dutton. They later negotiated with Anice Terhune {{for the rights to}} the two follow up novels, hoping to produce a sequel and television series if the first film proved successful. Starring Peter Breck, Peggy McCay, Carroll <b>O'Connor,</b> <b>and</b> Angela Cartwright, the film blended several of the novel's stories with some modifications to make a flowing narrative. Aram Avakian was initially selected to be the film's director, but his refusal to create a sentimental dog story resulted in his firing; he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. The film was released on June 6, 1962. Although it was praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film, and it was considered a low budget B-movie.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor began {{competing}} internationally in {{the late}} 1970s, and in 1986 started riding with the US national eventing team, beginning with the Australian Gawler World Championships, mounted on Lutin V. She won multiple CCI3* events, including the Rolex Kentucky Three Day and the Fair Hill International, and the CCI4* at the 1999 Rolex event, riding Prince Panache. During the 1990s, <b>O'Connor</b> <b>and</b> her horse Biko were mainstays of the US eventing team, riding to multiple top-ten finishes at major international events, including the Badminton Horse Trials and the Rolex Kentucky Three Day. O'Connor rode at the 1994 World Equestrian Games and the 1998 World Equestrian Games, helping the US team to a bronze medal at the latter. At the 2006 World Equestrian Games she rode Upstage as an individual, but did not compete in the team portion of the event.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 January, Berryman met with Allen, Jerram and Frowen at Allen's headquarters at Post 40 to discuss plans for the next day. It was agreed that Allen would advance on Bardia and cut the fortress in two, supported by Frowen's guns, every available tank, MacArthur-Onslow's Bren gun carriers and the 2/8th Infantry Battalion, which Mackay had recently allocated from reserve. Allen gave orders accordingly. During {{the afternoon}} the 6th Cavalry Regiment was pulled back to become the brigade reserve and the 2/5th Infantry Battalion relieved the 2/2nd to free it to advance the next day. That evening, Berryman {{came to the conclusion}} that unless the Italian defence collapsed soon, the 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades would become incapable of further effort and Brigadier Horace Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade would be required. Mackay was more sanguine about the situation, and reminded Berryman that his orders had been to capture Bardia with only two brigades. While they were discussing the matter, <b>O'Connor</b> <b>and</b> Harding arrived at 6th Division headquarters, and O'Connor readily agreed to the change of plan.|$|E
