500|$|On 31 October 1994 Princess Andrew's two {{surviving}} children, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover, went to Yad Vashem (the Holocaust Memorial) in Jerusalem {{to witness}} a ceremony honouring her as [...] "Righteous Among the Nations" [...] for having hidden the Cohens in her house in Athens during the Second World War. Prince Philip said of his mother's sheltering of persecuted Jews, [...] "I suspect that it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> her action was in any way special. She was {{a person with a}} deep religious faith, and she would have considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress." [...] In 2010, the Princess was posthumously named a Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government.|$|E
2500|$|Tunstall {{said that}} the album's title is {{inspired}} by a recurring dream she had, before discovering that 2010 is the Chinese Year of the Tiger. The dream is about her, seeing a tiger in her garden and goes outside to stroke it. She returns indoors and is seized by the fear {{that she could have}} been killed. Over the years, it has <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the reason the tiger responds so passively is that she herself is disguised as a tiger, wearing a tiger suit. She said that while writing and recording the album, she found a new sound she called [...] "Nature techno", which mixes organic instrumentation with electronic and dance textures, much like Björk has been doing since 1993. At a media showcase in London, Tunstall offered an unusual description of the songs from her forthcoming third album: [...] "Like Eddie Cochran working with Leftfield".|$|E
60|$|It {{had never}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Sidney might {{possibly}} marry a plain woman.|$|E
60|$|It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> rebuke implied a {{familiarity}} {{at which}} they had swiftly but imperceptibly arrived.|$|R
60|$|She had {{something}} of the feeling a Hindoo must experience who has been into surroundings or touched something that offends his caste. She passed {{people in the streets}} and regarded them with a quickening apprehension, once or twice came girls dressed in slatternly finery, going toward Regent Street from out these places. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> they at least had found a way of earning a living, and had that much economic superiority to herself. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> save for some accidents of education and character they had souls like her own.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid he'll {{think it}} frightfully expensive," [...] she answered, {{becoming}} thoughtful once more. And {{it did not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{neither of them had}} mentioned the individual to whom they referred.|$|R
60|$|She was silent. But {{the thought}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> a {{complete}} absorption in commercialism was not developing.|$|E
60|$|It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she did {{not need}} a suit, and that the order might {{have been hard to}} explain to Kennicott.|$|E
6000|$|... "How is it possible?" [...] cried Emma, {{turning her}} glowing cheeks towards him; for, while she spoke, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{he might have}} called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.|$|E
60|$|And oh! how earnestly Nunaga {{longed for}} a spill! In her despair, poor thing, it did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> at such a pace an upset might break the necks of the whole party.|$|R
60|$|She looks puzzled, casting {{about in}} <b>her</b> mind <b>to</b> find a definition, when it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{it is easier}} to point out the {{substantial}} object itself, massive against the dark-blue sky and the early stars.|$|R
5000|$|Lonely Lynn - When Lynn Walsh {{loses her}} only friends, {{she turns to}} {{breaking}} up as many friendships as she can, out of pure spite. Lynn certainly breaks up a number of friendships, {{but it does not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> someone might catch on....|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{listened to}} this {{assertion}} with some interest; {{it had never}} <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Touchett was likely to discuss her matrimonial prospects with Lord Warburton. [...] "Has he told you that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she {{had said}} enough. [...] "What a dignity that old gold-fish has!" [...] she remarked. [...] "He waves his tail--as {{if he were a}} beadle waving little boys out of church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, whativer is the matter, sister?" [...] said Mrs. Tulliver. She was not {{an imaginative}} woman, but it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the large toilet-glass in sister Pullet's best bedroom was {{possibly}} broken for the second time.|$|E
60|$|Mary saw {{a vessel}} {{standing}} in towards Oyster Pond, and her familiarity with objects {{of that nature}} was such, as <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> at once <b>that</b> it was a schooner; but so completely had she given up the Sea Lion, {{that it did not}} <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> this could be the long-missing craft.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Edmonstone was too unhappy to answer, for {{she could}} see no means of helping them. Mr. Edmonstone was of no use in a sick-room, and she had never thought it {{possible}} to leave Charles. It did not even <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she could do so till Charles himself suggested that she must go to Amy.|$|R
60|$|This curious {{separate}} strength, {{that existed}} in darkness and pride of night, never forsook her. She had never been more herself. It could not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> anybody, not even the young man of the world, Skrebensky, should have anything at all <b>to</b> do with <b>her</b> permanent self. As for her temporal, social self, she let it look after itself.|$|R
6000|$|... “She’s {{much more}} lonely with me. We’re perpetually having differences. Barb’s dreadfully vexed because I like America instead of—instead of—” And Lady Agatha paused a moment; for it just <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{this might be}} treacherous.|$|E
60|$|Picotee {{waited in}} her seat until it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she could escape the lady's-maid by going off into her father's pantry in her absence. But before this had been put into effect Menlove {{appeared}} again.|$|E
60|$|Allie lied. Her {{first thought}} was to lead them astray as to her skill with a horse; and then it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if she rode Fresno's saddle {{there might be an}} {{opportunity}} to use the gun.|$|E
60|$|So Gillian {{was left}} to the enigma why Alexis should regret the beauty of his own voice, and what Kalliope could mean by the scrapes of {{unprotected}} girls. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Miss White was her elder by six or seven years, and possibly might not rely on her judgment and discretion {{as much as she}} might have done on those of Alethea.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Will The Circle Be Unbroken?", Melissa and the {{principal}} are looking for Spencer at Rosewood High and asks the Liars if they spotted her. Later in Radley Sanitarium, Melissa is extremely apologetic because she was responsible for looking after Spencer while their parents {{were out of the}} country. Melissa admits <b>that</b> it didn't <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Spencer showcased erratic behavior, as she simply assumed her sister was being vile.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned away}} and left her {{wondering}} why he had abandoned his usual persistency, unless it was that an uneasy conscience had driven him from the field. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the man had under strong provocation merely yielded to the prompting of a somewhat hasty temper. In the meanwhile he crossed the room in an absent-minded manner and presently found himself near Jessy, who made room for him at her side.|$|R
60|$|It next <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{she could}} not go alone into that castle with just Gonzaga and the men {{he was about to}} enrol. His answer came with a {{promptness}} that showed he had considered, also, that.|$|E
60|$|As {{she spoke}} she saw Rachel redden; for she remembered silly {{things she had}} said, and also, it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she treated this {{exquisite}} woman rather badly, for Mrs. Dalloway had said that she loved her husband.|$|E
60|$|Jerome was gone--and he let Harriet Warren {{laugh at}} her {{and he would never}} come back to her. Well, it did not matter, but she had been a fool. Only it had never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Jerome could act so.|$|E
60|$|Afterward {{came the}} turn which, {{notwithstanding}} the furore caused by Andrea Korust's appearance, was {{generally considered to}} be equally responsible for the packed house--the Apache dance of Mademoiselle Sophie Celaire. Peter sat slightly forward in his chair as the curtain went up. For a time he seemed utterly absorbed by the performance. Violet glanced at him once or twice curiously. It began <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> it was not so much the dance as the dancer in whom her husband was interested.|$|R
50|$|Far way on a {{tropical}} island resort, Preston and Alex lounge {{back on a}} beach. Alex however is unsettled - her memory then triggered by the pop of the champagne cork - and she realises it was Gabe Preston who murdered her husband. Looking down to reveal the wedding ring she now wears as Mrs. Alex Preston, it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Preston now not only {{has access to the}} entire fortune, but that she is unable to testify against him because of marital privilege.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was only}} during the minute or two that Clara began to think how she should break the tidings <b>to</b> <b>her</b> friend, or {{in any way to}} realize the fact that the [...] "tidings" [...] would require breaking. She had rushed across the street with the {{important}} paper in her hand, {{proud of the fact that}} she had something great to tell. But during that minute or two it did <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> a choice of words was needed for such an occasion. [...] "Oh, Miss Fay," [...] she said, [...] "have you heard?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mary Louise hesitated; {{then she}} hung up the {{receiver}} without reply. It <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the hotel office was a public place and that the telephone girl {{would be likely to}} yell out the number for all to overhear.|$|E
6000|$|She {{crept into}} Dave Dyer's. Dave {{held up his}} arms with, [...] "Don't shoot! I surrender!" [...] She smiled, but it <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> for nearly five years Dave had kept up this game of pretending that she {{threatened}} his life.|$|E
60|$|Helène was disgusted, {{but she was}} not hard-hearted. The {{girl was}} evidently distressed--it never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she might not be in earnest. She herself could not {{understand}} such a lack of self-respect. A single gleam of pity mingled with her contempt.|$|E
50|$|Sophie {{is doing}} her driving test when it <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the {{bracelet}} {{she thought her}} father sent her was not from him, but from Cap. All the things she said and did to him and {{all he did was}} respond in kindness. As soon as she passes her test she drives to Garland, determined to take Cap to the Halloween Bash. Cap has had the same idea and {{a few miles from the}} commune they meet each other. Jumping into Sophie's car, they drive to Claverage Middle School.|$|R
60|$|Often, oh {{often the}} tram seemed to stop, and wet, cloaked people mounted and sat mute and grey in stiff rows {{opposite}} her, their umbrellas between their knees. The {{windows of the}} tram grew more steamy; opaque. She was shut in with these unliving, spectral people. Even yet it did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{she was one of}} them. The conductor came down issuing tickets. Each little ring of his clipper sent a pang of dread through her. But her ticket surely was different from the rest.|$|R
60|$|It was {{necessary}} {{that she should}} answer him;--and <b>to</b> <b>her</b> it was only natural that she should think what answer would best assist her own views without reference to his. It did not <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she could love him; but it did <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he might lift {{her out of her}} difficulties. What a benefit it would be <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> have a father, and such a father, for Felix! How easy would be a literary career to the wife of the editor of the 'Morning Breakfast Table!' And then it passed through <b>her</b> mind <b>that</b> somebody had told <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the man was paid £3,000 a year for his work. Would not the world, or any part of it that was desirable, come <b>to</b> <b>her</b> drawing-room if she were the wife of Mr Broune? It all passed through her brain at once during that minute of silence which she allowed herself after the declaration was made <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> But other ideas and other feelings were present <b>to</b> <b>her</b> also. Perhaps the truest aspiration of her heart had been the love of freedom which the tyranny of her late husband had engendered. Once she had fled from that tyranny and had been almost crushed by the censure to which she had been subjected. Then her husband's protection and his tyranny had been restored <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
