40|$|AIM: At present, two {{different}} clinical procedures {{to ensure the}} adherence of indirect tooth restorations to the dental tissues are available: a traditional method based on a delayed dentin sealing (DDS) and an innovative approach that contemplates an immediate dentin sealing (IDS). In this study the authors highlight {{the advantages of the}} latter method (IDS), decribing the <b>operating</b> <b>phases</b> of this procedure used in paediatric dentistry to perform indirect restorations of dental fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The <b>operating</b> <b>phases</b> of indirect composite restorations of dental fractures in paediatric patients are described, introducing an innovative procedure that recommends the immediate application of the dental adhesive (IDS) on the exposed dentin before the subsequent <b>operating</b> <b>phases</b> of tooth preparation, dental impression and adhesive cementation of the restoration. RESULTS: The immediate application of the dental adhesive (IDS) on the freshly cut exposed dentin, before taking the dental impression, protects the dental pulp from bacterial contamination and prevents post-operative sensitivity. At the same time, this procedure provides an ideal substrate for formation of a hybrid layer with excellent adhesion properties. CONCLUSION: Both methods (DDS and IDS) allow the formation of an adequate hybrid layer to seal the dentin in the interdiffusion area, although SEM images of samples treated with the two methods reveal clear ultrastructural differences between the different interface...|$|R

The original company, Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency, was a loan and contract company chartered in 1859. [...] The creation of Crédit Mobilier of America was a deliberate attempt to present, falsely, both to the government of the United States and to the general public the appearance that a corporate enterprise (independent of the Union Pacific Rail Road and its principal officers) had been impartially chosen by the Union Pacific Railroad's officers and directors to be the principal construction contractor and construction management firm for the Union Pacific Rail Road project. It was created by the officers of the Union Pacific to shield the companies's shareholders and management from the then common charge that they were using the construction phase of the Union Pacific project (as opposed to the <b>operating</b> <b>phase</b> of carrying passengers and freight) to line their pockets with excess profits. As the fraudsters believed that profits could not be generated from the operation of the railroad, they created a sham company to charge the U.S. government extortionate fees and expenses during construction of the line.|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} ultra-fine {{particles}} from equipment of daily use {{is currently a}} topic of high public concern. The present study reports on the measurement of 12 household appliances such as toasters, grills, and hair dryers in an emission test chamber regarding the release of particles between 5. 6 and 560 nm. The devices were new at the time experiments started and had never been used for their original purpose. For instance, toasters and sandwich-makers were tested without the presence of food or residues from prior usage. During the experiments the devices released aerosols with count mean diameters mainly below 100 nm. Within the <b>operating</b> <b>phase</b> high quantities of 10 nm particles are released which form larger particles by agglomeration. The origin of the particles {{can be attributed to}} the heated surfaces but cleaning these surfaces only had a minor influence on the emission strength. The released particles are evaporated in a thermodenuder between 150 °C and 200 °C. These findings indicate the particles to be formed from semi-volatile organic compounds. However, the compounds are not located on the heated surfaces and are not released as supersaturated vapor because emission is continuous over the <b>operating</b> <b>phase</b> of the device. Furthermore, the contribution of oxygen to the formation process can be neglected because the emission can also be detected in a nitrogen atmosphere. However, the presence of additional organic compounds in the surrounding air was found to be influencing the growth of the particles within the <b>operating</b> <b>phase.</b> All in all the tested household appliances were strong particle emission sources even when there was no contact with food or clothing...|$|E

30|$|Usually {{the site}} survey is {{conducted}} in a crowdsourced way [2, 6, 7]. Suppliers recruited by the service provider measure the WiFi signal strengths of nearby APs when they visit the places which the service provider is interested in, and then send the measured WiFi signal strengths and the corresponding locations to the service provider. The service provider aggregates the data contributed by the suppliers to estimate the parameters which {{will be used in}} the online <b>operating</b> <b>phase.</b> The parameters which need to be estimated depend on the algorithms used in the online <b>operating</b> <b>phase.</b> In k-nearest neighbor-based algorithms, the mean of the WiFi signal strength of every AP at every location needs to be estimated, while in the probability-based algorithms, both the mean and variance of the signal strength of every AP are required. Crowdsourcing is an efficient way to conduct the site survey, but the measurements contributed by the suppliers will inevitably leak their location privacy. The service provider can infer the locations that the suppliers visit based on the data they contribute. Existing research indicates that location traces can leak information about the individuals’ habits, interests, activities, and relationships [8, 9]. Consequently, the loss of location privacy can expose the suppliers to unwanted advertisements and location-based spams/scams and may cause social reputation or economic damage to the suppliers and can make the victims of blackmails or even physical violence.|$|E

30|$|The filters for {{sub-carrier}} shaping are initially {{designed in}} the frequency domain. This approach requires a high processing load, and thus, a more computationally efficient time domain implementation is subsequently derived. A modified tracking loop architecture is also proposed to independently track code and carrier phase. Sub-carrier equalization performed for autocorrelation shaping is only required for unambiguous code tracking. Thus, the modified tracking architecture <b>operates</b> <b>Phase</b> Lock Loop (PLL) and Delay Lock Loop (DLL) independently. The filtered signal is exploited for generating the correlator outputs used for driving the DLL, whereas the unfiltered samples are exploited by the PLL. This further mitigates the noise amplification problem, since the PLL is unaffected by the filtering performed by the sub-carrier shaping algorithms.|$|R
