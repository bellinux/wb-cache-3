40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are trying}} to {{evaluate}} the differential impact of <b>Outward</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>Traffic</b> (OPT) flows with respect to the final trade flows on the labour markets of EU countries. In particular, two EU countries are investigated, Germany and Italy, because of their relevance on total EU-CEEC OPT flows and because they embody two different models of outsourcing towards CEECs. The factor content of trade (FCT) analysis conducted at both levels of inter-industry trade and intra-industry trade signals a more relevant impact of OPT flows than final flows. In particular, results suggest that the labour market effects of intra-industry trade flows deriving from the vertical disintegration of production add significantly to the estimated factor market impact of trade. intra-industry trade; EU-CEEC trade; vertical disintegration; quality differentiation; labour market effects of international trade...|$|E
40|$|Amongst {{developed}} countries, Italy {{is unusual}} in that it has maintained a specialisation in traditional industries such as textiles and clothing (TCI). Explanations of Italy’s unusual industrial profile mainly emphasise the role of endogenous economic and cultural resources. Globalisation in the 1990 s and 2000 s saw slow growth and a significant decline of these formerly resilient industries. Analyses of trade and unit value data support accounts of the lateness of the Italian TCI’s movement {{in the direction of}} <b>Outward</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>Traffic</b> (OPT) and the subsequent rise of a pan-Euro-Mediterranean system. More recently, however, this system has declined as a result of new competitive challenges from China and other emerging economies that have eroded the position of Italian enterprises on export and domestic markets and adversely affected their Euro-Mediterranean suppliers. As district and value-chain theories show, the geography of industrial activities is a result of enterprise strategies and the environment in which they operate. To embrace recent trends these theories must, however, be extended to give greater weight to exchange rate, trade, market, demand-side and related institutional issues...|$|E
40|$|Die vorliegende Studie bietet eine erste Bewertung der Auswirkungen internationaler Produktion auf die Dynamik regionaler Integration in Europa. Was die Rolle ausländischer Direktinvestitionen angeht, so sind die anfänglich sehr hohen Erwartungen mittlerweile der Skepsis gewichen. Auf der Grundlage oftmals impliziter regionsübergreifender Vergleiche wird hier festgestellt, daß Direktinvestitionen in Zentral- und Osteuropa niedrig sind, daß sie keine nennenswerten Technologietransfers und 'backward linkages' mit sich bringen, und daß die Aussichten für die europaweite Entwicklung 'transnationaler Produktionsnetzwerke' bestenfalls unsicher sind. Es wird argumentiert, daß Verallgemeinerungen auf der Basis von Direktinvestitionsziffern mehr verschleiern als enthüllen. Daher wird hier die Entwicklung von 'Outward-Processing-Verkehr' zwischen der Europäischen Union und Zentral- und Osteuropa als {{alternative}} Quelle herangezogen, um einige der Transformationen zu kennzeichnen, welche das europäische Integrationsmodell im Augenblick durchmacht. " (Autorenreferat) "This {{paper offers}} a first {{assessment of the}} contribution of international production to the dynamics of regional integration in Europe. After very high expectations, there is increasing scepticism concerning the rote of foreign direct investment as an engine {{of growth in the}} region. On the basis of often implicit cross regional comparisons, it is argued that the level of foreign direct investment in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is low, that it does not lead to significant technology transfers and backward linkages, and that the prospects for 'cross national productions networks' to develop continent-wide are at best uncertain. The paper argues that generalisations based an foreign direct investment figures hide more than reveal and looks at the development of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> <b>traffic</b> between the European Union (EU) and CEE as an alternative source of evidence to characterise some of the transformations that the European model of integration is undergoing. It finds that EU firms, mainly medium sized German companies, make an important use of non equity forms of international production when expanding eastwards. The resulting patterns of cooperation are 'fluid', but not necessarily precarious. In fact, they are an ideal vehicle for implementing new flexible methods of production which have greater potentials for spillovers and 'multiplier effects'. Overall, these patterns of cooperation give rise to different market linkages that hardly fit into static categories, a process in which policy makers have only little say.

40|$|<b>Outward</b> <b>processing</b> {{has become}} a much {{discussed}} issue in Austria's economic policy debates. At first the negative impact on Austria's textile and apparel industry of the EU's <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> with East-Central Europe dominated the discussion. This problem disappeared, however, when Austria entered the EU. The increasing use of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> by Austria's firms to improve their price competitiveness has attracted less attention. This advantage was limited, however, by rules of origin, which rendered the export of merchandise produced in this way difficult. Again, membership in the EU removed these obstacles.

40|$|The US and the EU use <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> {{arrangements}} to shift labor intensive apparel operations to neighboring countries who have significantly lower labor costs, to promote demand for their capital-intensive textiles, {{and to provide}} economic assistance to the developing countries. They stimulate foreign investment, which, in turn, determines trade flows. The investment response to preferences is gradual because there are costs associated with capital stock adjustment. ^ This study focuses mostly on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade in apparel and textiles with the Caribbean. Preferential treatment of US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade has been expanded recently by the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (TDA 2000). Tariffs were previously exempted only {{on the value of}} imported intermediates, and became zero afterwards. ^ To study <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade and the effects of trade policies in the long and short runs, a dynamic model with adjustment costs of investment is specified. The hypothesis of capital stock being the key determinant of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade flows in the short run and tariff changes having limited short-run effect on <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade is tested, using US data. Statistical tests support that hypothesis. The model is then used to simulate long-run outcomes of the introduction of TDA 2000 and the elimination of Multi-Fiber Agreement on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade in the Caribbean Basin since the latter has the potential to have significant impact on the US demand for <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> apparel. The costs and benefits of these trade policy changes are evaluated. ^ Simulations of the effects of TDA 2000 for Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica showed that most of the adjustment of capital and trade would occur over 5 years, increasing trade by 12 % to 24 %. The elimination of MFA quotas, depending on the magnitude of its impact on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> (OP) demand, has the potential to eliminate the gains resulting from the adoption of TDA 2000. A 10 % negative MFA demand shock in 2000 decreased OP trade by 6 % and investment expenditures by 53 % on average as compared to the benchmark projections. A 30 % negative demand shock would bring disinvestments in all countries. ...|$|R

The focus is on cross-border sourcing of low-skill-intensive components of exports and import-competing products.

We find that <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> is more prevalent in import-competing industries, which are also the EU’s relatively intensive users of low-skilled labor. <b>Outward</b> <b>processing</b> in export industries is found to reduce the skill-to-low-skill ratio in EU industries, while <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> in import-competing industries has more ambiguous effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers observed in many developed countries has received much attention from economists in recent years. A similar rise of wage gap has now been observed for some newly developed economies, such as Hong Kong. However, few empirical studies have been carried out to explain the growing wage gap in these newly developed economies. This study uses the time series data to investigate the impact of increased <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade with the Chinese Mainland on the wage inequality of Hong Kong. We found that there is a significant positive association between the volume of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade and the wage premium of university graduates over primary school graduates and university graduates over secondary school graduates. Moreover, our econometric analysis also shows that it is the increased <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade that causes the widening of skill wage gap not vice versa. Furthermore, the increase of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade both increases the pay for well-educated people {{and at the same time}} decreases the pay for less well-educated people, thereby widening the wage gap in Hong Kong...|$|R

40|$|The {{countries}} of Central and Eastern Europe have displayed widely disparate trade performance {{since the beginning}} of the transition. The Czech Republic and Hungary have had some success moving into the production and export of more technologically-sophisticated, higher value-added goods, while Bulgaria and Slovakia have continued to specialize, sometimes increasingly, in low-skill, low-value-added goods. Poland and Romania are intermediate cases. In Poland, different parts of the economy show each of these tendencies. In Romania, performance is very different in different periods – significantly better after 1994 than before. In accounting for these patterns, our analysis points to the importance of direct foreign investment (DFI) and <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade. DFI has been an engine of technological and organization learning, but it has been significant only in the Czech Republic, Hungary and, most recently, Poland. Outward-processing trade (OPT) is widely spread and helps to explain the strong export performance of the region. The technological and organizational implications of OPT are, however, less obviously favourable: in particular, it does not encourage the development of differentiated, price-insensitive export products that offer countries insulation from foreign competition.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s the European apparel sector has {{witnessed}} a dramatic transformation. Driven by increasing costs in Western Europe, major Western apparel retailers and buyers have expanded their contracting of production into lower cost regions of `postcommunist' Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. One consequence {{of these changes}} is a burgeoning of apparel producers in peripheral European and North African regions, locked into supply relations with Western buyers. Equally apparent is a dramatic growth in apparel trade between the European Union (EU) and the countries of East - Central Europe (ECE). For much of the 1990 s these processes were driven by <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade arrangements between EU countries and applicant states in ECE, along with the EU customs union with Turkey. Further liberalization of trade regimes during the 1990 s removed these <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> customs arrangements, but outward-processing forms of assembly production continue. The authors chart these transformations, and signal {{one part of the}} emerging architecture of trade relations between the EU and ECE after 1989.

40|$|At present, the {{business}} social responsibility {{is considered by}} a costs-benefits perspective, {{one of its most}} important benefits being that it can constitute a competitive advantage source for large enterprises {{as well as for the}} small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

A special case is represented by the SMEs operating on the basis of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade type of subcontracting, a business form characteristic for a large number of foreign investments operating on the Romanian market in the clothing industry, their competitive advantage being represented by the low cost production; it implies, also, a low cost of the workforce. In these conditions, one raises the question of the existence of ISR and of its forms of manifestations, the main hypothesis being that if the ISR exists, it is limited by the pursued advantage of the lowest costs possible and it is not formally practiced. This hypothesis was partially confirmed by the results of our case study, the most important finding being that of the necessity for the enterprise to practice some forms of ISR, as a result of contextual factors (cultural and socio-economical) influence, in order to efficiently function, it couldn't be possible only through the pursuit of low costs competitive advantage. internal social responsibility; competitive advantage; SMEs; lohn (<b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade); clothing industry; case study. ...|$|R

The analysis is set {{against the background of}} the process of regional integration between the EU and its neighbouring developing countries. The underlying question is whether trade integration fosters or dampens learning and technological upgrading. We find that unit values of exports from these countries to the EU rose steadily between 1988 and 1996, relative to the unit values of world exports to Europe. If increases in unit values satisfactorily proxy increases in product quality, then trade integration has fostered product upgrading and technological learning in the sample countries. We find that imported technologies and other sources of knowledge have a strong bearing on this pattern. Technological inflows are captured by the degree of involvement of European companies in export flows from our sample countries (<b>Outward</b> <b>Processing</b> Trade) and by the skill content of the machines imported. export performance, regional integration, technology imports, textile industry...|$|R
