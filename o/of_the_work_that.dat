5|$|Henry McNish (11 September 187424 September 1930), often {{referred}} to as Harry McNeish or by the nickname Chippy, was the carpenter on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. He was responsible for much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> ensured the crew's survival after their ship, the Endurance, was destroyed when it became trapped in pack ice in the Weddell Sea. He modified the small boat, James Caird, that allowed Shackleton and five men (including McNish) to make a voyage of hundreds of miles to fetch help {{for the rest of the}} crew.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the United States in July 1920, Somervell {{was posted}} to the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, D.C. His war record {{earned him a}} place at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, {{reserved}} for the Army's best and most promising officers. He once again ranked near the top of his class. After graduation he was posted to the 1st New York Engineer District but soon obtained leave to assist Hines with a special study of navigation on the Rhine and Danube Rivers on behalf of the League of Nations, essentially a continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> the two men had done in 1920. He then attended the Army War College from 1925 to 1926.|$|E

50|$|Hacks {{typically}} wrote radical, salacious, or subversive literature, such as plays, novels, and pamphlets about controversial subjects.

25|$|The Chhairo Reconstruction and Maintenance Committee {{was formed}} who {{proceeded}} {{to collect information}} about <b>the</b> legal status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gompa structures and property as well as determine <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> would be required.|$|R
50|$|A widely publicised rumour claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> was {{to create}} a nuclear weapon storage {{facility}} in the cave. However, the few completed parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> (<b>that</b> are deserted and easily accessible to the public, today) make this claim seem very unrealistic.|$|R

25|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> used to {{take place}} in Dell's U.S. plants was {{transferred}} to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, or some of Dell's factories overseas. The Miami, Florida facility of its Alienware subsidiary remains in operation.|$|E
25|$|A {{theoretical}} way {{to reduce}} waste accumulation is to phase out current reactors in favour of Generation IV Reactors, which output less waste per power generated. Fast reactors can theoretically consume some existing waste. The UK's Nuclear Decommissioning Authority published a position paper in 2014 on the progress on approaches to the management of separated plutonium, which summarises the conclusions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> NDA shared with UK government.|$|E
50|$|Bolesław Olszewicz, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern {{historians who}} criticize Lelewel, argues {{there is not}} enough {{evidence}} to prove that Scolvus was actually Polish. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> mention Johannes Scolvus were published more than a century after the voyage and no contemporary evidence has been found.|$|R
5|$|Tsakalotos {{has written}} {{a number of books}} and {{articles}} on Greek and international economic policies, alone and in cooperation with other academics and writers.

25|$|Robert Smithson’s Hypothetical Continent (Map {{of broken}} clear glass, Atlantis) was first {{created as a}} photographical project on Loveladies Island NJ in 1969, and then recreated as a gallery {{installation}} of broken glass. On this he commented that he liked “landscapes that suggest prehistory”, and this is {{borne out by the}} original conceptual drawing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> includes an inset map of the continent sited off the coast of Africa and at the straits into the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier Zafar-ul-Haq {{replaced}} Brig Abid Mumtaz on 24 February 2010. Brigadier Zafar-ul-Haq, is a chivalrous {{and brave}} commander who has launched numerous operations for final annihilation of Taliban phenomenon from Bajaur. He ensured expansion of security forces {{in every part}} of Bajaur. Brigadier Zafar-Ul-Haq has pushed the Taliban quite back away from the locals areas and has insured safety for the local people. Now Bajaur is completely free of Talibans because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> Brig Abid Mumtaz, Brig Zafar-Ul-Haq and all the brave soldiers who served with them.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the extent}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> had to be carried out, Imperator {{remained}} at Liverpool until 21 February and during this time the company's annual dinner was held on board, before the ship returned to service on the North Atlantic. On 2 March 1920, the ship left New York, taking nine days to reach Southampton. During the voyage, Imperator developed a severe list which {{was found to be}} caused by a faulty ash ejector. Cunard decided that the ship was in need of a major overhaul and she was withdrawn from service.|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> Ramana used {{to explain}} his {{insights}} was the Ribhu Gita, a song at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shivarahasya Purana, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'Shaiva Upapuranas' or ancillary Purana regarding Shiva and Shaivite worship. Another work used by him was the Dakshinamurthy Stotram, a text by Shankara. It is a hymn to Shiva, explaining Advaita Vedanta.|$|R
50|$|Despite these hiccups, such as poor {{readership}} {{and lack}} <b>of</b> publishing, <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> are published in Bemba is generally high. Moreover, {{there seems to}} be many talented writers who would like to write in this language but could not because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons that have been given above and thers that are related.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> make up <b>the</b> Better Out Than In series were defaced, {{some just}} hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one {{defacement}} was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|R
25|$|In 1943, Albizu Campos became {{seriously ill}} {{and had to}} be interned at the Columbus Hospital of New York City. During his stay in the hospital, he learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> the Harlem Ashram was doing with the local Puerto Ricans. He asked Julio Pinto Gandía, a member of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, to bring the group to his bedside because he wanted to meet them. Reynolds and the others went to meet Albizu Campos as requested. That was the {{beginning}} of a lifelong friendship between Reynolds and Albizu Campos.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> {{went into}} {{developing}} OpenStep {{was applied to}} developing Mac OS X, Cocoa being the most visible part. However, differences exist. For example, NeXTSTEP and OpenStep used Display PostScript for on-screen display of text and graphics, while Cocoa depends on Apple's Quartz (which uses the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, but not its underlying technology). Cocoa also has a level of Internet support, including the NSURL and WebKit HTML classes, and others, while OpenStep had only rudimentary support for managed network connections via NSFileHandle classes and Berkeley sockets.|$|E
25|$|Eight Bells was the {{outgrowth}} {{of a series}} of oil paintings that Homer made using three wooden panels he found in the cabin of his brother's sloop at Prouts Neck, Maine. On two of the panels Homer painted scenes of mackerel fleets at Prouts Neck, one at dawn and the other at sunset; on the third he painted a grisaille study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> inspired Eight Bells, which depicted a ship's officer standing alone, taking an observation with an octant. Several years earlier, Homer had painted a watercolor on his voyage to England that also showed a sailor performing this activity.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} as a visiting {{professor}} at Harvard and then Tanglewood Music Center, Copland in 1952 bought his first house, Shady Lane Farm in Ossining. There, he wrote more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> defined his middle career, such as the Orchestral Variations and the opera The Tender Land. By 1960, he had outgrown it, and began looking for another country home.|$|R

5|$|When Lichtenstein had {{his first}} solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Golf Ball was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein {{included}} Golf Ball in Still Life with Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies <b>the</b> novel superimposition <b>of</b> abstraction and figuration. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> also represents abstraction {{as a result of}} elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|R
25|$|From Germany {{they walked}} southwards across the Alps to Italy, {{a journey that}} was {{recorded}} {{in the first of}} his travel books, a collection of linked essays titled Twilight in Italy and the unfinished novel, Mr Noon. During his stay in Italy, Lawrence completed the final version of Sons and Lovers that, when published in 1913, was acknowledged to be a vivid portrait of the realities of working class provincial life. Lawrence, though, had become so tired <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> he allowed Edward Garnett to cut about a hundred pages from the text.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, {{choreographer}} Alexander Gorsky {{staged a}} production which eliminated the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier and gave their dances to Clara and the Nutcracker Prince, who were played by adults instead of children. His {{was the first}} production to do so. An abridged version of the ballet was first performed outside Russia in Budapest (Royal Opera House) in 1927, with choreography by Ede Brada. In 1934, choreographer Vasili Vainonen staged a version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> addressed many of the criticisms of the original 1892 production by casting adult dancers in the roles of Clara and the Prince, as Gorsky had. The Vainonen version influenced several later productions.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of masks used in Africa. In West Africa, masks are used in masquerades that form part of {{religious}} ceremonies enacted to communicate with spirits and ancestors. Examples are the masquerades of the Yoruba, Igbo, and Edo cultures, including Egungun Masquerades and Northern Edo Masquerades. The masks are usually carved with an extraordinary skill and variety by artists who will usually have received their training as an apprentice to a master carver - frequently it is a tradition that has been passed down within a family through many generations. Such an artist holds a respected position in tribal society because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> he or she creates, embodying not only complex craft techniques but also spiritual/social and symbolic knowledge. African masks are also used in the Mas or Masquerade of the Caribbean Carnival.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>that</b> {{have been}} written for {{mandolin}} from the 18th century onward, many have been lost or forgotten. Some of these await discovery in museums and libraries and archives. One example of rediscovered 18th-century music for mandolin and ensembles with mandolins is the Gimo collection, collected in <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> 1762 by Jean Lefebure. Lefebure collected the music in Italy, and it was forgotten until manuscripts were rediscovered.|$|R

25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> <b>That</b> team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E
25|$|Soon, the Train was put {{in charge}} of the landing's water supply, {{something}} that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The fire hoses were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with metal pipe as soldiers would constantly make holes in it to get at the water inside. This was just some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> saw the Train removed from the 11th Division and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.|$|E
25|$|Gregory next {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Germany. In 718, he was approached by an Anglo-Saxon missionary, Winfrid, who proposed undertaking missionary work in Germany. Gregory agreed, and after changing his name to Boniface, commissioned him in May 719 to preach in Germany. After hearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>that</b> had been done so far, in 722 Gregory summoned Boniface back to Rome to answer rumours concerning Boniface’s doctrinal purity. Interestingly, at this face to face meeting, Boniface complained that he found Gregory’s Latin difficult to understand, a clear indication that Vulgar Latin had already started to evolve into the Romance languages. After examining Boniface’s written profession of faith, Gregory was satisfied enough that he made Boniface a bishop in November 722, and returned him to Germany to continue his mission. Continued successes saw Gregory write to Boniface in December 724 to offer his congratulations, followed in November 726 by a response to Boniface’s questions about how to structure the newly emergent churches in Germany.|$|E
