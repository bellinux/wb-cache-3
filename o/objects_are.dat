5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> {{composed of a}} mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{only five}} {{objects in the}} Solar System (Ceres, Eris, and the KBOs Pluto, Makemake and Haumea) are listed as dwarf planets by the IAU. 90482 Orcus, 28978 Ixion and many other Kuiper-belt <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> {{large enough to be}} in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium; most of them will probably qualify when more is known about them.|$|E
30|$|We {{continue}} to query the left (right) parallel {{line of the}} region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> and search the parent node of the found right (left) parallel line. If the right parallel line is the left child, and the region where the query <b>object</b> <b>is</b> does not have left adjacent parallel line, then the neighbor region of the queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and the right parallel line. If the right parallel line is the right child, and the parent node parallel line is the left parallel line of the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> then the neighbor region of the queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and {{the left and right}} parallel lines. If the left parallel line is the left child, and the parent node parallel line is the right parallel line of the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> then the neighbor region of the queried data <b>object</b> <b>is</b> the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is</b> and the left and right parallel lines. If the left parallel line is the right child, we use the middle order traversal algorithm to search for the direct stepfather node of the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is,</b> and the parallel line of the direct stepfather node is the right parallel line of the region where the queried <b>object</b> <b>is.</b> We calculate the distance between the data objects in the above searched region and the queried object, sorting and inserting these data objects into the sorting queue.|$|R

5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} the scattered disc {{to be the}} place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the intermediate stage in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> also thought to have originated in the scattered disc. Detached <b>objects</b> <b>are</b> not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects, and some such as Sedna have sometimes been considered {{to be included in}} this group.|$|E
5|$|Both Ariel and the {{slightly}} larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851.

5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} {{is a hard}} {{steel-grey metal}} that is often brittle and hard to work.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated participants' {{spatial memory}} of a briefly viewed layout. Participants saw an array of five objects on a table and, after a short delay, indicated whether the target object indicated by the experimenter had been moved. Experiment I showed that change detection was more accurate when non-target <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> stationary than when non-target <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> moved. This context effect was observed when participants were tested both at the original learning perspective and at a novel perspective. In Experiment 2, the arrays of five <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> presented on a rectangular table {{and two of the}} non-target <b>objects</b> <b>were</b> aligned with the longer axis of the table.
