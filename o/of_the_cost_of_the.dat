In March 1972, the entire cost of the section between 34th Street and 126th Street, according to the project's Draft Environmental Study, {{was estimated to be}} $381 million. In June 1972, it was announced that the UMTA would grant $25 million for the construction of this section of the line. The MTA had requested $254 million in federal funds for {{the northern part of the}} line.

5|$|Italian silk cloth {{was very}} expensive, {{as much a}} result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raw {{material}} as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable {{to keep up with}} the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.|$|E
5|$|Howe cabled Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} appraisal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed {{that it would be}} run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, {{the city}} council decided that a branch was to be built during {{construction}} at Nørrebro, to allow a future branch line from the City Circle Line towards Brønshøj. The {{first part of this}} line was intended to be constructed {{at the same time as}} the City Circle Line, to avoid a multitude-higher construction cost and long interruptions of operations later. This did not involve a final decision, only an option for future construction. The Herlev/Brønshøj line was ultimately dropped as the City of Copenhagen withdrew its share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nørrebro branch chamber in its 2009 budget, and the state refused to continue the project.

5|$|The first SH 151 was {{designated}} on March 19, 1930 from Mason to Menard as a renumbering of SH 29A. By 1935, SH 151 extended west to Eldorado. On April 29, 1942, {{the section of}} SH 151 west of Menard was cancelled and renamed FM 43. On March 17, 1948, FM 43 became part of SH 151, extending it to Eldorado. On August 22, 1951 SH 151 was cancelled and transferred to SH 29. The route of Highway151 was originally conceived in 1983 by local land developer Charles Martin Wender and later received approval by Raymond Stotzer, the district supervisor of the Texas Department of Transportation {{at the time and}} for whom the freeway would later be named. The freeway was a joint effort with landowners providing 85% of the right-of-way worth US$26 million and half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frontage roads worth $14 million with the city buying the rest. During the construction of the freeway, the Texas Turnpike Authority considered SH151 as a candidate to become a toll road, but this drew much criticism from local politicians and the Bexar County commissioners and did not come to fruition. SH 151 {{was designated}} on March 14, 1984 on its current route.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt that is applied for DCF valuation <b>of</b> businesses in <b>the</b> specific environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic. Neither theory nor practice {{has focused on}} this issue in detail. There is no systematic and comprehensive list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation methods usable in practice. Valuers and analysts disregard estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt arguing {{that it can be}} easily estimated from the current bank loan interest rates or from the traded bonds. Neither method is perfect and fully applicable in the Czech Republic. This dissertation thesis shows how <b>the</b> DCF value <b>of</b> an enterprise is shaped by <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt. Almost all formulas analysed caused <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> an enterprise to change with <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt, which makes <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt very important. Further, based on an analysis of 183 valuation reports, the thesis documents <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital estimation in <b>the</b> Czech Republic. It shows that while <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity is mainly estimated in compliance with theory, estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt is done by simple and sometimes inappropriate methods, because there is no guidance in the literature. Finally, this thesis suggests various methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation {{that can be used in}} practice in the Czech Republic. It provides full application guidance to these methods, data that was calculated by the author or taken from other sources and evaluates advantages and disadvantages of these methods. This thesis concludes by recommending methods that should be used for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt estimation in <b>the</b> Czech Republic as opposed to the simple methods currently used...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, <b>the</b> {{market price}} <b>of</b> risk {{is a key}} input to the model, as it is prone to {{estimation}} errors, and the model output is relatively sensitive {{with respect to this}} parameter. As an alternative to a direct input <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market price <b>of</b> risk, we consider in the following an implied calculation based on an available estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity. <b>The</b> reasoning is that most applications focus on an accurate estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity and give a little attention to <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt. We, therefore, analyze how an existing estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity can be used to calibrate the model and consistently obtain an estimate for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt without explicitly estimating <b>the</b> market price <b>of</b> risk.|$|R

5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of the database could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> database. The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database would do nothing to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E

A number <b>of</b> alternative measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital to Irish industry are presented.
