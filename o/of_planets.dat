5|$|Although {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} classification <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> orbiting other stars, the issue was not resolved; it was proposed instead to decide this only when such objects start to be observed.|$|E
5|$|By the 17th century, two {{developments}} {{allowed for}} the transits <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> {{across the face of}} the Sun to be predicted and observed: the telescope and the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, planetary orbits.|$|E

5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> are elliptical.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the IAU definition of dwarf planet, some scientists expressed their disagreement with the IAU resolution. Campaigns included car bumper stickers and T-shirts. Mike Brown (the discoverer of Eris) agrees with the reduction of the number <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> to eight.|$|E

5|$|Most Star Trek stories {{depict the}} adventures of humans and aliens who serve in Starfleet, the space-borne {{humanitarian}} and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation <b>of</b> <b>Planets.</b> The protagonists have altruistic values, and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Second Law {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the {{strength}} of forces. For instance, knowledge of the masses <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> along with the accelerations of their orbits allows scientists to calculate the gravitational forces on planets.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1801, astronomers {{discovered}} Ceres {{and other}} bodies between Mars and Jupiter which were for decades {{considered to be}} planets. Between then and around 1851, when the number <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> had reached 23, astronomers started using the word asteroid for the smaller bodies and then stopped naming or classifying them as planets.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to Pluto) to appear to be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of Kepler-6b was {{announced at the}} 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society with the discoveries <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> Kepler-4b, Kepler-5b, Kepler-7b, and Kepler-8b on January 4, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller orbital eccentricity. Although there are {{attempts}} {{to explain it}} partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number <b>of</b> <b>planets,</b> the exact causes remain undetermined.|$|E

5|$|Thousands of exoplanets {{have been}} {{identified}} in the last twenty years. The orbits of many of these planets and systems <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> differ significantly from the planets in the Solar System. The exoplanets discovered include hot-Jupiters, warm-Jupiters, super-Earths, and systems of tightly packed inner planets.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledging the problem, the IAU {{set about}} {{creating}} {{the definition of}} planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and {{a new class of}} dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).|$|E
5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its gravitational influence would disrupt the orbit <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> {{in the outer}} part of the habitable zone. In addition, it may have disrupted the formation of terrestrial planets and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris {{are likely to be}} small and dry.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} many {{attempts}} to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the radial velocity method is difficult, because the stellar activity may create signals that mimic the presence <b>of</b> <b>planets.</b> Attempts at direct imaging of potential exoplanets have proven unsuccessful to date.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{expect that}} the {{discovery}} of Planet Nine would aid in understanding the processes behind {{the formation of the}} Solar System and other planetary systems, as well as how unusual the Solar System is, with a lack <b>of</b> <b>planets</b> with masses between that of Earth and that of Neptune, compared to other planetary systems.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into a galactic disc. A galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material from high-velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life. This matter is mostly hydrogen and helium. The cycle of stellar birth and death slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the formation <b>of</b> <b>planets.</b>|$|E
