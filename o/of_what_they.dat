5|$|A {{group of}} friends browse the {{internet}} for pornography, finding a live stream of a woman bound to a chair.

5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E

5|$|Five years later, The Boss {{has been}} elected President of the United States, with {{the other members of}} the Saints, Keith David and former Vice Kings leader Benjamin King acting as cabinet.

5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups {{in countries such as}} Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E
5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach {{of a large number}} of buyers. Fearing the spread <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E

5|$|The war also {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of Athens' resurgence as a power in the Greek world.

5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} became {{convinced}} that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all {{of whom had been}} watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced that he had been cheating, although they differed in their versions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E

5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
5|$|Although {{from the}} outset of the oil boom there were efforts at {{conservation}} and protection of the environment, they generally enjoyed little success. Because of the ease of finding oil in the early decades, wells were often not fully developed before prospectors began looking for more productive wells. The wildcatters not only wasted the valuable resource, but created avoidable environmental contamination with the numerous oil strikes. The rush to extract oil frequently led to the construction of poor storage facilities where leaks were common and water pollution became a serious issue. After heavy logging during the 19th century, the clearing of fields for oil exploration and the demand for lumber to be used in new construction destroyed most of the remaining forest lands in the state. Later environmental management efforts helped restore some of the forest lands but they remain a shadow <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were before statehood.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E

5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were buying.|$|E
5|$|Barr {{died before}} AAA {{had a chance}} to move on with the storyline after When Worlds Collide. Barr's death was {{followed}} shortly afterwards by the Mexican peso crisis, which meant most of the US-based wrestlers were able to earn only a fraction <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were used to while working for AAA. The peso crisis led to Eddie Guerrero working for the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) instead. At the time of Barr's death, both wrestlers were in negotiations to work for ECW part-time, which became full-time in 1995. Guerrero would later end up working full-time for World Championship Wrestling, which had produced When Worlds Collide. After Barr's death, AAA retired the AAA World Tag Team Championship in Barr's honor. With Barr dying and Guerrero leaving, Los Gringos Locos was abandoned as well.|$|E
