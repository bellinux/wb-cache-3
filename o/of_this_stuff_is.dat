500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} soundtrack {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that [...] "some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> quite good".

Leah Greanblatt from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] score, naming it a [...] "shamelessly diva-fied mix of balladry, Broadway cabaret, and backroom boogie-woogie" [...] and complimented on its musical departure from Aguilera's previous studio album Bionic. In a positive review, Billboard editor Kerri Mason praised Burlesque as [...] "a campy celebration of diva-dom and an over-the-top, triple-threat performance". James Wigney of The Advertiser praised Aguilera's [...] "vocal gymnastics", but was mixed towards Cher's numbers on the soundtrack. Maura Johnston from The Village Voice named [...] "The Beautiful People (from Burlesque)" [...] as the thirteenth worst song of 2010, calling it [...] "an interesting failure." ...|$|E

5000|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews, and currently has a 59% ranking on Rotten Tomatoes and 62/100 on Metacritic. The Birmingham Post gave the film two stars {{out of five}} saying [...] "this hideously violent, formula one chase movie lacks the novelty of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto". Empire Magazine gave the film three stars out of five stating that the film [...] "could have done {{with a lot more}} character-meat on those bones." [...] Film4 gave the film two stars out of five stating [...] "It's just a shame none <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> thought through a little more carefully, because there's a talented cast here who have been hung out to dry."

60|$|The next Institution that I {{inspected}} {{was that}} of a paper-sorting works at Spa Road, Bermondsey, where all sorts of waste paper are dealt with in enormous quantities. <b>Of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> some <b>is</b> given and some is bought. Upon delivery it goes to the sorters, who separate it out according to the different classes of the material, after which it is pressed into bales by hydraulic machinery and sold to merchants to be re-made.|$|R

50|$|Monism is {{the view}} that the universe, at the deepest level of analysis, is {{composed}} of one fundamental kind <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> usually contrasted with substance dualism, the view found in the writings of Plato and Descartes that the universe is composed of two kinds of stuff, the physical and the stuff of soul, mind or consciousness.|$|R

[...] Miguel has said that he is [...] "comfortable" [...] with the term [...] "indie R&B" [...] because it [...] "insinuates a higher art.

So {{it was a combination of}} factors, but it was quite startling how the same exact books that were being reviewed kind of like Star Trek novels or something here in the States were being reviewed by very knowledgeable people who were talking about the future of human civilization and about what the 21st-century was going to be like economically. It was the same books, but they had been moved to a completely different context -- namely 'real fiction with important issues being discussed,' which I had always felt they were.

[...] They said, [...] "Obviously, we can't guarantee that," [...] and I said, [...] "Obviously, I can't change the ending."Goldman says the character of Clay [...] "was sympathetic for me. There was a sergeant who was a villain, but I thought Clay was just a nice affable stoop. I'd been in the army.

[...] After denying for years that there was a gay subtext to the film, in the 2010s he admitted it was a deliberate choice on his part. [...] "Homophobia was skyrocketing and I began to think about our core audience—adolescent boys—and how all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> might <b>be</b> trickling down into their psyches," [...] he explained.

5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} Turok games, where {{artists were}} limited to pre-designed levels, Shadow of Oblivion features maps that were entirely built to suit the designers' requirements. Levels also include events that unfold independently of the player's actions. As creative director David Dienstbier explained, players can [...] "see police choppers swooping throughout the world. Police drive up to certain buildings and charge into the building to go fight. Some <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> scripted specifically around the player's actions and movements, {{and some of it}} takes place completely independent of where the player is." [...] In {{the weeks leading up to}} the game's release, the development team was composed of 21 people and worked 24 hour shifts. A separate game, also titled Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion, was released for the Game Boy Color in 2000. Although set in the same fictional universe, it follows a different storyline.|$|E
5000|$|Oggs Cruz of Twitch Film {{expressed}} extreme {{disappointment to}} the film. He stated, [...] "Joyce Bernal's Kimmy Dora and the Temple of Kiyeme misses the entire point. It {{is just one}} humongous mistake that sadly betrays whatever hope the success of Kimmy Dora: Kambal sa Kiyeme (2009) created for the Philippine film industry." [...] He also stated that the film peddled nothing more but nonsense and described the film as plain treachery. Philbert Ortiz Dy of Click The City gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars. He stated, [...] "film is bafflingly bad, the charms of the first movie all sapped away as it makes a even bigger bid for the mainstream... But as the film does the horror, it forgets about its comedic core. None <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>is</b> remotely funny, and the film losing all of its comedic momentum whenever the plot gives its attention to all this overly familiar genre nonsense." [...] He also stated that the film looks sloppily done, and the horror feel {{is a waste of}} time.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a highly}} welcome book that offers a fresh {{perspective}} on the philosophy of biology. 1 It is of interest to both philosophers and biologists and to experienced readers as well as novices. The book is structured into four sections ‘Science’, ‘Biology’, ‘Microbes’ and ‘Humans’ and consists {{of a collection of}} articles written by John Dupré over the past few years. A very wide range of topics are discussed. Among other things, Dupré defends a pluralism that emphasizes that while there <b>is</b> only physical <b>stuff,</b> the kind of things composed <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>are</b> fundamentally diverse, a modest form of social constructivism, the inseparability of science and values, the thesis of promiscuous individualism that there are various ways of dividing living systems into organisms and an anti-reductionist position about biology stating that complex objects possess properties that are autonomous from properties of their constituent parts. Dupré also argues that the success in understanding the chemical basis of genetics has undermined a simplistic view of inheritance, that the New Synthesis is flawed and instead evolutionary theory is a theory in flux, that biological individuals are typically symbiotic wholes involving many organisms of radically different kinds and genomes, that cooperation is a characteristic of life, that medicine has to take seriously the microbial symbiotic relationships, that contrary to evolutionary psychology human beings are in fact pretty well adapted to modern life, that in no sense of the word ‘gene’ can biological legitimacy be given to the concept of human race, that human nature as something fixed and constant throughout the human species is an illusion and that a denial of genetic determinism gives way to a robust sense of human autonomy...|$|R

[...] "I didn't poll any <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff,</b> but I <b>am</b> who I am." [...] Political interest groups generally rank McGovern {{as one of the}} most liberal members of Congress. The National Journal ranked him among the seven most liberal representatives.

The most prominent difference? They aren't related." ...|$|R

60|$|Day {{and night}} the ship throbbed to the tireless {{pulse of the}} propeller, and though one day was very like another, it was {{apparent}} to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the propeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change was at hand. Francois leashed them and brought them on deck. At the first step upon the cold surface, Buck's feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More <b>of</b> <b>this</b> white <b>stuff</b> <b>was</b> falling through the air. He shook himself, but more of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for {{it was his first}} snow.|$|R
50|$|Takins have adaptations {{that help}} them stay warm and dry during the bitter cold of winter in the Himalayan Mountains. A thick, {{secondary}} coat is grown {{to keep out the}} chill. The large, moose-like snout has large sinus cavities to warm up the air a takin inhales before it gets to the lungs. Without this adaptation, takins would lose a large amount of body heat just by breathing. Yet another protection is their oily skin. Although they have no skin glands, their skin secretes an oily, bitter-tasting substance that acts as a natural raincoat in storms and fog. Streaks <b>of</b> <b>this</b> oily <b>stuff</b> can <b>be</b> seen where takins rub. They also have an odor that smells like a strange combination of horse and musk.|$|R

A second drug in the cough syrup, known as promethazine, is used as an antihistamine and commonly used to treat motion sickness and nausea.

I did not know till lately that this Gunga Govind Sing was his domestic servant; but Mr. Hastings, {{in a letter to the}} Court of Directors, calls him his faithful domestic servant, and as such calls upon the Company to reward him.

60|$|When {{they had}} been at work about five weeks there was a pole stuck into their heap of dirt, and {{on the top of}} the pole there was a little red flag flying. At about thirty feet from the surface, when they had already been obliged to insert {{transverse}} logs in the shaft to prevent the sides from falling in, they had come upon a kind of soil altogether different from the ordinary clay through which {{they had been}} working. There was a stratum of loose shingle or gravelly earth, running apparently in a sloping direction, taking the decline of the very slight hill on which their claim was situated. Mick, as soon as this was brought to light, became an altered man. The first bucket <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> that <b>was</b> pulled up was deposited by him separately, and he at once sat down to wash it. This he did in an open tin pan. Handful after handful he washed, shifting and teasing it about in the pan, and then he cast it out, always leaving some very small residuum. He was intent upon his business to a degree that Caldigate would have thought to be beyond the man's nature. With extreme patience he went on washing handful after handful all the day, while the other two pulled up fresh buckets of the same stuff. He would not pause to eat, or hardly to talk. At last there came a loud exclamation. 'By------, we've got it!' Then Dick and Caldigate, stooping down, were shown four or five little specks in the angle of the pan's bottom. Before the sun had set they had stuck up their little red flag, and a crowd of neighbours was standing round them asking questions as to their success.|$|R
