There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until <b>our</b> <b>ears</b> ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup.

500|$|According to Levine and Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was Rihanna's most pop-sounding song since [...] "Don't Stop the Music". Analyzing the song, the BBC's Fraser McAlpine {{questioned}} why [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] {{leaves a}} [...] "positive impression" [...] on the listener despite its arrogant, domineering tone. Critical at first ("Listen to the pneumatic hiss {{at the heart}} of this song. Try and endure the pumping thrust without getting winded. There is simply too much pressure being stuffed into <b>our</b> <b>ears,</b> with too much brutal force"), he concluded that Rihanna sings the song with great passion and gave it four stars out of five. James Dolan gave the song two-and-a-half stars out of five in Rolling Stone, writing that [...] "the trance beat won't keep you in the club unless someone else is paying for the drinks." ...|$|E

500|$|This was {{followed}} by an October 1801 anonymous review in the Monthly Mirror that argued, [...] "It is a matter to be lamented, that, in times like the present, a work of letters can rarely be reviewed upon the ground of its own proper merits... In the consideration of this romance, the judicious critic cannot but feel that one rule of good writing has been studiously observed. His work will not incur the censure passed by the late Mr. Collins upon his Persian Eclogues, namely, that, from erroneous manners, they were 'Irish.'" [...] The review continued, [...] "He tells us it is metrical... He will excuse <b>our</b> <b>ears,</b> but we cannot agree with him. Among the sins of our youth, we, like him, have traded in desultory versification, but have long been brought back to lyrical rhyme, and heroic blank verse. The reasons are obvious... We recommend his beauties to the esteem, and his faults to the forgetfulness, of every reader. Upon the whole, he has our thanks for much amusement, and some information." ...|$|E
500|$|Without a map, {{the route}} they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to [...] {{and could see}} the {{northern}} coast. They were above Possession Bay, which meant {{they would need to}} move eastward to reach their intended destination of Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge. There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge. [...] Early next morning, 20 May, seeing Husvik Harbour below them, they knew that they were on the right path. At seven o'clock in the morning they heard the steam whistle sound from Stromness, [...] "the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to <b>our</b> <b>ears</b> since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914". After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also used}} when {{measuring}} low-level noise in audio equipment, especially in the United States. In Britain, Europe and {{many other parts of}} the world, broadcasters and audio engineers more often use the ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which was developed in the 1960s based on research by the BBC and other organizations. [...] This research showed that <b>our</b> <b>ears</b> respond differently to random noise, and the equal-loudness curves on which the A, B and C weightings were based are really only valid for pure single tones.|$|E
5000|$|Likewise, it will connect that G {{with the}} D {{on the first}} quarter of measure 2 as its fifth. <b>Our</b> <b>ear</b> will {{establish}} this connection instinctively, but nonetheless in accordance with the demands of Nature. In an analogous way, it will link that first G with the C and E of the second half of measure 1 and thus form the concept of another triad. For <b>our</b> <b>ear</b> will miss no opportunity to hear such triads, no matter how far in the background of our consciousness this conception may lie hidden and no matter whether in the plan of the composition it is overshadowed by far more obvious and important relationships." ...|$|R

2500|$|Scatting may be {{desirable}} {{because it does}} not [...] "taint the music with the impurity of denotation". Instead of conveying linguistic content and pointing to something outside itself, scat music—like instrumental music—is self-referential and [...] "d what it mean". Through this wordlessness, commentators have written, scat singing can describe matters beyond words. Music critic Will Friedwald has written that Louis Armstrong's scatting, for example, [...] "has tapped into his own core of emotion", releasing emotions [...] "so deep, so real" [...] that they are unspeakable; his words [...] "bypass <b>our</b> <b>ears</b> and our brains and go directly for our hearts and souls".|$|E

2500|$|In {{perhaps the}} most {{exhaustive}} analysis of the debate, the 1995 article, [...] "Shakespeare and Others: The Authorship of Henry the Sixth, Part One", Gary Taylor suggests that approximately 18.7% of the play (3,846 out of 20,515 words) was written by Shakespeare. Taylor argues that Nashe almost certainly wrote all of Act 1, but he attributes to Shakespeare 2.4, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4., 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 through line 32. Taylor also suggests that the Temple Garden scene (2.4), in which the rival factions identify themselves through the selection of red and white roses, {{may have been a}} later addition. Scenes 4.5 to 4.7 include a series of rhyming couplets between Talbot and his son (4.5.15–4.7.50), which, while unusual to <b>our</b> <b>ears,</b> apparently had [...] "an electric effect upon early audiences." [...] Traditionally, these lines have often been pinpointed {{as one of the most}} obviously non-Shakespearian sections of the play. Roger Warren, for instance, argues that these scenes are written in a language [...] "so banal they must be non-Shakespearean." ...|$|E

2500|$|C.B. Cox writes, [...] "In Elizabethan {{times the}} crime of buggery was {{punishable}} by death. Today this legal term for homosexual intercourse offends <b>our</b> <b>ears,</b> but its use {{draws attention to the}} abhorrence with which many Christians of the time (and since) regarded physical intimacies between men. In these circumstances it's difficult to believe that Shakespeare would not only participate in an active homosexual relation with a handsome young man, but broadcast this affair to the world in sexually explicit sonnets pass round among his friends." [...] The competing view of a bisexual Shakespeare conflicts with Wilde's view. Cox bases his argument on the verb [...] "to have." [...] He argues that why must the verb usage of [...] "to have" [...] mean sexually possess? Elizabethan people had trouble believing [...] "had" [...] meant to have sexually {{when it came to the}} young man, but Cox writes, [...] "It's difficult to refute Pequiney's contention that in these three examples (Sonnet 52, Sonnet 75, and Sonnet 87) there is a sexual innuendo in [...] "had," [...] particularly when in Sonnet 129, which concerns heterosexual love for the Dark Lady, everyone agrees that there is such an implication,. Elizabethan society feared homosexual desire, but embraced heterosexual conquests. Cox writes, [...] "The poems may be based on personal experience but still that doesn't actually prove that Shakespeare 'had' the youth. There's an element of playfulness in the sexual innuendoes, a delight in wit as if Shakespeare is enjoying his own virtuosity and may not have expected to be taken literally... In his poems to the youth he may be using sexual innuendo as a kind of joke, a playful but at times almost serious hint that his affection may even extend to physical desire." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{landed at}} Bojnik near Radan Mountain, a {{position}} surrounded by Bulgars, Albanians, White Russians, and Germans. Through {{the latter part}} of August he, and his team back in Bari and Caserta, and the Partisans in Serbia and elsewhere, finalised the details of Ratweek. Almost to cue, the White Russians blew up their ammunition dump and the enemy started to retreat. The following day, Maclean moved to near Leskovac, and the next day, Ratweek began, with fifty heavy bombers attacking the town at 11:30. [...] "Already the Fortresses were over their target -- were past it -- when, as we watched, the whole of Leskovac seemed to rise bodily into the air in a tornado of dust and smoke and debris,and a great rending noise fell on <b>our</b> <b>ears.</b> When we looked at the sky again, the Forts, still relentlessly following their course, were mere silvery dots in the distance. [...] Even the Partisans seemed subdued." [...] That night, the land offensive began, and Maclean watched the Partisans attack the Belgrade-Salonika railway, blowing up bridges, burning sleepers, and rendering it unusable. [...] When the Germans tried to repair it, the Balkan Air Force soon dissuaded them. They tried to evacuate Greece and Macedonia by air, but again the Allies thwarted them. Maclean, with three British companions and one Yugoslav guide, made his way on horseback north into Serbia. [...] They travelled for several days through prosperous countryside, [...] "so surprising after Bosnia and Dalmatia", where the peasants, who expressed great friendship for Britain and a certain caution about the Partisans, gave them lavish hospitality and food. One evening they camped outside a village, and soon saw [...] "a procession of peasant women arriving with an array of bowls, baskets, jars and bottles. From these they produced eggs and sour milk and fresh bread and a couple of chickens and a roast suckling-pig and cream cheese and pastry and wine and peaches and grapes". The journey produced many such vignettes, some pleasant, others of confusion, discomfort, worry. [...] Altogether Maclean found it [...] "an agreeable existence", reflecting [...] "with heightened distaste" [...] on the life he lived on Vis in the shadow of political negotiations. [...] He hoped he could remain in Serbia to be there when Belgrade was liberated, but received a message that Tito had disappeared—or as Churchill put it [...] "levanted"—and he had to try to find him. [...] A plane was sent to pick up Maclean.|$|E
