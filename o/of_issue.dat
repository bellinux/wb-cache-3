5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E

5|$|As {{the series}} progressed, some critics began to express {{frustration}} with the comic. Joey Smith, also with Inside Pulse, found the large cast was difficult to track by the fourth issue. In a review <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, but sometimes thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included the comic book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.|$|E

5|$|Newly issued Irish {{postage stamps}} are {{available}} from the Philatelic Bureau of An Post in the Dublin, General Post Office. Commemorative and special issue stamps are usually available for one year from the date <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> Until the mid-1960s the Irish stamp-issuing policy was very conservative, with only a few new ones each year; up to four or five commemoratives, usually of two values, plus the occasional updated, or new, definitives. During the 1970s and beyond, the quantity produced rose considerably.|$|E
5|$|One {{circumstance}} {{which may}} call for issuance {{of a second}} passport of a particular type is a prolonged visa-processing delay especially for Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe visa applications.

The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> 6 in August 2012, Vaughan {{announced that the}} series would take a two-month hiatus, after which the first six-issue story arc was published in trade paperback form in October for $9.99 before the series' return in November, a practice that Vaughan and Staples would continue after each successive story arc and trade paperback publication. That same month, Vaughan and Staples promoted the series by appearing together at the 2012 New York Comic Con, their first appearance together since the series' debut. Some retailers refused to display the trade paperback because its cover (a reuse of the first issue's cover) depicts Alana breastfeeding Hazel.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues.

Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
5|$|Although issue #7 sold out, Image Comics PR & Marketing Director Jennifer deGuzman {{announced}} in a December 12, 2012 letter to retailers {{that it would}} not reprint select comics, such as that issue. DeGuzman explained the move as a result of decreasing orders on well-performing titles like Saga, despite critical acclaim and consistently selling out at a distributor level, and pointed to orders on Saga #8, which decreased 4% from orders on issue #7. Rather than invest in second printings, deGuzman explained, Image would instead focus its attention on ensuring that the first printing garners the sales desired. This move displeased some retailers, which prompted Image Publisher Eric Stephenson to announce the following day that Image would indeed publish a second printing <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> #7 at a considerable discount, but cautioned that the publisher {{would not be able to}} reprint every issue of the series indefinitely, and implored retailers not to under-order the series.|$|E
