5|$|Shakur {{personally}} cross-examined the witnesses, getting White {{to admit}} that he had once been in love with her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate. During the retrial, the defendants repeatedly left or were thrown out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> Both defendants were acquitted in the retrial; six jurors interviewed after the trial stated that they did not believe the two key prosecution witnesses. Shakur was immediately returned to Morristown, New Jersey, under a heavy guard following the trial. Louis Chesimard (Shakur's ex-husband) and Paul Stewart, the other two alleged robbers, had been acquitted in June.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, 2017, Dashcam footage seen by {{investigators}} and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> {{during the trial}} was released to public. On June 21, 2017, Ramsey County released additional evidence, including footage taken inside Yanez's squad car which shows Diamond Reynolds' daughter comforting her mother after the shooting.|$|E
40|$|Abstract for {{the volume}} Contributors to <b>The</b> Divine <b>Courtroom</b> in Comparative Perspective treat one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{pervasive}} religious metaphors, that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom,</b> in both its historical and thematic senses. In order {{to shed light}} on <b>the</b> various manifestations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom,</b> this volume consists of essays by scholars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Near East, Hebrew Bible, Second Temple Judaism, early Christianity, Talmud, Islam, medieval Judaism, and classical Greek literature. Contributions to the volume primarily center upon three related facets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine courtroom: <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> in <b>the</b> earthly legal system; <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> as <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> historical justice; and <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> as <b>the</b> venue in which God is called to answer for his own unjust acts...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Supreme Court <b>of</b> Victoria is an {{heritage}} {{listed building}} steeped in tradition and reticent to physical change. <b>The</b> current capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> to exhibit advanced technology derived evidence is substantially inadequate. This paper discusses the negative environmental impact, <b>the</b> inadequacies <b>of</b> <b>courtroom</b> facilities and inconsistencies {{in comparison to}} the available evidence and <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> jurors and courts in relation to evidence presentation. It also discusses the issues, possibilities and limitations involved in <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> an IT solution to <b>the</b> presentation <b>of</b> evidence...|$|R
50|$|Her {{trial began}} on 15 December 1902 at the Old Bailey before Sir Forrest Fulton, <b>the</b> Recorder <b>of</b> London. <b>The</b> <b>courtroom</b> {{was packed with}} spectators, many of them {{stockbrokers}} {{who had come to}} see Byron.|$|R
25|$|During Spilsbury's lifetime, and {{as early}} as 1925 after the murder {{conviction}} of Norman Thorne, concern began to be expressed by informed opinion about his domination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and {{about the quality of}} his methodology. The influential Law Journal expressed 'profound disquiet' at the verdict, noting 'the more than Papal infallibility with which Sir Bernard Spilsbury is rapidly being invested by juries.'.|$|E
25|$|On November 13, 2007, Reiser's eight-year-old son, Rory, who {{had made}} one out of two planned {{appearances}} in the pretrial hearing, arrived from Russia to testify for the prosecution. Both of his grandmothers were ordered out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> before he took the stand. The prosecution and defense teams both considered the testimony inconsistent and Du Bois complained that the boy had been coached.|$|E
25|$|The film Alleged (2010), {{a romantic}} drama set around the Scopes Trial, {{starring}} Brian Dennehy as Clarence Darrow and Fred Thompson as William Jennings Bryan, {{was released by}} Two Shoes Productions. While the main storyline is fictional, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> scenes are accurate according to the actual trial transcripts. Coincidentally, Dennehy had played Matthew Harrison Brady, the fictionalized counterpart of Bryan, in the 2007 Broadway revival of Inherit the Wind.|$|E
25|$|Moses appears {{eight times}} in carvings that ring the Supreme Court Great Hall ceiling. His face is {{presented}} {{along with other}} ancient figures such as Solomon, the Greek god Zeus and <b>the</b> Roman goddess <b>of</b> wisdom, Minerva. <b>The</b> Supreme Court Building's east pediment depicts Moses holding two tablets. Tablets representing the Ten Commandments can be found carved in <b>the</b> oak <b>courtroom</b> doors, on <b>the</b> support frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom's</b> bronze gates and in the library woodwork. A controversial image is one that sits directly above <b>the</b> Chief Justice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States' head. In <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 40-foot-long Spanish marble carving is a tablet displaying Roman numerals I through X, with some numbers partially hidden.|$|R

25|$|The {{east and}} west wings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{courthouse}} are separated and unconnected due to <b>the</b> high ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>courtroom</b> on <b>the</b> second floor beyond <b>the</b> <b>courtroom's</b> balcony. <b>The</b> east wing on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central stairway from the second floor leading to <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> balcony are storage and mechanical spaces. The small stairway on the west wing from the second floor opens into a storage area with potential office usage. This area has an additional stairway leading into the building's attic and clock house tower. The floor is narrower than <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> on each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building and above the rooftop in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courthouse's corner quadrants.|$|R
25|$|More than 100 {{people were}} present in the {{courtroom}} as the tape was played, and many members of both the jury and the audience wept openly upon hearing the contents, with several members of the audience either burying their heads in their hands, daubing tears from their eyes or rushing out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> before the tape had finished. Bittaker was undisturbed at hearing the contents of the tape—smiling throughout the hearing of the recording.|$|E
25|$|The {{figures of}} the wayang are also present in the {{paintings}} of that time, for example, the roof murals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> in Klungkung, Bali. They are still present in traditional Balinese painting today. The figures are painted, flat woodcarvings (a maximum of 5 to 15mm thick—barely half an inch) with movable arms. The head is solidly attached to the body. Wayang klitik {{can be used to}} perform puppet plays either during the day or at night. This type of wayang is relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1981 the {{building}} was renovated with much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> refurbished with Italian silk paneling, hand-painted carpet, and new furniture built by inmates. This refurbishing was completed in 2002 when the State of Oregon Law Library’s renovations were completed. During this time in 1989, {{the building}} was added to Salem’s Historic Properties List as a local historic landmark. Funds for the renovations came from private donors. The stained-glass skylight located above the courtroom that has a design of the Oregon State Seal was reinforced at this time and a protective clear skylight was built over the decorative skylight installed in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was carried}} out between 1616 and 1733, {{bringing}} the castle back into good order. As part <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> spine wall was rebuilt properly, and the second floor windows enlarged. <b>The</b> <b>courtroom</b> featured a chair for the Stannary court judge, additional seating for the court officials and a railed, public section around <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. <b>The</b> <b>courtroom</b> also doubled as a hall for village dances and feasts. At <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, however, Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, <b>the</b> Lord Warden <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stannaries, began <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> Dartmoor Prison at Princetown. Dartmoor Prison and Princetown grew increasingly important and courts began to be held there instead of Lydford Castle.|$|R
50|$|His {{first case}} as a judge was {{probably}} the most memorable: the unsuccessful libel action by Patrick Kavanagh against the Leader magazine. Such was the interest that members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public queued for hours in <b>the</b> hope <b>of</b> getting into <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b>|$|R
40|$|Epistemology is {{important}} in the debate about science and technology in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> <b>The</b> epistemological issues and the arguments about them in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> scientific and technical evidence are now well developed. Of equal importance, though, is an understanding of norms of persuasion and how those norms may differ across disciplines and groups. Norms <b>of</b> persuasion in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and in legal briefs differ from norms at a scientific conference and in scientific journals. Here, Kritzer examines the disconnect between science and <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differing norms <b>of</b> persuasion found within the scientific community and within the legal community...|$|R
25|$|The {{trial for}} Haywood Patterson {{occurred}} while the Norris and Weems cases were still under consideration by the jury. When the jury returned its verdict {{from the first}} trial, the jury from the second trial was taken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> When the verdicts of guilty were announced, the courtroom erupted in cheers, as did the crowd outside. A band, there {{to play for a}} show of Ford Motor Company cars outside, began playing Hail, Hail the Gang's All Here and There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight. The celebration was so loud that it was most likely heard by the second jury waiting inside.|$|E
25|$|In the 1840s a gang {{of criminals}} terrorised Coggeshall. Their {{headquarters}} were on Stoneham Street and their success {{was due to the}} unpaid and untrained, spare-time parish constables' inability to deal effectively with crime in their local area. The gang committed burglaries and violent robberies across Coggeshall, Great Tey, Cressing and Bradwell. Their crimes were often brutal and mainly directed at the elderly. Dell's hole in nearby Earls Colne is named after Mr Dell who was attacked by the gang. Such was the interest in the gang that when they were finally caught and brought to trial, the galleries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> were filled with fashionably dressed women. One of the members was hanged, and several others were transported.|$|E
25|$|The NAACP {{provided}} {{legal defense}} of the black men convicted by the state for the riot and carried {{the case to the}} US Supreme Court. Its ruling overturned the Elaine convictions and established important precedent about the conduct of trials. The Supreme Court found that the original trial was held under conditions that adversely affected the defendants' rights. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> audience were armed, as was a mob outside, so there was intimidation of the court and jury. The 79 black defendants had been quickly tried and convicted by an all-white jury: 12 were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death; 67 were condemned to sentences from 20 years to life. No white man was prosecuted for any of the many black deaths.|$|E
500|$|The {{finished}} building reflected {{two major}} influences: Judge Hogan had wanted {{a more traditional}} courthouse, similar in style to the United States Supreme Court building, while architect Mayne pushed for a modern glass and steel structure. Though opposed at first to each other's design thoughts, the two worked together to incorporate elements of each person's ideas. After years <b>of</b> working on <b>the</b> design process, including 25 revisions, the two compromised on elements with Hogan responsible for pushing {{for a set of}} steps leading to the main floor on the second level as well as <b>the</b> feel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms.</b> While Mayne had a reputation as an architect of confrontation and dislocation, this was one of three GSA Design in Excellence programs he had worked on with the artistically conservative federal government. Regarding them, he said: [...] "Obviously, those are buildings that require negotiation. I couldn't be too bad." ...|$|R
40|$|Feigned {{insanity}} {{in nineteenth-century}} America is appraised through a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medical and legal literature. The authors {{focus on the}} explanations for feigning, procedures used in uncovering feigning, and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> feigning in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> This discussion <b>of</b> feigned insanity demonstrates <b>the</b> remarkable consistency <b>of</b> approach to this form <b>of</b> malingering over <b>the</b> past 200 years...|$|R
50|$|A 1923 {{renovation}} {{added an}} elevator, three new wings, {{each with a}} courtroom, and a rotunda with an elaborate glass dome joining <b>the</b> wings. <b>Courtroom</b> 1 was added at this time. It is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>courtrooms</b> in <b>the</b> United States, with 500 seats. A second renovation was completed in 1995. Twenty-six portraits of county judges grace <b>the</b> building, many <b>of</b> which were painted in the 1920s and 1930s by Mr. and Mrs. Vale. Two 1930 murals, Knowledge and Justice were restored in 1994.|$|R
25|$|In the Senate {{election}} held in May 2007, Trillanes successfully {{launched a}} nationwide campaign from his prison cell {{as he ran}} and won {{a seat in the}} Philippine Senate on a shoestring budget. He was elected to the Senate as guest candidate for the anti-administration Genuine Opposition ticket, and assumed office on June 30, 2007. He made history for being the first Philippine senator to be elected while in jail when more than 11 million people voted him into office. On November 29, 2007, Trillanes, together with the soldiers facing coup d'état charges in connection with the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny, marched out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> while attending a hearing towards the Peninsula Manila hotel in Makati City, to reiterate their call for the ouster of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war Knight proposed to the War Artists' Advisory Committee the Nuremberg war crimes trials as a subject. The Committee agreed, and Knight went to Germany in January 1946 and spent three months observing the main trial from inside the courtroom. The result was the large oil painting, The Nuremberg Trial. This painting departs from the realism of her wartime paintings, in that, whilst apparently realistically depicting the Nazi war criminals sitting in the dock, the rear and side walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> are missing, to reveal a ruined city, partially in flames.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} {{days leading up to}} House's court case, House realizes the {{severity}} of the situation and finally apologizes to Tritter (episode [...] "Words and Deeds"). When Tritter refuses to accept the apology, House goes into rehab, putting on a show for Tritter and the judge, but Tritter cites his experiences with addicts as evidence House has not changed. The judge tells Tritter that she does not believe House to be the drug dealer that Tritter tried to show him to be and orders Tritter to move on after House is exonerated due to Cuddy committing perjury. Just before the bailiff escorts House out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> Tritter tells him: [...] "Good luck. I hope I'm wrong about you." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{project will}} analyse <b>the</b> {{intersection}} <b>of</b> gender and power relations {{at play in}} courtrooms during international prosecutions, {{in order to discuss}} the problematic connected to victimhood and witness-bearing. It will focus on the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which holds <b>the</b> primacy <b>of</b> being <b>the</b> first international tribunal prosecuting gender-based violence, with a special focus on wartime rape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bosniak Muslim female population. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this project is to question whether international tribunals offer effective prosecution of gender-based violence committed during armed conflicts, by taking <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> two victim witnesses who testified in the landmark case Prosecutor vs. Kunarac et al. at The Hague. Through critical discourse analysis, Foucauldian approaches to law, power and sexuality, and feminist legal scholarship, I will analyse whether rape survivors are offered access to justice, adequate treatment during the trials, and support; eminently, I will examine possible relations of power and domination hidden behind these crimes and their prosecution, in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms...</b>|$|R
25|$|Jury {{trials are}} also {{available}} for some few areas of civil law (for example defamation cases and those involving police conduct); these also require 12 jurors (9 in the County Court). However less than 1% of civil trials involve juries. At the new Manchester Civil Justice Centre, constructed in 2008, fewer than 10 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 48 <b>courtrooms</b> had jury facilities.|$|R
500|$|... "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] {{features}} <b>the</b> recurring gag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kool-Aid Man bursting through <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> wall at an inopportune time, exclaiming [...] "OH YEAH!!" [...] after {{a series}} <b>of</b> people in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> say [...] "Oh no!!" [...] in turn. The Kool-Aid Man then slowly backs out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{hole in the wall}} in embarrassment. [...] This time, the judge implores <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court to please stop saying [...] "Oh no!," [...] because, as he puts it, [...] "The f**kin' Kool-Aid guy's gonna keep showing up!!" ...|$|R
500|$|Devising {{a sequel}} to [...] "Squeeze" [...] posed a {{challenge}} for writers Glen Morgan and James Wong, who had never written a follow-up to any of their work previously. Morgan felt that the primary difficulty was in moving the story forward while still leaving room to recap what had happened previously {{for the benefit of}} viewers who had not seen the first episode; this led to the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> scene as a means to repeat any necessary information. Morgan also felt that Harry Longstreet, the initial director for [...] "Squeeze", had been [...] "a problem", and a second episode allowed for the use of scenes which Longstreet had failed to film for the earlier episode. To this end, the episode was helmed by David Nutter, who series creator Chris Carter considered the [...] "best" [...] director working on the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} racial {{injustice}} appears symbolically {{in the novel}} as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, {{even though it is}} not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> scenes. Jones writes, [...] "he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson.... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger." ...|$|E
500|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} the {{testimony}} of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup. The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank. White and Rivers, although convicted, {{had not yet been}} sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony. White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a [...]357 magnum pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial. Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> after many of her attempted motions were denied. The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with pleurisy.|$|E
50|$|A new {{courtroom}} {{facility was}} completed in 2009. The facility, which {{was made possible by}} an additional $2 million donation from the Levin family, is named the Martin Levin Advocacy Center in honor of UF Law alumnus Martin H. Levin (J.D. '88), and son <b>of</b> Fred Levin. <b>The</b> facility is 20,000 gross square feet, two stories tall, and includes a state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art <b>courtroom.</b> <b>The</b> new <b>courtroom</b> is designed to incorporate new technology to allow students to understand <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> technology in modern practice.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{problems}} involved in representing the Australian legal system on film and television, how {{these problems are}} addressed, and what commentary these texts are making about <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> law in Australia. It is suggested that the formal and dress requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian legal system make the trial process a ritual based around <b>the</b> reification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawyer and <b>the</b> stigmatisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accused [...] -in short, a degradation ceremony [...] -and that Australian legal dramas reflect this. But because of this lack <b>of</b> dynamism in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> Australian legal dramas must seek alternative sits of drama [...] -often domestic, and invariably outside <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> In this way, they present a more holistic view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawyer/judge's life, reinterpreting court proceedings (and <b>the</b> institution <b>of</b> law itself) as a repressed set-up by actively displacing dramatic tension outside <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> thus denying <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> <b>the</b> centrality it occupies in American representations and, by extension, American culture...|$|R
