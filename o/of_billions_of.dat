5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and tens <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster {{also contributed to the}} pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E

5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in 2001, Bush stated his {{opposition}} to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80percent of the world's population and would have cost tens <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> dollars per year. He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Rico pins Panay to {{the exposed}} {{core of the}} U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the {{targeting}} computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed at the loss <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E
5|$|In roughly 5billion years, the Sun will {{cool and}} expand outward to many times its current {{diameter}} (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and {{leaving behind a}} stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, {{over the course of}} tens <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years, {{it is likely that the}} Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.|$|E
5|$|KFN was {{an early}} {{casualty}} of the subprime mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company.

5|$|Swarming {{behaviour}} is {{a response}} to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million individuals per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Gemini and Keck telescopes {{obtained}} {{spectra of}} Haumea which showed strong crystalline water ice features {{similar to the}} surface of Pluto's moon Charon. This is peculiar, because crystalline ice forms at temperatures above 110 K, whereas Haumea's surface temperature is below 50 K, a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed. In addition, the structure of crystalline ice is unstable under the constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from the Sun that strike trans-Neptunian objects. The timescale for the crystalline ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on the order of ten million years, yet trans-Neptunian objects have been in their present cold-temperature locations for timescales <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years. Radiation damage should also redden and darken the surface of trans-Neptunian objects where the common surface materials of organic ices and tholin-like compounds are present, {{as is the case with}} Pluto. Therefore, the spectra and colour suggest Haumea and its family members have undergone recent resurfacing that produced fresh ice. However, no plausible resurfacing mechanism has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|In December 1978, Metro {{announced}} that the new completion date of the Green Line past the Anacostia Station to Rosecroft Raceway would be 1987 (a year later than anticipated). Metro also {{announced that}} cost considerations had forced it to abandon the high-vault ceiling design for all unbuilt stations (except Navy Yard), and that a less-costly design would be used at all unbuilt Green Line stations. By July 1979, despite the release <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> dollars in construction funds by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Metro had pushed back {{the construction of the}} Anacostia Station to mid-1985 and the completion of the Branch Avenue Line to late 1986. But construction schedules continued to slip: despite reaffirming its construction schedules in December 1979, Metro announced in January 1980 that completion of the Green Line terminus in Prince George's County would be pushed back six more months to 1987.|$|E
5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> US dollars per year – including {{a wide range of}} transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E
5|$|Truman {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} when Roosevelt died in April 1945, just {{before the end of}} World War II. In the war's aftermath, Americans wanted to know why the U.S. seemed ill-prepared for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Barkley sponsored a resolution to create the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack and was chosen as chairman of the ten-person committee. The committee's report, delivered on July 20, 1946, exonerated Roosevelt of any blame for the attack and highlighted weaknesses in communications between branches of the U.S. armed forces, leading {{to the creation of the}} United States Department of Defense. Barkley also helped ensure U.S. participation in the United Nations and advocated approval <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> dollars in loans to rebuild Europe.

50|$|There are {{typically}} 50 million bacterial cells in {{a gram of}} soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water. In a much-cited study from 1998 the world bacterial biomass was calculated to be 350 to 550 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of carbon, equal to between 60% and 100% of the carbon in plants. More recent studies of seafloor microbes have cast considerable doubt on that, one study in 2012 reduced the calculated microbial biomass on the seafloor from the original 303 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of C to just 4.1 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of C, reducing the global biomass of prokaryotes to 50 to 250 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of C. Further, if the average per cell biomass of prokaryotes is reduced from 86 to 14 femtograms C then the global biomass of prokaryotes is reduced to 13 to 44.5 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of C, equal to between 2.4% and 8.1% of the carbon in plants.|$|R

5|$|The further {{evolution}} of Callisto after accretion {{was determined by}} the balance of the radioactive heating, cooling through thermal conduction near the surface, and solid state or subsolidus convection in the interior. Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all icy moons. It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting point, due to the temperature dependence of ice viscosity. Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is a slow process with ice motions of the order of 1centimeter per year, but is, in fact, a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales. It is thought to proceed in the so-called stagnant lid regime, where a stiff, cold outer layer of Callisto conducts heat without convection, whereas the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime. For Callisto, the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid lithosphere with a thickness of about 100km. Its presence would explain the lack of any signs of the endogenic activity on the Callistoan surface. The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered, because under the high pressures found there, water ice exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the ice I on the surface to ice VII in the center. The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large-scale ice melting and any resulting differentiation that would have otherwise formed a large rocky core and icy mantle. Due to the convection process, however, very slow and partial separation and differentiation of rocks and ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> years and may be continuing to this day.|$|E
