Using this, she will be able to deduce her own reaction, and figure <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the experience of seeing red will feel like.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name {{most of the}} things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not figure <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.|$|E
500|$|Ichiki and 916 of his regiment's 2,300 troops, {{designated}} the [...] "First Element" [...] and carrying seven days' supply of food, were delivered to Taivu Point, about [...] east of Lunga Point, by six destroyers at 01:00 on August 19. [...] Ichiki {{was ordered to}} scout the American positions {{and wait for the}} remainder of his force to arrive. Known as the Ichiki Butai (Ichiki Detachment), they were an elite and battle-seasoned force but as was about to be discovered, they were heavily stricken with [...] "victory disease" [...] – overconfidence due to previous success. Ichiki was so confident in the superiority of his men that he decided to destroy the American defenders before the remaining majority of his force arrived, even writing in his journal [...] "18 August, landing; 20 August, march by night and battle; 21 August, enjoyment of the fruit of victory". He concocted a brazenly simple plan: march straight down the beach and through the American defenses. Leaving about 100 personnel behind as a rear guard, Ichiki marched west with the remaining 800 men of his unit and made camp before dawn about [...] east of the Lunga perimeter. The U.S. Marines at Lunga Point received intelligence that a Japanese landing had occurred and took steps to find <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was happening.|$|E

5000|$|... "A Desperate Man" [...] {{is written}} by Nicole Mirante-Matthews and {{directed}} by Leslie Libman. According to executive producer Gary Glasberg, [...] "Ziva has been going through some decisions and choices, just as Tony has. With this week’s episode, Ray is going to return, and she’s {{going to have to}} face some decisions of her own and figure <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what’s</b> going on with that relationship. This was an opportunity to tease that and bring it all up to the surface".|$|R
5000|$|We {{have to find}} <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what's</b> <b>out</b> there. I'll {{probably}} just collect all the songs that's floating around and make my own mixtape called The Leak since people want the music so bad. To {{tell you the truth}} though, there's a song I did with Kanye West out there—of course you want to save that for your album, but the rest of them songs probably wouldn't have made the album. There's a song floating around that says 'produced by Timbaland'.|$|R
2500|$|Marco Rubio– [...] "Freedom {{of speech}} on campuses {{seems to be}} under assault {{in some of the}} {{supposedly}} finest institutions in this country... In the case of Missouri, I'm still trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it is that got the president fired." ...|$|E
2500|$|Threats {{like that}} are no way to conduct the serious, sober discussions needed to figure <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> ails the movie {{industry}} and {{to come up with}} solutions. [...] It was Hollywood's arrogance in pushing bills through Congress without proper vetting that caused them to be withdrawn; these threats also are not helpful to figuring out what ails the industry and how to solve their issues.|$|E
2500|$|The Budig glider was {{a single}} seat biplane or {{sesquiplane}} of unequal span and chord with three forward surfaces supported {{on a pair of}} box section booms. The upper foreplane was claimed to provide automatic stability and carried an elevator behind it, though Flight remarked that [...] "It is difficult, from the illustration, to make <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> this arrangement is [...] supposed to do." [...] The pilot sat at the upper wing trailing edge, completely exposed at the front of a short central fuselage which supported a rectangular fin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only, Baas, {{that if we}} do {{not want}} to be killed in this place from which there is no escape, it is {{necessary}} that you should find <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> on <b>what</b> day and at what hour Dogeetah is going to arrive." ...|$|R

According to the author, [...] "My book is about trying to find <b>out</b> <b>exactly,</b> specifically, <b>what</b> happened to those people." ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 2015, Eton accidentally sent emails to 400 {{prospective}} students, {{offering them}} conditional {{entrance to the}} school in September 2017. The email was intended for nine students, but an IT glitch caused the email {{to be sent to}} 400 additional families, who didn't necessarily have a place. In response, the school issued the following statement: [...] "This error was discovered within minutes and each family was immediately contacted to notify them that it should be disregarded and to apologise. We take this type of incident very seriously indeed and so a thorough investigation, overseen by the headmaster Tony Little and led by the tutor for admissions, is being carried out to find <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> went wrong and ensure it cannot happen again. Eton College offers its sincere apologies to those boys concerned and their families. We deeply regret the confusion and upset this must have caused." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{our belief}} that the {{abductor}} of the child suffocated her to death, possibly by putting {{a hand over her}} mouth." [...] The coroner's report recommended that officials continue to investigate. Inspector Healey immediately detailed detectives to find <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> had happened. He told the Chicago Inter Ocean: [...] "I have forty detectives at work today on the theory that the criminals lived in the neighborhood of the Paroubek home. We are investigating every incident of the lives of the Paroubeks since they came to Chicago in order to trace a possible enemy. It will surprise me if the criminals are not arrested within a week." [...] To the Chicago Tribune he stated, [...] "We have one or two theories, but nothing specific enough to even talk about. I intend to place more men on the case tomorrow." [...] Lt. Costello returned to investigating the anonymous letters. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Hoffman's and Paroubek's theory as fact.|$|E

5000|$|Film critic Dan Schneider wrote, of the film's {{narrative}} structure: [...] "Many {{critics have}} taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic...But this is wrong, for alcohol isn’t her problem - nor is her chain smoking. They are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction, and much to Cassavetes’ credit, as a storyteller, he never lets us find <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what's</b> wrong with Myrtle, and despite her coming through in the end, there's no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence. This sort of end without resolution links Cassavetes directly with the more daring European directors of the recent past, who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience, and forcing their viewers to cogitate, even if it hurts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the song's backing vocals, Mike Mills {{explained}} to Melody Maker: [...] "'Harborcoat' from Reckoning has got me and Michael and Bill all doing completely unrelated things, {{and yet it}} works together. Because of the production we insisted on from Mitch and Don, which I know must have been incredibly frustrating for them, it's hard to pick <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what's</b> going on. We tried it again on [...] "Find The River." [...] I {{had the idea that}} Bill and I would go in and do some harmonies without listening to each other. It's great because mine is this incredibly angst-ridden emotional thing, and Bill's is this really low-key sort of ambling part. They're two opposite ends of the spectrum but they're both on there, and it's a beautiful thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Smiley {{speaks about}} how this made her feel {{irritable}} because this was an endeavor of which she spent over a year writing. She thought that her feeling and passions were well displayed {{but none of this}} was mentioned by critics. In the end, Smiley was still happy with Moo. She was happy that it could be read in two ways. She had intended for it to be tricky and evasive. [...] "And then, it turned <b>out,</b> that's <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it was!" ...|$|R

5000|$|.....several of Ellin's best-known and best-loved works end somewhere shy {{of telling}} the full story, instead leaving the reader him- or herself to fill {{in some of the}} blanks. [...] "The Specialty of the House," [...] for example, lays out all the clues behind the culinary masterpieces at Sbirro's Restaurant but we readers have to figure <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what's</b> going on back in that kitchen. At the end of [...] "The House Party," [...] Ellin {{provides}} glimpses of {{the true nature of the}} festivities but then leaves us uneasily sorting through the larger ramifications... These open endings...force us to become an active part of the storytelling, at the very least puzzling out the [...] "Why?" [...] and [...] "What if?" [...] and [...] "But suppose…" [...] possibilities, or trying to tie up the loose ends left purposefully dangling, or supplying the emotional responses underplayed by the author, or at the further extreme, having some hefty moral quandaries laid at our doorsteps, as Ellin's [...] "The Moment of Decision" [...] so expertly does.|$|R
5000|$|On March 25, 2015, it was {{reported}} that Kantner had suffered a heart attack. “Paul’s health took a bad turn this week,” the members of Jefferson Starship said via a Facebook post. “He’s in the hospital, stable and undergoing tests to find <b>out</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what’s</b> going on, but doctors suspect he had a heart attack. He is in the best possible care and we are sending him all of our best wishes, good thoughts and healing vibes." [...] The band also stated that they're [...] "continuing the tour without him, as most of the shows are sold out or close to it and we have to honor our contracts and our fans who bought tickets and put on the best show possible,” the band said in its official statement. “We will dedicate every show to Paul until he is well enough to rejoin us onstage.” Kantner returned to the group later on in the year, in time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jefferson Airplane with special shows that also featured Grateful Dead tribute group Jazz is Dead.|$|R
