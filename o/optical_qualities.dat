40|$|ABSTRACT: By {{comparison}} to man-made optical systems, {{the human eye}} has relatively low <b>optical</b> <b>quality.</b> Consequently, standard industrial metrics of <b>optical</b> <b>quality,</b> such as RMS wavefront error and Strehl ratio, {{may not be the}} most useful metrics of <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> for predicting the quality of vision or the optical limits to visual performance. In this paper we present a variety of optical metrics defined in terms of wavefront quality and image quality that may prove more useful. An evaluation of these metrics for a population of well-corrected, normal, healthy eyes indicates significant mutual correlation among these metrics. Principal component analysis indicates that 89 % of the variance between eyes can be accounted for by 4 principal components, the first of which weights the various metrics almost uniformly...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} aging on visual function and <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> in a healthy adult population and provide reference values for different age ranges. Methods: We conducted a prospective study with 198 healthy volunteers from 31 to 70 years of age. The visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) at 3, 6, 12 and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) frequencies were assessed, together with values of <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> and intraocular scatter- ing obtained with a double-pass system(Optical Quality Analysis System– OQAS), specifically the modulation transfer function cutoff frequency (MTFcutoff), the Strehl ratio, the OQAS values (OV) at contrasts of 100, 20 and nine per cent and the objective scatter index (OSI). We studied the change of these variables with age and obtained standard values for <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> and intraocular scattering parameters for four age groups: 31 to 40, 41 to 50, 51 to 60 and 61 to 70 years. Results: We found significant correlations between age and all variables analysed and signifi- cant differences among the age groups considered except for CS (3 cpd) (p= 0. 067). Ageing particularly affected low-contrast parameters, such as theOV nine per cent and theOSI, which decreased to 37 and 50 per cent of their original values, respectively. TheOSIwas found to pro- vide high sensitivity and specificity values, when healthy and caratactous eyes were considered. The results suggest that optical deficits are compensated until 50 years of age with sensory and perceptual factors, as smaller changes were found for visual function than for objective mea- surements of <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> and intraocular scattering. Conclusions: Measures of <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> assessed by subjective psychophysical and objective techniques varied differently with age. Values obtained for each age group {{can be used to}} de- termine normal limits of <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> and intraocular scattering for diagnosis of ocular conditions.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{longitudinal}} changes in <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> including intraocular scattering in normal eyes and eyes with short tear breakup time (TBUT). Methods: We prospectively examined twenty eyes of 20 healthy subjects, and age-matched twenty eyes of 20 short TBUT subjects. The modulation transfer function (MTF) cutoff frequency, the Strehl ratio, and the objective scattering index (OSI) were quantitatively assessed using an <b>Optical</b> <b>Quality</b> Analysis System. We investigated {{the changes in}} these variables measured consecutively at the initial examination, 5, and 10 seconds without blinking. We also compared these variables in eyes with short TBUT with those in normal eyes. Results: No {{significant differences in the}} MTF cutoff frequency, Strehl ratio, or OSI were detected over a 10 -second period in normal eyes. These variables also became significantly degraded even over a 5 -second period in eyes with short TBUT (p, 0. 01). We found significant differences in these variables at 5 and 10 seconds (p, 0. 05), but none immediately after the blink between normal and short TBUT eyes. Conclusions: <b>Optical</b> <b>quality</b> including intraocular scattering deteriorated significantly with time in eyes with short TBUT, whereas we found significant differences over a 10 -second period in normal eyes. Eyes with short TBUT showed greater deterioration in <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> after the blink than normal eyes. The longitudinal assessment of <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> may be effective in distinguishing eyes with short TBUT from normal eyes...|$|R

50|$|This {{account is}} more a {{reflection}} of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area {{was used in the}} production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its high purity levels.

A growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world. Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria spread throughout the Roman Empire. With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of manganese dioxide), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes.

5000|$|Tuning {{was used}} in Hertz's {{original}} experiments and practical application of tuning {{showed up in the}} early to mid 1890s in wireless systems not specifically designed for radio communication. Nikola Tesla's March 1893 lecture demonstrating the wireless transmission of power for lighting (mainly by what he thought was ground conduction) included elements of tuning. The wireless lighting system consisted of a spark-excited grounded resonant transformer with a wire antenna which transmitted power across the room to another resonant transformer tuned to the frequency of the transmitter, which lighted a Geissler tube. Use of tuning in free space [...] "Hertzian waves" [...] (radio) was explained and demonstrated in Oliver Lodge's 1894 lectures on Hertz's work. At the time Lodge was demonstrating the physics and <b>optical</b> <b>qualities</b> of radio waves instead of attempting to build a communication system but he would go on to develop methods (patented in 1897) of tuning radio (what he called [...] "syntony"), including using variable inductance to tune antennas.|$|E
40|$|Role of {{the tear}} {{film in the}} <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> of the human eye Robert Montés-Micó, OD, MPhil, PhD This paper reviews recent studies {{of the role of}} the tear film in the <b>optical</b> <b>quality</b> of the eye.
