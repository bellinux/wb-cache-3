5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> poets.|$|E
5|$|Another of Gaudí's major {{projects}} and among his most admired works is the Casa Milà, {{better known as}} La Pedrera (1906–1910), commissioned by Pere Milà i Camps. Gaudí designed the house around two large, curved courtyards, with a structure of stone, brick and cast-iron columns and steel beams. The facade is built of limestone from Vilafranca del Penedès, apart from the upper level, which is covered in white tiles, evoking a snowy mountain. It has {{a total of five}} floors, plus a loft made entirely of catenary arches, as well as two large interior courtyards, one circular and one oval. Notable features are the staircases to the roof, topped with the four-armed cross, and the chimneys, covered in ceramics and with shapes that suggest mediaeval helmets. The interior decoration was carried out by Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogués and Aleix Clapés. The facade was to have been completed with a stone, metal and glass sculpture with Our lady of the Rosary accompanied by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, 4m in height. A sketch was made by the sculptor Carles Mani, but due to the events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tragic</b> Week in 1909 the project was abandoned.|$|E

The emphasis is given to <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following: <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> “heroes” (i. e. characters who initially show resistance and a will to change their life, which lead to hopelessness and their ultimate fall/destruction by fate); tragic peripeteia (i. e. <b>the</b> sudden change <b>of</b> fortune, which usually leads to suspense and ruin); tragic irony (i. e. the antithesis between action and result, between appearance and reality and between verbal word and true meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation); <b>tragic</b> anagnorisis (i. e. <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> truth: when ignorance is replaced by knowledge).

25|$|His {{funeral was}} held on 13 August 1913 at St Peter's Church in Tadley in Hampshire.

The casket containing his ashes was buried in a grave beside that of his grandmother, Emma Evans, {{who had died in}} 1911. Leon King, Cody's stepson, was among the mourners, as were Evan's family and friends. The prayers of committal were read by the Rev L.P.

25|$|In 2014, his centenary year, {{a number}} of celebratory concerts and events took place. Highlights {{included}} symphony performances, in February, by the London Symphony Orchestra and Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, two orchestras that had particularly close associations with Panufnik. A special concert on 24 September, his birthday, by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra included performances of the Piano Concerto and Sinfonia Elegiaca. A Panufnik day, on 30 November, at Kings Place in London featured the Brodsky Quartet. In November, the São Paulo Symphony Orchestra gave two performances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tragic</b> Overture with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski conducting.

25|$|The {{story of}} Ethan Frome had {{initially}} begun as a French-language composition that Wharton {{had to write}} while studying the language in Paris, but several years later she took the story up again and transformed it into the novel it now is, basing her sense of New England culture and place on her 10 years of living at The Mount, her home in Lenox, Massachusetts. She would read portions of her novel-in-progress each day to her good friend Walter Berry, who was an international lawyer. Wharton likely based the story of Ethan and Mattie's sledding experience on an accident that she had heard about in 1904 in Lenox, Massachusetts. Five people total {{were involved in the}} real-life accident, four girls and one boy. They crashed into a lamppost while sledding down Courthouse Hill in Lenox. A girl named Hazel Crosby was killed in the accident. Wharton learned of the accident from one of the girls who survived, Kate Spencer, when the two became friends while both worked at the Lenox Library. Kate Spencer suffered from a hip injury in the accident and also had facial injuries. It is among the few works by Wharton with a rural setting. Wharton found the notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> sledding crash to be irresistible as a potential extended metaphor for the wrongdoings of a secret love affair.|$|E
25|$|The choreography for the {{character}} of Nikiya went through a renaissance in when performed by the virtuoso ballerina Dudinskaya, whose revisions to the choreography remain the standard. Although her interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tragic</b> Nikiya was looked on as unsuitable for the stellar ballerina, she nevertheless excelled in The Kingdom of the Shades, where Petipa's strict academic patterns prevailed. In the Variation de Nikiya (often {{referred to as the}} Scarf Duet) Ponomarev and Chabukiani changed the original staging of Petipa - originally, this variation called for Nikiya to perform her variation alone, with a long veil connected by wire to a fly-space above the stage, with the veil flying upward upon the final moments of the variation. The variation was changed so that Solor would now hold one end of the veil as Nikiya danced, departing the stage half-way through her solo offstage. Dudinskaya studded the choreography with multiple tours en arabesque, and included, for the first time, airy splits in her Grand jetés during the Entrée de Nikiya, as well as adding fast piqué turns in the Grand coda. The choreography for Solor went through a renaissance as well with the great Premier danseur Chabukiani in the role. Although the dances for the role of Solor had become far more prominent since La Bayadère had been performed in Imperial Russia, Chabukiani's revisions to the choreography would become the standard for all proceeding male dancers.|$|E
