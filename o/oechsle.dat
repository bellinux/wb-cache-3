25|$|Soon after inoculation, yeast {{begin to}} rapidly consume the {{available}} assimilable nitrogen {{with up to}} 46% of YAN being fully consumed by the onset of full fermentation. Because inorganic nitrogen, such as the ammonium salts in DAP, are toxic to yeast in high levels, it is never added during inoculation when the biomass of the newly re-hydrated yeast is low. Many winemakers split up the dosage of DAP with the first addition being made {{at the end of}} the lag phase when the yeast enter their period of exponential growth and alcoholic fermentation begins. In most must this is around 48 to 72 hours after inoculation. A second dosage is then often added around a third of the way through sugar fermentation and often before the sugar levels hit 12-10 Brix (6.5 to 5.5 Baumé, 48.3 to 40.0 <b>Oechsle)</b> because as the fermentation progresses yeast cells are no longer able to bring the nitrogen into the cell due to the increasing toxicity of ethanol surrounding the cells. This leaves the nitrogen unused and available for spoilage organisms that may come afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{more than}} 90% {{of all the}} {{dissolved}} solids in grape juice are sugars, measuring the must weight is a good indicator {{of the amount of}} sugars in the wine. Rather than measure the actual [...] "weight" [...] of the must, the density or specific gravity of the juice is measured in relation to the specific gravity of distilled water. Viticulturists and winemakers can use a refractometer which uses a refractive index to indirectly measure the must weight from the juice of a single grape or they can use a hydrometer in the winery with the juice from several dozen or hundreds of grape berries. Different countries around the world use various scales to measure the must weight of grape juice. In the United States, New Zealand, and parts of Australia it is measured in degrees brix (symbol °Bx); in Germany (wine) it is degrees <b>Oechsle</b> (°Oe); in France and most of Europe the Baumé scale is used and in Austria the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (°KMW) scale is used.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} mainly {{concerned}} with analytical methods used for ingredients determination of fermentable saccharides in grapes and musts. The process started with studies of literary sources focused on yeast cells metabolism {{and methods of}} ingredients determination of saccharides. The selected analytical methods are further on described with respect to accuracy, speed and demands of instrumental facilities. Finally, the suitable methods for viticulture practical area are presented. The aim of experiment was to compare diverse analytical methods which would be suitable for ingredients determination of fermentable saccharides. The measurments were carried out at The Department of Viniculture and Viticulture at the Faculty of Horticulture in city of Lednice in South Moravia, and powered by the Czecho-slovak normalized must-meter both with a thermometer and without one, the <b>Oechsle's</b> must-meter, digital refractometer and by the titration method according to Rebelein...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Oechsle</b> Scale is a {{hydrometer}} scale {{measuring the}} density of grape must, which {{is an indication of}} grape ripeness and sugar content used in wine-making. It is named for Ferdinand <b>Oechsle</b> (1774-1852) and it is widely used in the German, Swiss and Luxembourgish wine-making industries. On the <b>Oechsle</b> scale, one degree <b>Oechsle</b> (° Oe) corresponds to one gram of the difference between the mass of one litre of must at 20 °C and 1 kg (the mass of 1 litre of water). For example, must with a specific mass of 1084 grams per litre has 84° Oe.|$|E

50|$|He is most {{noted for}} {{developing}} a method for measuring the must weight of the grape must in winemaking. The <b>Oechsle</b> scale, named after him and divided into degrees <b>Oechsle</b> (°Oe), is still used for official classification of German wine, Swiss wine and Luxembourg wine.|$|E
50|$|The mass {{difference}} between equivalent volumes of must and water {{is almost entirely}} due to the dissolved sugar in the must. Since the alcohol in wine is produced by fermentation of the sugar, the <b>Oechsle</b> scale is used to predict the maximal possible alcohol content of the finished wine. This measure is commonly used to select when to harvest grapes. In the vineyard, the must density is usually measured by using a refractometer by crushing a few grapes between the fingers and letting the must drip onto the glass prism of the refractometer. In countries using the <b>Oechsle</b> scale, the refractometer will be calibrated in <b>Oechsle</b> degrees, {{but this is an}} indirect reading, as the refractometer actually measures the refractive index of the grape must, and translates it into <b>Oechsle</b> or different wine must scales, based on their correlation to refractive index.|$|E
