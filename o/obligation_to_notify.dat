In this instance the third party was an insurance company, but the judgment bears relevance for all third parties because it sheds light on how {{the concept of the}} “dominant purpose” of a document will be interpreted in such circumstances. In this instance, the document was a notice of a potential claim under an insurance contract, sent to the insurer, who would then send it on to their legal advisors to obtain an opinion on the merits of the potential claim. The Court of Appeal decided that the document attracted litigation privilege because {{at the time it was}} created, litigation had commenced and the document was created for the dominant purpose of obtaining advice in relation to that litigation. It was held that, when looking at the dominant purpose of a document, it was necessary for the Courts to take a wider view; the entire context of the creation of the document should be considered. In particular, the Court of Appeal held that it was important to look at the motivation of the party requiring the document to be created (which was that it would be used by the insurer for the purpose of obtaining legal advice) and not simply the intention of those composing or preparing the document (which was in order to fulfil its <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the insurer).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in Transhipment Container Terminal (TCT) management is to have fairly reliable and affordable predictions about vessel arrival. Terminal operators need to estimate the actual time of arrival in port {{in order to determine the}} daily demand for each work shift with greater accuracy. In this way, the resources required (human resources, equipment as well as spatial resources) can be allocated more efficiently. Despite contractual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) 24 hours before arrival, ship operators often have to revise it due to unexpected events like weather conditions, delay in a previous port and so on. For planners the decision-making processes related to this topic can sometimes be so complex without the support of suitable methodological tools. Specific models should be adopted, in a daily planning scenario, to provide a useful support tool in TCTs. In this study, we discuss an exploratory analysis of the data affecting delays registered at a Mediterranean TCT. We present some preliminary results obtained using data mining techniques and propose a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model to reduce the range of uncertainty of ship arrivals in port. This approach is compulsory to manage vast amounts of unstructured data involved in estimating of vessel arrivals...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to find out}} what {{experiences}} three preschool teachers, two preschool directors and a social worker (BSc) from the social service have of reporting suspicion of child abuse done by preschools. What perceptions do these individuals have of each other, what experiences do they have regarding cooperation and how do they perceive their responsibilities regarding filing reports on suspicion of child abuse? This investigation is based on qualitative interviews with open ended questions on the basis of an interview guide. The theoretical approach of the essay lies in the phenomenology philosophy, which revolves around the individual’s experiences and perceptions of a phenomenon. Experience and perception are therefore key concepts of the essay. The conclusion of the results is that the preschool teachers and the preschool directors have positive experiences and views of the social service in general, however, there are some differentiations between the individuals’ perceptions. The social worker has a mixed but positive experience of the preschools. The respondents believe that the cooperation between the preschools and the social service can be improved but also on this point the opinions between individuals differs depending on earlier experiences. When it comes to responsibilities, the preschool teachers and directors are aware of their <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report and the social worker is aware of the social service’s <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect and do {{what is best for the}} child. The social service cannot do this on their own; they need the general public and the professional groups with <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> them on any suspicion or worry...|$|R

40|$|A {{container}} terminal {{is a complex}} system where {{a broad range of}} operations are carried out involving a wide array of resources that need to interact over a 24 hour operating cycle. Since the various activities are mutually related to each other, there is a need not only to maximise the efficiency of each one, but also to ensure proper coordination, hence to solve integrated decision-making problems. Several factors can affect the quality of the services provided and the overall efficiency. Vessel arrival uncertainty further complicates the task of the planners and, as a result, of the effectiveness of the planning itself, in particular at the operational level. Each arrival produces high peak loads for other terminal activities, {{as well as for the}} supporting arrival activities (pilotage, towage, etc.) and hinterland transportation (waiting, congestion etc.). Deviating arrivals only worsen this peak load. On a daily level, the actual time of arrival of the vessels often deviates from the scheduled time. Despite contractual <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at least 24 hours before the arrival, ship operators often have to adapt and update the latest ETA due to unexpected circumstances. This aspect results in a last-minute change of plans in terminal operations resulting in higher costs. In fact, the ability to predict the actual time of a vessel’s arrival in a port 24 hours in advance is fundamental for the related planning activities for which the decision-making processes need to be constantly adapted and updated. Moreover, disruptions in container flows and operations caused by vessel arrival uncertainty can have cascade effects within the overall supply chain and network within which the port is part. Although vessel arrival uncertainty in ports is a well-known problem for the scientific community, the literature review highlights that in the maritime sector the specific instruments for dealing with this problem are extremely limited. The absence of a reference model that specifies the relationship between vessel arrival uncertainty and the involved variables resulted in the application of a specific machine learning approach within the Knowledge Discovery in Database process. This V approach, that abandons all prior assumptions about data distribution shape, is based on the self-learning concept according to which the relation between an outcome variable Y and the set of predictors X is directly identified from the historical collected data. The approach has been validated thanks to two different case studies: the {{container terminal}} of Cagliari, located in the Mediterranean basin, and one of the main container terminals of Antwerp, located at the North Sea. Depending on the framework and planning purposes several estimates can provide useful information on vessel arrivals. Sometimes, it can be useful for planners to infer a quantitative estimate of the delay/advance in minutes, sometimes it may be useful to have a qualitative estimate, even only knowing whether or not an incoming vessel is likely to arrive before or after the scheduled ETA. For this reason a two-step instrument is proposed is made up of two different modules. The fitted algorithmic models used to obtain predictions are Logistic Regression, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and Random Forest. All the proposed models are able to learn from experience, following the well-known Data Mining paradigm “learning from data”. From a practical point of view, the probability, associated to the continuous estimation, of specifically identifying the work-shift of the incoming vessel is calculated. In all predictions Random Forest algorithms still show the best performance. This aspect can help planners, in the daily strategy decision making process, in order to improve the use of the human, mechanical and spatial resources required for handling operations. This could maximise terminal efficiency and minimise terminal costs, hence improving terminal competitiveness. Moreover, the interpretation of the discovered knowledge, made it possible to evaluate the most discriminating variables of the analysis, even thanks to graphical visualisation of the Importance-plots. ...|$|R
