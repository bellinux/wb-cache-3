5|$|From Yemen, as from Egypt, the Ayyubids {{aimed to}} {{dominate}} the Red Sea trade routes which Egypt depended <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> sought to tighten their grip over the Hejaz, where an important trade stop, Yanbu, was located. To favor trade {{in the direction of}} the Red Sea, the Ayyubids built facilities along the Red Sea-Indian Ocean trade routes to accompany merchants. The Ayyubids also aspired to back their claims of legitimacy within the Caliphate by having sovereignty over the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The conquests and economic advancements undertaken by Saladin effectively established Egypt's hegemony in the region.|$|E

25|$|Multiple {{denominations}} {{experienced a}} split from 1861 until 1865 {{due to the}} ongoing political climate but also slavery. Often to distinguish these denominations the word Southern was used. Hence, for denomination that remained in the North the word Northern was used. Examples include Southern Presbyterians and Northern Presbyterians, Southern Baptists and Northern Baptists, Southern Episcopalians and Northern Episcopalians, and so <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> forth. Such splits entailed no theological conflicts or doctrine changes, and adjectives Southern/Northern were only used to describe one's base in the Confederacy/the Union, territorial scope, political allegiance/preferences or stance on slavery.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, and so <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for {{me to be able to}} publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> this was a question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E

500|$|In {{the preface}} to The Man-Eating Myth, Arens notes that he was first {{inspired}} to begin a fuller investigation of cannibalism while teaching an introductory course on anthropology at Stony Brook University, New York. One student {{asked him why he}} focused his teaching on such topics as kinship, politics and economics rather than the more [...] "exotic" [...] subjects of witchcraft, fieldwork experiences and cannibalism. Arens concurred that these latter topics would interest his students {{to a greater extent than}} those which he was then lecturing <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> undertook an investigation into the prior accounts of cannibalism in the anthropological record.|$|E
500|$|Hans Singer {{suggested}} that Nurkse's theory makes dubious {{assumptions about the}} underdeveloped economy. For example, Nurkse assumes that the economy starts with nothing at hand. However, an economy usually starts at a position which reflects the previous investment decisions undertaken in the country, and at any given moment, an imbalance already exists. So the logical step would be to take on those investment programmes which compliment the existing imbalance in the economy. Clearly, such an investment cannot be a balanced one. If an economy makes the mistake of setting {{out to make a}} balanced investment, a new imbalance is likely to appear which will require still another [...] "balancing investment" [...] to bring equilibrium, and so <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> forth.|$|E

500|$|Finkelstein is a sharp {{critic of}} the state of Israel. Discussing Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah, Israeli {{historian}} Avi Shlaim stated that Finkelstein's critique of Israel [...] "is based on an amazing amount of research. He seems to have read everything. He has gone through the reports of Israeli groups, of human rights groups, Human Rights Watch and Peace Now and B'Tselem, all of the reports of Amnesty International. And he deploys all this evidence from Israeli and other sources in order to sustain his critique of Israeli practices, Israeli violations of human rights of the Palestinians, Israeli house demolitions, the targeted assassinations of Palestinian militants, the cutting down of trees, the building of the wall—the security barrier on the West Bank, which is illegal—the restrictions imposed on the Palestinians in the West Bank, and so <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> forth. I find his critique extremely detailed, well-documented and accurate." ...|$|E

Chung, {{who worked as a}} level designer for Pandemic Studios, has contributed to the development of titles such as Full Spectrum Warrior and [...] Four incarnations of Gravity Bone were produced during its one-year development. Chung commented during an interview with FidGit that [...] "Gravity Bone started out very different from what it was and ended up getting scrapped ... so <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> forth until this version came out." [...] The first version of Gravity Bone featured more typical first-person shooter elements than the released version, and was based on a series of Quake 2 maps entitled Citizen Abel. He elaborated that the first version of the game had the player running around with a gun, [...] "shoot things and stuff explodes." [...] Development shifted in a new direction, and Gravity Bone was transformed; the player would act as a computer hacker, [...] "hacking stuff all the time." ...|$|E
