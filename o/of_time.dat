The characters frequently travel through time to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> (represented as year ∞), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods.

Whereas formal {{verification}} <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> systems {{has become a}} very active field of research, the idealised mathematical semantics <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> automata cannot be faithfully implemented. Several works have thus focused on a modified semantics <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> automata which ensures implementability, and robust model-checking algorithms for safety, and later LTL properties have been designed. Recently, a new approach has been proposed, which reduces (standard) model-checking <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> au-tomata to other verification problems on channel machines. Thanks to a new encoding of the modified semantics as a network <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> sys-tems, we propose an original combination of both approaches, and prove that robust model-checking for coFlat-MTL, a large fragment of MTL, is EXPSPACE-Complete. ...|$|R
