50|$|In 1965, President Charles de Gaulle chose Île Longue as {{home for}} <b>the</b> sea-based {{component}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Force de frappe.

5|$|The group {{recorded}} several independent EPs {{and played}} primarily in their New Orleans area before becoming noticed by Sparrow Records {{at a concert}} in 1999. The ensuing record deal saw the band's only commercial release, a critically acclaimed album entitled Kaleidoscope Superior, in 2000. Shortly after, the band left Sparrow and drifted out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye.</b> A final album, entitled The Rise of Modern Simulation was independently released before the group disbanded in 2003. Many of the band members continue to play together and collaborate in various bands, namely Mutemath and Club of the Sons.|$|E

Keating knows his most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark's help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete anonymity and Keating's promise {{that it will be}} built exactly as designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not able to prevent major changes from being made in Cortlandt's construction. Roark dynamites the project to prevent the subversion of his vision.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, Action T4 became {{widespread}} public knowledge in Germany (and also in neutral countries and to Germany's enemies), and on August 24, 1941, Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest (however it still continued, not only out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye</b> but in greater intensity). Hitler {{did not want to}} run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and, as a result, the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally. Even if there had been any written instances of this order, they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable.|$|E

2500|$|Collinsville and Jenks, Oklahoma operate no-kill shelters, but {{routinely}} send unwanted {{animals to}} Tulsa for euthanasia. According to Jenks operations superintendent Gary Head, the city [...] "wants {{nothing to do}} with killing dogs....It keeps us low-key and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>eye.</b> We don't have a bad reputation here."

5|$|Soon afterward, Hill {{dropped out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye,</b> {{dissatisfied}} with the music industry and suffering with the pressures of fame. Her last full-length recording, the new-material live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 (2002), sharply divided critics and sold poorly compared to her first album {{and work with the}} Fugees. Hill's subsequent activity, which includes the release of a few songs and occasional festival appearances, has been sporadic. Her behavior has sometimes caused audience dissatisfaction; a reunion with her former group did not last long. Her music, as well as a series of public statements she has issued, has become critical of pop culture and societal institutions. Hill has six children, five of whom are with Rohan Marley. In 2012, she pleaded guilty to tax evasion for failure to pay federal income taxes, and in 2013, served a three-month prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks before}} the primary, Combs was {{endorsed}} by former Vice-President and native Kentuckian Alben W. Barkley, but Combs felt the endorsement came too late to be much help. Chandler defeated Combs in the primary {{by a vote of}} 259,875 to 241,754 and went on to win his second term as governor. Combs returned to Prestonsburg, set up a savings and loan company, and re-established his law practice. During the four years of Chandler's term, Combs accepted a number of speaking engagements, but otherwise remained out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye.</b> Meanwhile, the state's need for funds compelled Chandler to raise the state sales tax and other taxes, despite his campaign promises not to do so. Consequently, Chandler lost credibility and Combs gained a reputation as a courageous, forthright, and honest politician for having acknowledged the state's financial need during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Stamper brothers—Tim and Chris Stamper—founded the British {{video game}} {{companies}} Ultimate Play the Game and Rare. They first {{worked together on}} arcade conversion kits, which were licensed to companies, but later became developers for the ZX Spectrum home computer in the early 1980s. Chris programmed the games, while Tim designed the graphics. They found success as Ultimate with games including Jetpac and Knight Lore. The brothers founded Rare in the mid-1980s after reverse engineering the Nintendo Entertainment System to shift their focus to console development. They became Nintendo's first major Western developer, for whom they developed licensed games and ports. Over the next two decades, Rare enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} Nintendo and developed multiple major titles for the company, including Donkey Kong Country and GoldenEye 007. Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002, and the brothers left the company in 2006. After spending several years out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye,</b> the brothers are currently planning new ventures.|$|E
50|$|Not much {{is known}} about Ron's {{personal}} life, as she was noted to keep as much of her private life out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>eye.</b> Her younger sister Pan Rom, said her sister survived up until the Vietnamese invasions when the Khmer Rouge launched their final series of mass executions. In a 2015 BBC documentary on the band Cambodian Space Project, which has covered many of Ron's songs, it was alleged by an interview subject that Ron was tricked by the Khmer Rouge into performing one of her songs, after which she was led away and executed.|$|R

25|$|It can {{be argued}} that the {{presence}} of Robert Kardashian on Simpson's legal team, combined with the press coverage of the trial, would ultimately be the catalyst for the ongoing popularity of the Kardashian family.

25|$|The {{creation}} of Austria-Hungary and the Banat's absorption into the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen were significant blows for Mocioni's nationalist-loyalist campaign.

50|$|Veblen defines leisure as the non {{productive}} consumption <b>of</b> time. <b>The</b> wealthy consume time unproductively {{due to a}} disgust of menial labor but also as evidence of their pecuniary ability to live idle lives. But {{there are moments when}} even the noble is not viewed publicly and then he must give a satisfactory account of his use of time. Often his account will manifest through <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> servants or some sort of craftsmen. A material proof of leisure is another way that the noble demonstrates his wealth even when he is out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public's</b> <b>eye.</b> Objects or trophies or knowledge that has no real-world application are all examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things that the wealthy use to demonstrate their wealth and their leisure. Displaying rules of etiquette and breeding, and formal and ceremonial observances are other demonstrations of unproductive (and therefore leisurely) uses of time.|$|R

An engineering report in March, 1988, gave information that the tailings dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
