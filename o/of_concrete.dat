5|$|Due to {{the steep}} slope {{on which the}} {{building}} is situated, {{it had to be}} specially designed out <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E

40|$|A large {{dielectric}} measurement cell, with 54 ml sample volume, {{was designed}} and calibrated to operate over a 1 MHz- 3 GHz frequency range. The cell {{was used to measure}} the dielectric constants and conductivities <b>of</b> <b>concretes</b> over a broad frequency range and different curing times. The water/cement/sand ratios <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> were changed to study the dependence of the electromagnetic properties on them. Chemical admixtures to retard and accelerate the curing process <b>of</b> <b>concretes</b> were also added. It was found that the electromagnetic properties <b>of</b> <b>concretes</b> vary significantly over the frequencies. Furthermore, during the curing process, the water/cement/sand ratios and chemical admixtures <b>of</b> <b>concretes</b> affected their electromagnetic properties.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were carried out recently, where two types of waste materials, {{including}} steel slag (by-product of the steel-making process) and crushed waste glass, were adopted as the coarse or fine aggregates <b>of</b> the <b>concretes.</b> To compare with the new concretes using waste materials, two batches <b>of</b> <b>concretes</b> using normal limestone and lightweight aggregates were also prepared and tested. The material properties <b>of</b> <b>concretes,</b> such as the slump value, density, modulus of elasticity, compressive strength and flexural strength were measured {{and the results are}} reported and discussed in this paper.

5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated by the use <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> and brick. By varying {{the weight of the}} aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E
