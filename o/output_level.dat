The BoomSound stereo system {{is controlled by}} two five-volt NXP TFA9887 integrated circuits combining NXP’s CoolFlux audio DSP, a class-D amplifier with current sensing, and a DC-to-DC converter to boost the <b>output</b> <b>level</b> of micro-speakers up to five times (up to 2.6W RMS) without damaging the driver.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofer <b>output</b> <b>level</b> can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E

Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be compression drivers (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the {{throat of a horn}} for added <b>output</b> <b>level</b> and control of radiation pattern.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{hydroelectricity}} {{is relatively}} low, {{making it a}} competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.

The actual input and <b>output</b> <b>levels</b> for each period depart from the planned levels according to a probability distribution determined empirically.

25|$|The cost of {{hydroelectricity}} {{is relatively}} low, {{making it a}} competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower <b>output</b> <b>level</b> of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered energy plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} of headphones is {{of concern}} because of the output limitations of amplifiers. A modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier, with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load. Amplifiers are not ideal; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide. In order to ensure an even frequency response, adequate damping factor, and undistorted sound, an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving (and ideally, as low as possible). If output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones, significantly higher distortion will be present. Therefore, lower impedance headphones will tend to be louder and more efficient, but will also demand a more capable amplifier. Higher impedance headphones will be more tolerant of amplifier limitations, but will produce less volume for a given <b>output</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} function {{is essentially a}} measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product. The product itself depends on the purpose of the model, {{but one of the most}} common examples is the study of total biomass. A notable example of the success of FBA is the ability to accurately predict the growth rate of the prokaryote E. coli when cultured in different conditions. In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass {{objective function}}. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the <b>output</b> <b>level</b> of some biotechnologically relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a chemostat or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are held constant. Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.|$|E

25|$|The {{exponential}} horn has an acoustic loading property {{that allows the}} speaker driver to remain evenly balanced in <b>output</b> <b>level</b> over its frequency range. The benefits of the design were first published by C.R. Hanna and J. Slepian in 1924 for the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). A major drawback is that the {{exponential horn}} allows for a narrowing of the radiation pattern as frequency increases, making for high frequency 'beaming' on axis and dull sound off axis. Another concern is that a throat of small diameter is needed for high efficiency at high frequencies but a larger throat is best for low frequencies. A common solution is to use two or more horns, each with the appropriate throat size, mouth size and flare rate for best performance in a selected frequency range, with sufficient overlap between the frequency ranges to provide a smooth transition between horns. Another solution tried in the late 1930s by Harry F. Olson of RCA was to use multiple exponential flare rates, either by connecting increasingly larger horns in series or by subdividing {{the interior of a}} single horn. Exponential horns continue to be used by some designers, and in some applications.|$|E
