In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government. In the NWT, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ.

5|$|English and French are the {{official}} languages {{of the legislature}} and courts of Manitoba, according to §23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 (part of the Constitution of Canada). In April 1890, the Manitoba legislature attempted to abolish the <b>official</b> <b>status</b> of French, and ceased to publish bilingual legislation. However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that §23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).|$|E
5|$|From 1992 onward, many {{bodies were}} {{discovered}} orbiting {{in the same}} volume as Pluto, showing that Pluto {{is part of a}} population of objects called the Kuiper belt.

Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System. The Hayden Planetarium reopened—in February 2000, after renovation—with a model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{languages}} {{existed in the}} multi-ethnic Empire, {{and some of these}} were given limited <b>official</b> <b>status</b> in their provinces at various times.

Similarly Coptic, Armenian, and Georgian became significant among the educated in their provinces, and later foreign contacts made Old Church Slavic, Middle Persian, and Arabic important in the Empire and its sphere of influence.|$|E
