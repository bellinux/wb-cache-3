25|$|Crocodiles {{have the}} most acidic stomach of any vertebrate. They can easily digest bones, hooves and horns. The BBC TV {{reported}} that a Nile crocodile that has lurked a long time underwater to catch prey builds up a large <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt.</b> When it has caught and eaten that prey, it closes its right aortic arch and uses its left aortic arch to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from its muscles directly to its stomach; the resulting excess acidity in its blood supply makes it much easier for the stomach lining to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulks of swallowed prey flesh and bone. Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach stones), which may act as ballast to balance their bodies or assist in crushing food, similar to grit ingested by birds. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles had a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the Egyptian plover, which enter the crocodile's mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile's blood; with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species, it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction.|$|E

50|$|The octopus’ {{heart rate}} {{does not change}} {{significantly}} with exercise, though temporary cardiac arrest of the systemic heart can be induced by <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt,</b> almost any sudden stimulus, or mantle pressure during jet propulsion. Its only compensation for exertion is through an increase in stroke volume of up to three times by the systemic heart, which means it suffers an <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt</b> with almost any rapid movement. The octopus is, however, able to control how much oxygen it pulls {{out of the water}} with each breath using receptors on its gills, allowing it to keep its oxygen uptake constant over a range of oxygen pressures in the surrounding water.|$|E
40|$|Maintaining an {{adequate}} tissue oxygen delivery (DO(2)) and consumption (VO(2)) {{is crucial in}} the treatment of septic patients. A fall in V 0 (2) is associated with a higher mortality. The early recognition of shock or tissue hypo perfusion impacts on patient prognosis. In occasions, hypovolemia or important regional <b>oxygen</b> <b>debts</b> are not recognized, since macro homodynamic variables have been compensated. In this situation, the use of metabolic hypo perfusion markers such as lactate, central venous oxygen saturation and gastric goniometry, can be helpful. However, interpretation of these markers should be cautious and always considering the overall clinical status of the patient. In the initial stages of sepsis, the dependency of V 0 (2) on DO(2) predominates as histopathological mechanism of multiple organic failure. In late stages, other factors predominate as determinants of multiple organic failure and mortality, such as hyper or hypo immune response, microcirculatory alterations and cytopathic hypoxia...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen uptake during {{myocardial}} hyperemia (MRH) following occlusions of 2. 5 - 30 s was {{studied in}} nine anesthetized open-chest dogs by continuous measurement of left anterior coronary blood flow and anterior coronary vein oxygen saturation with electromagnetic flowmeter and fiber-optic catheters, respectively. The ratio of excess <b>oxygen</b> uptake to <b>debt</b> multiplied by 100 % {{was defined as}} the oxygen repayment ratio (RR) and varied between - 50 % and + 150 % (mean 78 %). Application of a steady-state Fick formula, as used by previous investigators, results in a profound overestimate of the RR (70 - 400 %, mean 295 %). RR is severely distorted by the venous catheter system, and after consideration of these effects we would conclude that the "true" RR in MRH is even lower than we found. Comparing our results with steady-state exercise autoregulation leads us to the following conclusions: 1) chemical kinetic limitations in oxygen release by red blood cells are excluded, 2) a simple direct PO 2 regulation of flow is unlikely, but 3) our results are not inconsistent with a more complex integral oxygen regulation or with the metabolic hypothesi...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic energy-yielding {{processes}} in human tissues, as estimated from 02 -debt, have been {{thought to be}} important in the exertions of athletics (1, 2) or of hard work (3). Recent studies (4) have suggested that the anaerobic metabolism induced by hypoxia plays a part in almost all activity, whether severe or mild, although mild activity may be associated with 02 -debts too small to measure. Rather than an emergency mechanism, anaerobic metabolism may therefore {{be a part of the}} ordinary daily life of mammals. This anaerobic mechanism of energy supply is called forth by inadequacy of oxygen supply relative to tissue requirements, and the ability of the oxygen transport mechanisms to meet tissue demands may become the critical factor at specific levels of relative hypoxia (5). Therefore it seemed possible that in patients with diseases of the oxygen transport system (lungs, blood and circulation) tissue anaerobic metabolism might be even more important, and perhaps a significant determinant of physical disability. The older concept of 02 -debt (6) is a static one largely because of the manner of its measurement, but it has contributed a great deal to the understanding of oxygen supply which could not be learned from blood flow and <b>oxygen</b> concentrations alone. <b>Debt</b> development has been found to be the same in patients with hear...|$|R

50|$|Although exercising {{at lower}} intensities will improve aerobic conditioning, the most rapid gains are made when exercising {{close to an}} individual's {{anaerobic}} threshold. This is the intensity at which the heart and lungs can no longer provide adequate oxygen to the working muscles and an <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt</b> begins to accrue; {{at this point the}} exercise becomes anaerobic.

50|$|Armadillos {{are fully}} capable of climbing, swimming, and jumping. Dasypus {{have a unique}} ability to build up an <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt</b> and hold their breath {{for up to six}} minutes.

50|$|The Henderson-Hasselbalch {{equation}} {{is useful for}} calculating blood pH, because blood is a buffer solution. In the clinical setting, this {{equation is}} usually used to calculate HCO3 from measurements of pH and PaCO2 in arterial blood gases. The amount of metabolic acid accumulating can also be quantitated by using buffer base deviation, a derivative estimate of the metabolic {{as opposed to the}} respiratory component.

50|$|Originally {{referred}} to as <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt,</b> this post exercise aerobic effect was first hypothesized by A.V. Hill and H. Lupton in 1922. They theorized that the body needs to replace the oxygen used by working muscles during mild to intense bouts of exercise. More recently, researchers have used the term 'excess post-exercise oxygen consumption' to describe the different events that occur as the body restores itself to homeostasis, or rest. The body’s metabolic rate will be raised {{for a longer period}} post- exercise from high intensity bouts of exercise. Depending on the level of stress and intensity of exercise, metabolic increase can be seen for up to 18-24 hours.|$|E
50|$|The {{level of}} {{physical}} activity in a person determines what physiological changes the heart makes. The two types of exercise are static (strength-training) and dynamic (endurance-training). Static exercise consists of weight lifting and is mostly anaerobic, meaning the body does not rely on oxygen for performance. It also moderately increases heart rate and stroke volume (<b>oxygen</b> <b>debt).</b> Dynamic exercises include running, swimming, skiing, rowing, and cycling, which rely on oxygen from the body. This type of exercise also increases both heart rate and stroke volume of the heart. Both static and dynamic exercises involve the thickening of the left ventricular wall due to increased cardiac output, which leads to physiologic hypertrophy of the heart. Once athletes stop training, the heart returns to its normal size.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of blood lactate level (La) on oxygen uptake (·VO 2) {{kinetics}} during recovery after short-term exercise with maximal effort (sprint). Three sprints were performed on a cycle ergometer with a load of 8 % of body weight at maximal rotation rate. ·VO 2 kinetics and <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt</b> were determined after three sprint tests: one 10 -s cycling sprint, five repeated 10 -s cycling sprints with 6 -min intervals and one 30 -s cycling sprint. There was no significant difference between peak power outputs in the 10 -s sprint and five sprints. There was no difference in ·VO 2 kinetics during recovery from one sprint and during recovery after five sprints. La peaked at 5 min. The peak value of La was significantly lower in one sprint (4. 41 ± 0. 9 mM) than in five sprints (7. 01 ± 2. 2 mM). Thus, despite a difference in La, there was no difference between ·VO 2 kinetics during recovery after one sprint and after five sprints. There was a significant difference in ·VO 2 between the five sprints and 30 -s sprint from 70 s to 320 s during recovery, but there were no significant differences in La after 5 min of recovery. There were two phases in ·VO 2. They consisted of fast <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt</b> and slow <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt.</b> There were also no differences in slow and fast oxygen debts between the two 10 -s sprints despite significant differences in blood lactate during recovery. Peak La in the five sprints was not significantly different from that in the 30 -s sprint (8. 68 ± 1. 2 mM). However, slow <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt</b> was significantly greater in the 30 -s sprint than in the five sprints.

40|$|Some Atlantic cod in the Bornholm Basin {{undertake}} vertical foraging migrations into severely hypoxic bottom water. Hypoxic {{conditions can}} reduce the postprandial increase in gastrointestinal blood flow (GBF). This could subsequently postpone or reduce the postprandial increase in oxygen consumption (MO 2), i. e. the SDA, leading to a disturbed digestion. Additionally, a restricted oxygen uptake could result in an <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt</b> {{that needs to be}} compensated for upon return to normoxic waters and this may also affect the ability to process the food. Long-term cardio-respiratory measurements were made on fed G. morhua in order to understand how the cardio-respiratory system of feeding fish respond to a period of hypoxia and a subsequent return to normoxia. These were exposed to 35 % water oxygen saturation for 90 minutes, equivalent to the time and oxygen level cod voluntarily endure when searching for food in the Bornholm Basin. We found that i) gastric and intestinal blood flows, cardiac output and MO 2 increased after feeding, ii) gastric and intestinal blood flows were spared in hypoxia, and iii) there were no indications of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>debt</b> {{at the end of the}} hypoxic period.
