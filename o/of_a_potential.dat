5|$|Before 1856 {{there was}} minimal {{discussion}} of statehood within Minnesota.

5|$|Adding to {{the chaos}} were fears <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> second explosion. A cloud of steam {{shot out of}} {{ventilators}} at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. While the fire was quickly put out, the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. However, many rescuers ignored the evacuation and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{second cousin}} George of Hanover (her {{eventual}} successor) visited London {{for three months}} from December 1680, sparking rumours <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> marriage between them. Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle {{as part of a}} scheme to unite the Hanoverian inheritance. Other rumours claimed she was courted by Lord Mulgrave (later made Duke of Buckingham), although he denied it. Nevertheless, {{as a result of the}} gossip, he was temporarily dismissed from court.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by the discovery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> toxic waste site {{in the path of}} the subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 520, Vitalian was {{appointed}} ordinary consul for the year, sharing {{the office with}} Rusticius. Nevertheless, the former rebel continued to pose a potential challenge to Justin, and more importantly to his nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527â€“565). Thus, in July {{of the same year}} he was murdered inside the Great Palace along with his secretary Paulus and his domesticus (aide) Celerianus. According to John of Nikiou, he was killed because he was plotting against Justin; most chroniclers, however, put the responsibility for the crime on Justinian's desire to rid himself <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> rival for his uncle's succession.|$|E
5|$|Following Japanese {{victories}} in Malaya, Singapore {{and elsewhere in}} the Pacific in late 1941 and early 1942, the whole 15th Battalion was mobilised for wartime service and tasked with undertaking defensive duties along the coast of south-east Queensland, based at Caloundra, due to concerns <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> invasion. The invasion did not occur and, in mid-1942, the 15th Battalion was transferred to the 29th Brigade. Consisting of the 42nd and 47th Battalions, the 29th was part of the 5th Division, and was moved north to Townsville, where the battalion served as a garrison force.|$|E

5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Indian {{government}} {{approved of}} plans {{to acquire the}} Sea Harrier for the Indian Navy; prior to this, rumours reportedly were circulating <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> Indian purchase of the Soviet V/STOL-capable Yak-36. The BAE Sea Hawk was phased out from the Indian Navy in 1978, {{in preparation for the}} purchase of Sea Harriers. In November 1979, India placed its first order for six Sea Harrier FRS Mk 51 fighters and two T Mk 60 Trainers; the first three Sea Harriers arrived at Dabolim Airport on 16 December 1983, and were inducted the same year. Ten more Sea Harriers were purchased in November 1985; eventually a total of 30 Harriers were procured, 25 for operational use and the remainder as dual-seat trainer aircraft. Until the 1990s, significant portions of pilot training was carried out in Britain due to limited aircraft availability.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Parliament ordered the slighting of castles across the country, deliberately destroying or damaging the structures to prevent them being used in any subsequent Royalist uprisings. North Wales proved to be a special case, as there were concerns that Charles II might lead a Presbyterian uprising in Scotland and mount a sea-borne attack on the region. Conwy, Caernarfon and Beaumaris were initially garrisoned by Parliament to defend against such an attack. Conwy was later partially slighted in 1655, but Caernarfon and Beaumaris escaped entirely. Harlech, less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> Scottish target, was rendered unusable by Parliament, but was not totally demolished.|$|E

5|$|Marshal Murat {{convened a}} {{military}} tribunal, chaired by General Emmanuel Grouchy, that morning to summarily try and sentence anyone found in possession <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> weapon. Many Spaniards lost their lives, and artist Francisco Goya, {{who witnessed the}} aftermath of the executions, painted his famous painting The Third of May 1808 to commemorate this event. The fighting and executions claimed at least 154 French and 409 Spanish lives and inspired resistance to the French across the country, signalling the start of the Spanish War of Independence. After Doaiz's death his wife entered a convent in Seville.|$|E

He played in forty games, starting one, for the Heat during the 2008â€“09 season, averaging 4.2 points, 1.6 rebounds and 15.8 minutes per game. Jones missed 36 games due to right wrist injures and was a DNP-CD six games. He started all seven of the team's playoff games that season. He completed two four-point plays in a span of eleven seconds in a playoff loss to the Atlanta Hawks on April 29, 2009.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> safety problem.

On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
