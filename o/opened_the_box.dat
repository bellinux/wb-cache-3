5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} one that appeared in c.1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the Holy Land. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a witch, from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood; this box, she told him, held several other smaller boxes, which fitted inside one another. She told him that the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. The fairy warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} the three ciphertexts {{originates}} from an 1885 pamphlet detailing treasure being buried {{by a man named}} Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in the 1820s. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared, never to be seen again. According to the story, the innkeeper <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> 23 years later, and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died. The friend then spent the next twenty years of his life trying to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one of them which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.|$|E

500|$|In late 1927 {{or early}} 1928, there {{arrived at the}} Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, {{according}} to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment. [...] The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, {{as it had been}} shipped with other equipment by mistake. [...] His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology. [...] And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter. [...] They carefully <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine. [...] They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box.|$|E
500|$|Hephaestus– The former Smith God {{and husband}} of Aphrodite {{who had fallen}} from the grace of Olympus. The creator of [...] Pandora and Pandora's Box, Hephaestus {{concealed}} the truth about his artificial [...] "daughter" [...] from Zeus, advising that the Box should be stored in an impregnable temple {{on the back of}} Cronos instead of in the Flame of Olympus. When Kratos eventually penetrated the temple and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>Box,</b> it released previously trapped evils into the world. Infected by fear, Zeus beat and deformed Hephaestus as punishment for his deception before trapping him in his forge in the Underworld. Kratos encountered Hephaestus in his quest to find the Flame of Olympus and eventually found Pandora, the key to quenching the flame and opening Pandora's Box. Hephaestus betrayed Kratos by sending him into what he had hoped to be a fatal confrontation with the Titan Cronos for the Omphalos Stone, but a triumphant Kratos returned with the stone, angered at Hephaestus. The surprised god then crafted the stone into a weapon for Kratos before attempting to kill the Spartan himself, but was killed by Kratos, who took the newly forged weapon, the Nemesis Whip. The character was voiced by Rip Torn (who voiced Zeus in the 1997 animated Disney film Hercules) in God of War III.|$|E
2500|$|Beale {{placed the}} ciphertexts {{and some other}} papers in an iron box, which he gave in 1822 to a {{reliable}} person, the Lynchburg innkeeper Robert Morriss. The treasure {{was supposed to be}} buried near Montvale in Bedford County, Virginia. Beale asked Morriss not to open the box unless Beale or one of his men failed to return from their journey within 10 years. Sending a letter from St. Louis a few months later, Beale promised Morriss that a friend in St. Louis would mail the key to the cryptograms, but it never arrived. Twenty-three years later, in 1845, Morriss <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> finding two plaintext letters from Beale, and several pages of ciphertext separated into Papers [...] "1", [...] "2", and [...] "3". Morriss had no luck in solving the ciphers, and decades later left the box and its contents to an unnamed friend.|$|E

2500|$|Almeida's {{long career}} became legendary. One {{story that was}} retold was {{that while he was}} on the island of Curacao, Almeida {{fell in love with a}} married woman. After a {{campaign}} and returning to the island, the woman's husband died on the same day, and Almeida married her and took her onto his boat, but she died of bullet wound in the first attack. Almeida had her body embalmed and buried [...] "his treasure" [...] on a desolate island near Puerto Rico, visiting each month. After Almeida's death, his second in command and some of the crew marched in search of treasure, which supposedly included jewels and gold. After unearthing the first copper box enclosing the coffin, they fought amongst themselves for the loot until the sole survivor <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>box</b> and fled in terror from the embalmed corpse, falling from a cliff. Other crew members then discovered the scene and transported the woman's body to St. Thomas for burial.|$|E
2500|$|In a March 2012 {{interview}} with CBS News' [...] "60 Minutes", retired USAF General Michael Hayden – {{who served as}} director of both the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency – while denying knowledge of who created Stuxnet said that he believed it had been [...] "a good idea" [...] but that it carried a downside in that it had legitimized the use of sophisticated cyber weapons designed to cause physical damage. Hayden said, [...] "There are those out there who can {{take a look at}} this... and maybe even attempt to turn it to their own purposes". In the same report, Sean McGurk, a former cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security noted that the Stuxnet source code could now be downloaded online and modified to be directed at new target systems. Speaking of the Stuxnet creators, he said, [...] "They <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> They demonstrated the capability... It's not something that can be put back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And {{it came to}} pass, that, when Abram {{came into}} Egypt," [...] in [...] a Midrash asked why the text at that point {{mentioned}} Abraham but not Sarai. The Midrash taught that Abram had put Sarai in a box and locked her in. The Midrash told that when Abram came to the Egyptian customs house, the customs officer demanded that Abram pay the custom duty on the box and its contents, and Abram agreed to pay. The customs officer proposed that Abram must have been carrying garments in the box, and Abram agreed to pay the duty for garments. The customs officer then proposed that Abram must have been carrying silks in the box, and Abram agreed to pay the duty for silks. The customs officer then proposed that Abram must have been carrying precious stones in the box, and Abram agreed to pay the duty for precious stones. But then the customs officer insisted that Abram open the box so that the customs officers could see what it contained. As soon as Abram <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> Sarai's beauty illuminated the land of Egypt.|$|E
