5|$|Further {{works in}} the 1990s saw a second {{carriageway}} constructed from Mundaring to Sawyers Valley, and then extended to The Lakes {{at the edge of}} Perth. A dual carriageway was also constructed in Kalgoorlie, and a long <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> was built near Clackline.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> is {{the lane}} furthest from the {{shoulder}} of a multi-lane carriageway/roadway (sometimes called the fast lane, although this is deprecated by the authorities).|$|E
50|$|Maureen's memorable moments include {{moving into}} the <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> of a dual {{carriageway}} {{in the path of}} an overtaking car, and accidentally running over husband Dave's foot.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{most of the}} <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes,</b> {{provided}} on steep stretches just south of Bristol, have been blocked out with chevrons.|$|R
50|$|From Lidsdale State Forest as {{far west}} as Glanmire {{most of the}} highway is three lanes, with almost {{continuous}} <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> alternating between eastbound and westbound.|$|R

50|$|In Australia, most {{intercity}} highways {{are constructed}} {{with only one}} lane in each direction. Head-on collisions are a risk, particularly with fatigued drivers. Overtaking lanes are an additional lane in one direction for a short distance (one or two kilometres) to assist faster traffic to safely overtake slower traffic. Road markings are often painted so that the additional lane appears in {{the centre of the}} road (guiding traffic to the left), and traffic needs to deliberately change lanes to overtake. At the end, the markings are the other way, so that the left lane must yield and merge into the <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane.</b> Large signs alert drivers that they are approaching an <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane,</b> often at 5km and 1km distances before the lane starts.|$|E
50|$|To {{reinforce}} his point, Boaks {{would sometimes}} deliberately hold up traffic at crossings. He later took to pushing a trolley or pram full of bricks {{back and forth}} repeatedly, at Zebra crossings. Occasionally he would sit in a deckchair in the <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> of the Westway (A40) in North Kensington, reading The Daily Telegraph.|$|E
5000|$|This new {{proposal}} did {{not include}} the replacement of the Bridgewater Bridge or <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> for the new bypass. Mayor Bisdee said that the proposed 2 lane bypass was inadequate for the needs of the area, and stated that with increasing truck movements in the area, that <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> were needed or the Swedish One Plus Two model. State Transport Minister Jim Cox confirmed that specific details such as lanes, safety barriers and other safety features had yet to be finalised. [...] Mr Cox stressed the road on the bridge is sound but did say $1.5 million was needed to fix the liftspan.|$|R
50|$|The {{highway is}} sealed dual {{carriageway}} from Bunbury to Capel {{and in the}} town of Busselton; and is single carriageway from Capel to Busselton and from Vasse to Augusta with regular <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Work costing a {{total of}} £8.5 million was {{undertaken}} at Moy, Carrbridge and Bankfoot. Northbound <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> were created and the carriageway was reconstructed at both Moy and Carrbridge. Junction improvements were also made at Moy.|$|R
50|$|A {{passing lane}} (North American English) or <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> (British, Irish and Australian English) is the lane on a multi-lane highway or {{motorway}} {{closest to the}} center of the road (the central reservation). In some countries, lanes are described as being on the 'inside' or the 'outside' of a road - which one the passing lane is varies.|$|E
50|$|On a dual {{carriageway}}/divided carriageway highway/motorway or arterial road, any lane {{can be an}} <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> {{though in}} many places (including Germany) undertaking (overtaking on the side furthest from the road centre line) is prohibited. Lanes are normally separated by broken lines (usually white) but may be a single solid white to indicate lane-changing is allowed but discouraged. Double lines indicate that lane-changing (for example to overtake) is prohibited, such as in tunnels or sometimes for HOV lanes and HOT lanes.|$|E
50|$|The 1.3 mile {{stretch of}} dual {{carriageway}} and associated one-mile westbound <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> one-mile west of Dumfries opened in 1999, which replaced the previous bottleneck road which snaked up a wooded glen and afforded no overtaking opportunity {{by way of}} solid double white lines for its duration, locally known as The Glen. The new section claimed the title after the previous road was declassified and closed at the western end, allowing only local access to residential property and agricultural land.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{a railway}} line {{underpass}} was constructed near Symmons Plains, south of Perth, {{to create a}} grade separated rail crossing on the highway itself. Significant numbers of <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> have also been extended or created.|$|R
50|$|Work costing a {{total of}} £8.5 million was {{undertaken}} at Moy, Carrbridge and Bankfoot. Northbound <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> were created and the carriageway was reconstructed at both Moy and Carrbridge. Junction improvements were also made at Moy.|$|R
50|$|The Sunraysia Highway, B220, is a two-lane, two-way {{road with}} mainly {{unsealed}} but still providing shoulders {{and has no}} <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> provided along the highway, as it is designated as a ‘B’ road for its full length.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{the federal}} {{government}} approved a $43.9 million project to upgrade substandard sections of Great Eastern Highway between Northam and Southern Cross. That portion of the highway {{was one of the}} oldest sections of the National Highway within Western Australia. The road was susceptible to failure due to poor drainage and frequent flooding.Further works in the 1990s saw a second carriageway constructed from Mundaring to Sawyers Valley, and then extended to The Lakes at the edge of Perth. A dual carriageway was also constructed in Kalgoorlie, and a long <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> was built near Clackline.|$|E
5000|$|Main roads (Magistralni putevi) - roads {{connecting}} bigger {{cities or}} economic regions of Montenegro. Most {{of the main}} roads of Montenegro are listed with International E-road network, and are locally labeled with M letter followed by a number. Typically, these are paved roads of single carriageway type, featuring one lane per direction, with frequent addition of a third <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> on sections with steep gradients. Curve radii usually allow speeds of up to 80 km/h, and width of a single traffic lane is usually at least 3m. Main roads listed with International E-road network in Montenegro are: ...|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1990s, a new {{section of}} road was {{constructed}} between Ballinhassig and Halfway. The old {{section of the}} N71 which the new section replaced, was redesignated as {{the part of the}} R613. The new road constructed by-passed Halfway, with Halfway remaining the only town or village on the route which has been bypassed. Other features of this improvement scheme replaced old sections of the road between Cork City and Ballinhassig, with the old sections now forming parts of the local road network. This new section features an <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> for both sides of the road. A flyover was also constructed for the N71 - R613 junction.|$|E
50|$|A {{minimum speed}} limit of 70 km/h is in force. On <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes,</b> however, {{this could be}} as high as 100 km/h to 110 km/h. Penalties for driving both below and in excess of the {{prescribed}} speed limits are enforced.|$|R
50|$|Other {{projects}} in South Australia include: {{a number of}} <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> have also been added {{in recent years to}} help make it safer with the high volume of traffic. Major 'S'-bend curves near Waikerie were realigned, and further upgrades to the road were performed up to 2012.|$|R
50|$|The road then {{proceeds}} as {{a single}} carriageway with regular <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> to Augusta through small dairy and crop farms, orchards and wineries - the only slow point on this entire journey is when it becomes {{the main street of}} the popular tourist and seachange town of Margaret River.|$|R
5000|$|In 1927 {{plans were}} drawn {{up for a}} [...] "Ridge Route Alternate", named as it was planned as an {{addition}} to the existing Ridge Route {{and not as a}} replacement. It opened in 1933 as a three-lane highway through the mountains. The middle or [...] "suicide lane" [...] was used as an <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> for cars in both directions. This route was a great improvement, faster and 9.7 mi shorter than the old Ridge Route, but was not enough to satisfy demand, and a conversion to a four-lane expressway was needed. The outbreak of World War II delayed this until 1948 and the fourth lane was completed in 1952. However, just three years later, plans were begun for converting the four-lane expressway to a six-lane freeway.|$|E
5000|$|Signs {{indicate}} exits, toll gates, service/refreshment areas, intersections, {{and also}} warn about keeping a fair distance apart. [...] "Distance checks" [...] are commonplace; {{the idea here}} {{is to keep the}} two-second rule (or, as Chinese law requires, at least a 100 m distance between cars). Speed checks and speed traps are often signposted (in fact, on the Jingshen Expressway in the Beijing section, even the cameras have a warning sign above them), but some may just be scarecrow signs. Signs urging drivers to slow down, warning about hilly terrain, banning driving in emergency lanes, or about different road surfaces are also present. Also appearing from time to time are signs signaling the <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> (which legally should only be used to pass other cars). Although most English signs are comprehensible, occasionally the English is garbled.|$|E
50|$|In the Republic of Ireland, many {{national}} primary roads were upgraded in the 1990s and 2000s to wide two lane road (two lane road with space for three lanes, {{in addition to}} hard shoulders) to allow more space for overtaking (a very common manoeuvre {{in a country that}} had little dual carriageway until the early 2000s). However, due to the deceptive perception of safety given by such roads, future upgrade projects are likely to be 2+1 road where traffic volume suits (a successful pilot installation was used on the N20 near Mallow, County Cork). This form of road is of similar profile to wide two lane, but includes a central crash barrier, and has three lanes, with an <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> on one side or the other, alternating every 2 km. It has been used in Denmark and Sweden since the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The Western Highway {{begins at}} the Victorian-South Australian border, east of Bordertown. It is mainly a high quality single {{carriageway}} from there to just outside the Melbourne side of Beaufort, with adequate numbers of <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes.</b> However, the highway passes through several agricultural centres, for example Horsham, Victoria, slowing down traffic significantly.|$|R
50|$|The Welsh Government has {{constructed}} a bypass to reduce traffic congestion on the A473 road at Tonteg, Church Village (Pentre'r Eglwys) and Llantwit Fardre. The Church Village bypass, {{as it is}} known, has been built as a single carriageway, with crawler and <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> around roundabouts, and was opened for traffic in September 2010.|$|R
50|$|Costain, under {{contract}} from Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council constructed a bypass to reduce traffic congestion on the A473, Pontypridd to Bridgend (Penybont) road, from Cross Inn, near Llantrisant, to Tonteg via Efail Isaf. The Church Village bypass, which is {{built as a}} single carriageway, with crawler and <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> around roundabouts opened in September 2010.|$|R
50|$|This {{still left}} the East Ayrshire {{stretch of the}} road which widely {{appeared}} in statistics {{as one of the}} most dangerous sections of road in Scotland. The majority of this section was an unsegregated, 4-lane single carriageway between Kilmarnock and Newton Mearns and the lanes were narrow compared to the standard of other major roads. At several points, it was common for traffic waiting to turn right to queue in the <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane.</b> The speed limit of 60 mi/h km/h was widely ignored. Finally, the road narrowed to only two lanes near Newton Mearns, causing long queues.The combined result was a number of fatal crashes. The Scottish Executive took the decision to replace the entire section up to the Kilmarnock bypass with an extension of the M77 after pressure and campaigning from West Sound and West FM.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent years}} {{speculation}} {{has focused on}} the bodies having been buried under the A9, which {{was in the middle of}} a major program of upgrading at the time of the disappearance. An 80-year-old farmer with supposed divining skills took his divining rods to Dalmagarry and declared the bodies to be under a track, 12ft down. He now thinks the bodies are under the A9, at a spot he has marked with a yellow circle. In 2010, the Scottish Government announced that a £2.6 million contract had been awarded for an <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> at the location, which renewed interest from the farmer, who claims to have discovered [...] "anomalies" [...] in a radar survey of the area. However, a spokeswoman for Northern Constabulary said that after studying aerial photographs taken by the RAF during the construction of the A9, they were satisfied the bodies were not buried under the road.|$|E
50|$|The A4 is {{the main}} route into Fermanagh (and on to County Sligo) from the Belfast direction. Running {{from the end of}} the M1 at Dungannon, the section through the Clogher Valley is the lowest {{standard}} on the whole route. While towns and villages along the A4 in Fermanagh were generally bypassed years ago, the A4 runs straight through the middle of three Tyrone villages: Augher, Clogher and Fivemiletown. These are now the only non-bypassed settlements on the road. The largest of these, Fivemiletown, will be bypassed. The village currently has a one-way system to cope with the heavy traffic on the narrow main street, but this stalls long-distance traffic and is a big inconvenience to residents of the village. The new road will be built to 2+1 standard, meaning that there will be one lane in one direction, with two in the opposite direction to permit overtaking. On longer routes, such as this one, the <b>overtaking</b> <b>lane</b> usually alternates giving an overtaking opportunity to traffic in each direction. The scheme will compliment a 2+1 scheme completed on the A4 outside Fivemiletown in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Rhondda Cynon Taf, {{the local}} authority, has {{constructed}} a bypass to reduce traffic congestion on the A473, Pontypridd to Bridgend (Penybont ar Ogwr) road, at Tonteg, Church Village (Pentre'r Eglwys) and Llantwit Fardre (Llanilltud Faerdref). The Church Village bypass, {{as it is}} known, is built as a single carriageway, with crawler and <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> around roundabouts and was completed in Autumn 2010.|$|R
50|$|The road to Orford {{remains at}} the {{national}} standard as a two-lane highway, albeit {{with only a few}} <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes</b> along its distance. The remainder of the road to St Helens is two lane, with even fewer overtaking opportunities.The eastern, coastal portion of the highway is spectacular, in places running just metres from the Tasman Sea, which makes this the eastern-most A road in Tasmania.|$|R
50|$|The Melton Highway {{connects the}} Western Freeway and Calder Freeway and {{provides}} the most direct route between Ballarat and Melbourne's northern airports (Tullamarine and Essendon) and suburbs, bypassing busy western suburbs. The increase in traffic has seen the road upgraded with many <b>overtaking</b> <b>lanes,</b> and increasing residential levels at the Sydenham end has seen duplication of the carriageway and reconstruction of the railway crossing just north of Sydenham (Watergardens) station.|$|R
