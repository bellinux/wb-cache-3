5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} apocryphal, {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when Alexander Hamilton, then the commander of an artillery battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> of King George II that hung in the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> Paul had {{convinced}} Alessandro {{to retain the}} post, hinting that he would later succeed him as pope– an aspiration that was ultimately frustrated. As Alessandro realised the emptiness of the promise he lost confidence in both his grandfather's word and political credibility.|$|E
5|$|Kunichika's status {{continued}} to rise and he was commissioned to create several portraits of his teacher. When Kunisada died in 1865, his student was commissioned to design two memorial portraits.

5|$|The National Portrait Gallery later refused Harris's offer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait.</b> In 2012 the {{painting}} was displayed at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool {{as part of an}} exhibition of Harris's work. It was described by the Walker Gallery as having been part of Harris's private collection; the gallery later said that they had returned the portrait to Whitewall Galleries with whom Harris had a commercial relationship.|$|E
5|$|Another celebrated {{image of}} Washington is the Lansdowne {{portrait}}, a large portrait with one version {{hanging in the}} East Room of the White House. This painting was saved during the burning of Washington by British troops in the War of 1812 through the intervention of First Lady Dolley Madison and Paul Jennings, one of President James Madison's slaves. Four versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> are attributed to Stuart, and additional copies were painted by other artists for display in U.S. government buildings. In 1803, Stuart opened a studio in Washington, D. C.|$|E
5|$|Harold Washington, {{the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait,</b> {{was elected in}} 1965 to the Illinois House of Representatives. After the death of Richard J. Daley in late 1976, Washington won Chicago's 1983 Democratic mayoral primary election. He was elected mayor, {{prevailing}} over Bernard Epton in a racially polarizing general election. His first four-year term was characterized by the Council Wars, a period of political conflict with the mostly white aldermanic majority in City Council. Seven Washington-backed aldermanic challengers prevailed in the April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda. Washington died suddenly {{of a heart attack}} in his office. His death was followed by a period of mourning by Chicagoans, particularly in the African-American community.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>portraits</b> {{was painted}} in four months, from October 1800 to January 1801.

5|$|Later {{copies of}} the second state, with minor retouching, were also printed from the plate by Thomas Cotes in 1632, for Robert Allot's Second Folio, a new edition of the {{collected}} plays. It was also reused in later folios, although by then the plate was beginning to wear out and was heavily re-engraved. The original plate was still being used into the 1660s, and then disappears. Already in 1640 William Marshall had copied and adapted the design on a new plate for John Benson's edition of Shakespeare's sonnets. All subsequent engraved reprintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> were made by later engravers copying the original printed image.|$|E
5|$|Next to the apse is a {{mural of}} Saint Cyril of Alexandria, captioned as “Saint Cyril the Philosopher”, the 9th-century missionary to the Slavs. Although the {{position}} and iconography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> clearly identify it as an image of Cyril of Alexandria, the caption hints that the local population confused the two saints and Cyril the Philosopher was still well-remembered at the time. Other images painted in the church include these of the Dormition of the Mother of God (above the entrance), the Transfiguration of Jesus (under the vault), John Damascene, Cosmas of Maiuma, Archangel Michael (south of the entrance), Saint Constantine and Saint Helena (right of the entrance).|$|E

25|$|In 1980, O'Neal {{facilitated}} {{a meeting}} between Fawcett and artist Andy Warhol, who created two portraits of Fawcett during their time together. Fawcett later loaned <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> to <b>The</b> Andy Warhol Museum.

40|$|<b>The</b> focus <b>of</b> “Portraits on <b>the</b> Wall” is {{discovering}} the history behind two family heirlooms. Through online archival and ancestry websites, a tentative history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portraits</b> was found. Once a more clear background was established, a complete {{line of descent}} was created starting with <b>the</b> current generations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family and traced back to one generation previous to <b>the</b> <b>portraits.</b> While searching for answers about <b>the</b> subjects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portraits,</b> an abundance <b>of</b> family history was unearthed. Everything from local politicians, to Supreme Court cases against step-mothers, successful business owners, to friends of presidents. While investigating the subjects in <b>the</b> <b>portraits,</b> other family events are explored on the journey through eight generations <b>of</b> family history. <b>The</b> main source <b>of</b> information outside of family knowledge was ancestry. com. Through this website, pictures, censuses, marriage licenses, and birth and death records were found to provide additional resources. “The Ewing Genealogy” and bartondatabase. info are both compilations of family histories that intertwined with <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portraits,</b> making them both extremely valuable sources. Additionally, other family heirlooms including photographs, books, and newspaper clippings were used...|$|R
5|$|Titian was a {{personal}} friend of Charles; the commissioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given {{as a means to}} strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, as he began to see himself unaccountable to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, {{the year}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait.</b> He befriended Ingres either through his son Édouard Bertin, {{a student of}} the painter, or via Étienne-Jean Delécluze, Ingres' friend and the Journals art critic. In either case the genesis of the {{commission}} is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|Rolf Harris was {{a popular}} {{entertainer}} on British TV, and was the presenter of Rolf on Art, a BBC series on artists. He took two months to complete the portrait; two sittings were held at Buckingham Palace {{in the summer of}} 2005, filmed by the BBC; the rest of the painting was completed at Harris' own art studio. The portrait, measuring , is in oil of the Queen wearing a turquoise dress. After he completed the portrait Harris' reputation as an artist, and the value of his works increased, and he was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE). The award was annulled following his conviction for indecent assault and sexual offences, and his art work became worthless. The ownership and current location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> is unknown.|$|E
