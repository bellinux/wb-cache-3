40|$|Many {{cities have}} adopted minimum parking requirements, {{but we have}} {{relatively}} poor information about how parking infrastructure has grown. In this research, using building and roadway growth models, we estimate how parking has grown in Los Angeles County from 1900 to 2010, and how parking infrastructure evolves, affects urban form, and relates to changes in automobile travel. We find that since 1975, the ratio of residential <b>offstreet</b> <b>parking</b> <b>spaces</b> to automobiles in Los Angeles County is close to 1. 0 and the greatest density of <b>parking</b> <b>spaces</b> is in the urban core. Most new growth in parking occurs outside of the core. 14 % of incorporated land in Los Angeles County is committed to parking. Uncertainty in our space inventory is attributed to our building growth model, onstreet space length, and the assumption that <b>parking</b> <b>spaces</b> were created as per the requirements. The continued use of minimum parking requirements is likely to encourage automobile use {{at a time when}} metropolitan areas are actively seeking to manage congestion and increase transit use, biking, and walking. Widely discussed ways to reform parking policies may be less than effective if planners do not consider the remaining incentives to auto use created by the existing parking infrastructure. Planners should encourage the conversion of existing parking facilities to alternative uses. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} 17 transit-oriented {{developments}} (TOD) in five U.

Over a typical weekday period, the surveyed TOD housing projects averaged 44 percent fewer vehicle trips than that {{estimated by the}} manual (3. 754 versus 6. 715). Vehicle trip rates of transit-oriented housing projects were particularly low in metropolitan Washington, D. C. and Portland, Oregon, both known for successful TOD planning at the regional and corridor levels. Trip rates also generally fell as neighborhood densities increased. Local officials should account for the lower automobile use of those residing in TOD housing through such measures as traffic impact-fee adjustments and reduced <b>offstreet</b> <b>parking</b> requirements...|$|R

This article focuses on 3 strategies {{that were part of}} the larger study and that relate to removing barriers in connection with (1) subdivision/development standards; (2) density bonuses; and (3) the processing of permits, plans, and reviews. Recommendations relating to development standards address excessive requirements for lot size, lot width, yard setbacks, <b>offstreet</b> <b>parking,</b> and width of sidewalks and planting strips. Recommendations relating to density bonuses address an existing system crippled by rules that are confusing, contradictory, and of questionable economic value. Recommendations relating to processing of permits address unclear responsibilities and standards, insufficient advance planning and zoning, lack of waivers and uniformity, and an excessive number of hearings...|$|R

40|$|When a {{business}} restripes a parking lot, it must provide accessible <b>parking</b> <b>spaces</b> {{as required by}} the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. In addition, businesses or privately owned facilities that provide goods or services to the public have a continuing ADA obligation to remove barriers to access in existing parking lots when it is readily achievable to do so. Because restriping is relatively inexpensive, it is readily achievable in most cases. This ADA Business Brief provides key information about how to create accessible car and van spaces and how many spaces to provide when parking lots are restriped.

40|$|In this paper, a 3 -layer Bayesian {{hierarchical}} detection framework (BHDF) {{is proposed}} for robust <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> detection.

40|$|<b>Parking</b> <b>space</b> is a {{basic and}} {{important}} public facility in urban areas. Problems of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> {{are said to be}} always occuring in urban areas, especially in the city centre or busy commercial and services zones. In Malaysia, the common parking system adopted is shared-parking turn-time system, whereby members of the public share limited <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the city centre and have to take turns to keep their vehicle temporarily in parking lots. City centres are said to be suffering from insufficient <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> forcing people to park their vehicles on road shoulders or outside the gazetted parking lots. This causes traffic congestion and arouses question of sufficiency of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in such areas. The basic task in addressing this issue is by carrying out supply and demand analysis of <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} apply a spatial technique using the Geographic Information System (CIS) in modelling the supply and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> taking Johor Bahru city centre as a study case. Maps of buildings, land cadastre, urban land use, and others such as road and street networks are digitally constructed to form a spatial database of supply and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the study area. Attribute data on building inventory, building characteristics, land use, space supply, and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> are obtained from the Johor Bahru City Council, private parking companies operating in the city, observational, as well as interview surveys in the study area. The shared-parking turn-time model - the "SpaTT model" - is developed to analyse spatial distribution of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> supply and demand in the study area. The "SpaTT model" is then incorporated into Arc View 3. 1 to determine <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> equilibrium across the study area. This, in turn, is used to determine zones with <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> deficit and, thus, which need additional parking lots. The study discloses that there is reasonable level of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> equilibrium in the study area. In other words, there is no evidence of acute supply problem of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the Johor Bahru city centre as perceived, although there are zones where additional on-street parking could be provided to add parking supply...|$|R
