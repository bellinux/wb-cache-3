50|$|Open Discourse is a {{technical}} term used in discourse analysis and Sociolinguistics and is commonly contrasted with Closed Discourse. The concept of open and closed discourse {{is associated with}} the overlay of open and closed discourse communities and open and closed communication events. Keys to determining whether a discourse is open or closed include access to information, equity of access, open access, quality of discourse and mechanisms and modalities of discourse control: overt, covert, implicit and incidental. As a conceptual filter and cultural construct, ideology is a function and mechanism of discourse control. Channel and signal of a communication event and register of communication together control discourse and therefore, determine the degree of social inclusion and social exclusion and, by extension, the relative efficiency of that communication event. Open and closed discourse operate along a continuum where absolute closure and complete openness are theoretically untenable due to noise in the channel. The nature of the channel, signal, code, replicability, recording, transmissibility, cataloguing, recall or <b>other</b> <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> a communication event and its information control and context of transmission-as-event, impact its relative position along the continuum between open and closed discourse.

We argue that while scholars and writers often focus on direct tips, contextual tips often make direct tips possible, such as when human rights conditions in a state deteriorate creating the potential for an uprising.

Only 60 - 70 % of new patients {{could be controlled}} effectively by standard AEDs and this stimulates the search for new, more effective and well-tolerated AEDs. Objective To asses the efficacy and safety of topiramate, as an adjunctive therapy to standard AEDs for children with intractable epilepsy. Methods This was an open label, parallel group study. Forty children with at least 4 seizures during a 4 -week baseline period {{were randomly assigned to}} topiramate (n= 20) or control group (n= 20). In the topiramate group, the drug was given in adjunct to AEDs for  2 -week titration dosage continued with a 12 -week stabilization period, while the control group received only AEDs adjusted to their clinical responses.

In this study, three groups of research articles including native English (NE), native Persian (NP), and non-native English (NNE) articles (written by Iranian academics) were analyzed based on Hyland and Tse’s (2004) taxonomy plus two metadiscourse strategies by Abdi et al.

The {{difference between the two}} cultures of English and Persian represented in texts was examined in terms of the impact of English as L 2 on the non-native English research articles written by Iranian academic writers.

For Nepal, {{this is the}} second poverty map produced after a gap of seven years in collaboration with the Central Bureau of statistics, Nepal. This report presents 2010 / 11 small-area estimates and maps for Nepal at the 75 district, 967 ilaka and 2344 'target area' level, of poverty incidence, poverty gap, and poverty severity. The report also provides maps of the number of poor and their average consumption. As the newly introduced target areas are generally smaller than conventional aggregation levels, special attention is devoted to investigating the precision of the point estimates and to interpretation of the results. The poverty maps could usefully be expanded to other indicators of welfare such as nutrition and food security like in 2006. Detailed spatial distribution of poverty offers an opportunity to explore further the causes of poverty trends in Nepal. When combined with the spatial distribution of correlates of poverty such as access to roads, schools and health facilities, and <b>other</b> <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> economic geography, one can further our understanding of the persistence of pockets of poverty in Nepal.

40|$|The {{research}} on social science eventually comes through any meaning {{about the human}} and society. Its message is directed to the society and the principal object of research would be its components, generally research participants or samples in terms of research method. As for nature, it is per se obvious that humans or populace act on various factors to influence their decision. This complex nature of human strands generally prevail that the multivariate analysis is an usual challenge for the social science researchers. For example, the researchers may like to know the relationship of special training on math and achievement of math score. He or she may apply a multivariate analysis from several variables, in which one may be controlled and pretest or post test will be administered. So he groups two classes in test and for a longitudinal study over one semester between the specially trained students and normal class. Then he adds one <b>other</b> <b>variable</b> <b>of</b> family income level that he supposes one important factor to affect the achievement of student in math subject. This would be quantitatively answered by applying a multivariate test, called specifically as factoral ANOVA. The simple ANOVA test may be dosed in several times to understand more a complex interaction or control among the variables. Nevertheless, it has the weakness that unnecessary time and effort would be consumed. Additionally, MANOVA or other multivariate analysis of data would lead us to the more intense and precise result when the variables in consideration all interact to affect the outcome variables. It can be made distinct from mere aggregation of each result from one way ANOVA or univariate and bivariate analysis. Like these, in various ways. the quantitative studies are used to find the scientific truth. Through the Quantitative Reasoning and Analysis (QRA), we could achieve much progress which {{would be helpful to}} accelerate the interest and skills in the empirical studies. Most of all, the studies in concern of quantitative method might be a leapfrog for one, who fears of the difficult quantitative skills of analysis. Many of researchers may be fragile since the math courses in the high school and one pass in the college days are all we may have experienced. It is challenging also because the days might be far gone of middle age. For this reason, it never is a puffery that we would fear of quantitative skills. I hope that this paper could be a small help to adapt with the quantitative paradigm. Additionally, {{it would be great to}} realize that the quantitative reasoning is fairly powerful and very persuasive to frame a scientific message not only for the peer professionals, but also for lay world. We don’t have to cite the belief of empiricists and its modern evolution backed up by the mathematicians and statisticians. The benefit from this research method is obvious from many realities.
