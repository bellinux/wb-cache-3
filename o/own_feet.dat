25|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{notes in}} The Uses of Enchantment that the 18th-century fairy tale Beauty and the Beast is {{a version of}} Cupid and Psyche. Motifs from Apuleius occur in several fairy tales, {{including}} Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin, in versions collected by folklorists trained in the classical tradition, such as Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. In the Grimm version, Cinderella is given the task of sorting lentils and peas from ash, and is aided by birds just as ants help Psyche in the sorting of grain and legumes imposed on her by Venus. Like Cinderella, Psyche has two envious sisters who compete with her for the most desirable male. Cinderella's sisters mutilate their <b>own</b> <b>feet</b> to emulate her, while Psyche's are dashed to death on a rocky cliff. In Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, the Little Mermaid is given a dagger by her sisters, who, {{in an attempt to}} end all the suffering she endured and to let her become a mermaid again, attempt to persuade her to use it to slay the Prince while he is asleep with his new bride. She cannot bring herself to kill the Prince, however. Unlike Psyche, who becomes immortal, she doesn't receive his love in return, but she, nevertheless, ultimately earns the eternal soul she yearns for.|$|E

In 2011, Vikram was selected as a Youth Envoy for the United Nations Human Settlements Programme with his aim being to spread awareness about the statutes of U.N Habitat which include urban stabilisation and to help formulate plans for effective water management, slum eradication and women and youth empowerment. Soon after he announced two further social projects, [...] "Karka Kasadara" [...] and [...] "Patchai Puratchi", with the former being to identify school and college drop outs and help them to stand on their <b>own</b> <b>feet,</b> while the latter was about planting trees with an aim to make Chennai go green.

500|$|In the Shiva Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, and the Vishnu Purana, the rakshasa disguises {{himself as}} a Brahmin cook and gains entry to the king's kitchen. When Vashishtha arrives in Ayodhya on the king's {{invitation}} for a Shraddha ceremony, or simply dinner, the demon cooks human flesh and offers that to the sage {{on behalf of the}} king. The enraged sage curses him to be transformed into a human-eating rakshasa and wander the forests. The pious king is outraged by the unjust curse and quarrels with the sage. Vashishtha reduces the curse to 12 years when he hears of the rakshasa's deception. But the king is not satisfied. He takes water in his hand to cast a curse on Vashishtha, but the queen dissuades him. However, the curse-ridden water cannot be wasted. If thrown on the ground, it will destroy the crop. If thrown in the air, it will spoil the rains. Throwing in any direction would harm some living beings. Ultimately, the king throws the water on his <b>own</b> <b>feet.</b> Since the king's feet become black and white in colour, he gains the epithets Kalmashapada and Kalmasanghri (literally, [...] "pied feet").|$|E

To Vivekananda, education was not only collection of information, but something more meaningful; he felt education should be man-making, life giving and character-building.
