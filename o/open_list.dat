5|$|The {{most recent}} {{substantial}} {{revision of the}} election law came in February 2015, and was partially upheld by the Constitutional Court in September 2015. An element of preferential voting was introduced by letting voters choose not only {{for a list of}} candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an <b>open</b> <b>list</b> system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} d'Hondt {{formula is}} applied to the vote (except for the twelfth constituency in which national minority representatives are elected), with a five-percent election threshold in each constituency. Since 2015, the parliamentary elections have an element of preferential voting by letting voters choose not only for a list of candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an <b>open</b> <b>list</b> system.

50|$|A {{localized}} list {{or local}} list {{is a technique}} used under systems of party-list proportional representation to determine which party candidates are elected from the party list. Local <b>lists</b> differ from <b>open</b> <b>lists</b> or closed <b>lists.</b> As with <b>open</b> <b>lists,</b> local lists allow the electorate to vote for individual candidates, but that preference is expressed through local or district level election processes. Closed lists do not allow voters to express such a preference. Voters vote only for the party.|$|R

25|$|Party list {{proportional}} representation is an electoral {{system in which}} seats are first allocated to parties based on vote share, and then assigned to party-affiliated candidates on the parties' electoral lists. This system is used in many countries, including Finland (<b>open</b> <b>list),</b> Latvia (<b>open</b> <b>list),</b> Sweden (<b>open</b> <b>list),</b> Israel (national closed list), Brazil (<b>open</b> <b>list),</b> Nepal (Closed list) adopted in 2008 in first CA election, the Netherlands (<b>open</b> <b>list),</b> Russia (closed list), South Africa (closed list), Democratic Republic of the Congo (<b>open</b> <b>list),</b> and Ukraine (<b>open</b> <b>list).</b> For elections to the European Parliament, most member states use open lists; but most large EU countries use closed lists, so {{that the majority of}} EP seats are distributed by those. Local lists were used to elect the Italian Senate {{during the second half of}} the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Ahead of {{the polls}} CC.OO. and UGT had agreed on the {{principles}} of voluntary and secret vote. However, UGT called for the usage of closed lists whilst CC.OO. wanted to have <b>open</b> <b>lists.</b> Although the underlying motives of the choice of different approaches to the electoral system are not entirely clear, one assumption is that CC.OO. favoured <b>open</b> <b>lists</b> as they would be benefitted by their superior number of organized cadres whilst UGT would have hoped that their connection to the Socialist Party could be better utilized with closed lists. In the end the Ministry of Labour adopted a mixed system. The polls in companies with less than 250 employees were held with <b>open</b> <b>lists,</b> in other companies closed lists were used.|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to previous parliamentary elections that were closed list, Indonesia instituted an <b>open</b> <b>list</b> system for this election.

25|$|In an <b>open</b> <b>list,</b> voters may vote, {{depending}} on the model, for one person, or for two, or indicate their order of preference within the list. These votes sometimes rearrange the order of names on the party's list and thus which of its candidates are elected. Nevertheless, the number of candidates elected from the list {{is determined by the}} number of votes the list receives.|$|E

25|$|For the Senate, 208 {{seats were}} elected using an <b>open</b> <b>list</b> partial block voting, with electors voting for {{individual}} candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote {{for up to}} three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. Ceuta and Melilla elected two seats each. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Sirisena {{released}} his manifesto, titled A Compassionate Maithri Governance— A Stable Country, on 19 December 2014 {{at a rally}} at Viharamahadevi Park. The main pledge in the manifesto is {{the replacement of the}} executive presidency with a Westminster style cabinet but the manifesto acknowledges that Sirisena would need the support of the parliament to amend the constitution. The manifesto also makes a commitment to replace the <b>open</b> <b>list</b> proportional representation system with a mixture of first-past-the-post and PR for electing MPs. Parliamentary elections will be held in April 2015 after the constitution has been amended. Independent commissions will be established to oversee the judiciary, police, elections department, Auditor-General's Department and Attorney-General's Department. The Commission on Bribery and Corruption will be strengthened and political diplomatic appointments annulled. Populist measures in the manifesto include a commitment to write-off 50% of farmers' loans, reduce fuel prices by removing taxes and a salary increase of Rs.10,000 for public servants. Public spending on health would increase from 1.8% of GDP to 3% of GDP whilst that on education would increase from 1.7% of GDP to 6% of GDP. The manifesto also states that the casino licences granted to Kerry Packer's Crown Resort and John Keells Holdings's Water Front will be cancelled. Political victims during Rajapaks's rule, including Sarath Fonseka and Shirani Bandaranayake, would be re-appointed.|$|E
500|$|Fair dealing is an {{exception}} to United Kingdom copyright law which allows {{for the use of}} copyrighted works without licensing in certain circumstances. It is governed by Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which provide three types of situation in which fair dealing is a valid defence: where the use is for the purposes of research or private study, where it is to allow for criticism or review, and where it is for the purpose of reporting current events. This can be contrasted with the United States doctrine of fair use, which provides a general defence rather than rigid and specific categories of acceptable behaviour. Under United Kingdom law, an infringer relying on fair dealing as a defence must show that their actions fall into a specific category of acceptable use, as opposed to the [...] "illustrative <b>open</b> <b>list</b> of purposes" [...] in US law. The fair dealing exceptions had previously been formalised in case law as [...] "fair use" [...] forms, but this was eliminated by the Copyright Act 1911.|$|E

2500|$|PR {{tries to}} resolve the {{unfairness}} of majoritarian and plurality voting systems where the largest parties receive an [...] "unfair" [...] "seat bonus" [...] and smaller parties are disadvantaged and have difficulty winning any representation at all (Duverger's law). The established parties in UK elections can win formal control of the parliament with as little as 35% of votes (2005 UK general election). In certain Canadian elections, majority governments have been formed by parties {{with the support of}} under 40% of votes cast (2011 Canadian election, 2015 Canadian election). If turnout levels in the electorate are less than 60%, such outcomes allow a party to form a majority government by convincing as few as one quarter of the electorate to vote for it. [...] In the 2005 UK election, for example, the Labour Party under Tony Blair won a comfortable parliamentary majority with the votes of only 21.6% of the total electorate. [...] Such misrepresentation has been criticized as [...] "no longer a question of 'fairness' but of elementary rights of citizens". [...] However, PR systems with a high electoral threshold, or other features that reduce proportionality, are not necessarily much fairer: in the Turkish general election, 2002, using an <b>open</b> <b>list</b> system with a 10% threshold, 46% of votes were wasted.|$|E
