40|$|Overlap-directed DNA {{assembly}} methods allow multiple DNA {{parts to}} be assembled {{together in one}} reaction. These methods, which rely on sequence homology between the ends of DNA parts, have become widely adopted in synthetic biology, despite being incompatible with a key prin-ciple of engineering: modularity. To answer this, we present MODAL: a Modular Overlap-Directed Assembly with Linkers strategy that brings modular-ity to overlap-directed methods, allowing assembly of an initial set of DNA parts {{into a variety of}} arrangements in one-pot reactions. MODAL is accompanied by a custom software tool that designs overlap linkers to guide assembly, allowing parts to be assembled in any specified order and orientation. The in silico design of syn-thetic orthogonal <b>overlapping</b> <b>junctions</b> allows for much greater efficiency in DNA assembly for a variety of different methods compared with using non-designed sequence. In tests with three different assembly technologies, the MODAL strategy gives assembly of both yeast and bacterial plasmids, composed of up to five DNA parts in the kilobase range with efficiencies of between 75 and 100 %. It also seamlessly allows mutagenesis to be performed on any specified DNA parts during the process, allowing the one-step creation of con-struct libraries valuable for synthetic biology applications...|$|E

The reverse {{transcriptase}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} (RT-PCR) provides a technique to diagnose a group of sarcomas and small round cell tumors that contain specific chromosomal translocations and chimeric gene fusion products.

40|$|ObjectiveVarious {{types of}} device-specific adverse events can occur during {{deployment}} of thoracic stent grafts {{due to the}} high flow rate and severe aortic angulation that is often encountered in the thoracic aorta. This study assessed the incidence, etiology, and overall effect of misaligned deployment of the Talent Thoracic Stent Graft (TSG) System. Techniques to predict and avoid this complication are discussed. MethodsData collection included pivotal-trial follow-up, direct surveys of centers {{inside and outside the}} United States and principal investigators, a targeted literature search, and review of complaint files. Misaligned deployment was considered to occur when the proximal covered or uncovered stent apices of a thoracic stent graft folded back on itself and remained nonparallel to the wall of the aorta after deployment had been completed. ResultsOf about 20, 305 deployments to date of the Talent TSG, 24 misaligned deployments were identified for an incidence of 0. 1 %. Nineteen (79 %) events occurred during treatment of degenerative aneurysms or penetrating ulcers, four (17 %) during treatment of dissections, and the underlying pathology could not be determined for one patient. The misalignment was noted at the proximal end of the stent graft in 15 patients (63 %), and the other 9 events (37 %) occurred at the graft <b>overlap</b> <b>junction.</b> Two events were treated intraoperatively, with a second overlapping device placed in one patient and a snare used to reposition the proximal stent in another. Adverse clinical events occurred in three patients and included a persistent type I endoleak, continued false lumen perfusion in a patient with dissection, and delayed retrograde type A dissection in a patient undergoing total arch repair. No intraoperative contrast extravasation or computed tomography evidence of perforation was noted. There were no perioperative deaths or cerebrovascular events, with one report of paraplegia among the 24 patients in this series. ConclusionMisaligned deployment is an unusual phenomenon that tends to occur in the context of certain well-defined anatomic conditions in the thoracic aorta. To date, most of these events have not led to significant adverse sequelae. However, careful patient selection, periprocedural imaging, and case planning can help to identify anatomies in which misaligned opening is likely to occur, allowing physicians to avoid this complication...|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, with driving currents, {{the power}} reduces as the resistance decreases. This {{means that a}} process can be designed whereby as the welding completes, the heat automatically subsides, leading to a self-executing welding process. As Tohmyoh showed [14], there is a threshold of power at which the heat applied is enough for welding yet low enough not to cause to damage to the nanowires. Current ramps serve {{as a method of}} finding the appropriate current quickly, without having to incrementally adjust a constant current measurement. While resistance is still high, small current steps must be used because large steps can burn the nanowire. However, when using small steps, it takes an impractically long time to reach a sufficiently high current to complete the weld (and current-source units often have a maximum limit to the number of measurement steps). That is why multiple current ramps, each with larger step sizes, are thus used to lower the contact resistance step by step. During each current ramp, before welding begins and resistance changes, power and heat increase along with the increasing current. As the heat approaches the breakdown temperature of the intermediate layer, the layer partly dissolves and the resistance decreases, which is observed as a drop in the voltage response. Since the power decreases as the intermediate layer becomes ineffective, the complete dissolution of the intermediate layer does not typically occur until a current on the order of 1  mA is reached. At this point, the heat at the junction is also high enough for local melting of the silver and thus for welding to occur. As found in other works on Joule heat welding of metallic nanowires [14], the power required for welding was not dependent on nanowire length since the resistance of the junction is much larger than the resistance of the nanowires themselves [26]. Once melting is achieved, the junction exhibits a linear voltage–current response. The completion of welding is evident with further measurements. This is done by first leaving the junction to settle without current for several minutes and then running a current ramp. A linear response would confirm the completion of the weld, while a surge response with a voltage spike {{at the start of the}} measurement would show an uncompleted weld. The typical electrical response to such current ramp sweeps is shown in Fig.  3 b, and an image of a typical <b>overlapped</b> <b>junction</b> after welding is shown in Fig.  3 c. The image shows that the morphology of the nanowires is minimally affected away from the junction, including next to either electrodes.|$|R

The extents of these overlaps may be set by single fortuitously matching base pairs and determine the patterns of subsequent gap filling and nick ligation. Under conditions of alternative overlap settings, rules for the most probable joining pathway and the effects of mismatches on junction formation were analyzed.

By identifying changes in splicing and novel loci expression associated with disease, {{we may be able to}} gain a better understanding of their pathogenesis, identify novel disease-specific biomarkers, and find better targets for therapy. Using RNA-seq data that our group generated on 281 human lung tissue samples (47 =Control, 131 =COPD, 103 =ILD), I initially defined the transcriptomic landscape of lung tissue by identifying which genes were expressed in each tissue sample. I used a mixture model to separate genes into reliable and not reliable expression. Next, I employed reads that <b>overlapped</b> splice <b>junctions</b> in a linear model interaction term to identify disease-specific differential splicing. I identified alternatively spliced genes between control and disease tissues and validated three (PDGFA, NUMB, SCEL) of these genes with qPCR and nanostring (a hybridization-based barcoding technique used to quantify transcripts). Finally, I implemented and improved a pipeline to perform transcriptome assembly using Cufflinks that led to the identification of 1, 855 novel loci that did not overlap with UCSC, Vega, and Ensembl annotations. The loci were classified into potential coding and non-coding loci (191 and 1, 664, respectively). Expression analysis revealed that there were 120 IPF-associated and 10 emphysema-associated differentially expressed (q < 0. 01) novel loci. RNA-seq provides a high-resolution transcript-level view of the pulmonary transcriptome and its modification in lung disease. It has enabled a new understanding of the lung transcriptome structure because it measures not only the transcripts we know but also the ones we do not know. The approaches and improvements I have employed have identified these novel targets and make possible further downstream functional analysis that could identify better targets for therapy and lead to an even better understanding of chronic lung disease pathogenesis. 2031 - 01 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a method based on {{vectorial}} signatures, which aims at discriminating, by a fast technique, symbols represented within technical documents. The use of signatures {{on this kind of}} document has an obvious interest. Indeed, considering a raw vectorial description of the graphical layer of a technical document (e. g. a set of arcs and segments), signatures can be used to perform a pre-processing step before a "traditional" graphics recognition processing, or can be used to establish a classification that can be sufficient to feed a further indexation step. To compute vectorial signatures, we have based our approach on a method proposed by Etemadi et al., who study spatial relations between primitives to solve a vision problem. We considerer five types of relations, invariant to transformations like rotation or scaling, between neighboring segments: parallelism with or without <b>overlapping,</b> collinearity, L <b>junctions</b> and V junctions. A quality factor is computed for each of the relations, computable with low requirements of power. The signature of all models of symbols that could be found in a given document are computed and matched against the signature of the document, in order to determine what symbols the document is likely to contain. The quality factor associated with each relation is used to prune relations whose quality factor is too low. We present finally the first tests obtained with this method, and we discuss the improvements we plan to do...|$|R
