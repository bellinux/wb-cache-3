Models <b>of</b> <b>capture</b> rate were generalized linear models with a gamma distribution using a log-link function.

Models <b>of</b> <b>capture</b> efficiency were generalized linear models with a quasibinomial distribution due to response type {{and the number of}} zeroes in the data set. We constructed models using a combination of water depth (linear or quadratic term), flock size, flock composition (single vs. mixed species), days since burn, habitat (Burn vs. Sloughs Adjacent to Burns), and year. The number of birds within a foraging flock affects foraging success of wading birds (Krebs 1974), so we controlled for flock size because it could confound the analysis of fire effects on foraging success. Changes in vegetation and other factors associated with time since burn may also affect foraging success of wading birds, so we included time since burn as a covariate to describe the effect that this variable has on foraging success of wading birds. We selected models <b>of</b> <b>capture</b> rate using the corrected Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) and <b>of</b> <b>capture</b> efficiency using corrected QAIC (QAICc; Burnham and Anderson 2002).
