5|$|Senate {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> The Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in the Senate resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian Democrats have been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry.
