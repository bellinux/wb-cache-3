Temporal {{variation}} in fire return intervals (FRI) {{that may be}} related to changes in land use was identified by comparing composite fire return intervals (CFRI) for the pre-Euro-American (prior to 1850), settlement (1850 to 1904), and fire exclusion (since 1905) periods using a Student’s t-test. A composite record of all sites was used for temporal comparisons for fires that burned any of <b>our</b> <b>sites,</b> 10 % or more of <b>our</b> <b>sites,</b> or 25 % or more of <b>our</b> <b>sites.</b> This analysis distinguishes how land use changes affected the frequency of fires of different extent (Dieterich 1980).|$|R

50|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{effective}} Operation In <b>Our</b> <b>Sites</b> has been in preventing websites that harm the U.S. economy, but agencies have seized {{a significant amount of}} funds and counterfeit goods from targeted websites.

50|$|Intellectual {{property}} owners and their representatives are not surprisingly supportive of Operation In <b>Our</b> <b>Sites</b> to the government, but some critics question {{the effectiveness of}} the program since the targeted websites are not actually seized or shut down; the program in effect only increases visitor access to agencies' servers.

30|$|Several {{factors may}} have {{prevented}} successful establishment of seeded bunchgrasses. One, <b>our</b> <b>sites</b> were on southerly aspects {{with a high}} concomitant heat load. In California, planted grasses established better on north facing than on south facing slopes (Lulow et al. 2007). Two, rainfall at <b>our</b> <b>sites</b> varied annually over the seven-year course {{of the study and}} included one exceedingly dry year (2008), which may have created conditions in which only well-established plants survived. Three, because California brome and blue wildrye are short-lived perennials in contrast to longer lived Roemer’s fescue and Lemmon’s needlegrass ([URL] they may have reached the ends of their lifespans and failed to reseed due to site conditions or the drought year.|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{accretion}} and elevation {{change in}} tidal forests, {{and the corresponding}} ability of these wetlands {{to keep pace with}} sea-level rise (SLR), represent data gaps in our understanding of wetland sustainability. Surface Elevation Tables and marker horizons were installed in three mature tidal forests and a restored tidal marsh, allowing us to measure elevation change, accretion, and subsidence. Additionally, we measured predictor variables to test for their significance in explaining accretion and elevation change rates. Mean accretion at <b>our</b> <b>sites</b> was 11. 67 +/- 3. 01 mm yr- 1 and mean elevation change was - 20. 22 +/- 8. 10 mm yr- 1, suggesting subsidence occurring beneath the sites. Processes contributing to accretion and elevation change at <b>our</b> <b>sites</b> may be driven by hydrologic patterns. Comparing our elevation trends with SLR trends suggests that <b>our</b> study <b>sites</b> may not keep pace with SLR. However, we may be observing short-term oscillations that do not indicate true long-term trends...|$|R

50|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the bimonthly political magazine The American Prospect, the author proposes that lobbying efforts on behalf of the media industry {{played a critical role in}} the adoption and implementation of Operation in <b>Our</b> <b>Sites.</b> The article further asserts that in the year prior to inception of Operation In <b>Our</b> <b>Sites,</b> large media conglomerates began providing ICE agents with lists of potential targets for the first round of raids. ICE was for some time responsible for regulating and eliminating sales of counterfeit merchandise, but pressure from the entertainment industry, through lobbying and other efforts, expanded the agency's function to include enforcement against piracy. Lobbying spending by the TV, music and movie industry did in fact increase dramatically from 2004 to 2010; it peaked at $123 million in 2011, then dropped to around $118 million where it stayed from 2012 to 2013.|$|R
