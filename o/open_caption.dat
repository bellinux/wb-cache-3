40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} {{standard}} use of intralingual subtitling in the Netherlands {{with the dominant}} form of intralingual subtitling, or impact captioning, in Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, and China: so called <b>open</b> <b>caption</b> telop (OCT). These open captions differ greatly from the subtitles {{we are used to}} seeing in the Netherlands, and are more so used to emphasize and create impact, rather than the subtitles in the Netherlands for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, strong accents or dialects, or as a learning tool for foreign language speakers. Research into the effects of OCT on a non-Asian, western audience has rarely been done, which makes it all the more important to gather some insight into this phenomenon. This thesis attempts to do so by conducting a small research into the thoughts of Dutch viewers on Asian-style <b>open</b> <b>caption</b> telop. Three short clips of popular Dutch entertainment programs had OCT added edited into them and were shown to a group of 40 respondents, both male and female and of various ages. They were then asked to fill in a short questionnaire, and some were asked to elaborate on their answers. The results of this research were used to determine whether the Dutch viewer public appreciates the forms and functions of OCT and whether this type of subtitling could, in theory, be implemented in Dutch television programs...|$|E
40|$|Depending on the {{specific}} information they are seeking, users desire flexible and intuitive methods to search and browse multimedia libraries. However, the cost of manually extracting the metadata to support such functionalities may be unrealistically high. Therefore, {{over the last decade}} there has been a great interest in designing and building systems that automatically analyze and index multimedia data, and retrieve its relevant parts. ^ In this work we describe algorithms that facilitate browsing, searching, and summarization of video sequences. We propose shot transition detection algorithms for the detection of cut and dissolve types of shot transitions based on a binary tree regression classifiers framework. Our system is able to detect these transitions with high accuracy. ^ We discuss stochastic models to model video program genres, such as news programs or sitcoms, and show how these can be applied to automatically detect the genre of a given program. We investigate the use of hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) for modeling. Since the computational complexity of SCFG training is high, we develop a hybrid HMM-SCFG model that reduces the training time of the models considerably. ^ Deriving compact representations of video sequences that are intuitive for users and let them easily and quickly browse large collections of video data is fast becoming {{one of the most important}} topics in content-based video processing. Such representations, which we will collectively refer to as video summaries, rapidly provide the user with information about the content of the particular sequence being examined, while preserving the essential message. We propose an automated method to generate video skims for information-rich video programs, such as documentaries, educational videos, and presentations, using statistical analysis based on speech transcripts that are obtained by automatic speech recognition (ASR) from the audio. Ideally one would like the generated summaries to be both detailed and covering most of the important points of the full program they were derived from. Clearly, for high summarization ratios it is impossible to stiff both of these constraints. Our summarization approach quantifies these two concepts and maximizes a weighted sum of both detail and coverage functions to obtain a trade-off between the two. We also study objective evaluation methods for video summaries. We evaluate summaries produced by a number of algorithms using a question and answer evaluation scheme and discuss other methods of summary evaluation. ^ In the final part of the dissertation we describe a real-world video processing application that makes use of many algorithms introduced in this work. In this application we generate a list of unique people appearing in a news program using a combination of visual and audio features. This system greatly facilitates the indexing of news programs and also may be used as part of a automatic <b>open</b> <b>caption</b> insertion system. ...|$|E

50|$|Before captioning, it {{was either}} {{impossible}} or very difficult for people with hearing impairments to watch television or videos. Captioning TV programs means that the audio is displayed as text on the screen. There {{are two types of}} captioning: open and closed. In 1970, the first <b>open</b> <b>captioning</b> with visible video picture was used in which captioning was shown to every viewer. In order to reduce oppositions to captioning, closed captioning was created. Closed captioning is positioned {{at the bottom of the}} screen beneath the speakers and calls for a decoder. Closed captioning is synchronized with speech and also transcribes sound such as laughter while <b>open</b> <b>captioning</b> does not require a decoder and captioning is continuously displayed. The 1990 Television Decoder Circuitry Act was the first act which recognized captioning. Due to this act, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commanded that all television broadcast receivers with screen sizes greater than 13 inches and manufactured or imported on or after July 1, 1993, be capable of receiving and displaying closed captions. Although these televisions were now capable of using captions, there still was no rule stating that captioning must be used other than for federally-funded public service announcements (authorized in the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act). Because captions were not required, many stations refused to display them, so in 1995 the FCC asked for an inquiry. However, the inquiry was succeeded by the reforms foreshadowed by the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which intended to ensure that all Americans with hearing and visual disabilities were able to access video services. The 1996 Telecommunications Act instructed the FCC to investigate if proper video programming conditions for those with hearing and visual disabilities were being met. After the investigation, the FCC created rules and implementation schedules to ensure that people with disabilities were being accommodated. In April 2000, another rule was adopted that requires broadcasters, cable operators, and other multichannel video programming distributors to make local emergency information accessible to people with hearing impairments. Finally, hearing-disabled people could participate like the rest of society in video and TV entertainment, proving that physical impairment can be overcome by making societal accommodations.|$|R

40|$|In the globalizing {{society we}} live in today, movies are made {{available}} to a broad and international audience through the translation of their contents – dubbing, voice-overs and subtitling. Of these, subtitling {{has proven to be}} an effective tool for the transmission of the core message to a different target audience without affecting the original too much. It is common practice in Japan to add Japanese subtitles to American film productions; regardless of genre, motion picture rating and popularity. The same is done for domestic Japanese cartoons (anime) and TV programs through the use of <b>open</b> <b>captions.</b> These types of subtitles are especially appropriate for hearing audiences of whom the people can hear the dialogues, sounds and background music themselves. Subtitles for non-hearing audiences, like deaf and hearing impaired viewers, need a different approach as the translation of sound to (written) language is also necessary. Only with this second layer of translation, can the deaf have a complete cinematic experience and be exposed to all cinematic clues. Nonetheless, in Japan this second layer of translation of American movies is insufficient, if not almost absent. In recent years, this issue has surfaced in the academic field of audiovisual translation studies in Japan. This thesis attempts to contribute to this nascent research area and takes {{a closer look at the}} subtitling options for a deaf Japanese target audience and tries to detect areas of improvement...|$|R
5000|$|In {{time for}} the 2006 season there were three {{additions}} to the stadium. Two sets of LED scoreboards were added. One replaced the formerly manually operated [...] "out of town" [...] scoreboards along {{the left and right}} field walls with a new set of LED scoreboards along the left-field wall. The new [...] "out of town" [...] scoreboards show continually updated information about other Major League games, including the score, hits, errors, outs, and an image of the field displaying the runners on base. A second-tier marquee scoreboard was also added along the bottom of the 300-level of the stadium stretching from foul pole to home plate to foul pole, with the portion closest to the foul lines used to provide <b>open</b> <b>captions</b> of announcements from the public address system and advertisements. The section of the second-tier scoreboard above home plate displays statistics for those unable to see the main scoreboard above the center-field wall. The final addition to Miller Park for the 2006 season was the addition of a field-level picnic area in the corner of right-field. The picnic area has a capacity of 75 and provides a place for fans to watch the game in a leisurely setting and be within feet of the right-fielder. Known first as the Mercedes-Benz Field Haus, the picnic area's name was changed to AirTran Airways Landing Zone in 2009, and later to the current name, the ATI Club.|$|R
