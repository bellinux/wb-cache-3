40|$|The use of <b>oxidized</b> metal <b>powders</b> in {{mechanical}} shock or crush safety enhancers in nuclear weapons has been investigated. The functioning {{of these devices}} {{is based on the}} remarkable electrical behavior of compacts of certain <b>oxidized</b> metal <b>powders</b> when subjected to compressive stress. For example, the low voltage resistivity of a compact of <b>oxidized</b> tantalum <b>powder</b> was found to decrease by over six orders of magnitude during compaction between 1 MPa, where the thin, insulating oxide coatings on the particles are intact, to 10 MPa, where the oxide coatings have broken down along a chain of particles spanning the electrodes. In this work, the behavior of tantalum and aluminum powders was investigated. The low voltage resistivity during compaction of <b>powders</b> <b>oxidized</b> under various conditions was measured and compared. In addition, the resistivity at higher voltages and the dielectric breakdown strength during compaction were also measured. A key finding was that significant changes in the electrical properties persist after the removal of the stress so that a mechanical shock enhancer is feasible. This was verified by preliminary shock experiments. Finally, conceptual designs for both types of enhancers are presented...|$|R

40|$|Metal {{hydrides}} {{are potential}} materials for onboard hydrogen storage. Thermal property measurements {{are needed to}} optimize the thermal management design of metal hydride storage systems which require a measurement technique developed with considerations of the thermodynamics of the hydriding process and the pyrophoric nature of the material. In the present work, a transient plane source (TPS) apparatus was integrated with a pressure vessel to measure effective thermal conductivity (keff) and thermal diffusivity (α) of metal hydrides in a high pressure hydrogen environment (up to 275 bar) for the first time. From these direct measurements, the material specific heat (CP) was derived from isotropic property relations. Furthermore, a custom pellet press was fabricated to make metal hydride pellets, including additives for structural integrity and thermal enhancement. ^ Thermal properties of Ti 1. 1 CrMn in <b>oxidized</b> pellet, <b>oxidized</b> <b>powder,</b> activated powder were measured. Pellets composed with graphite and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) had the highest keff between 6. 3 and 6. 9 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K. Pellets with aluminum powder had a keff of 1. 7 to 3. 5 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K, dependent on the compression force applied on the pellets. <b>Oxidized</b> <b>powder</b> k eff increased from 0. 80 to 1. 6 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K with increasing hydrogen pressure from 0. 17 to 275 bar. The pressure dependence of keff was attributed to the change in mean free path of the hydrogen gas with pressure. In contrast to <b>oxidized</b> <b>powder,</b> keff of activated Ti 1. 1 CrMn powder ranged from 0. 31 to 0. 71 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K {{as a function of}} hydrogen pressure from 2. 9 to 253 bar. While k eff was only dependent on the hydrogen pressure, both α and C P data of activated powder had strong dependencies on the hydriding reaction progress. This dependency was attributed to the change in metal hydride lattice structure between the desorbed and the absorbed phase, which affected the phonon transport. The present thermal property study provided data and insights for the implementation of efficient thermal management in metal hydride based onboard hydrogen storage systems. ...|$|R

Two different commercial powders with markedly diverse mean size as well as size distribution were chosen. Thermal oxidation of these as-received powders was carried out to restore the O/Ti ratio to be 2.0. By this way, another two kinds of feedstock powders were obtained.

For some spraying runs, carbon steel served as the substrate, and for others, the previously sprayed titania coating from a different kind of feedstock. Combinations of single- and double-layer coatings were studied. Porosity, microstructure, phase composition, chemical composition, band gap based on reflectance measurement, and photocatalytic activity were examined. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated substantial differences between samples sprayed from the fine and coarse <b>powders.</b> Coatings from <b>oxidized</b> <b>powders</b> were slightly more photocatalytic. High spraying distance used for several of them was good for obtaining low band gap, whereas surface roughness and phase composition were not substantially different compared to standard spraying distance coatings.|$|R

Nanocomposites, antibacterial paper, chemically modified GR and GO, in conjugate with proteins can be prepared [45]. Because GO bears abundant oxygen-containing functional groups, it is dispersible in aqueous solution [46]. Several methods have been successfully developed to prepare GR with a single layer, such as the scotch tape [47], chemical vapor deposition [48], epitaxial growth on electrically insulating and conducting surface and chemical oxidation–reduction of graphite [49].

However, the potential advantages (large power up-grade, increased cycle lengths, possible high burn-ups) as a Light Water Reactor (LWR) fuel are offset by uranium nitride's extremely low oxidation resistance (UN <b>powders</b> <b>oxidize</b> in air and UN pellets decompose in hot water). Innovative research is proposed to solve this problem and thereby provide an accident tolerant LWR fuel that would resist water leaks and high temperature steam oxidation/spalling during an accident. It is proposed that we investigate two methods to increase the oxidation resistance of UN: (1) Addition of USi{sub x} (e. g. U{sub 3 }Si{sub 2 }) to UN nitride powder, followed by liquid phase sintering, and (2) 'alloying' UN nitride with compounds (followed by densification via Spark Plasma Sintering) that will greatly increase oxidation resistance...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{atomization}} reaction synthesis (GARS) {{was employed}} as a simplified method for producing precursor powders for oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic stainless steels (e. g., Fe-Cr-Y-(Ti,Hf) -O), departing from the conventional mechanical alloying (MA) process. During GARS processing a reactive atomization gas (i. e., Ar-O 2) was used to <b>oxidize</b> the <b>powder</b> surfaces during primary break-up and rapid solidification of the molten alloy. This resulted in envelopment of the powders by an ultra-thin (t 3 ̆c 150 nm) metastable Cr-enriched oxide layer that {{was used as a}} vehicle for solid-state transport of O into the consolidated microstructure. In an attempt to better understand the kinetics of this GARS reaction, theoretical cooling curves for the atomized droplets were calculated and used to establish an oxidation model for this process. Subsequent elevated temperature heat treatments, which were derived from Rhines pack measurements using an internal oxidation model, were used to promote thermodynamically driven O exchange reactions between trapped films of the initial Cr-enriched surface oxide and internal Y-enriched intermetallic precipitates. This novel microstructural evolution process resulted in the successful formation of nano-metric Y-enriched dispersoids, as confirmed using high energy X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), equivalent to conventional ODS alloys from MA powders. The thermal stability of these Y-enriched dispersoids was evaluated using high temperature (1200 yC) annealing treatments ranging from 2. 5 to 1, 000 hrs of exposure. In a further departure from current ODS practice, replacing Ti with additions of Hf appeared to improve the Y-enriched dispersoid thermal stability by means of crystal structure modification. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the dispersoids was found to depend strongly on the original rapidly solidified microstructure. To exploit this, ODS microstructures were engineered from different powder particle size ranges, illustrating microstructural control as a function of particle solidification rate. The consolidation of ultra-fine powders (dia. less than 5 ym) resulted in a significant reduction in dispersoid size and spacing, consistent with initial scanning electron microscopy studies on as-atomized cross-sectioned particles that suggested that these powders solidified above the threshold velocity to effectively solute trap Y within the alpha-(Fe,Cr) matrix. Interestingly, when the solidification velocity as a function of particle size was extracted from the aforementioned theoretical particle cooling curves, it could be offered as supporting evidence for these microstructure observations. Thermal-mechanical treatments also were used to create and evaluate the stability of a dislocation substructure within these alloys, using microhardness and TEM analysis of the alloy sub-grain and grain structure. Moreover, elevated temperature tensile tests up to 800 yC were used to assess the initial mechanical strength of the ODS microstructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface state}} of carbon nanotubes-Fe-alumina {{nanocomposite}} powders was studied by transmission and integral low-energy electron Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy. Several samples, prepared under {{reduction of the}} R-Al 1. 8 -Fe 0. 2 O 3 precursor in a H 2 -CH 4 atmosphere applying the same heating and cooling rate and changing only the maximum temperature (800 - 1070 °C) were investigated, demonstrating that integral low-energy electron Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy is a promising tool complementing transmission Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy for {{the investigation of the}} location of the metal Fe and iron-carbide particles in the different carbon nanotubenanocomposite systems containing iron. The nature of the iron species (Fe 3 +, Fe 3 C, R-Fe, ç-Fe-C) is correlated to their location in the material. In particular, much information was derived for the powders prepared by using a moderate reduction temperature (800, 850, and 910 °C), for which the transmission and integral low-energy electron Mo¨ssbauer spectra are markedly different. Indeed, R-Fe and Fe 3 C were not observed as surface species, while ç-Fe-C is present at the surface and in the bulk in the same proportion independent of the temperature of preparation. This could show that most of the nanoparticles (detected as Fe 3 C and/or ç-Fe-C) that contribute to the formation of carbon nanotubes are located in the outer porosity of the material, as opposed to the topmost (ca. 5 nm) surface. For the higher reduction temperatures Tr of 990 °C and 1070 °C, all Fe and Fe-carbide particles formed during the reduction are distributed evenly in the bulk and the surface of the matrix grains. The integral low-energy electron Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopic study of a <b>powder</b> <b>oxidized</b> in air at 600 °C suggests that all Fe 3 C particles oxidize to R-Fe 2 O 3, while the R-Fe and/or ç-Fe-C are partly transformed to Fe 1 -xO and R-Fe 2 O 3, the latter phase forming a protecting layer that prevents total oxidation...|$|R
40|$|Beryllium is a favoured canning and/or moderating {{material}} in the proposed Australian High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor. With carbon dioxide as the most likely coolant a detailed knowledge of the corrosion of beryllium in this gas is required. Two separate investigations have proceeded simultaneously. First {{the effect of the}} following variables was studied; surface preparation of the specimen, temperature (100 — 725 ºC), pressure (0 — 280 p. s. i. g.), velocity, and impurity content of the gas. The influence of irradiation has not yet been studied. Autoclaves, thermobalances, and dynamic loops were used. The results were statistically analysed and kinetic data obtained. In all cases specimens with etched surfaces yielded approximately 25 — 30 per cent, greater weight gains than specimens with ground or polished surfaces. On extruded material no "breakaway" oxidation was encountered below 650 ºC in commercially dry gas (< 20 p. p. m. moisture). The rate of attack was to some extent affected by the pressure of the gas. Breakaway was only observed in one series of specimens at 650 ºC. In this particular case the gas pressure was 280 p. s. i. g. However, it seems that surface temperatures of beryllium cans made from extruded material should be maintained below 650 ºC in a reactor system using the commercially pure carbon dioxide as coolant. In the second approach a more basic study of the chemistry of the reaction was made as well as a detailed investigation into the variation caused by differences in the composition and fabrication of the metal. Spiral spring balances at atmospheric pressure were used. Extruded material made from beryllium <b>powder</b> <b>oxidized</b> in dry oxygen {{for a short period of}} time had greatly enhanced oxidation resistance when exposed to carbon dioxide. Some of the material exposed to wet carbon dioxide at 700 ºC and atmospheric pressure did not exhibit "breakaway" oxidation. The weight gains after 1, 000 hours exposure under these conditions were never greater than 0. 5 mg/cmZ, Some comparisons were made between the reaction rates of beryllium with oxygen and carbon dioxide. In certain circumstances dry oxygen gave breakaway oxidation whereas carbon dioxide did not...|$|R
40|$|Several {{projects}} {{are reported in}} this thesis. These projects deal with the processing of MgB(subscript 2) bulk samples and metal-sheathed wires or tapes. The main {{focus is on the}} fabrication aspects. The correlation between fabrication parameters and superconductivity properties is studied extensively. MgB(subscript 2) tapes and wires were prepared by the Powder-In-Tube (PIT) method. Ag, Cu and Fe were chosen to act as sheath materials. The interaction between the sheath materials and the MgB(subscript 2) core was studied. It was found that the MgB(subscript 2) superconducting tapes sheathed in copper exhibited a higher critical current density than Fe-sheathed tapes if prepared at temperatures below 850 (degrees) C. However, in term of the core composition and microstructure, the Fe sheathed tapes had the most pure MgB(subscript 2) phase only with a few micro cracks regardless of the heat treatment conditions. Increases in the overall mechanic deformation rate did not influence the J(subscript c) value of the Fe-sheathed tapes, whereas the J(subscript c) of the Cu-sheathed tapes grew by up to an order of magnitude with an increasing thickness reduction rate. The Ag-sheathed tapes usually showed very poor performance in term of the core microstructure, composition and critical current density, indicating that Ag is not appropriate for sheathing MgB(subscript 2). MgB(subscript 2) Fe-sheathed wires were made by both in-situ and ex-situ approaches. The wires made using the ex-situ method did not show such high I(subscript c) as those made by the in-situ method. In the case of 7 -filament wires, the adoption of an additional mechanic deformation in in-situ method can increase J(subscript c) by a factor of 2. 7 compared with the initial single filament wires. After further sintering, J(subscript c) can increase by 4. 3 times. However, in 19 filament and 49 filament wires, after second sintering, I(subscript c) was blocked by micro cracks and impurities. Effects on the wire induced by exposure to air were studied, with J(subscript c) decreasing by 20 % after aging in air for 4 months. The decrease was attributed to the oxidation of the remnant unreacted Mg oxidation after long time exposure to air. Different mechanical deformations were adopted to make Fe-sheathed MgB(subscript 2) wires. It was found that square rolling is more beneficial than drawing in term of improving I(subscript c). The mass density of the MgB(subscript 2) core was improved after further mechanical deformation, but the I(subscript c) did not increase accordingly. The cracks caused by mechanical deformation are very difficult to heal with post annealing. The formula (MgB[subscript 2]) (subscript 1 -x) : (Mg+ 2 B) (subscript x) was used to fabricate MgB(subscript 2) bulk (where x varies from 0 to 1). The critical current density {{as a function of the}} applied field is larger over the entire field range for samples with x? 0. An addition to the un-reacted Mg+ 2 B mixture to the MgB(subscript 2) powder enhances the transparency of the grain boundaries, introducing an MgB(subscript 2) matrix that is formed in-situ with embedded small MgB(subscript 2) ex-situ particles (for 0 ?x? 1). The grain boundaries are found to be responsible for the pinning of vortices. The larger x is, the smaller the amount of pinning boundaries, so that J(subscript c) (B) decays faster. MgB(subscript 2) was doped with nanometer size SiC particles. Si and C were introduced into the MgB(subscript 2) crystal lattice due to the counter balanced atomic sizes of Si and C, on average nearly coinciding with the size of B. T(subscript c) was reduced slightly by the doping. However, the doping was shown to strongly improve J(subscript c) (H) dependence at high applied fields. A pinning mechanism explaining this improvement is suggested, in which the main intra-granular ingredients are the dominant contribution of a larger number of dislocations induced by the substitution effect and a secondary contribution due to the nano-inclusions. The processing parameters for SiC doped MgB(subscript 2) wires have been studied systematically. The sintering temperature and time have strong effects on the T(subscript c) of the superconducting material. Higher temperatures and longer dwell times are beneficial to the T(subscript c) but not to the J(subscript c). Samples sintered at 750 (degrees) C and 850 (degrees) C exhibit higher J(subscript c) than those sintered at 680 (degrees) C and 950 (degrees) C. Sloww cooling has a beneficial effect on J(subscript c) field dependence. Uniaxial pressures (250 and 680 Mpa) improve the mass density but have a negligible effect on J(subscript c). The doping effects of C, Si and C+Si particles on J(subscript c) (H) have been studied. Nano-Si, C or (Si+C) dopant particles can improve J(subscript c) (H) performance at higher fields compared with undoped MgB(subscript 2). At 20 K and 4 T, J(subscript c) of the nano-Si doped sample reached 10 (superscript 4) A/cm(superscript 2) which is 100 times higher than that of the coarse-Si doped sample. The J(subscript c) of nano-C doped samples is 10 times higher than that of the coarse-C doped sample. The nano-(Si+C) co-doped samples show similar behaviour to the nano Si doped sample whatever the ratio of Si to C. Coarse C or Si doping decreased J(subscript c) at all fields and all temperatures measured. MgB(subscript 2) wires have been synthesised with different B and Mg powders as well as different Mg: B ratios. The effects of B powder on the J(subscript c) and T(subscript c) of this superconductor are noticeable. Impurities in the B powder can suppress both the T(subscript c) and J(subscript c). <b>Oxidizing</b> the Mg <b>powder</b> did not have a strong influence on T(subscript c), although the effects on J(subscript c) are significant when the Mg <b>powder</b> is severely <b>oxidized.</b> The influence of lightly <b>oxidized</b> Mg <b>powder</b> on both T(subscript c) and J(subscript c) is negligible. If the MgB(subscript 2) composition fluctuates from the normal stoichiometricity of 1 : 2, T(subscript c) decreases with excessive Mg composition. A minor Mg deficiency (x? 0. 1 in Mg[subscript 1 -x]B[subscript 2]) did not influence T(subscript c) strongly. J(subscript c) did not change dramatically with the variations in composition. A two-step sintering was used to synthesize MgB(subscript 2). However, although the mass density achieved in higher value, the critical current density dropped dramatically after the second grinding and sintering. The higher the first sintering temperature, the smaller the critical current density. The magnetic screening of the superconducting MgB(subscript 2) filaments in single and multifilament wires by means of an iron sheath has been directly visualized. The observations showed that the magnetic flux induced inside the iron sheath is higher than the applied field. The superconducting filaments exhibit an extended Meissner state and are free from the induced magnetic flux at least up to B = 0. 2 T for both kinds of wires. This was observed by the magneto-optical technique used. Global magnetization measurements showed that the screen effect could be dominant up to B= 1. 5 T and that it is much more effective in increasing fields than in decreasing fields.
