I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E

2500|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{said and}} Senator Kerry {{has said that}} you are going to do in order to get us out of the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of na√Øve? ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{an exhilarating}} flight, Carter arrives at last at the abode of the gods, but finds it empty. Finally a great {{procession}} arrives with much fanfare, {{led by a}} pharaoh-like man who explains to Carter that the gods of earth have seen the city of Carter's dreams and decided to make it their home, and have thus abandoned Kadath. The gods walk no more {{in the ways of}} gods, and have become instead mere denizens of the jewelled city Carter had glimpsed in his dreams. The pharaoh commands Carter to find this city, so that the natural order might be restored. [...] "It is not over unknown seas," [...] he says, [...] "but back over well-known years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes. For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen and loved in youth... These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love." [...] This mysterious man then reveals his identityhe is Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, the emissary of the Other Gods who dwell in the blackness of space.|$|E

6000|$|... "Poor Dean, {{she gets}} no thanks for {{reminding}} <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> forgotten. Next time she will leave your letters to their fate, {{and perhaps it}} will be as well, if they have such a bad effect upon your temper, Gerald." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth, when I got inside I felt as if I didn't care much about it. The place {{depressed}} me {{almost as much as}} it did you--it was ugly. And then I thought <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> said this morning as to whether we ought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Malchus, {{tell us your}} story," [...] Hannibal said. [...] "It seems {{strange to}} me that <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> said nought to your father or me <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> learned, and left us to take such {{measures}} as might seem fit to us, instead of taking the matter into your own hands." ...|$|R

60|$|When {{the morning}} came, your {{language}} and conduct showed {{that you were}} absolutely ignorant <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> said and done overnight. At the same time, Miss Verinder's language and conduct showed that she was resolved to say nothing (in mercy to you) on her side. If Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite chose to keep the Diamond, he might do so with perfect impunity. The Moonstone stood between him and ruin. He put the Moonstone into his pocket.|$|R
6000|$|Now, {{to talk of}} any {{ordinary}} bird swooping, and fluttering, and tugging, {{does not}} sound very tremendous; but, reader, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> witnessed {{the manner in which}} that enormous albatross conducted itself, <b>you</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> stared with amazement--oh, no! <b>You</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> gone home with your mouth as wide open as your eyes, and have given a gasping account <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen--by no means! <b>You</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> talked of feathered steam-engines, or of fabled rocs, or of winged elephants in the air--certainly not! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have acted}} very wisely and well, my son," [...] Hamilcar said, [...] "and Carthage owes you {{the life of}} our beloved Hannibal. You indeed {{reasoned}} with great wisdom and forethought. Had <b>you</b> informed us <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> discovered we should have taken precautions which would doubtless have effected the object; but they would probably have become known to the plotters, and the attempt would have been postponed and attempted some other time, and perhaps with success. <b>What</b> say <b>you,</b> Hannibal, <b>have</b> I not reason {{to be proud of}} this young son of mine?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "When {{we finally}} came there, {{and found that}} Miss Porter and her party had left, I {{commenced}} to realize something <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done for an utter stranger. Nor am I trying to repay you with money, Tarzan. It is that just at present you need money; were it sacrifice that I might offer you it were the same--my friendship must always be yours, because our tastes are similar, and I admire you. That I cannot command, but the money I can and shall." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Hampstead did {{not reach}} his house till nearly six on the {{following}} morning, and, having been travelling two nights out of three, allowed himself the indulgence of having his breakfast in bed.
