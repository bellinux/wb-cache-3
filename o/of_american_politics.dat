25|$|The Depression caused major {{political}} changes in America. Three {{years into the}} depression, President Herbert Hoover, widely blamed for {{not doing enough to}} combat the crisis, lost the election of 1932 to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a landslide.

25|$|McCain's 2006 rating by the Almanac <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Politics</b> (2008) on Social Policy is 46% conservative, 53% liberal. (2005: 64% conservative, 23% liberal.) McCain {{also has}} an 83% rating from the Christian Coalition, which {{indicates}} many socially conservative views such as voting yes on $75M for abstinence education, yes on recommending a Constitutional ban on flag desecration, and voting yes on memorial prayers and religious symbols at school. In 2013, the National Journal gave McCain a rating of 58% conservative and 41% liberal on Social Policy.|$|E
25|$|Finan (2003) says Smith is an underestimated {{symbol of}} the {{changing}} nature <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>politics</b> {{in the first half}} of the last century. He represented the rising ambitions of urban, industrial America at a time when the hegemony of rural, agrarian America was in decline, although many states had legislatures and congressional delegations biased toward rural areas because of lack of redistricting after censuses. Smith was connected to the hopes and aspirations of immigrants, especially Catholics and Jews from eastern and southern Europe. Smith was a devout Catholic, but his struggles against religious bigotry were often misinterpreted when he fought the religiously inspired Protestant morality imposed by prohibitionists.|$|E

The National Journal, as cited in the Almanac <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Politics</b> 2016, gave Ros-Lehtinen a composite score of 54% conservative and 46% liberal. Ros-Lehtinen was ranked as the 6th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Florida) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills {{by members of the}} opposite party).|$|E
25|$|McCain's 2006 rating by The Almanac <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>Politics</b> (2008) on Economic Policy is 64% conservative, 35% liberal (52% conservative, 47% {{liberal in}} 2005). McCain fleshed out the main points of his {{economic}} plan in an April 15, 2008 speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania. In summary, McCain would make the Bush tax cuts permanent instead of letting them expire, he would eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax in order to assist the middle-class, he would double the personal exemption for dependents, reduce the corporate tax rate, and offer a new research and development tax credit. At the same time, he pledges to eliminate pork-barrel spending, freeze nondefense discretionary spending {{for a year or}} more, and reduce Medicare growth. He is also opposed to extravagant salaries and severance deals of corporate CEOs. In 2013, the National Journal gave McCain an economic rating of 61% conservative and 38% liberal.|$|E
25|$|In {{international}} affairs, Roosevelt's presidency until 1938 {{reflected the}} isolationism that dominated practically all <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>politics</b> at the time. After 1938 he moved toward interventionism {{as the world}} hurtled toward war. Liberals split on foreign policy: many followed Roosevelt, while others like John L. Lewis of the CIO, historian Charles A. Beard and the Kennedy Family opposed him. However, Roosevelt added new conservative supporters, such as Republicans Henry Stimson, who became his Secretary of War in 1940, and Wendell Willkie, who worked closely with FDR after losing {{to him in the}} 1940s election. Anticipating the post-war period, Roosevelt strongly supported proposals to create a United Nations organization as a means of encouraging mutual cooperation to solve problems on the international stage. His commitment to internationalist ideals was in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson, except that FDR learned from Wilson's mistakes regarding the League of Nations; FDR included Republicans in shaping foreign policy, and insisted the U.S. have a veto at the UN.|$|E
