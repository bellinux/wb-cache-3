5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they are <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be {{in a state of}} grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E

This gave influence to Principle 18 (protection from medical abuse) of The Yogyakarta Principles.|$|E

After the blessing, the mezuzah is attached. Many people also touch a finger to the mezuzah as a way of showing respect to God in a simpler fashion than saying the prayer whenever they pass through the door.|$|E

40|$|Shame {{and guilt}} are often theorized to differ on a self versus {{behavior}} focus. However, we propose {{that this is}} not true when taking a group perspective. In our field study, 196 communal participants were confronted with historical ingroup immorality. Results showed that participants who were <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>understood</b> what happened in that time-period felt more guilt and shame than did those who were too young. Partly due to their ingroup anger, shame motivated an intention to change the ingroup self and behavior. In contrast, partly due to personal anger, guilt motivated an intention to change personal self and behavior. This suggests that the distinction between shame and guilt are not as clear-cut as previous research have assumed...|$|R
5000|$|The Moorside {{received}} {{criticism from}} the family of Shannon Matthews. Matthews' grandmother told the Daily Mail: [...] "Shannon deserves to live her life in peace. … What happened to her was a trauma, a tragedy. It is sick and disgusting that it is being turned into a TV show. It isn't entertainment. … If she sees it, Shannon is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> now <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that it is about her. … How is that fair? It will upset her. They shouldn't be dragging up the past and what happened. …". Karen Matthews' cousin told Good Morning Britain that the series [...] "shouldn't go out because it's going to bring everything back. Family members will get grief like they {{have done in the}} past, I don't think it should go ahead. …". A spokesperson for BBC One said: [...] "This drama is not focused on Shannon Matthews herself. Her abduction is not portrayed, nor are her experiences during the time she was missing. The drama {{tells the story of the}} women who led the campaign to find her." ...|$|R
25|$|Driving {{through the}} mist, David finds his house {{destroyed}} {{and his wife}} dead. Devastated, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas, the group decides {{there is no point}} in going on. David shoots the others (with their consent, except for his son who is not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand)</b> rather than have them endure horrifying deaths. When David is done killing all of them, he is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and waits to be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the U.S. Army has arrived, managed to close the portal, and are in the process of exterminating the creatures. David also witnesses rescued survivors, and restoring order. Among the survivors is the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, completely unscathed and having rescued her two children. David realizes that his group was only moments away from being rescued, aware now that their deaths were premature and in vain, and drops to his knees screaming.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the review}} {{aggregator}} Metacritic, the film {{had an average}} score of 25 out of 100, based on 32 reviews from professional critics. At Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 122 reviews. The film earned generally negative reviews from movie critics, although some praised Lopez's performance. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Lopez [...] "holds the screen in a star performance that {{has less to do}} with acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself", while commenting that its preview had [...] "audience gasping" [...] and [...] "Enough does a better job than most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming your worst fears". On the other hand, Alice King of Entertainment Weekly described the film's plot as [...] "arduously nonsensical" [...] and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: [...] "All this to protect a helium-voiced little girl with whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it's as if she's handling garbage rather than a small child." [...] A writer from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, noting that the film doesn't [...] "utilize Slim's old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim's real and adopted fathers" [...] while it [...] "uses the tiresome old [...] "kid" [...] cliché. Gracie is, as always, just <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story." [...] However, the writer did praise Lopez in the end sequence, [...] "By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as I could have been, actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her." [...] Additionally, LaSalle felt that [...] "It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now", stating that [...] "it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.|$|E

6000|$|To own the truth, my {{attachment}} for Rupert had materially lessened {{with the}} falling off of my respect. He had manifested so much selfishness during the voyage--had shirked so much duty, {{most of which}} had fallen on poor Neb--and had been so little of the man, in practice, whom he used so well to describe with his tongue--that I could no longer shut my eyes {{to some of his}} deficiencies of character. I still liked him; but it was from habit, and perhaps because he was my guardian's son, and Lucy's brother. Then I could not conceal from myself that Rupert was not, in a rigid sense, a lad of truth. He coloured, exaggerated, glossed over and embellished, if he did not absolutely invent. I was not <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> then <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that most of the statements that float about the world are nothing but truths distorted, and that nothing is more rare than unadulterated fact; that truths and lies travel in company, as described by Pope in his Temple of Fame, until-- ...|$|R
60|$|This {{particular}} conversation, one of many, had, as it happened, important {{results on}} the lives of these two young creatures. Isobel, in whom the love of Truth, however ugly it might be and however destructive of hope, faith, charity and all the virtues, was a burning, inbred passion, took to the secret study of theology in order to find out why Godfrey was so convinced as to the teachings of the Bible. She was not <b>old</b> or mellowed <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that the real reason must be discovered, not in the letter but in the spirit, that is in the esoteric meaning of the sayings as to receiving the Kingdom of Heaven like a child and the necessity of being born again. Therefore with a fierce intensity, thrusting aside the spirit and its promptings which perhaps are shadows of the only real truths, she wrestled with the letter. She read the Divines, also much of the Higher Criticism, the lives of Saints, the Sacred Books themselves and many other things, only to arise bewildered, and to a great extent unbelieving.|$|R
