After working in Paris for Royale Optique and Alain Mikli, Salaun landed in New York City to manage Mikli’s first New York store. After {{falling in love with}} New York City she decided to forego launching Mikli’s first store in Japan to open her own boutique in her favorite neighborhood, opening the first Selima Optique in 1993 on the corner of Wooster and Broome in Soho. The Optique began fulfilling custom orders with a French atelier when a friend (Hubert Kriegel of the Timeless Ride) asked if Selima could make him a “funkier” version of the iconic “Le Corbusier” frame. After Barney’s president bought herself a few of Selima’s customs, the store asked to carry a full Selima Optique collection and, with some wholesale guidance from Barneys21, the first official Selima Optique brand collection was produced and sold through a first-of-its-kind shop-in-shop at Barneys New York in 19969.Since 1996 the company has expanded with retail locations and wholesale accounts across the world and into different industries as well. In the 2000s there was Selima’s trendy Soho lingerie store “Le Corset,” vintage French-inspired luxury lingerie shopped by New Yorkers and worn by Baby Spice in the Rolling Stone Magazine. And in 2009 there was “Hats by Selima Atelier,” a collection of eclectic hats created with partner Virginie Promeyrat and notably shopped by Madonna. Now, Selima Optique has retail locations in New York6, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Paris, France and its collection is wholesaled across the globe. The brand has collaborated with the likes of Jack Spade and J.Crew, and more recently with NBA MVP Russell Westbrook, style icon Iris Apfel, and New York’s Neue Galerie [...] Personally, Selima Salaun has helped mentor designers like Darylynn and Coco & Breezy9 while sitting on the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s board and recently helping found the C.F.D.A.’s latest branch: the Eyewear Designers of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (efCFDA). Popular with celebrities and tastemakers, Selima’s clients include Anne Hathaway, Lady Gaga, and Ryan Gosling — and client-turned-friend John Turturro even credits her as the inspiration for the character played by Sofia Vergara in his film “Fading Gigolo9.” ...|$|E

40|$|This {{book had}} to be written. Congratulations to British {{dispensing}} optician Timothy Bowden for his dogged determination in researching, writing and essentially self-publishing this hefty tome. How does one tackle the monumental task of tracking the complex history {{of the development of}} the contact lens, from the production of the first human artificial glass eyes by Ludwig Müller-Uri in Germany in 1835 to the sophisticated, high-technology, multi-billion dollar contact lens industry of today? The superficial answer may seem simple: do it chronologically, but it is much more difficult than that. Multiple contemporaneous and seemingly unconnected events often converged to result in ideas that elevated contact lens technology to the next level and many developments revolved around the deliberate and sometimes accidental activities of a long list of enthusiasts, inventors, entrepreneurs, businessmen, technicians, scientists, engineers, polymer scientists, <b>opticians,</b> <b>optometrists</b> and ophthalmologists...|$|R

40|$|Objective. This study {{estimates}} {{the distribution of}} visual health professionals (VHP) in South America, while performing a comparison between {{countries in the region}} and against statistics from Spain and the United States. An analysis of coverage and geographic distribution will reveal accessibility to vision care. Background. The World Health Organization has prioritized the elimination of avoidable blindness by the year 2020 and has targeted human resource development as a strategy. Most government databases in Latin America do not currently track VHP. Methods. Data collection consisted of 152 key informant interviews with identified experts in the public and private sector. The resulting analysis yielded an estimation of the number of professionals and their regional distribution per country by category—optometrists and opticians, ophthalmologists, and other VHP. Results. An estimated 53, 582 visual health professionals (19, 004 ophthalmologists, and 32, 361 <b>opticians,</b> <b>optometrists</b> and other professionals) show an imbalanced geographic distribution that is disproportional to the distribution of the population. Regional coverage density averages 15 per 100, 000. Conclusion. Across all VHP categories, there is lack of adequate eye care human resources. Overall, the gap between the private sector and the public sector leaves many zones without coverage, and, therefore, in a situation of social exclusion in visual health. Grants.

50|$|There {{remains to}} this day stark {{controversy}} over whether non-Irlen-certified Meares-Irlen syndrome and the original Irlen syndrome are the same condition. Irlen syndrome, for example, seems to include a broader array of symptoms, including severe variants of the core condition. Basic testing for scotopic sensitivity was tried by <b>optometrists,</b> <b>opticians,</b> and orthoptists in UK hospitals, and by <b>optometrists</b> and <b>opticians</b> in private practice employing a technique that used the Intuitive Colorimeter, developed under Medical Research Council license. An alternative approach to correct Irlen syndrome was tried by Orthoscopics franchise in the UK, with wide colour coverage and tints manufactured by Hoyato match. Other commercial organisations have produced sets of therapeutic tints, although most have not received scientific evaluation.|$|R

To ascertain if parents {{are familiar with}} current recommendations on pediatric vision screening and to assess {{their knowledge of the}} roles that pediatricians, ophthalmologists and optometrists have in this screening process. Methods. A survey was targeted at parents to determine what the general public understands regarding vision screening. Results. The survey was conducted from January–May 2010. One hundred fifty six persons responded. Over one-third did not know the difference between eye care specialists. Many believed <b>opticians</b> and <b>optometrists</b> receive medical school training. Over forty percent incorrectly identified the recommended visual acuity testing age. A large discrepancy existed regarding who should perform pediatric eye exams. Most agreed a failed screening warranted follow-up, but there was not a uniform opinion as to when to seek care. The majority of respondents understood amblyopia should be treated at least before age ten; although nine percent believed amblyopia could be treated at any age. Discussion. There is a significant lack of understanding of the current screening recommendations, difference between eye care professionals, and the importance of early treatment of amblyopia. Conclusions. Many parents do not understand the potential detrimental consequences of delayed care in the event their child fails a vision screening. 1...|$|R
40|$|Every {{year since}} 2001, we have {{reported}} data from an international survey of contact lens prescribing in Contact Lens Spectrum. This work, which first {{started in the}} United Kingdom, has now recorded information about more than 250, 000 contact lens fits in 54 countries. Our approach is simple. We ask contact lens prescribers (<b>optometrists,</b> <b>opticians,</b> or ophthalmologists, depending on the country) to record information about the first 10 contact lens fits that they perform {{after the start of}} the survey period each year. Each fit is then weighted to reflect the volume of fits performed by each practitioner. Information is collated at our two survey offices in Manchester, United Kingdom and Waterloo, Canada. For this report of contact lens prescribing in 2013, we report data for 21, 673 lens fits in 31 markets around the world...|$|R

In 2011, we captured information about 22, 362 fits in 29 countries. Lens Wearer Demographics Women continue to represent the majority of patients attending for contact lens fitting (Table 1). Sixty-seven percent of fits were to women, with minimal variations in this measure between countries, ranging from 56 percent in Slovenia to 77 percent in Taiwan (Figure 1). For both sexes across all nations, the average age at fitting was 31. 2 years, ranging from 23 years in Nepal to 37 years in Sweden. In a number of mature contact lens markets, the mean fitting age is edging toward 40 years. For example, in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Sweden, Australia and Denmark, the average age is greater than 35 years. The oldest patient reported this year was a 100 -year-old man, who was fitted with extended-wear soft lenses...|$|R
40|$|A Federal Trade Commission {{survey of}} contact lens wearers {{is used to}} {{estimate}} a multinomial logit-least-squares model of the joint determination of provider choice and quality of care in the contact lens industry. The effect of personal and industry characteristics on a consumer's choice among three types of providers [...] <b>opticians,</b> ophthalmologists, and <b>optometrists</b> [...] is estimated via multinomial logit. The regression model {{of the quality of}} care has two features that distinguish it from previous work in the area. First, it uses an outcome rather than a structural or process measure of quality. Quality is measured as an index of the presence of seven potentially pathological eye conditions caused by poorly fitted lenses. Second, the model controls for possible selection bias that may arise {{from the fact that the}} sample observations on quality are generated by consumers' nonrandom choices of providers. The multinomial logit estimates of provider choice indicate that professional regulations limiting the commercial practices of optometrists shift demand for contact lens services away from optometrists toward ophthalmologists. Further, consumers are more likely to have their lenses fitted by opticians in states that require the licensing of opticians. The regression analysis of variations in quality across provider types shows a strong positive selection bias in the estimate of the quality of care received by consumers of ophthalmologists' services. Failure to control for this selection bias results in an overestimate of the quality of care provided by ophthalmologists...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes is {{a common}} {{condition}} affecting around 69, 000 people in Northern Ireland. One of the possible complications of diabetes is a condition called diabetic retinopathy, which can cause sight loss and blindness. Retinopathy causes damage to the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the retina, the tissues {{in the back of}} the eye that deal with light. This can seriously affect vision. Research shows that if retinopathy is identified early, for example through retinal screening, and treated appropriately, blindness can be prevented in the majority of people with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2. Screening programmeIn Northern Ireland, a diabetic retinopathy screening programme (DRSP), run by the Public Health Agency, has been put in place to screen all eligible people with diabetes aged 12 years and over. Dr Bernadette Cullen, Consultant in Public Health Medicine, PHA, said: "Screening detects problems early and allows appropriate treatment to be offered. It is vital that everyone with diabetes attends diabetic retinopathy screening when it is offered. Early detection of potential problems offers a very real opportunity to intervene and, with appropriate treatment, can prevent blindness in the majority of those at risk. "The screening testThe screening test involves photographs being taken of the back of each eye, using a special camera. The test is painless and takes about 15 minutes. If the person is over 50 years of age, they will need to have drops put in their eyes about 15 minutes before the test to dilate their pupils. The photographs are sent to the regional screening centre for analysis by trained graders. Results will show whether patients require further referral for assessment or treatment by hospital eye services (HES). If this is not required, screening will be offered again the following year. GPs are informed of all results and if the patient is under the care of a diabetologist, they too will be informed. Patients are informed of results by their GP and if they need an urgent referral, protocols are in place to ensure this happens. Many people with diabetes attend their <b>optometrist</b> (<b>optician)</b> on a regular basis to have a sight test for glasses. It is important they continue to do this - this test is free to people with diabetes. It is also vital that people with diabetes attend for diabetic retinopathy screening when invited, regardless of how or where their diabetes is treated, or whether they visit a hospital consultant/GP for their diabetic care. Patients are invited to screening via their GP practice. An information leaflet to help patients make an informed decision to attend for screening is also sent.
