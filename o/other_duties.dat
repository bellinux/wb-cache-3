As the only aviation brigade in the theater, the brigade provided air support for all U.S. Army units operating in the country. The brigade's mission at that time focused on close air support, medevac missions, and <b>other</b> <b>duties</b> involving combat with Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the country. The brigade returned to Fort Drum in 2004.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, Election Day for Indianapolis {{political}} offices, {{bands of}} pro-union men roved {{the city and}} vandalized property, burnt streetcars, harassed public officials, and effectively shut down {{much of the city}} in the worst violence of the strike. Sheriff Porttens again ordered the police to protect the streetcars, but another twenty-nine officers resigned; because the force was so short on men, the sheriff refused their resignation and put them on <b>other</b> <b>duties.</b>|$|E

5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among <b>other</b> <b>duties.</b>|$|E

This appointment was made on the recommendation of Lord Mountbatten, whose nephew Philip Mountbatten was now the Duke of Edinburgh. As such, Browning became the head of the Princess' personal staff. He also juggled <b>other</b> <b>duties.</b> In 1948 he was involved with the 1948 Summer Olympics as Deputy Chairman of the British Olympic Association, and commandant of the British team.

5|$|The colony's most {{powerful}} executive was its Governor, who was originally {{elected by the}} freemen but was later appointed by the General Court in an annual election. The General Court also elected seven Assistants to form a cabinet to assist the governor.

They were responsible for publishing announcements, performing land surveys, carrying out executions, and a host of <b>other</b> <b>duties.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{may have}} weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from <b>other</b> <b>duties,</b> {{but it was}} not enough to drive him from office. Perhaps because {{there was no one to}} replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E

He was {{commander}} of the Strategic Air Command's Fifteenth Air Force at Colorado Springs, Colorado, from 1 May 1947 to 2 August 1948, with the rank of major general from 27 October 1947. The Air Force returned to England {{for the first time}} since World War II when Johnson organized the 3rd Air Division there on 20 August 1948.

5|$|Midshipmen were {{expected}} {{to work on the}} ship, but were also expected to learn navigation and seamanship. They {{were expected}} to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, <b>other</b> <b>duties</b> included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising gun batteries, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen {{were expected to}} keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation. At Princeton University, a {{group led by}} Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a klystron, {{they were able to}} separate isotopes using high-voltage electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to <b>other</b> <b>duties.</b> At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Patton led U.S. {{troops into}} the Mediterranean theater with an {{invasion}} of Casablanca during Operation Torch in 1942, where he later established himself as an effective commander through his rapid rehabilitation of the demoralized U.S. II Corps.

There he was embroiled in controversy after he slapped two shell-shocked soldiers under his command, and was temporarily removed from battlefield command for <b>other</b> <b>duties</b> such as participating in Operation Fortitude's disinformation campaign for Operation Overlord. Patton returned to command the Third Army following the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, where he led a highly successful rapid armored drive across France.
