5|$|At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in {{a heavily}} weaponized version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II armor. Stark {{arrives in the}} Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko {{remotely}} takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard Happy Hogan go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko seemingly commits suicide by blowing up his suit.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, Carpender was {{replaced}} by Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, who ordered the final deactivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 6 in all combat commands. Christie abided by the order, commencing on 20 January 1944, but was still convinced the Mark 6 had potential. He had Commanders Chester Nimitz, Jr. and James McCallum continue technical studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 6 and to develop improvements, but these revised exploders were just as unreliable as the earlier versions.|$|E

5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{authority}} {{for this type}} of registration is set forth in the Lanham Act, which permits concurrent use registration where the concurrent use applicant made a good-faith adoption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> prior to the registrant filing an application for registration.

5|$|The statute {{essentially}} codifies the Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine, {{established by}} the United States Supreme Court in two cases decided in 1916 and 1918.

5|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the war began, {{submarine}} captains indicated {{there were}} problems with the Mark 14 torpedo and the influence feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 6 exploder. Torpedoes would fail to explode, or explode prematurely. Despite these reports, Christie was not fully aware {{of the impact of the}} situation, because his S-boats used the older Mark 10 torpedo, with a contact-only pistol. Christie acknowledged Mark 14s were running deeper than set, but attributed the failures to poor maintenance and errors on the part of the captain and crew. He was convinced the Mark 6 was satisfactory, and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it. In November 1942, Christie was ordered to return to Newport as Inspector of Ordnance at the Torpedo Station. Newport had become a bottleneck for torpedo manufacture, and the Bureau of Ordnance wanted to advance development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 18 electric torpedo. Christie resisted leaving his command at Brisbane, but was considered of more use to resolve the torpedo issue. He was replaced by Captain James Fife. For his service at Brisbane, Christie was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

5|$|By November 1942, North Carolina had an {{additional}} Mark 4 and a SG surface search radar added. The normal battleship configuration was present aboard North Carolina in April 1944, with SK and SG radars (air and surface search, respectively), a backup SG, and Mark 8s to direct its main battery. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 4s remained for the secondary battery, {{and one of}} the older Mark 3s was still present, possibly as a backup for the Mark 8s. An SK-2 dish replaced the older SK radar and Mark 12s and 22s superseded the Mark 4s in September of that year. Aside from never receiving an SK-2, Washington was the recipient of similar upgrades.|$|E

George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested Bond & the Moonraker, The Moonraker Scare and The Moonraker Plan, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested Hell is Here; the final choice of Moonraker was a suggestion by Wren Howard.|$|E

The laboratory's ordnance engineering division, known as Z Division, after its first director, Jerrold R. Zacharias, was split between Los Alamos and Sandia. Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the mechanical and electrical reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 3 Fat Man bomb, but this work was disrupted by the Crossroads tests.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{meeting the needs}} of the British forces, Project E affected the design and development of British nuclear weapons. Interim designs like Violet Club were no longer required, as Project E weapons could do the job pending the development of a British weapon. The British designers were particularly impressed by the Mark 28, which was not only lighter than the British Green Grass warhead used in Yellow Sun, but remarkably more economical in its use of expensive fissile material. An Anglicised version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> 28 was developed, known as Red Snow, and a Yellow Sun Mark 2 using Red Snow cost £500,000 compared with £1,200,000 for the Mark 1 with Green Grass.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three decades, Kilburn led the {{development}} of a succession of innovative Manchester computers. The first, commenced in 1951, was a development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> I known as the megacycle machine or Meg, that replaced the vacuum tube diodes with solid state ones. This permitted an order of magnitude increase in the clock rate. To add further speed, Kilburn provided for 10-bit parallel CRT memory. It {{was also one of the}} first computers, if not the first, to have floating point arithmetic. Meg operated for the first time in 1954, and nineteen were sold by Ferranti, six of them to customers overseas.|$|E

5|$|The Mark II {{telescope}} once constructed {{was also}} used as an interferometer with the Lovell telescope. This has a baseline of 425 m (1,394ft) (meaning that it can synthesize a telescope with 425 m diameter), giving it a resolution of around 0.5 arcminutes. This telescope pair {{has been used to}} carry out survey work, and to determine the positions of faint radio objects. Also, one of the drivers behind the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> III was to use it as an interferometer with the Mark I to carry out a survey of radio sources.|$|E

On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna {{on the left is}} for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.|$|E
