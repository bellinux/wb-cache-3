5|$|Angle {{returned}} to in-ring action on TNA's debut on Destination America on January 7, 2015, {{when he stopped}} a brawl, but started a street fight against MVP. On January 31, 2015 (aired March 20), Angle defeated Lashley to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for a record sixth time. He lost to Eric Young on May 1, at Hardcore Justice, in a stretcher match with the title not on the line. He successfully retained his title against Lashley <b>once</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> again against both Lashley and Eric Young. On May 8, Angle defeated Young to retain his title with Bully Ray as the special referee. On the May 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, he successfully retained his title once again against Eric Young, this time in a I Quit match. At Destination X, Angle defeated Rockstar Spud, who gave up the X Division Championship in order to challenge for the title. Later that night, Angle again successfully defended his title, this time against Austin Aries, who cashed in his Feast or Fired contract to allow him a title match. On the June 25, 2015 taping of Impact Wrestling (aired July 1), Angle lost the championship to Ethan Carter III. On the July 8 episode of Impact Wrestling, Angle faced Carter in a rematch in a losing effort.|$|E

For some models this element is a plastic test strip with a small spot impregnated with glucose oxidase and other components. Each strip is used <b>once</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> discarded. Instead of strips, some models use discs, drums, or cartridges that contain the consumable material for multiple tests.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in Edinburgh on 30 January 1746, he at once {{proceeded}} {{in search}} of Charles. He made a detour to Aberdeen, where he spent some time training the well-equipped forces now under his command for {{the next stage of}} the conflict in which they were about to engage. He trained his troops to hold their fire until the enemy came within effective firing range, fire <b>once,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> bayonet the man to the right thereby catching the enemy under their lifted sword arm.|$|E

In his second match, against Sussex, he made an unbeaten 50 in Gloucestershire's follow-on, helping his county to draw the match. In nine other innings for Gloucestershire in the 1889, 1890 and 1891 seasons, however, he reached double figures only <b>once,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> made only 12.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates <b>once</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the circuit breaker was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current, typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates <b>once</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse, as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E

25|$|A {{cone crusher}} {{is similar in}} {{operation}} to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber {{and more of a}} parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken <b>once,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fall to a lower position (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again. This process continues until the pieces are small enough to fall through the narrow opening {{at the bottom of the}} crusher.|$|E
25|$|Crosby had an {{interest}} in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach. From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. Although he was passionate about his team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to the game on the radio. Crosby had the NBC telecast of the game recorded on kinescope. The game {{was one of the most}} famous in baseball history, capped off by Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run. He apparently viewed the complete film just <b>once,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009. The restored broadcast was shown on MLB Network in December 2010.|$|E
25|$|When a {{young worker}} leaves the nest {{for the first}} time, it will {{generally}} make 2 to 3 'orientation flights' in order to familiarize itself with {{the entrance to the}} colony amidst the surrounding landscape. In the first flight, the worker flies approximately 25nbsp&cm out of the nest at <b>once</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> quickly turns around to face the entrance. The wasp slowly flies {{back and forth to the}} nest several times, surveying an angle that is approximately 90 degrees, while facing the entrance. Then, the wasp promptly returns to the nest, the whole flight lasting only about one minute or less. Soon after returning from the first flight, the wasp will leave the nest in a similar fashion, but this time ventures out approximately 15 to 20 meters and covers an angle of approximately 280 degrees. Once 2 meters away, V. rufa will fly back and forth repeatedly in a figure-eight pattern, while facing the entrance to the nest. In some cases, after this second flight the wasp will have gathered all of the knowledge necessary to fly off. Other wasps must make a third orientation flight that is like the second one. At first, the worker may miss the entrance to the nest many times; however, after six to twelve trips, the wasp gains its bearings; flights become longer, and reentry into the colony becomes more precise.|$|E

25|$|The first tournaments of the Australasian Championships {{suffered}} from the competition of the other Australasian tournaments. Before 1905, all Australian states and New Zealand had their own championships, the first organised in 1880 in Melbourne and called the Championship of the Colony of Victoria (later the Championship of Victoria). In those years, the best two players– Australian Norman Brookes (whose name is now written on the men's singles cup) and New Zealander Anthony Wilding– almost did not play this tournament. Brookes came once and won in 1911, and Wilding entered and won the competition twice (1906 and 1909). Their meetings in the Victorian Championships (or at Wimbledon) helped {{to determine the best}} Australasian players. Even when the Australasian Championships were held in Hastings, New Zealand, in 1912, Wilding, though three times Wimbledon champion, did not come back to his home country. It was a recurring problem for all players of the era. Brookes went to Europe only three times, where he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round <b>once</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> won Wimbledon twice. Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, William Larned, Maurice McLoughlin, Beals Wright, Bill Johnston, Bill Tilden, René Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer, Ted Schroeder, Pancho Gonzales, Budge Patty, and others, while Brookes, Ellsworth Vines, Jaroslav Drobný, came just once. Even in the 1960s and 1970s, when travel was less difficult, leading players such as Manuel Santana, Jan Kodeš, Manuel Orantes, Ilie Năstase (who only came once, when 35 years old) and Björn Borg came rarely or not at all.|$|E

However, the distorted sound of an overdriven vacuum tube amplifier can be a desirable sound, {{to the extent that}} modern Leslie simulators have an explicit [...] "overdrive" [...] setting.|$|E

500|$|The Katyusha {{multiple}} {{rocket launcher}} (...) {{is a type of}} rocket artillery first built and fielded by the Soviet Union in World War II. Multiple rocket launchers such as these deliver explosives to a target area more quickly than conventional artillery, but with lower accuracy and requiring a longer time to reload. They are fragile compared to artillery guns, but are inexpensive, easy to produce, and usable on any chassis. The Katyushas of World War II, the first self-propelled artillery mass-produced by the Soviet Union, were usually mounted on ordinary trucks. This mobility gave the Katyusha, and other self-propelled artillery, another advantage: being able to deliver a large blow all at <b>once,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> move before being located and attacked with counter-battery fire.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} notable events {{occurred}} on Midway when the pilot of a VNAF Cessna O-1 dropped {{a note on the}} deck of the carrier. The note read [...] "Can you move these helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more, we have enough time to move. Please rescue me. Major Buang, Wife and 5 child." [...] Midways CO, Captain L.C. Chambers ordered the flight deck crew to clear the landing area; in the process an estimated US$10 million worth of UH-1 Huey helicopters were pushed overboard into the South China Sea. Once the deck was clear Major Buang approached the deck, bounced <b>once</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> touched down and taxied to a halt with room to spare. Major Buang became the first VNAF fixed-wing pilot to ever land on a carrier. A second Cessna O-1 was also recovered by the USS Midway that afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite a [...] "potentially gimmicky tone", the episode provided [...] "a {{lot of fun}} moments along with a little emotional content as well. The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly, and that occurred here; it avoided becoming too syrupy and featured just enough emotion to make an impact. It also contained some great bits, like Bart and Lisa’s karaoke performance of the 'Theme from Shaft'. It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess's [...] "This is our karaoke bar. Now it is empty, but {{soon it will be}} hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Again, a playful dig at racial stereotypes. Homer comes over as a reasonable man who wants to live his last day in style, and the closing twist is easily as good as the farewells leading up to it." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said that the episode is [...] "rich with sentimentality and Homer's expression of love for his family as he fears that his time is up." [...] He also commented that while all of the chalkboard gags on the show are [...] "funny", this episode [...] "features a true gem" [...] as Bart writes [...] "I will not cut corners" [...] <b>once</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> puts ditto marks below. Ed Potton of The Times wrote: [...] "The writers offer black humour by the bucketload, but the grim reality of Homer's fate is never in doubt; his eventual collapse is deeply affecting. A great example of [...] fierce satire being offset by a potent emotional core." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said {{the first half of the}} episode has [...] "fun skewering Japanese restaurants and such, while the second half is reasonably successful at emphasizing character while sustaining the comedy." ...|$|E
