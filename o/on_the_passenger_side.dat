5|$|In May 2011, all 24,091 C3 Picassos in the UK were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} modification, following complaints and {{an investigation by}} BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog into brakes that could be activated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the right-hand drive vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side.</b> This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
25|$|An air bag is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side,</b> the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until {{he was able to}} obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler.|$|E
50|$|As in {{previous}} years, the Top 40 Qualifying cars eligible to start, must have flashing lights installed (for better {{identification of the}} Top 40 competitors) behind <b>the</b> windscreen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger’s</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each car is {{numbered}} (1 to 100), with a 348 Serie Speciale plate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> door-post.In 1994, {{a further}} 15 units were produced, {{bringing the total}} production of this limited edition to 115.|$|R
5000|$|Options {{available}} at extra cost included velour carpeting, grab handles for <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> in <b>the</b> back, whitewall tires, a two tone paint finish {{and even a}} [...] "make-up mirror" [...] cleverly incorporated into <b>the</b> sun-visor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
25|$|Mounting base: Attaches the {{mounting}} {{system to the}} vehicle. This element is commonly composed of rugged materials such as steel. Tunnel Mounts attach to the raised floor area (drive shaft tunnel) between the driver and passenger. Passenger Side Mounts attach to floor <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle. Console mounting brackets attach to an existing vehicle center console. Trunk Mounts provide mounting options for use inside car trunks.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield wiper <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions permit rear {{fog lamps}} to be {{installed}} either singly or in pairs. If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog lamp. In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle, positionally symmetrical with the rear fog. If two {{rear fog lamps}} are fitted, they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's centreline.|$|E
50|$|The interior, {{like the}} {{exterior}} and chassis, is made entirely of carbon fiber. There are four screens: one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's side of <b>the</b> dashboard, one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> dashboard, one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center console, and one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Cars sold from 1952 also {{featured}} a fuel-based passenger cabin heater. In order to ignite the heater {{it was necessary}} first to open a small tap in the engine bay, after which the flow of hot air could be regulated using a control in <b>the</b> footwell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|In his confession, Beach {{alleged that}} he choked Nees, but an autopsy found no {{indication}} of strangulation. Beach also claimed that after the murder, he wiped his fingerprints from the truck, but many fingerprints, four palm prints and one bloody palm print were found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> truck, none of which belonged to Nees or Beach. Finally, Beach said that Nees tried {{to escape from the}} driver’s side door, but the bloody palm print was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger’s</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
25|$|The third-generation RX comes {{standard}} with a twin-chamber {{front passenger}} airbags, side torso airbags {{for the front}} row, side curtain airbags for front and rear rows, and knee airbags for the front row. Active headrests become standard to help reduce whiplash injuries. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill Assist Control (HAC) which helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on inclines are standard while a more advanced Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system is optional. VDIM {{is designed to be}} more subtle and less intrusive in performance than VSC alone, VDIM can also engage prior to an actual skid taking place acting as a preventative measure. The Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) remains optional, while a new bi-xenon optional Intelligent Highbeam feature is added, this system can dim the high-beams automatically whenever traffic is detected. Other optional safety features include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) and a Head-up Display (HUD) which helps the driver keep attention on the road ahead by displaying navigation, speed, and audio information on the windshield; the HUD uses high-intensity LEDs displaying high contrast white figures on the windshield allowing it to be read in direct sunlight. The optional navigation system offers a backup camera and a Wide-View Side Monitor utilizes a camera <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> view mirror to help eliminate blind spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> at low speeds, this system does not include the 180° wide-angle front camera found in the LX 570. To further help improve visibility, water-repellent glass is used on the front doors.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, Labonte {{announced}} the GEICO 500 {{is to be}} his 890th and final start. To commemorate the occasion, Go Fas Racing designed a car split into three designs: the Kellogg's design from his 1996 title run on the driver side, the Piedmont Airlines design from his 1984 championship year <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side,</b> and the Duck Industries design from his early career in the center. However, NASCAR did not allow the scheme, due to a rule stating cars must have the same colors on both the driver side and passenger {{side of the car}} for safety reasons; the team would switch to the former design, while being allowed to retain the center. Labonte qualified ninth, but because of the unapproved paint scheme, was forced to start {{at the tail end of}} the field. He would finish in thirty-third place, one lap down in his final race.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{there was}} a special limited release of the FC called Infini with only 600 made for each year. Some special noted {{features}} for all Infini series are: infini logo on the back, upgraded suspension, upgraded ECU, higher horsepower, lightened weight, 15-inch BBS aluminum alloy wheels, Infini logo steering wheel, aero bumper kits, bronze colored window glass, floor bar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side,</b> aluminum bonnet with scoop, flare and holder. The car was thought as the pinnacle of the RX-7 series (until the FD came out). The Infini IV came with other special items such as black bucket seats, 16-inch BBS wheels, Knee pads, {{and all the other}} items mentioned before. There are differing years for the Infini, which noted the series. Series I was introduced in 1987, Series II was introduced in 1988, Series III was introduced in 1990, and Series IV was introduced in 1991. Series I and II came in White or Black, Series III came in Forest Green only, and Series IV came in Forest Green or Noble Green. There are only minor differences between the series, the biggest change which was from the Series II being an S4 (1985–1988) and the Series III and IV being an S5 (1989–1992).|$|E
5000|$|On 7 August 2006, Hüseyin Başbilen, a 31-year-old {{mechanical}} engineer working {{for ten years}} at Aselsan as a production engineer, {{was found dead in}} his car at Pursaklar, Ankara. His left wrist and throat were cut, his head was under <b>the</b> glove compartment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> and his feet were up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's seat. In 2009, a court ruled that it was suicide. In 2011, the case was reopened as part of the [...] "Ergenekon" [...] investigation.|$|R
50|$|In December 2012, Millennium Luxury Coaches {{announced}} they had successfully relocated the {{diesel exhaust fluid}} inlet to the driver's side of the coach. It had previously been located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side,</b> which presented a problem at filling stations because of the pump being located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's side. This stirred controversy as skeptics noted it brought warranty concerns with Prevost. Prevost engineers and management visited Millennium's facility to view the modifications, giving the modifications a thumbs up and eliminating warranty concerns.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} featured raised seating in {{the second}} row, a hard point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger’s</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> center console to provide support {{for a range of}} optional accessories (e.g., an optional shopping bag holder), rear-seat table, waste basket and cargo net integrated into the rear seat backs. Standard interior features included a coat hook integrated into the <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> front <b>passenger's</b> headrest, glove compartment with pen holder and toll card, configurable center console and rear seating with a two position backrests — one position favoring cargo and the other favoring comfort.|$|R
25|$|The Marines, {{believing the}} island was safe, were caught off guard by the attack. The gunfire by the two assailants struck the two baseball-playing Marines {{as well as a}} tent and dozens of cases of soft drinks. After {{shooting}} at the Marines initially, reports state the men then drove to another location and then shot again. According to accounts, a Marine sentry returned fire with an M16A2 rifle and company commander Captain Matthew S. Reid returned fire with a sidearm, with the former's gunfire disabling the truck. The two Kuwaiti gunmen were shot, with one of them exiting the vehicle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> with several gunshot wounds. Reid and the senior-most Marine enlisted on the island, First Sergeant Timothy Ruff, and Company Gunnery Sergeant Wayne A. Hertz then closed with and shot the gunman several more times, killing them. Ruff and other Marines, including Hertz, then extracted the wounded driver of the truck from out of the vehicle. That gunman also died. Before the second gunman died, the Marines walked up to his body and stood over him. Surrounded by U.S. Marines, the mortally-wounded gunman laid dying on the ground and muttered a few phrases in Arabic before finally expiring.|$|E
500|$|He {{moved to}} Cunard as a {{director}} and then chairman, where {{he was responsible for}} radically altering the passenger and freight operations of the business; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the business, he cut massive losses by selling the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth liners, then oversaw the radical re-design of the replacement liner the Queen Elizabeth 2, which was under construction when he took up his position with Cunard. The changes he oversaw allowed the Queen Elizabeth 2 to become a profitable luxury liner for the company. His work on the freight size of the business included the containerisation of the business together with the amalgamation of smaller lines and the formation of joint ventures which would be needed to operate larger container ships. He was chairman of Cunard when the Atlantic Conveyor was ordered and launched as part of Cunard's contribution to the Atlantic Container Line joint-venture.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ironic" [...] was {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui.|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile {{with a cup of coffee}} in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side.</b> When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E
50|$|The Renault DeZir is an {{electric}} concept {{car that was}} first officially presented at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. The car is a 2-seat coupe with butterfly doors, and the interior is of red leather. The concept's butterfly doors open like a conventional-butterfly door <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's side and a suicide-butterfly door <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side.</b> It features a 148 hp mid-mounted electric motor. This gives the concept rivalry with the Audi e-tron, with 0 - 60 mph in just five seconds and {{a top speed of}} 112 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, {{the buses}} {{of one of}} Valley Metro's predecessors, Phoenix Transit System, were painted with an orange and pink stripe, and a logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sides, rear and front, {{featuring}} a character known as [...] "Tico", which was a sun wearing sunglasses, and a sombrero. In the late-1980s, this logo disappeared and buses were simply labeled [...] "City of Phoenix Transit System". In 1993-1994, the RPTA changed the colors to a green and purple color scheme (which many vehicles still have), with a green stripe and a large purple [...] "V" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side,</b> and <b>the</b> reverse <b>on</b> <b>the</b> driver's side.|$|R
50|$|It {{features}} {{a choice of}} 2.3- and 3.2-liter gasoline engines, or 2.3- and 2.9-liter diesel engines, all produced on license from Mercedes-Benz, accompanied by a five-speed manual Borg-Warner gearbox. The interior of the second generation Korando was unique because it had a steering wheel arch on either side. This was to make converting to right-hand-drive easier and {{to cut down on}} production costs. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side,</b> a handle was fitted in the arch. This generation was sold as the Daewoo Korando from 1999 to 2001, as Daewoo bought a majority stake in SsangYong, but was later forced to sell its shares.|$|R
2500|$|Some of {{the changes}} with the {{redesign}} included a new grille that did not open with the hood, and slightly smaller exterior dimensions. [...] Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model. [...] A pollen filter was installed with this generation, and was accessed from inside the engine compartment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> against the firewall. [...] Custom and Limited trim levels continued to be offered.|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 {{facelift}} {{included a}} new cross-hatch grille, [...] energy absorbing front bumper and revised square taillights, again {{mounted in the}} bumper. New emission standards added EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) valves to engines, and horsepower ratings were reduced. The standard Turbo-Fire [...] two-barrel was now rated at [...] while the only optional engine was the Turbo-Jet [...] V8 produced [...] with dual exhaust ( [...] with single exhaust used in station wagons). A new option on sedans and coupes was a 50/50 bench seat with recliner <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{director}} {{called for}} maximum speeds of about , but the cars (including the chase cars filming) at times reached speeds of over [...] Driver's point-of-view shots {{were used to}} give the audience a participant's feel of the chase. Filming took three weeks, resulting in nine minutes and 42 seconds of pursuit. Multiple takes were spliced into a single end product resulting in discontinuity: heavy damage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of Bullitt's car can be seen much earlier than the incident producing it, and the Charger appears to lose five wheel covers, with different ones missing in different shots. Shooting from multiple angles simultaneously and creating a montage from the footage to give the illusion of different streets also resulted in the speeding cars passing the same vehicles at several different times, including, widely noted, a green Volkswagen Beetle. At one point the Charger crashes into the camera in one scene and the damaged front fender is noticeable in later scenes. Local authorities did not allow the car chase to be filmed on the Golden Gate Bridge, but did permit it in Midtown locations including Bernal Heights and the Mission District, and {{on the outskirts of}} neighboring Brisbane.|$|E
50|$|The {{idler arm}} {{supports}} {{the end of}} <b>the</b> center link <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> vehicle. The idler arm bolts to the vehicle's frame or subframe. Generally, an idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of}} the center link from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center link at the proper height. Idler arms are generally more vulnerable to wear than Pitman arms because of the pivot function built into them. If the idler arm is fitted with grease fittings, these should be lubricated with a grease gun at each oil change.|$|R
50|$|As was {{customary}} of minivans of {{the time}} the S-MX features only one (conventional) rear door <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> (left) <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> vehicle. Ostensibly this feature was for <b>the</b> safety of <b>passengers,</b> to prevent them from stepping out into traffic.|$|R
5000|$|The driver's {{car pulls}} up {{to the side of the}} road, and the masked figure enters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side.</b> <b>The</b> two drive down another path and stop at a small house. Upon exiting the vehicle the film {{continues}} to a shot of the driver/killer leading the masked figure by a rope which binds his wrists, all the while carrying his brief case. The dilapidated doorway to the house is shown to have the number [...] "1334" [...] laid out in small bones at the top, otherwise adorned with dominoes, a crucifix, caution tape, a glove, a knife, and various photographs of someone's arms and head being bound.|$|R
2500|$|Toyota {{announced}} that the 2014 model year would be the final production year of the FJ Cruiser for the U.S. Market, therefore to add uniqueness to {{the final version of}} the Trail Teams Special Edition, Toyota designated the final version to be the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition which features a few special upgrades. The 2014 Trail Teams Ultimate Edition FJ Cruiser comes in a Heritage Blue paint scheme (resembling an original FJ40 Land Cruiser factory paint color), and for the first time features a white grille bezel that again pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40. The remaining vehicle trim remains black, similar to previous versions of the Trail Teams Special Edition. [...] While all of the Trail Teams FJ Cruisers feature a race-inspired TRD/Trail Teams off-road suspension designed by Bilstein, the Ultimate Edition features a new rear remote reservoir suspension. The suspension also raises the vehicle slightly taller than stock as to achieve a leveled stance. The Ultimate Edition is also equipped with a special 1/4 inch thick aluminum TRD skid plate, designed to help with the approach angle for the front of the vehicle and provide better protection while off-roading. Significant interior differences that are unique to the 2014 Trails Team Ultimate Edition include; the interior panel inserts are black rather than color matched to the exterior color of the vehicle, the radio bezel is silver, and a special [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] dash plaque is affixed to the dash <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> indicating the special edition is only [...] "One of 2500." [...] Additionally, the seating fabric inserts are color matched to coordinate with the Ultimate Edition's unique silver/black interior, rather than the exterior color as in previous years.|$|E
50|$|A {{belt-driven}} pump mounted low on {{the driver}} side circulates the high-temperature coolant, while a separate belt-driven pump mounted higher <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> circulates the low-temperature coolant.|$|E
50|$|It {{features}} a 14mm hex fill plug <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> and a 17mm hex drain {{plug on the}} bottom (with a strong magnet for attracting metal flakes).|$|E
50|$|The choke {{provision}} for the Quadrajet was initially {{in the form}} of an intake-mounted, heat sensitive spring, (divorced choke), often referred to as a heat riser. The spring connected to a rod that actuated <b>the</b> choke mechanism <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> carburetor, and relied on intake manifold's temperature. Later models, second generation Quadrajets, (1974-onward), were designed with a self-contained choke housing that held the heat sensitive spring and directly operated the choke mechanism. This system relied on hot air drawn from a small heat exchanger in the intake manifold -- and later models, (generally 1978-onward), relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicle's 12 volt system to power a heating element and spring as the engine's temperature increased.|$|R
25|$|The {{external}} appearance and equipment of the VAM Pacer {{consisted of a}} full bright molding package (wheel lips, top edges of the hood and fenders, window surrounds, rocker panels), bright rear panel between the taillights and the rear licence plate housing, protective side moldings, front and rear bumper guards, bumper nerfing strips, five-mile-per-hour bumpers with recovering shocks (only VAM car with this characteristic along with the Matador-based Classic line), five-spoke in-house VAM wheels, trim rings and full cover volcano center caps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wheels, ER78x14 radial tires, driver's side manual remote mirror, radio antenna <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> fender, squared VAM logo emblems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fenders, Pacer emblems <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fenders and bright rear panel and a two-step hood latch.|$|R
50|$|Late in 1963, Zappone was {{monitoring}} {{local police}} frequencies and overheard a Florida Highway Patrolman requesting a sergeant after he pulled over a chimpanzee driving a compact convertible for speeding on Interstate 4 {{just east of}} Tampa. He rushed to grab a ride with another newsman, WTVT TV reporter Steve Wilson, and arrived in time to photograph the lawman issuing the chimp a citation for speeding and having no driver's license. Robert Slover, owner of Tampa-based Southern Amusement Enterprises, a traveling carnival featuring Cappy, had installed a separate brake <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> and {{was present at the}} time the citation was given. <b>The</b> highway patrolman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scene advised his superiors there was only one steering wheel and it was in front of the chimpanzee.|$|R
