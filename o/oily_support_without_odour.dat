50|$|In {{communities}} where infibulation is common, {{there is a}} preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and <b>without</b> <b>odour,</b> and {{both women and men}} may find the natural vulva repulsive. Men seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation. The local preference for dry sex causes women to introduce substances into the vagina to reduce lubrication, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and Vicks menthol rub. The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection. Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that infibulation increases hygiene.|$|R
40|$|Group living {{has evolved}} as an {{adaptation}} to predation in many animal species. In {{a multitude of}} vertebrates, the tendency to aggregate varies with the risk of predation, but experimental evidence for this is less well known in invertebrates. Here, we examine the tendency to aggregate in the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex in the absence and presence of predator fish <b>odour.</b> <b>Without</b> fish <b>odour,</b> the gammarids showed no significant tendency to aggregate. In contrast to this, in fish-conditioned water, they significantly preferred {{to stay close to}} conspecifics. Predation risk can, thus, influence gammarids social behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Complementary and {{alternative}} medicine are increasingly {{used by many}} to relief the effects of chronic stress. Odours derived from plants, like lavender are currently used to reduce stress. The main problem with traditional and new treatments {{is that they have}} not been properly tested with appropriate controls, existing evidence are predominately anecdotal. The main aim {{of this study was to}} properly evaluate the effectiveness of traditional and new plant derived odours in reducing the effects of chronic stress with appropriate controls. We used concurrent stressors of social isolation and predator odour as a model for chronically stressing mice over 10 days (D 2 ̆ 7 Arbe et. al., 2002). Animals were divided into 4 groups (n= 4 for each group) : Group 1 controls (minimal/no stress) with <b>odours,</b> <b>without</b> <b>odours</b> group 2; stress with odours group 3 and stress <b>without</b> <b>odours</b> (group 4). We applied odours to only groups 1 and 3, three times a day by spraying 0. 2 ml of odour onto bedding of the animal 2 ̆ 7 s cage. Following end of treatment, animals were sacrificed by cervical fracture, blood was collected from the heart and both vasa deferentia dissected free and place in an organ bath. We measured mean amplitudes of extra junctional currents (EJCs) using focal extracellular recording technique. At least 16 randomly chosen recording sites were electrophysiologically studied from each preparation. As demonstrated previously, stressed animals showed higher levels of sympathetic neurotransmission. We tested 7 different odours derived from green plants and graded their activity. We compared their activity with the commonly used stress relief agent, lavender and made an unexpected observation. The most effective plant derived odour, which reduced the physiological effects of chronic stress, was cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol [0. 3...|$|R
