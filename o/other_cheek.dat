5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the <b>other</b> <b>cheek</b> to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

Generally the gesture is {{repeated}} with the <b>other</b> <b>cheek,</b> or more, alternating cheeks. Depending on country and situation, {{the number of}} kisses is usually one, two, three or four. Hand-shaking or hugging may also take place.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s when war was brewing Europe, the anti-religious {{propaganda}} carried {{the line that}} devout Christians could not make good soldiers because Christianity was anti-war, preached love of one's enemies, turning the <b>other</b> <b>cheek,</b> etc. This propaganda stood in sharp contradiction with the anti-religious propaganda that had been produced in the 1920s that blamed the church for preaching unqualified patriotism in World War I. To a lesser degree, it also differed from the criticism of Christians who had fought for Russia in World War I but who would not take up arms for the USSR.|$|E

25|$|Jarrett {{would then}} enter a feud with Mick Foley, who {{attacked}} him while shooting his DVD at the TNA Asylum. The two would {{meet in a}} four-way match at Sacrifice involving Kurt Angle and Sting with Jarrett putting his voting shares in TNA on the line, Angle putting his leadership of The Main Event Mafia, Sting putting his career, and Foley putting the TNA World Heavyweight Championship; Sting {{would go on to}} pin Angle for the victory and leadership of the mafia. Jarrett later pinned Eric Young in order to qualify for the King of the Mountain match, however Young attacked Jarrett after the match in storyline. The following week, Jarrett called out Young and offered to turn the <b>other</b> <b>cheek,</b> but instead Young provoked him by saying that he pays more attention to wrestling than his own daughters just like his father Jerry which resulted in Jarrett slapping Young and assaulting him. Jarrett also would accidentally punch referee Earl Hebner while Hebner was trying to separate the two. On the June 11 episode of Impact!, Mick Foley kayfabe fined and suspended Jarrett and threw him out of the arena as a punishment. The following week, Foley threw a party for Jarrett and welcomed his return to TNA in order to have him on his side at Slammiversary. At Slammiversary, Jarrett refused to give Foley the belt in the King of the Mountain match, which was won by Kurt Angle after assistance from Samoa Joe. Shortly after Slammiversary, Jarrett once again disappeared from TNA programming. During his hiatus, it was reported that Jarrett had lost all of his backstage power in TNA and would return only as a wrestler.|$|E
500|$|Jesus calls {{people to}} repent their sins and to devote {{themselves}} completely to God. Jesus tells {{his followers to}} adhere to Jewish law, although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the Sabbath. When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: [...] "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind... And a second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself" [...] (...) [...] Other ethical teachings of Jesus include , refraining from hatred and lust, turning the <b>other</b> <b>cheek,</b> and forgiving people who have sinned against you (Matthew 5–7).|$|E
500|$|As a Christian minister, King's main {{influence}} was Jesus Christ and the Christian gospels, {{which he would}} almost always quote in his religious meetings, speeches at church, and in public discourses. King's faith was strongly based in Jesus' commandment of loving your neighbor as yourself, loving God above all, and loving your enemies, praying for them and blessing them. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to turn the <b>other</b> <b>cheek</b> in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus' teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52). In his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, King urged action consistent with {{what he describes as}} Jesus' [...] "extremist" [...] love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors, which was very usual for him.

500|$|In {{political}} sociology, one of Weber's {{most influential}} contributions is his [...] "Politics as a Vocation" [...] (Politik als Beruf) essay. Therein, Weber unveils {{the definition of}} the state as that entity that possesses a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force. Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power. A politician must not be a man of the [...] "true Christian ethic", understood by Weber as being the ethic of the Sermon on the Mount, that is to say, the injunction to turn the <b>other</b> <b>cheek.</b> An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a saint, for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it. The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ethic of attitude and the ethic of responsibility (" [...] vs [...] ") and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).|$|E

2500|$|Oleschuk in 1938 {{accused the}} Church and clergy of misinterpreting the new Soviet Constitution's article 146, which allowed social and public {{organizations}} {{to put forward}} candidate for election to local soviets, by thinking that this meant the Church could put forward candidates. The supreme procurator Andrei Vyshinsky claimed that the only public organizations that were allowed to do this were those [...] "whose aim is active participation in the socialist construction and in national defense". The Church did not fall into either of these categories because it was considered anti-socialist and because Christianity taught to turn the <b>other</b> <b>cheek</b> and love one's enemies, which therefore meant Christians could not be good soldiers and defenders of the homeland.|$|E

2500|$|The ads {{featuring}} barely clad or naked {{women have}} been criticized by some feminist animal rights advocates. When Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis posed naked for Playboy, donating half her $100,000 fee to PETA, the group issued a press release saying Davis [...] "turns the <b>other</b> <b>cheek</b> in an eye-opening spread," [...] then announced she had been photographed naked with Hugh Hefner's dog for an anti-fur ad. In 1995, PETA formed a partnership with Playboy to promote human organ donation, with the caption [...] "Some People Need You Inside Them" [...] on a photograph of Hefner's wife. The long-standing campaign, [...] "I'd rather go naked than wear fur," [...] in which celebrities and supermodels strip for the camera, generated particular concern.|$|E
2500|$|The longest {{discourse}} in the Sermon is , traditionally {{referred to as the}} Antitheses or Matthew's Antitheses though Gundry disputes that title. In the discourse, Jesus fulfills and reinterprets the Old Covenant and in particular its Ten Commandments, contrasting with what [...] "you have heard" [...] from others. For example, he advises turning the <b>other</b> <b>cheek,</b> and , in contrast to taking an eye for an eye. According to most interpretations of , , , and , and most Christian views of the Old Covenant, these new interpretations of the Law and Prophets are not opposed to the Old Testament, which was the position of Marcion, but form Jesus' new teachings which bring about salvation, and hence must be adhered to, as emphasized in [...] {{towards the end of the}} sermon.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout history {{many have}} {{understood}} Jesus of Nazareth {{to have been}} a pacifist, drawing on his Sermon on the Mount. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should [...] "not resist an evildoer" [...] and promoted his turn the <b>other</b> <b>cheek</b> philosophy. [...] "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you." [...] The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.|$|E
