50|$|Taylor was a Whig hard-liner, {{and argued}} in an {{anonymous}} tract Submission and Obedience to the Present Government (1690) {{the duty of}} taking the oaths of allegiance to William III and Mary II, based <b>on</b> Bishop <b>Overall's</b> Convocation Book. That work had recently been published {{for the first time}} by William Sancroft, to justify the attitude of non-jurors; but Taylor interpreted its argument of the book in the opposite sense. The author John Overall had drawn up the manuscript in 1606, and it consisted of a series of canons which had been submitted to Convocation and accepted by it early in James I's reign, concerning the right of subjects to resist oppressive government. The canons, in ambiguous language, denied the right of resistance but recognised that a government originating in rebellion might acquire the stamp of divine authority. James I objected to the second point, and the canons were dropped before they received official confirmation. Sancroft had brought the matter to public notice by insisting <b>on</b> <b>Overall's</b> first doctrine, of non-resistance; Taylor's pamphlet put the opposite emphasis <b>on</b> <b>Overall's</b> argument, and his interpretation seems to have influenced William Sherlock. Taylor added a Vindication (1691), also anonymous.|$|R
5|$|In a 2008 {{evaluation}} of state Governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking {{him in a}} tie for fifth place <b>on</b> <b>overall</b> fiscal policy.

The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.|$|E
5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving <b>on</b> <b>overall</b> dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E

5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact <b>on</b> <b>overall</b> sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E
5|$|From D-Day to 21 August, the Allies landed 2,052,299 men in {{northern}} France. The {{cost of the}} Normandy campaign was high for both sides. Between 6 June {{and the end of}} August, the American armies suffered 124,394 casualties, of whom 20,668 were killed. Casualties within the First Canadian and Second British Armies are placed at 83,045: 15,995 killed, 57,996 wounded, and 9,054 missing. Of these, Canadian losses amounted to 18,444, with 5,021 killed in action. The Allied air forces, having flown 480,317 sorties in support of the invasion, lost 4,101 aircraft and 16,714 airmen (8,536 members of the USAAF, and 8,178 flying under the command of the RAF). The Free French SAS paratroopers suffered 77 killed, with 197 wounded and missing. Allied tank losses have been estimated at around 4,000, with losses split evenly between the American and British/Canadian armies. Historians slightly differ <b>on</b> <b>overall</b> casualties during the campaign, with the lowest losses totaling 225,606 and the highest at 226,386.|$|E
