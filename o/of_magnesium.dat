5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production <b>of</b> <b>magnesium</b> metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply <b>of</b> <b>magnesium,</b> more than any other North American magnesium operation.

40|$|To {{consider}} the relationship <b>of</b> serum <b>magnesium</b> with {{the activity of}} the parathyroid gland in maintenance hemodialysis patients we designed a study to investigate the role <b>of</b> serum <b>magnesium</b> in regulating the parathyroid secretion.

Predialysis serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, intact serum PTH (iPTH), serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D (25 -OH Vit D) and plasma HCO 3 – were measured. The Urea Reduction Rate, duration and dosage of hemodialysis treatment were calculated also.
