5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed to the left <b>or</b> <b>right,</b> indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted {{on either side of}} the fuselage and only saw reflections from the left <b>or</b> <b>right,</b> slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted above and below the wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Pong is a {{two-dimensional}} sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left <b>or</b> <b>right</b> {{side of the}} screen. They can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return {{the ball to the}} other.|$|E

5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as herpes zoster, {{is a viral disease}} {{characterized}} by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on the left <b>or</b> <b>right</b> of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is tested by evaluating {{the function of}} the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius muscle is tested by asking the patient to shrug their shoulders with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the patient to turn their head to the left <b>or</b> <b>right</b> against resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} H.olivaceoalbus {{stretches}} across {{the northern and}} western North America as well as across Europe (except the Mediterranean region) and Russia. The fungus typically fruits between late summer and early winter, and occasionally (depending on the geographical location and climate) as early as June <b>or</b> <b>right</b> through December. The population is currently not endangered, except in France, where it is almost extinct.|$|E

5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script <b>or</b> <b>right</b> to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left <b>or</b> <b>right</b> sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left <b>or</b> <b>right,</b> and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E

5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right <b>or</b> <b>right</b> wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected {{so there was no}} need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left <b>or</b> <b>right</b> of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left <b>or</b> <b>right</b> by turning their rocket.|$|E

5|$|Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like {{many other}} platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side-scrolling, {{played on a}} {{two-dimensional}} plane in which Kirby can move left <b>or</b> <b>right</b> as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can avoid}} attacks from their opponents by dodging {{to the left}} <b>or</b> <b>right</b> or by ducking, but players cannot punch while dodging or ducking, nor can they duck body blows. They can also block attacks to either the head or the body, but they cannot block strong punches; strong punches must be avoided by dodging or ducking. Depending on the situation, the player must {{strategically}} block, dodge, or duck {{in order to avoid}} an opponent's attack. Players can capitalize on the opponent's attacks by launching counter-punches immediately after avoiding an attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, the left <b>or</b> <b>right</b> subtrees are traversed {{depending on whether the}} target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the boy throughout the game.

Limbo is presented through dark, greyscale graphics and with minimalist ambient sounds, creating an eerie, haunting environment. The dark visuals also hide numerous environmental and physical hazards, such as deadly bear traps on the forest floor, or lethal monsters hiding in the shadows, such as a giant spider. Among the hazards are glowing worms, which attach themselves to the boy's head and force him to travel in only one direction until they are killed.|$|E
