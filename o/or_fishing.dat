5|$|The island's {{population}} was recorded as 192 at the 2011 census, {{an increase of}} over 30% since 2001. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The majority of the resident working population are engaged in farming <b>or</b> <b>fishing,</b> and sheep raised on the island {{have a reputation for}} quality. Most of the land is owned by the Duke of Argyll, with the farmers being tenants.|$|E
5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building <b>or</b> <b>fishing.</b> The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E

5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution {{has been a problem}} in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{granitic}} gneiss rocks {{throughout the}} entire coastline are home to large populations of invertebrates, fish and seaweed. These gneiss and the dunes form rich ecosystems, but are threatened by waterfront construction, holiday-makers and dune sports. Short-beaked common dolphins occur in large numbers in Northern Portugal. Dolphins show themselves by porpoising and bowriding along with boats just off the city of Póvoa de Varzim, where fishing activities occur. Alive or dead discarded fish while fishing can be easily caught by dolphins, which could help explain this relationship in the city's waters. Stranded whales and dolphins and found dead occur with some frequency, natural causes, rough seas events, incidents with ships <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> boats can explain these events.|$|E
5|$|About 12,500 {{species of}} insects are native to Florida, {{most of which}} {{naturally}} flew into the region from the Caribbean or Southeastern United States. An additional 1,000 {{have been identified as}} exotic. Insects create about $1 billion of damage to structures and agriculture in Florida each year. The tide of arriving insects is nearly impossible to control with the volume of goods and shipments coming into South Florida. Imported citrus is a major avenue for damaging insects. Twenty-one species have been imported and released to act as biological control agents: to impede the growth of invasive plants or counter the effects of other insects. Others, such as the Madagascan hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) and European cricket (Acheta domesticus) are sold as pets <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> bait, and are then released into backyards. Similarly, aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, clams, snails, and melania find their ways into local waters from the bottoms of ships or in bilge holds. The aquarium trade also supplies enthusiasts with exotic species which are dumped or escape into waterways.|$|E

5|$|Although the use {{of small}} private vessels for {{personal}} transport undoubtably extends back into prehistory, large ships capable of braving the open ocean were typically dedicated to trade <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> for most of human history. Even military campaigns would often simply hire or commandeer these private fleets to serve as troop transports, as did the traders, pilgrims, and wealthy tourists of antiquity and the Middle Ages. The voyages of exploration and colonization were often provided for by the crown out of naval funds; where they were not, they were usually chartered or else purchased and then used for shipping supplies after the initial settlement. Dedicated and scheduled local passenger services came to be offered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the 1817 Black Ball was the first trans-Atlantic passenger line. In the Age of Sail, the duration of such passages depended much on the prevailing winds and the weather. The 18th-century coastal Margate hoys began the popularization of leisure travel in Britain and Ireland that later gathered steam with Thomas Cook's package tours in the next century. During the 19th century, steam-powered ocean liners connected the railroad networks of the world. By 1900, the Atlantic crossing took about five days and the passenger lines competed to win the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade accorded to the fastest liner in regular service. For twenty years from 1909, the prize went to the RMS Mauretania for its average speed of 26.06 knots (48.26km/h). This era waned as cheaper and faster intercontinental flights became available, most importantly the 1958 New York City–Paris route.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of California statehood (1850), many Miwok of Marin and Sonoma Counties were making {{the best of a}} difficult situation by earning their livelihoods through farm labor <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> within their traditional homelands.

25|$|As {{explained}} in the trapping section, if met by resistance, hornets lose the urge to attack and instead retreat. Different measures of resistance include weeds, wire, <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> nets or limiting the passage size so only bees can make it through. Experienced hornets catch on and eventually stay on these traps, awaiting the arrival of bees. The best method of controlling hornets is to combine these protective screens with traps.|$|E

25|$|Religious : Fishing has had {{an effect}} on all major religions, {{including}} Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, and the various new age religions. Jesus was said to participate in fishing excursions. According to the Roman Catholic faith the first Pope was a fisherman, the Apostle Peter, a number of the miracles, and many parables and stories reported in the Bible involve fish <b>or</b> <b>fishing.</b> The Pope's traditional vestments include a fish-shaped hat and the fishermans ring.|$|E

25|$|In {{front of}} the island of Pessegueiro {{is one of the}} more popular beaches, {{attracting}} windsurfers, boaters and sport fishermen to the waters off the coast. Alongside the beach of Pessegueiro is the 17th-century fortress, partially destroyed by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. On the island of Pessegueiro, which inspired the contemporary musician Rui Veloso to pen a composition, is another 17th-century fortress, the ruins of a Roman porto and 15th-century chapel. These have also attracted visitors, as boats regularly visit the island for visits, <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> around its waters.|$|E
25|$|Installer bits are {{a type of}} {{twist drill}} bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. Installer bits are also known as bell-hanger bits <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> bits. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through this transverse hole, and the bit pulled back through the drilled hole. The installer bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York in 1898.|$|E
25|$|A {{bolas spider}} is any of {{several species of}} orb-weaver spider that, instead of {{spinning}} the typical web, hunt by using a sticky 'capture blob' of silk {{on the end of}} a line, known as a 'bolas'. By swinging the bolas at flying male moths or moth flies nearby, the spider may snag its prey rather like a fisherman snagging a fish on a hook. Because of this, they are also called angling <b>or</b> <b>fishing</b> spiders (although the remotely related genus Dolomedes is also called a fishing spider). The prey is lured to the spider by the production of up to three pheromone-analogues.|$|E
