2500|$|Although the [...] "pacification" [...] of South Vietnam's villages was the {{continuously}} touted supreme goal <b>of</b> the <b>Saigon</b> government, the U.S. Mission, MACV, and the media, {{there was}} little real discussion within the media as to {{why it was so}} difficult to convince the Vietnamese peasantry to join the side <b>of</b> the <b>Saigon</b> government.|$|R
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near the centre <b>of</b> <b>Saigon.</b> They had {{pretended to be}} working the transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials. The plan was that this advance party would give signals to a larger party of rebels, who were waiting on the outskirts <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> {{with the majority of}} the weapons, to move into the city for {{the main part of the}} uprising.|$|E
5|$|Diệm faced {{challenges}} to his authority from four more groups. The Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài religious sects had private armies that controlled the Mekong Delta and the areas west <b>of</b> <b>Saigon,</b> respectively. The Bình Xuyên was an armed, organised crime empire that controlled much <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> with a 40,000strong private army, while the Vietminh still controlled {{much of the}} rural area. Diệm's Vietnamese National Army (VNA) was led by General Nguyễn Văn Hinh, a French citizen who loathed and frequently disobeyed him. Bảo Đại sold the operating license of the national police to the Bình Xuyên, effectively putting administrative control of the police {{in the hands of}} a crime syndicate.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April a South Vietnamese armored {{task force}} crossed the Cambodian border {{into the area}} known as the Parrot's Beak, {{northwest}} <b>of</b> <b>Saigon.</b> The following day a multi-division U.S./South Vietnamese force rolled over the border and into the area known as the Fishhook, north <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> and opposite Binh Long Province. With the exception of heavy fighting at the town of Snoul, PAVN/NLF resistance was light {{since most of the}} North Vietnamese had been withdrawn from the border regions for operations against FANK. In quick succession, all of the border sanctuaries were struck, to one degree or another, by U.S. or South Vietnamese forces.|$|E

5|$|Evacuation plans already existed as a {{standard}} procedure for American embassies. At the beginning of March, fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries. By mid-April, contingency plans were in place and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter evacuation. As the imminent collapse <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> became evident, Task Force 76 (TF76) was assembled off the coast near Vung Tau to support a helicopter evacuation and provide air support if required. In the event, air support was not needed as the North Vietnamese paused for {{a week at the}} outskirts <b>of</b> <b>Saigon,</b> possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and avoiding a possible confrontation with the U.S. by allowing the mostly-unopposed evacuation of Americans from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April, the {{evacuees}} {{were flown}} to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand on HMH-462 helicopters and Amphibious Ready Group Alpha proceeded to the South China Sea to rendezvous with Task Force 76 as it stood by to implement Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation <b>of</b> <b>Saigon.</b>|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the impact}} of the {{propaganda}} campaigns, the Catholic immigrants helped to strengthen Diem's support base. Before the partition, most of Vietnam's Catholic population lived in the north. After the borders were sealed, the majority were now under Diem's rule. The Catholics implicitly trusted Diem due to their common faith and were a source of loyal political support. One of Diem's main objections to the Geneva Accords—which the State of Vietnam refused to sign—was that it deprived him of the Catholic regions of North Vietnam, and he had unsuccessfully called for Bui Chu and Phat Diem to be omitted from the communist zone. With entire Catholic provinces moving south en masse, in 1956 the Diocese <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> had more Catholics than Paris and Rome. Of Vietnam's 1.45million Catholics, over a million lived in the south, 55% of whom were northern refugees. Prior to this, only 520,000 Catholics lived in the Dioceses <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> and Huế combined.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions of}} Định {{in the wake}} of the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> have long been a subject of conjecture.

5|$|The loyalists {{were unaware}} that Đính's real {{intention}} was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung's loyalists in the countryside where they could not defend the president.

5|$|After the Fall <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> {{and the end}} of the Vietnam War, the {{remnants}} of the VNQDD were again targeted by the victorious communists. As Vietnam is a single-party state led by the Vietnamese Communist Party, the VNQDD is illegal. Some VNQDD members fled to the West, where they continued their political activities. The VNQDD remains respected among some sections of the overseas Vietnamese community as Vietnam's leading anti-communist organisation.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1834, the {{imperial}} forces managed to finally repel the Siamese invaders and gained {{the upper hand}} over the rebels, regaining control of the southern countryside and besieging the rebel fortress. Although Khôi died during the siege in November 1834, the rebels defending the citadel <b>of</b> <b>Saigon</b> held out against imperial troops until September, 1835. The rebel commanders put to death. In all, between 500 and 2,000 citadel defenders were captured and executed, including Marchand.|$|E

As of 2014, the Nam Viet restaurant is the only Vietnamese business remaining from the original Little Saigon community, and Four Sisters is a Vietnamese restaurant that opened since the decline <b>of</b> Little <b>Saigon.</b>|$|R

5|$|Đính was put {{in charge}} of the fake coup and was allowed the {{additional}} control of the 7th Division based in Mỹ Tho, which was previously assigned to Diệm loyalist Cao, who commanded the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta. The reassignment of the 7th Division gave Đính and his III Corps complete encirclement <b>of</b> <b>Saigon,</b> and would prevent Cao from storming the capital to save Diệm as he had done during the coup attempt in 1960.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Saigon,</b> the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E
