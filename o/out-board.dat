2500|$|A further {{problem is}} that {{especially}} wooden ships {{have more than one}} [...] "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the [...] "length of the topmost deck" [...] – the [...] "length on deck" [...] (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level' or the [...] "length between perpendiculars" [...] (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including jibboom and <b>out-board</b> part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length.

60|$|The Cetacea {{plunged into}} the seas, burying him to the waist, but {{he made his way}} <b>out-board</b> with the canvas {{buffeting}} his head until he seized an iron ring. It cost him a determined effort to wrench it loose so it could run in, and when, at last, the sail swept behind him he felt the blood warm on his lacerated hand. Then he crawled on board, and when he and Moran had set a smaller jib it was high time to reef the mainsail; but they spent a few moments in gathering strength for the task.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} see {{a danger to the}} ship. The jibs I speedily doused and brought {{tumbling}} to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. Of course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung <b>out-board,</b> and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. I thought this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle. At last I got my knife and cut the halyards. The peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water, and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhall, that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, the HISPANIOLA must trust to luck, like myself.|$|E
60|$|As for men, {{there were}} fifty fellows as desperate as Hereward himself, to take service {{with him for}} that or any other quest. So they {{ballasted}} their ships with great pebbles, stowed under the thwarts, {{to be used as}} ammunition in case of boarding; and over them the barrels of ale and pork and meal, well covered with tarpaulins. They stowed in the cabins, fore and aft, their weapons,--swords, spears, axes, bows, chests of arrow-heads, leather bags of bowstrings, mail-shirts, and helmets, and fine clothes for holidays and fighting days. They hung their shields, after the old fashion, <b>out-board</b> along the gunwale, and a right gay show they made; and so rowed out of Waterford harbor amid the tears of the ladies and the cheers of the men.|$|E

Now, there is reason in such an idee; whereas, I never could reconcile it to my natur', that these little bits of stars should keep a craft like the 'arth in her course, with such a devil of a way on her, as we know in reason she must have, to run so far in a twelvemonth.

60|$|Deerslayer lay passive a {{few minutes}} longer, his eye at the bullet hole, however, and much did he rejoice at seeing that he was drifting, gradually, farther and farther from the shore. When he looked upward, the treetops had disappeared, but he soon found that the canoe was slowly turning, so as to prevent his getting a view of {{anything}} at his peephole, but of the two extremities of the lake. He now bethought him of the stick, which was crooked and offered some facilities for rowing without the necessity of rising. The experiment succeeded on trial, better even than he had hoped, though his great embarrassment {{was to keep the}} canoe straight. That his present manoeuvre was seen soon became apparent by the clamor on the shore, and a bullet entering the stern of the canoe traversed its length, whistling between the arms of our hero, and passed out at the head. This satisfied the fugitive that he was getting away with tolerable speed, and induced him to increase his efforts. He was making a stronger push than common, when another messenger from the point broke the stick <b>out-board,</b> and at once deprived him of his oar. As the sound of voices seemed to grow more and more distant, however, Deerslayer determined to leave all to the drift, until he believed himself beyond the reach of bullets. This was nervous work, but it was the wisest of all the expedients that offered, and the young man was encouraged to persevere in it by the circumstance that he felt his face fanned by the air, a proof that there was a little more wind.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was perhaps}} but a natural {{transition}} for him, who so closely observed these indications of departure {{in the ship}} so often named, to turn {{his eyes on the}} vessel which lay without the fort, in order to witness the effect so manifest a signal had produced in her, also. But the closest and the keenest scrutiny could have detected no sign of any bond of interest between the two. While the firmer was making the movements just described, the latter lay at her anchors without the smallest proof that man existed within the mass of her black and inanimate hull. So quiet and motionless did she seem, that one, who had never been instructed in the matter, might readily have believed her a fixture in the sea, some symmetrical and enormous excrescence thrown up by the waves, with its mazes of lines and pointed fingers, or one of those fantastic monsters that are believed to exist {{in the bottom of the}} ocean, darkened by the fogs and tempests of ages. But, to the understanding eye of Wilder, she exhibited a very different spectacle. He easily saw, through all this apparently drowsy quietude, those signs of readiness which a seaman only might discover. The cable, instead of stretching in a long declining line towards the water was [...] "short," [...] or nearly [...] "up and down," [...] as it is equally termed in technical language, just [...] "scope" [...] enough being allowed <b>out-board</b> to resist the power of the lively tide, which acted on the deep keel of the vessel. All her boats were in the water, and so disposed and prepared, as to convince him they were in a state to be employed in towing, in the shortest possible time. Not a sail, nor a yard, was out of its place, undergoing those repairs and examinations which the mariner is wont to make so often, when lying within the security of a suitable haven, nor was there a single rope wanting, amid the hundreds which interlaced the blue sky that formed the background of the picture, that might be necessary, in bringing every art of facilitating motion into instant use. In short, the vessel, while seeming least prepared, was most in a condition to move, or, if necessary, to resort to her means of offence and defence. The boarding-nettings, it is true, were triced to the rigging, as on the previous day; but a sufficient apology was to be found for this act of extreme caution, in the war, which exposed her to attacks from the light French cruisers, that so often ranged, from the islands of the West-Indies, along the whole coast of the Continent, and in the position the ship had taken, without the ordinary defences of the harbour. In this state, the vessel, to one who knew her real character, appeared like some beast of prey, or venomous reptile, that lay in an assumed lethargy, to delude the unconscious victim within the limits of its leap, or nigh enough to receive the deadly blow of its fangs.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, the Air Force awarded L-3 Communications a $61 million {{contract}} to add precision strike packages to eight MC-130W Combat Spear special-mission aircraft {{to give them}} a gunship-like attack capability; such-equipped MC-130Ws are known as Dragon Spears. Air Force Special Operations Command is arming these aircraft to relieve the high operational demands on AC-130 gunships until new AC-130Js enter service. The MC-130W Dragon Spear was renamed the AC-130W Stinger II in 2011. The precision strike packages consist of a 30 mm gun and several precision guided munitions (PGMs). Rails are mounted on the <b>out-board</b> pylon of the wing for four Hellfire missiles, SDBs, or SDB IIs under each. 10 Common Launch Tubes (CLTs) are mounted on the rear ramp to fire Griffin A missiles; additional missiles are stored in the aircraft that can be reloaded in flight.

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{case is the}} Airbus A400M. Unique to the {{propulsion system}} of this airplane are the counter-rotating propellers on both wings; both propellers on each wing rotate in opposite direction to each other, down in-between. If both engines on a wing are operative, the shift of the thrust vector with increasing angle of attack is always towards the other engine on the same wing. The effect is that the resultant thrust vector of both engines on the same wing does not shift as the angle of attack of the airplane increases, as long as both engines are operating. There is no overall P-factor; {{there will be no}} difference in magnitude of remaining thrust yawing moments after failure of either engine #1 or #4 with increasing AOA, only in direction left or right. This means that the minimum control speed during takeoff (VMC) and/ or in the Air (VMCA) after failure of either one of the outboard engines will be the same, unless (boosting) systems, that may be required for controlling the airplane, are installed on only one of the outboard engines. This airplane does therefore not have a left- or right-hand critical engine; both <b>out-board</b> engines are equally critical.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{destruction}} of the enemy fleet was the only permanent way to end this problem, Caesar directed his men to build ships. However, his galleys were at a serious disadvantage compared to the far thicker Veneti ships. The thickness of their ships meant they were resistant to ramming, whilst their greater height meant they could shower the Roman ships with projectiles, and even command the wooden turrets which Caesar had added to his bulwarks. The Veneti manoeuvred so skilfully under sail that boarding was impossible. These factors, coupled with their intimate knowledge of the coast and tides, put the Romans at a disadvantage.However, these advantages would not stand in the face of Roman perseverance and ingenuity. Caesar's legate Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus was given command of the Roman fleet, and in a decisive battle, succeeded in destroying the Gaulish fleet in Quiberon Bay, with Caesar watching from the shore. Using long billhooks, the Romans struck at the enemy's halyards as they swept past (these must have been fastened <b>out-board),</b> having the effect of dropping the huge leathern mainsails to the deck, which hopelessly crippled the vessel whether for sailing or rowing. The Romans were at last able to board, and the whole Veneti fleet fell into their hands.|$|E
5000|$|Minke whales {{were first}} {{exploited}} by Greenlanders off western Greenland in 1948, when a fishing vessel mounted with a harpoon cannon began catching them. This vessel averaged 18 whales per annum (range four to 32), before being joined by three other vessels in 1958. The {{number of vessels}} participating in the hunt each year increased rapidly, rising from 18 in 1963, to 25 in 1964, and to 45 in 1965. The peak was reached in 1968 and 1969, with 56 vessels active in both years. From 1970 to 1976 the average fluctuated between about 30 and 45 vessels. A total of 3,434 minke whales were taken off western Greenland between 1948 and 1976, with a peak of 315 reached in 1968. The vast majority of these whales were taken by fishing vessels normally targeting cod, shrimp, or salmon, but an increasing number in later years were caught using {{a number of small}} boats with <b>out-board</b> motors, armed with high-powered rifles for killing the whale and hand-held harpoons and floating bladders to secure them; walkie-talkies were used for coordination.

40|$|Thrust-emplaced tectonic units {{dominate}} {{the structure of}} the Scandinavian Caledonides. The lower units made up the Baltoscandian margin of the early Paleozoic continent Baltica. The thrust sheets that probably formed the outer part of this margin are treated here as suspect terranes. Three such terranes (1 through 3) are distinguished. The higher tectonic units, occurring as far-transported (> 400 km) thrust sheets in the Upper and Uppermost Allochthons, are composed of exotic terranes derived from <b>out-board</b> of Baltica. Terranes containing, at least in part, oceanic sequences (4 through 9) have been distinguished from those comprising metamorphic complexes of less-certain affinity (10 through 12); a terrane (13) composed predominantly of exotic continental lithosphere forms the highest unit in the tectonostratigraphy. A complex polyphase accretionary history is apparent for the outboard terranes.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the measurement of}} the dynamic centre of pressure (CoP) of a brake pad during a normal braking event using a modified 12 -piston opposed calliper. The modifications allow the centre of pressure to be controlled both radially and {{along the length of}} the pad, inducing a leading or trailing centre of pressure as desired. The technique is unique in its design and implementation. Both the centre of pressures of the inboard and <b>out-board</b> pads are recorded simultaneously with varying pressures and speeds. The results, which include pressure and force maps, show the position of the centre of pressure to vary considerably during a braking event, both radially and axially along the pad. The CoP offset is related to the calliper mounting geometry which is subsequently compared to the effective “spragging angle” and the generation of brake noise. It is seen that by inducing a leading offset noise may be generated and subsequently eliminated if a trailing centre is then induced.
