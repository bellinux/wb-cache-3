5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between serum trace elements, antioxidant capacity index and hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (HDCP). Methods: Forty cases <b>of</b> normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> twenty-one <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with high blood pressure, twenty-eight <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with early stage of mild preeclampsia and twenty-two <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with early stage of severe preeclampsia were selected respectively. Then, the differences of blood routine examination and blood coagulation function of the four groups were compared. At the same time, the levels of the serum trace elements and oxidative stress related indexes in the placental villi tissue were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: The white blood cells and hematocrit <b>of</b> HDCP <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> {{were significantly higher than}} those <b>of</b> normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> women; platelet and fibrinogen levels were obviously lower than those <b>of</b> normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> while thrombin time was shorter than that <b>of</b> normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> women; levels <b>of</b> serum copper, zinc and manganese were also significantly lower than whose <b>of</b> normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> while iron level was distinctly higher than that <b>of</b> normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> The differences between groups were statistically significant. The activities of SOD and GSH-PX in the placental villi tissue <b>of</b> HDCP <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> were significantly smaller than those <b>of</b> normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> while the Hcy level was higher than that <b>of</b> normal healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> The differences between groups were statistically significant. Conclusions: <b>Pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with HDCP has both imbalance of trace elements and redox system equilibrium, so we should strengthen the determination of the trace elements and redox related indexes <b>of</b> HDCP <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> to ensure health of maternal and child...|$|R

India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E

Uttar Pradesh contributed to the largest share of almost all communicable and noncommunicable disease deaths, including 48 per cent of all typhoid deaths (2014); 17 per cent of cancer deaths and 18 per cent of tuberculosis deaths (2015). After Assam, Uttar Pradesh has India’s second-highest maternal mortality rate, 285 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births (2013), with 62 percent <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> unable to access minimum ante-natal care.|$|E

Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

The military recruits Bart and Milhouse to befriend the alien race in avatar bodies. They succeed in this and Bart ends up getting Kang's daughter pregnant after falling in love with her. They learn that the extract Hilarrium, which is excreted by their queen, is primarily used by the natives to reduce the mood swings <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> Milhouse then contacts the military of their location, which then attacks the natives. In the battle, the natives are helped by all the animals of the planet, which eventually defeats the military.

5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

40|$|Background: Maternal {{mortality}} rate is still high in Indonesia. This {{is due to}} the many woman who died from complications of pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. Complications during childbirth are expected to be prevented and detected through a visit by a medical team during puerperium. However, based on the data collected by RISKESDAS the visit during puerperium has not been performing well. Therefore, the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> about puerperium needs to be prepared that they can pass through it normally. Method: Used a survey method with the analytic cross sectional study design. The sample in this study were all <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> who recorded both in village midwives, and private practice health centers midwives in the working area of Simpang Timbangan some as much as 61 people. Using accidental sampling method. Results: Maternal knowledge about puerperium-related education pendidikan (RP= 37, 5; CI 95 % = 4, 549 - 309, 334), compliance of 7 T (counseling points) (RP= 3, 491; CI 95 %= 1, 204 - 10, 123) and the fulfillment of the 7 rights <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> (RP= 3, 197; CI 95 %= 1, 108 - 9, 223).

There is extensive experience with the treatment <b>of</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> with TB and no toxic effect of PZA in pregnancy has ever been found. High doses of RMP (much higher than used in humans) causes neural tube defects in animals, but no such effect has ever been found in humans.
