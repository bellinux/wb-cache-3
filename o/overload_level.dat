However, at a negative {{value of the}} baseline stress ratio, the fatigue crack propagation rate can accelerate after applying a tensile overload. To evaluate such crack propagation behavior, the effective stress intensity factor range has been employed. The transition of residual fatigue life after applying these loads was observed and this behavior was dependent on the loading conditions. When the applied <b>overload</b> <b>level</b> was lower than a critical level, retardation of crack propagation was observed. However, when the applied <b>overload</b> <b>level</b> was higher than a critical level, the crack growth rate got higher.

40|$|Just {{as their}} single-bit counterparts, multi-bit sigma delta {{modulators}} exhibit nonlinear behavior {{due to the}} presence of the quantizer in the loop. In the multi-bit case this is caused by the fact that any quantizer has a limited output range and hence gives an implicit saturation effect. Due to this, any multi-bit modulator is prone to modulator overloading. Unfortunately, until now, designers had to rely on extensive time-domain simulations to predict the <b>overloading</b> <b>level,</b> because there is no adequate analytical theory to model this effect. In this work, we have developed such an analytical theory based on multiple input describing function analysis. This way, we obtained expressions for the signal gain, the noise gain and the variance of the quantization noise. Here, both the case of DC as well as sinusoidal signals was considered. These results were used for the stability analysis of multi-bit Sigma Delta modulators, which allows to predict the <b>overloading</b> <b>level.</b> Code implementing the proposed expressions is available for download at [URL] be/cas/en/download...|$|R

While for specimens with sharp notches one would expect a decrease in cyclic lifetime, the introduction of periodic overloads generally causes a lifetime extension. Therefore specimens with three different notch depths but constant notch radius, and consequently three different elastic notch factors, were combined with three different <b>overload</b> <b>levels</b> and two different overload types. On the fracture surfaces {{a decrease in the}} crack propagation rate to a certain distance was observed which was followed by an increase of the crack propagation rate till fracture. The different distances to the minima of the crack propagating rate depend on the type and the level of the periodic overload {{as well as on the}} notch depth. A significant fatigue life extension due to periodic overloads introduced into a constant amplitude load could be obtained for pure tensile overloads with high <b>overload</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

Hybrid Sigma Delta modulators use analog and digital integrators {{to improve the}} dynamic range.

The presented modulator achieves 8 -dB (19 dB) improvement in dynamic range (signal to noise ratio) compared to conventional modulator with the same oversampling ratio (OSR). Another significant advantage of the proposed structure is that the <b>overload</b> <b>level</b> (OL) increases about 8. 6 -dB.

40|$|A {{fluorescence}} recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) {{machine is}} an elaborate and expensive device which can excite the molecules {{of a sample}} of fluorescently dyed cell plasma membrane and measure the number of photons that the sample emits. The knowledge gained through such an experiment is biomedically useful because {{the intensity of the}} light emitted can be used to guage the mobility of the proteins in the plasma membrane. Because FRAP detectors are so costly, the goal in this project is to design and construct an electrical FRAP simulator. The rate, R(t), at which the photons are emitted from the membrane after excitation, is governed by the equation: R(t) = A - B/(l+Ct) + D/(1 +Ct) ², where t is time and A,B,C,D are positive constants. Given A,B,C,D and the other characteristics of a FRAP detector: opening and closing shutter delays, <b>overload</b> <b>level</b> of the PMT, and steady-state rate of photon emission before strong laser beam excitation; an analog voltage output, R(t), is produced. R(t) is created by using an integrator and a series of dividing, squaring, multiplying, and summing circuits. Finally, a TTL output with a frequency proportional to R(t) is produced by using a voltage contolled oscillator. TTL outputs, which describe the intensity of the light emitted before and during excitation of the molecules, are also simulated and are then combined with this VCO output to produce the entire output.

A commonly used rapid allergen detection method is lateral flow devices, although research about their validation is lacking. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate lateral flow devices, their specificity and sensitivity to milk proteins and milk-derived ingredients, swabbing conditions, and applications in cleaning validation. Several lateral flow devices advertised to detect total milk did not detect whey proteins or whey-derived ingredients. The <b>overload</b> <b>level</b> of the kits was highly variable (ranging from 100 - 10, 000 ppm milk protein), stressing the necessity of validating each kit for its intended purpose. Milk soils were produced on stainless steel panels in order to assess swabbing conditions. There was essentially no difference in sensitivity achieved from using the swab provided by a kit as compared to a common swab, but certain swabs were better suited to scraping soils rather than absorbing liquid soils. The milk soils that were dried at high heat had a lower recovery than unheated or low heat soils. Concentration dependent interferences with lateral flow devices and general protein tests were found with caustic cleaning solutions and oxidizing sanitizers, respectively. Four food-processing surfaces: 316 grade stainless steel, HDPE, Nylon 6 / 6, and Delrin, were soiled with milk and cleaned with each cleaning solution of a typical CIP system separately and then sequentially. When used separately, a commercial caustic solution was observed to outperform a commodity caustic solution. The acidic and sanitizing solutions did not contribute to milk soil removal. The stainless steel surface was most easily cleaned. The lateral flow devices were able to detect milk soils with similar frequency, while the general protein kit had a lower sensitivity. An enhanced visualization method which employed protein staining and scanning of the soils was used, but more development of this method is necessary prior to further use. Advisors: Joseph L.

This cannot reflect the high risk of iron overload in children who have an increased need for iron. In this study, we developed four experimental iron overload models in young rats using iron sucrose and evaluated different markers of iron overload, tissue oxidative stress and inflammation as its consequences. Iron overload was observed in all iron-treated rats, as evidenced by significant increases in serum iron indices, expression of liver hepcidin gene and total tissue iron content compared with control rats. We also showed that total tissue iron content was mainly associated with the dose of iron whereas serum iron indices depended essentially on the duration of iron administration.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dental {{implants}} {{have reported}} success rates of over 90 % {{over long periods}} of time. However, failures still occur and seem to be unpredictable. One factor that is increasingly considered a strong candidate in failure of dental implants is occlusal loading. Overloading of dental implants during functional and parafunctional activity has been extensively discussed from the clinical point of view, but little scientific evidence. AIM: The aim {{of this article is to}} review literature related to loading and overloading implants through masticatory and parafunctional activity, in order to attempt to clarify causality of overload in relation to implant failure. Materials and Methods: All types of publications, published in English up to December 2001 were included. Pubmed search was done using various keywords and the “related article” feature. All identified publications and in vivo studies were reviewed but case studies were excluded. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Osseointegrated implants can fail due to very high occlusal load under experimental conditions. However, the safe and the <b>overload</b> <b>levels</b> are not known. What is clear is that loss of osseointegration is more frequent in early implant loss in the presence of micromotion. Apart from this, it is difficult to find a clear relationship between loading and in vivo tissue response. CONCLUSION: Within the context of the published literature, the consensus on overloading of dental implants is still an unresolved issue. It can be concluded that more research is required to reach a better understanding on the relationship between overload and interfacial biomechanics. Nevertheless, the clinician should be aware that increased loading, associated with parafunctional activities, has a higher risk of biomechanical complications...|$|R
