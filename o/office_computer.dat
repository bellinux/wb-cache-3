2500|$|On January 5, 2000, Northwest Airlines filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} flight attendants' union {{and a number of}} [...] employees. Along with its January 5 complaint, Northwest Airlines filed a motion for discovery, {{requesting}} searches of the hard drives of the office and home computers of union officials. Additionally, Northwest requested searches of the home computers of [...] employees, including Kevin Griffin and Frank Reed. On February 8, Minnesota District Court Judge Boylan approved the request and issued the discovery order. The order required all 43 named defendants, officers and [...] members to turn over both home and <b>office</b> <b>computer</b> equipment to the accounting company Ernst & Young for [...] "purposes of examining and copying information and communications contained on the computer hard drives." [...] The order permitted the discovery of all data, including e-mail communications. After conducting discovery, Northwest Airlines fired over a dozen employees in early March, stating that they had engaged in a sickout. The Union filed grievances claiming none of the employees' sick calls were false. The effect on intra-airline email use was marked: postings critical of Northwest Airlines by employees dwindled, and the majority of messages after the search were posted anonymously.|$|E
2500|$|The Coyle E. [...] Moore Athletic Center {{is located}} {{on the north side of}} the University Center and is the center of Florida State Athletics and it's 400-plus student-athletes. It is home to the Athletics Administration and support staff and houses the Executive Staff, Business <b>Office,</b> <b>Computer</b> Information Services, Coaches' Video, Seminole Productions, College of Communication faculty offices and student edit rooms, Academic Support, Student Services, Compliance, Sports Information, Digital Media, Marketing and Promotions, Facilities and Event Management, classrooms, a dining {{facility}} with a full service kitchen, and a mailroom. Initially built in the 1950s as a football field house, the original infrastructure of the athletic center plumbing, sewage, and air-conditioning had become inadequate to the demands placed upon it by far more student-athletes and staff than it was designed for. In 2004, the Moore Building underwent an overhaul makeover to match the appearance of the rest of the University Center with a more efficient floor plan to allow for more room for growth. The new facility caters to the student athlete's needs by housing a dining hall, a 15,000 square foot training and rehab facility, and a more than 8,000 square foot tutorial and study hall space. A multi-purpose theater for team meetings, press conferences, and symposiums is also located on the first floor of the Moore Athletic Center. The main level showcases Florida State's talented student-athletes with wall-to-wall vibrant memories of historic Seminole seasons and athletic achievements, including the 1993 and 1999 football national championships. In an effort to enhance the studies of Florida State students, there is also a designated space for athletic-training curriculum and a studio provided for the College of Communication students to gain hands on experience producing work for Seminole athletics.|$|E
