The relationship between the transformed acicular ferrite, the inclusions, and the chemical nature of the inclusions which had actually nucleated ferrite laths was examined in detail. By employing weld metals with either intermediate (200 - 350 ppm) or low (15 - 30 ppm) oxygen levels, the inclusion chemistry and nucleation behaviour ofacicular ferrite in <b>welds</b> with different <b>oxygen</b> contents were compared. In addition, the influence of the [Al]/[O] ratio in lower <b>oxygen</b> content <b>weld</b> metals was also examined. It was found that the first acicular ferrite laths nucleated from the inclusions at both oxygen levels, and the chemical composition of the active inclusions varied considerably. The inclusions nucleated acicularferrite by acting simply as inert substrates with the ability to reduce the free energy barrier to nucleation. The number and size distribution of the inclusions appeared to be the dominant factors; the thermal stress-strain fields and lattice disregistry were less important. The most favourable type of inclusions were within the size range 0. 3 - 0. 9 ?m for the higher <b>oxygen</b> content <b>weld</b> metals and 0. 35 - 0. 75 ?m for the lower <b>oxygen</b> level <b>weld</b> metals. A high [Al]/[O] ratio depresses the formation of acicular ferrite by increasing the soluble matrix aluminium content, which encourages extensive ferrite sideplate formation; the concurrent variation in inclusion chemical composition did not appear to influence the nucleation of acicular ferrite...|$|R

50|$|The French-designed {{open circuit}} SCUBA, called the Aqua Lung, was {{protected}} by US patent and international patents, so Eldred set about designing the Porpoise CA (a prototype), the world's first single hose regulator. Eldred referred to the French model as the Gagnan Aqua Lung, as designer Émile Gagnan was the Frenchman who actually designed the device for Jacques-Yves Cousteau. This new design was superior to the Aqua Lung, and did not violate any of the existing patents. Eldred's regulator was never patented as his business was {{too small for the}} expense. The first production model was designated the CA-1. (C A for compressed Air, 1 for single cylinder) He began using an <b>oxygen</b> <b>welding</b> reduction valve for his prototype. His chief design effort was developing the demand valve which people now call the second stage. It was sold as a complete single cylinder, single hose SCUBA early in 1952. The cylinder was inverted so the diver could reach the innovative regulator mounted reserve. Only about a dozen of these exist and are {{now in the hands of}} SCUBA collectors. Eldred also made the CA-2, which was a double cylinder model. Only two CA-2 Porpoises are still known to exist. About three quarters of the Porpoises made were surface supplied 'hookah' units.

The connection between the properties of welds with the content of oxygen in WMD were carried out.

Ti 02 K 20 and CaO. A binary SiOrMnO flux was also produced for purposes of comparison. The fluxes were fused, crushed, sized and used to make submerged arc welds on carbon steel plate. Supplementary argon shielding was used to prevent atmospheric contamina-tion which might distort the effect of metal oxide decomposition. Silicon and manganese recoveries were also mea-sured. The results show that the stability of metal oxides during welding is not direct-ly related to their thermodynamic stabili-ty. Some fluxes, which are otherwise very stable chemically, may decompose into suboxides {{in the presence of}} the welding arc plasma. Such oxides produce higher levels of <b>oxygen</b> in the <b>weld</b> metal than chemically stable oxides which do not form suboxides.

40|$|The {{research}} of this thesis {{is focused on}} the optimization of laser beam welding of PMlOOO with respect to its high temperature mechanica! properties. This nickel chromium alloy is used for the thermal protection system of the re-entry test vehicle of ESA; Expert. With respect to the ceramic tiles which are used in conventional thermal protection systems, metals {{do have a lot of}} sustainable advantages. For instance the ductility and the self healing capabilities will have a positive effect on the maintenance characteristics of the thermal protection system. PMlOOO makes use of yttrium oxide (1203) for the dispersion hardening which is responsible for the good mechanica! properties at high temperatures. This research focused therefore on the relation between the yttrium oxide in original state in the welds and the mechanica! properties of the welds. To optimize the laser beam wel ding process the wel ding speed (v) and the laser beam power (P) is varied. The first weld series (weld series I) is investigated with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, hardness tests and morphology research. From these results three weld parameter combinations are chosen (weld series II) which are used for tensile tests at temperatures from room temperature up to 1250 °C. The parameters are chosen such that the infiuence of the welding speed and the welding power is individually measured. There are also tensile tests performed on the PMlOOO base material to set a reference. With optical microscopy it is shown that the macrostructure of the welds exists out of dendrites. In the middle of the weld the dendrites form a center line. The scanning electron microscope showed large amounts of black spots in the weld.

40|$|Typically, when gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW) is employed to join near-alpha titanium alloys, the resulting weld fusion zone (FZ) {{is much harder}} than that of the base metal (BM), thereby leading to lost ductility. The aim of this investigation was to improve FZ ductility of Ti- 5 Al- 1 Sn- 1 V- 1 Zr- 0. 8 Mo by modifying filler metal chemistry. In this regard, metallic yttrium was added to the filler metal and aluminum concentration reduced. It was believed that additions of yttrium would lead to formation of yttria in the weld melt, thereby promoting heterogeneous nucleation. Since oxygen and aluminum both act as alpha-stabilizers, expected pickup of <b>oxygen</b> during the <b>welding</b> process will be offset by the aluminum reduction. Tensile testing indicated that modified filler metal welds showed a dramatic increase in ductility of the FZ. Fracture toughness testing showed that while JIC values decreased in all welds, the tearing modulus, T, in modified filler metal welds was significantly higher than that of matching filler metal welds. Microhardness mapping of the weld zones illustrated that modified filler metal welds were significantly softer than matching filler metal welds. Microstructural examinations were completed through the use of optical, SEM and TEM studies, indicating that there was a presence of nano-particles in the weld FZ. XPS analysis identified these particles as yttrium oxysulfate. WDS analysis across the welds' heat affected zones demonstrated that there is an internal diffusion of oxygen from the BM into the FZ. Research results indicate yttrium oxysulfide particles form in the weld pool, act as a drag force on the solidification front and limit growth of prior-beta grain boundaries. The reduced prior-beta grain size and removal of interstitial oxygen from the matrix in modified filler metal welds, further enhanced by oxidation of yttrium oxysulfide to yttrium oxysulfate, leads to increased ductility in the weld's FZ. Addition of yttrium to the weld also acts to modify the surface tension of the melt, leading to an increased weld depth penetration. Results of this work indicate that the goals of this project and a significant advancement in the understanding of yttrium effects on titanium grain refinement have been achieved...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen induced cold {{cracking}} in weldments {{is the most}} serious problem limiting the use of high strength low alloy steel in the structural industry. Improvement of the weldability of structural steel has significantly reduced the risk of {{cold cracking}} in the heat affected zone. Consequently, the avoidance of weld metal cold cracking becomes a major task since the risk of hydrogen induced cold cracking in the HAZ is greatly diminished in modem low carbon steels. Hydrogen induced cold cracking in weld metal is caused by the complex interaction of the diffusible hydrogen content, residual stress and susceptible microstructure. Depending on the joint geometry which induces stresses, cold cracking in weld metal can be of two types with respect to the welding direction: longitudinal cracking which is parallel to the welding direction, and transverse cracking which is perpendicular to the welding direction. Weld deposits for high strength low alloy steels can be susceptible to transverse cold cracking. The investigation described in this thesis involved the use of the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test to examine the effect of shielding gas mixture and preheat temperature on weld metal transverse cold cracking behaviour in a flux cored arc welded BIS 812 EMA quenched and tempered steel. The minimum yield stress of BIS 812 EMA steel 1 s 690 MPa. The consumable used in welding was a low hydrogen flux cored wire. Literature relevant to the characteristics of weld metal cold cracking has been reviewed, with emphasis on the factors affecting hydrogen induced cold cracking. The process of flux cored arc welding, the weld thermal cycle and the properties of weld metal have been examined. The main types of cold cracking and relevant weldability tests have been discussed. Two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures (Ar- 5 %C 02 and Ar- 20 %C 02) and five different preheat temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) were used at an aim heat input of 1. 7 kJ/mm to investigate the effect of welding conditions on the transverse cold cracking behaviour of the weld metal deposited on BIS 812 EMA steel. The microstructures, hardness values and fracture surfaces of the weld metals, have been examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy and microhardness testing. The characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the weld metals have been determined using scanning electron microscopy and automatic image analysis. The continuous cooling transformation diagrams of the base metal and the weld metals have been developed using dilatometry and microstructural observation. Additionally, precipitation hardening by alloy carbides has been studied by tempering of weld metals. It was found that, below a critical preheat temperature, weld metal transverse cracks developed in the self restrained G-BOP test at least five minutes after welding and initiated below 150 °C, confirming that the weld metal transverse cracking was cold cracking. Shielding with Ar- 20 %C 02 mixture resulted in significantly lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking than shielding with Ar- 5 %C 02 mixture. However, the microstructures of the weld metals deposited with the two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures were similar and mainly consisted of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite. Comparing the two weld metals, the higher oxygen potential of the Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture caused reduction of hardenability elements such as carbon, boron, manganese and silicon in the weld metal; and the higher <b>oxygen</b> absorption during <b>welding</b> resulted in a higher non-metallic inclusion volume fraction and a slightly larger mean particle size and number of particles per unit volume. These factors led to phase transformation during cooling at higher temperature in weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02, a slightly coarser microstructure with more bainitic ferrite, and a significantly lower hardness than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02. In addition, the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture had a lower diffusible hydrogen level and less nitrogen in solid solution. These characteristics combined with the lower hardness value of the weld metal are considered to be the main factors contributing to the lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 compared with Ar- 5 %C 02 under the same welding conditions. Three types of fracture morphologies were found {{to be associated with the}} weld metal transverse cold cracking: microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture and intergranular (IG) fracture. IG was more prevalent in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture while MVC dominated in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02. These trends are consistent with the difference in weld metal hardness (strength). The susceptibility to weld metal transverse cold cracking, based on the G-BOP test, decreased with increasing preheat temperature for both shielding gas mixtures. No cracking was observed for the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture for a preheat of 40 °C, but a preheat of 100 °C was required for crack-free welding using Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture. However, it is concluded that the finer microstructure of the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 is capable of both higher strength and lower cold cracking susceptibility than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 provided the hardnesses are similar and below a critical level of about 290 HV...|$|R
