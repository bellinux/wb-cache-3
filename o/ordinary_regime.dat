60|$|Note, in {{the first}} place, that these graver {{offences}} {{are likely to be}} both less frequent and less grave under the régime we have described than under the <b>ordinary</b> <b>régime.</b> The ill-behaviour of many children is itself a consequence of that chronic irritation in which they are kept by bad management. The state of isolation and antagonism produced by frequent punishment, necessarily deadens the sympathies; necessarily, therefore, opens the way to those transgressions which the sympathies check. That harsh treatment which children of the same family inflict on each other, is often, in great measure, a reflex of the harsh treatment they receive from adults--partly suggested by direct example, and partly generated by the ill-temper and the tendency to vicarious retaliation, which follow chastisements and scoldings. It cannot be questioned that the greater activity of the affections and happier state of feeling, maintained in children by the discipline we have described, must prevent them from sinning against each other so gravely and so frequently. The still more reprehensible offences, as lies and petty thefts, will, by the same causes, be diminished. Domestic estrangement is a fruitful source of such transgressions. It is a law of human nature, visible enough to all who observe, that those who are debarred the higher gratifications fall back upon the lower; those who have no sympathetic pleasures seek selfish ones; and hence, conversely, the maintenance of happier relations between parents and children is calculated to diminish the number of those offences of which selfishness is the origin.|$|E

Compared to what {{is the case with}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>regimes</b> and international organizations in the transnational realm, the EU is ‘more’. European states’ self-help means of reciprocity and countermeasures have been removed, and the institutions of the EU affect the freedom, security and well-being of all the subjects – they benefit and threaten, reward and punish EU citizens as well as third parties. Hence, a particular context of social cooperation exists, which gives rise to obligations and legitimate claims. There are morally arbitrary sources of equality that are in breach with the principle of equal citizenship; and the European Treaties have achieved the function of a superior legal structure, which establish both a unitary European citizenry distinct from national ones and a set of autonomous European bodies. There is thus a comparable context of justice and democracy to that of the nation states. However, then there is a second claim of the ‘sovereignists’, that is that the establishment of supranational, coercive power would mean a competition for final authority – for control of centralised authority – with the nation states. 4 The case of the EU shows, as we shall see, that there need not be a struggle for final authority, when the legal basis is the same for all adjudicative bodies.|$|R

40|$|In 1998, Congress added Section 512 to the U. S. Copyright Act, {{creating}} {{a set of}} safe harbors that protect online service providers (OSPs), under certain conditions, from liability for copyright infringement that might occur {{in the course of}} specified online activities. Some commentators have viewed two of these safe harbors, sections 512 (c) and 512 (d), as departing from the <b>ordinary</b> copyright <b>regime</b> by protecting OSPs from claims of direct infringement by the OSP itself, but following the <b>ordinary</b> copyright <b>regime</b> by allowing secondary liability claims against an OSP for infringements committed by users of the OSP’s services. This Article suggests that this view is not entirely accurate. Part I suggests that the safe harbors’ statutory protection for OSPs against direct infringement claims may not be particularly significant, because ongoing judicial development applying copyright law to conduct unprotected by the safe harbors suggests that an OSP’s potential direct infringement liability for its routine functions may not be particularly great. Part II compares the elements of common law copyright claims for contributory infringement and vicarious liability with the provisions of sections 512 (c) and 512 (d) that disqualify an OSP from a safe harbor based either on its level of knowledge about, or control over, a user’s infringing activity. Although the conditions that an OSP must meet to qualify for these safe harbors closely parallel the elements of the common law secondary liability claims, they differ in subtle but important ways. As a result, in some instances the safe harbors will insulate an OSP from secondary liability claims that would, in the absence of section 512, succeed. The Article therefore concludes that the section 512 safe harbors may be more valuable to OSPs facing secondary liability claims than they initially appear, and less valuable to those facing direct infringement claims...|$|R

The current research paper aims at investigating the effect of one such a drug as methadone on the serum levels of Alkaline phosphatase, Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase enzymes. A total number of 28 male adult Wistar rats were completely haphazardly assigned to four group (n= 7) : a control group that received an <b>ordinary</b> daily dietary <b>regime</b> and Experimental groups one, two and three that were administered through oral gavage with 5 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml and 40 mg/ml of methadone syrup, respectively, on a daily basis besides the <b>ordinary</b> dietary <b>regime</b> for eight weeks. Blood samples were collected from the animals at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study for the determination of serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase enzymes.

The serum levels of all three ALT, AST and ALP enzymes were significantly increased in the groups that had been given different doses of methadone (P< 0. 001). According to the results obtained herein and the effects that methadone has on the elevation of liver enzymes levels and also due to the fact that this maintenance medication is being increasingly administered on a daily basis for the treatment of addiction to various narcotics, it seems that there is a need for devising better strategies and better planning for the amount and method of methadone use as well as the way this medication has to be distributed within the society.

40|$|Mainstream {{conceptualizations of}} ‘ethical consumption’ equate the notion with conscious, individual, market-mediated choices {{motivated}} by ethical or political aims that transcend ordinary concerns. Drawing on recent sociology and anthropology of consumption {{literature on the}} links between ordinary ethics and ethical consumption, this article discusses some {{of the limitations of}} this conceptualization. Using data from 32 focus groups conducted in Chile and Brazil, we propose a conceptualization of ethical consumption that does not centre on individual, market-mediated choices but understands it at the level of practical outcomes, which we refer to as different forms of ‘ethical living’. To do that, we argue, we need to depart from the deontological understanding of ethics that underpins mainstream approaches to ethical consumption and adopt a more consequentialist view focusing on ethical outcomes. We develop these points through describing one particular <b>ordinary</b> moral <b>regime</b> that seemed to be predominant in participants’ accounts of ethics and consumption in both Chile and Brazil: one that links consumption and ethics through care.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theory and}} evidence on importing responses to {{exchange rate fluctuations}} from highly disaggregated Chinese data. The paper first develops a heterogeneous-firm trade model and predicts firms' import responses at both extensive and intensive margins: when domestic currency appreciates, more firms start importing and more products are added into the imported inputs bundle (extensive margin effect); the import value by each firm also increases (intensive margin effect); those import responses {{are found to be}} more profound for firms in <b>ordinary</b> trade <b>regime</b> than those in processing trade regime. Next, the paper presents the empirical evidence of Chinese firms' import response to domestic currency appreciation in both the short run and the medium run and confirms the predictions from the model. The results show that the extensive margin effect dominates: an appreciation of local currency significantly increases the probability of firm entry and products adding, which counts for a major source of the increase in China's aggregate import value from 2000 to 2006.

40|$|In Australia, small {{businesses}} have been generally {{subject to the}} same tax rules as larger enterprises, although for many decades, those operated as private companies were arguably more heavily taxed in respect of retained profits. However, since the mid- 1980 s, Australia has gradually shifted its approach and began adopting increasing numbers of tax concessions for {{small businesses}}, in contrast to the <b>ordinary</b> taxation <b>regime</b> applying to larger enterprises (and small businesses that did not qualify for any tax concessions). Australia’s government recognises and accounts for these concessions as tax expenditures, the equivalent of direct spending subsidies to support various activities of, and investments made by, small businesses. The concessional regime for small businesses is a unique subsidy system. First, the rationale for special treatment of the sector is uncertain. That is, viewed objectively, most explanations for such concessional treatment are difficult to sustain. Second, whatever the empirical studies may show, Australian politicians on all sides of the political spectrum believe there are social, economic and political benefits through the provision of tax concessions for small businesses and, as such, the continued use of concessions for this sector is inevitable. For the foreseeable future, concessions for small businesses appear to be ingrained as part of Australia’s tax system. The challenge, therefore, is to devise concessions that are efficiently targeted to provide appropriate subsidies where they are most likely to achieve the goals ascribed by policymakers and politicians enacting the measures. Efficiency, in this context, is synonymous with effective targeting. That is, tax expenditures should not deliver windfall benefits to those enterprises that can already operate profitably and expand in the market under the <b>ordinary</b> tax <b>regime</b> without the provision of concessional subsidies; similarly, concessions should not miss small businesses that require subsidies to generate the requisite social and economic benefits sought by the government. In this regard, current tax expenditures for small businesses fare poorly and, historically, Australia’s taxation system has been recognised as an impediment to the efficient growth of the small business sector. This is because concessions have not been the product of rational design, but instead have represented an amalgam of ad hoc measures subject to continual, often inconsistent, and sometimes contradictory changes. This thesis proposes an alternative approach to the design of tax concessions for small businesses based, first, identifying an optimal benchmark for evaluating the needs of the sector and, second, by the evaluation of alternative concessions in terms of that benchmark to ensure they operate efficiently by targeting those small businesses that most need the concessions. The proposed benchmark is based on the business ‘life-cycle’ model of small businesses, which examines the progression of the business as it moves through successive stages from start-up to decline. An evaluation of past, present and proposed tax concessions for small businesses, as well as variations used in other jurisdictions by reference to this model, finds that most are poorly targeted and thus inefficient as subsidy programs. A program for alternative and better-targeted small business concessions designed by reference to the benchmark life-cycle model is developed {{in the course of a}} chronological review of tax concessions afforded to small businesses in Australia...|$|R

40|$|The {{level of}} {{corruption}} varies widely across countries. This paper examines {{the consequence of}} corruption {{for the design of}} monetary policy. We employ an extended Barro-Gordon framework a la Alesina and Tabellini (1987) and model corruption as a leakage of tax revenue. There are several important implications from the model. First, the optimal in‡ation targeting for a high-corruption country is generally dif-ferent from that for a low-corruption country. A mechanical in‡ation target (i. e., the 1 - 3 % range typically advocated to most countries in the world) could reduce social welfare. Second, corruption can be viewed as one source of lack of com-mitment. Fixed exchange rates or currency boards are more di¢cult to sustain for high-corruption countries as the in‡ation rate (in the anchor country) may be too low from the viewpoint of the countries that adopt the exchange rate arrangements. Third, while in‡ation rate generally rises with the level of corruption under a com-mitment regime, it may fall or rise with corruption under a discretionary regime, depending on the initial level of corruption. Despite of this, a commitment regime generally generates a higher level of welfare than an <b>ordinary</b> discretionary <b>regime.</b> Fourth, a Rogo¤-style conservative central banker can outperform a …xed exchange rate regime, a mechanical in‡ation target, currency board or dollarization. However, the optimal degree of conservatism is an inverse function of the corruption level.

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} devices, {{thermal energy}} is carried by phonons, the quantized excitation of atomic vibrations. These phonons scatter with impurities, electrons, grain boundaries, and other phonons. At a sufficiently large scale, phonon dynamics can be approximated as a Brownian random walk, leading to ordinary diffusion {{described by the}} heat equation. However, such approximations fail at {{the scale of the}} phonon mean free path. In this regime, a proper wave description encoding phonon scattering is required. For sufficiently short thermal systems, the thermal conductivity becomes extrinsic and exhibits linear scaling with system size. This scale is known as the ballistic transport regime. As the system size grows beyond this scale, the thermal conductivity asymptotes into the intrinsic, <b>ordinary</b> diffusive <b>regime.</b> However, there are special circumstances where this transition does not occur. In this Thesis, we demonstrate the anomalous scaling of thermal conductivity. The source of this anomaly is the Anderson localization of thermal phonons. Anderson localization is the spatial trapping of waves due to extreme levels of elastic disorder. The hallmark of Anderson localization is an exponential decay law of conductance with increasing system size. Since thermal transport is a broadband process, this exponential suppression leads to a thermal conductivity maximum as a function of system size. Our numerical study of GaAs/AlAs superlattices with ErAs nanoparticles exhibits this thermal conductivity maximum, yielding quantitative agreement to experiments. We then generalize our elastic model to allow for the incorporation of finite-temperature effects. The inclusion of phonon-phonon scattering decoheres phonons, resulting in phonon delocalization. Counterintuitively, the additional inelastic scattering increases conductance for originally localized phonons. This localization to diffusive transition as a function of temperature is captured in our model at low temperatures (~ 20 K). by Jonathan M. Mendoza. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate clear evidence of the peculiar quantized sliding state, previously found in a simple 1 D boundary lubricated model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 056101 (2006) ], for a substantially less idealized 2 D description of a confined multi-layer solid lubricant under shear. This dynamical state, marked by a nontrivial ``quantized'' ratio of the averaged lubricant center-of-mass velocity to the externally imposed sliding speed, is recovered, and shown to be robust against the effects of thermal fluctuations, quenched disorder in the confining substrates, and {{over a wide range}} of loading forces. The lubricant softness, setting the width of the propagating solitonic structures, is found {{to play a major role}} in promoting in-registry commensurate regions beneficial to this quantized sliding. By evaluating the force instantaneously exerted on the top plate, we find that this quantized sliding represents a dynamical ``pinned'' state, characterized by significantly low values of the kinetic friction. While the quantized sliding occurs due to solitons being driven gently, the transition to <b>ordinary</b> unpinned sliding <b>regimes</b> can involve lubricant melting due to large shear-induced Joule heating, for example at large speed.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} approach {{based on an}} interferometer composed by two quantum dots asymmetrically coupled to isolated Majorana quasiparticles (MQPs), lying {{on the edges of}} two topological Kitaev chains, respectively via couplings (t+Δ) and (Δ-t). This setup enables us to probe MQPs in a quite distinct way from the zero-bias peak feature. Most importantly, the system behaves as a current switch made by two distinct paths: (i) for the upper dot connected to both chains, the device perceives both MQPs as an ordinary fermion and the current crosses solely the lower dot, since current in the upper dot is prevented due to the presence of the superconducting gap; and (ii) by suppressing slightly the hybridization of the upper dot with one chain, the current is abruptly switched to flow through this dot, once a trapped electron as a bound state in the continuum (BIC) (Phys. Rev. B 93, 165116 (2016)) appears in the lower dot. Such a current switch between upper and lower dots characterizes the Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) proposed here, being the ratio t/Δ the control parameter of the transition. This QPT is associated with a change from an <b>ordinary</b> fermionic excitation <b>regime</b> to a MQP in the interferometer, which enables not only the fundamental revealing of MQPs, but also yields a current switch assisted by them...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{properties}} of ordinary strong magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in a strongly magnetized medium with the recently discovered viscosity-damped regime. We focus on energy spectra, anisotropy, and intermittency. Our most surprising conclusion is that in ordinary strong MHD turbulence the velocity and magnetic fields show different high-order structure function scalings. Moreover this scaling depends on whether the intermittency is viewed in a global or local system of reference. This reconciles seemingly contradictory earlier results. On the other hand, the intermittency scaling for viscosity-damped turbulence is very different, and difficult to understand {{in terms of the}} usual phenomenological models for intermittency in turbulence. Our remaining results are in reasonable agreement with expectations. First, we find that our high resolution simulations for ordinary MHD turbulence show that the energy spectra are compatible with a Kolmogorov spectrum, while viscosity-damped turbulence shows a shallow k − 1 spectrum for the magnetic fluctuations. Second, a new numerical technique confirms that ordinary MHD turbulence exhibits Goldreich-Sridhar type anisotropy, while viscosity-damped MHD turbulence shows extremely anisotropic eddy structures. Finally, we show that many properties of incompressible turbulence for both the <b>ordinary</b> and viscosity-damped <b>regimes</b> carry over to the case of compressible turbulence.

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} the early phase of nucleation on a planar fault with the rate- and state-dependent friction law, loaded externally by steady slip, to clarify {{its relation to}} fault instability. We define R[n] as the invasion distance of the inward creep to characterize that phase. For a circular fault, the dependence of R[n] on the dimensionless parameters l[b], l[b−a], and l[RA] (all of these are proportional to the rigidity and the characteristic distance of the state evolution L and inversely proportional to the normal stress and the fault radius) can be compiled. We found that Rn is proportional to l[b] (both aging law and slip law of the state evolution) and l[b−a] (aging law). In {{the case of the}} aging law only, there are two <b>regimes</b> (<b>ordinary</b> events and slow events) separated by the value of l[RA]. The regimes have different trend lines, although we could not measure Rn for the case of l[RA] < 0. 35 because of breaking of the mirror symmetry of instability along the loading direction. R[n] in the slow event regime is smaller. Moreover, we investigated the effect of fault shape and found that a model with a long radius along the mode 2 direction has similar parameter dependence to circular faults, but a model with a long radius along the mode 3 direction has different ones. Our results imply that we can qualitatively estimate the fault instability parameters from the early phase of nucleation, although further research is necessary to enable application to actual faults...|$|R
40|$|We study {{effects of}} {{turbulent}} mixing {{on the critical}} behaviour of a nonequilibrium system near its second-order phase transition between the absorbing and fluctuating states. The model describes the spreading of an agent (e. g., infectious disease) in a reaction-diffusion system and belongs to the universality class of the directed bond percolation process, also known as simple epidemic process, and {{is equivalent to the}} Reggeon field theory. The turbulent advecting velocity field is modelled by the Obukhov [...] Kraichnan's rapid-change ensemble: Gaussian statistics with the correlation function ∝δ(t-t') k^-d-ξ, where k is the wave number and 0 <ξ< 2 is a free parameter. Using the field theoretic renormalization group we show that, depending on the relation between the exponent ξ and the space dimensionality d, the system reveals different types of large-scale asymptotic behaviour, associated with four possible fixed points of the renormalization group equations. In addition to known <b>regimes</b> (<b>ordinary</b> diffusion, ordinary directed percolation process, and passively advected scalar field), existence of a new nonequilibrium universality class is established, and the corresponding critical dimensions are calculated to first order of the double expansion in ξ and ε= 4 -d (one-loop approximation). It turns out, however, that the most realistic values ξ= 4 / 3 (Kolmogorov's fully developed turbulence) and d= 2 or 3 correspond to the case of passive scalar field, when the nonlinearity of the Reggeon model is irrelevant and the spreading of the agent is completely determined by the turbulent transfer.

40|$|We study {{effects of}} {{turbulent}} mixing on the random growth of an interface {{in the problem}} of the deposition of a substance on a substrate. The growth is modelled by the well-known Kardar [...] Parisi [...] Zhang model. The turbulent advecting velocity field is modelled by the Kraichnan's rapid-change ensemble: Gaussian statistics with the correlation function 〈 vv〉∝δ(t-t') k^-d-ξ, where k is the wave number and 0 <ξ< 2 is a free parameter. Effects of compressibility of the fluid are studied. Using the field theoretic renormalization group we show that, depending on the relation between the exponent ξ and the spatial dimension d, the system reveals different types of large-scale, long-time asymptotic behaviour, associated with four possible fixed points of the renormalization group equations. In addition to known <b>regimes</b> (<b>ordinary</b> diffusion, ordinary growth process, and passively advected scalar field), existence of a new nonequilibrium universality class is established. Practical calculations of the fixed point coordinates, their regions of stability and critical dimensions are calculated to the first order of the double expansion in ξ and ε= 2 -d (one-loop approximation). It turns out that for incompressible fluid, the most realistic values ξ= 4 / 3 or 2 and d= 1 or 2 correspond to the case of passive scalar field, when the nonlinearity of the KPZ model is irrelevant and the interface growth is completely determined by the turbulent transfer. If the compressibility becomes strong enough, the crossover in the critical behaviour occurs, and these values of d and ξ fall into the region of stability of the new regime, where the advection and the nonlinearity are both important.

40|$|Summary and Conclusions Many {{research}} {{groups around the}} globe take a direct route from failure undermonotonic loading to high cycle fatigue. Surprisingly, low cycle fatigue being a border phenomenon between the aforementioned failure phenomena, is often not considered. In the present thesis, the gap between failure under monotonic loading and HCF was closed by thorough LCF analyses. As a practically relevant material, the high-strength aluminium alloy Al 2024 has been chosen. The SRµCT investigations have made it evident that micro-mechanics based porous plasticity damage models are not suitable for this particular alloy due to {{a high number of}} dense particles. The particles are arranged in continuous layers throughout the micro-structure. Studying the microstructure and fracture mechanisms, it can be safely stated that bigger inclusions in Al 2024 sheets and plates are responsible for damage initiation in the LCF regime. Al 2024 thick plate, due to its underlying manufacturing process develops precipitates {{in the middle of the}} plate, creating layers within. A transition of fracture mode, from surface to internal fracture, was observed with increasing plastic range in cyclic experiments. In an <b>ordinary</b> low cycle <b>regime</b> (40 - 200 cycles), a fatal crack is generated by the propagation and frequent coalescence of small surface cracks. Eventually, a mesocrack initiates from the surface of the specimen due to the presence of bigger intermetallics. For a 100 mm thick plate the S-direction has been found to be very brittle when compared to L and T-directions (rolling directions) respectively. Although there is a ductility observed, the resulting failure occurs without macroscopic softening. An identical response was also observed in 4 mm thin sheets. For allowing symmetric strain amplitudes (R = - 1) in such sheets, a oating antibuckling guide has been proposed which successfully prevents buckling at high compressive loading without affecting adversely the mechanical behaviour of the specimen. In summary, the material behaviour in S-direction can be characterised as neither completely brittle nor completely ductile. More precisely, plastic strain accumulation as damage driving process as well as small fatigue crack growth as brittle damage mechanism can be seen for LCF. This led to a conclusion that for modelling low cycle fatigue for these materials, a material model which incorporates both these effects (coupled ductile and brittle) was required. For that purpose, a phenomenological CDM approach was considered in the present thesis. In our earlier analyses in the past, only ductile damage was taken into account. However, since the microstructural arrangement of Al 2024, as observed in our experiments favour also brittle failure modes, a fully coupled ductile-brittle model has been proposed. While ductile damage has been modelled in a similar fashion as advocated formerly by other authors (see, e. g. Lemaitre & Desmorat (2005)), a novel approach was elaborated for brittle damage. In sharp contrast to the ductile damage model, material degradation can already evolve below the yield limit. Since early work on a large number of smooth and notched specimen demonstrated that wide variations in commercial aluminium alloys caused little or no detectable differences in fatigue strength, the novel coupled damage model is also applicable to a wider range of aluminium alloys. The material parameters necessary to use the proposed model can be easily obtained from a hysteresis loop test in order to determine the cyclic stress-strain curve. The predicted LCF lifetimes for A 12024 alloy are in good agreement the respect experiments verifying the underlying assumptions...|$|R
