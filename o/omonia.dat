5|$|During the 1979–80 season, Nea Salamina {{played in}} the second division. Many times fans at its matches outnumbered those of teams {{competing}} in the first division. The team easily won the league {{and returned to the}} first division for the 1980–81 season. At the first game they beat the later champion <b>Omonia,</b> 2–1, in an away game at Makario Stadium in Nicosia. This defeat was the first <b>Omonia</b> suffered at the stadium since they began competing in it. Nea Salamina finished seventh for the season.|$|E
5|$|In five leagues of the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation, Nea Salamina {{failed to}} win a title; during its last two years, it {{finished}} second. The 1952–53 season saw the cup finalists losing 2–0 to AC <b>Omonia</b> at Gkooul stadium (Omonia's home pitch).|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1974, before the Turkish occupation, Nea Salamina signed Bulgarian coach Iancho Arsov, {{who went on to}} win titles with <b>Omonia</b> decades later. The {{agreement}} was canceled when financial problems caused by the team's refugee status made it impossible to pay for a foreign coach.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 1966–67 {{season the}} board of Olympiakos {{reported}} rumors of future match-fixing between Nea Salamina and Anorthosis to the team, which its president denied. Nea Salamina defeated Anorthosis; Olympiacos won the league championship, despite its defeat by <b>Omonia.</b> The Olympiakos board apologized, congratulating Nea Salamina on its victory. By {{the end of the}} decade Nea Salamina was finishing mid-table, despite an outflow of players to other teams or the army.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan {{began his}} career with Celtic in 2006, but a lack of first team {{opportunities}} saw him being loaned to other Scottish clubs. In 2010, he switched clubs and countries joining CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria, {{from where he was}} loaned to Scottish side St Johnstone in 2011. After playing for Kilmarnock between 2012 and 2013, he signed for defending Cypriot champions APOEL. In both his seasons with the club, he won the double. Subsequently, he moved to rivals <b>Omonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1965–66 {{season was}} one of the best (but painful) periods for Nea Salamina; the team arguably played the best {{football}} in Cyprus. The team contended for the championship until the last game of the season and lose its first cup final. In a game against APOEL at the old GSP stadium, Nea Salamina was leading 3–0. In the 62nd minute, an APOEL player hit a Nea Salamina's player; an APOEL grabbed and hid a linesman's flag. The game was halted, and the CFA ordered a rematch. The dispute lasted more than three weeks; in the meantime Nea Salamina was defeated by the bottommost team, Aris Limassol F.C.. In the penultimate match of the tournament <b>Omonia</b> and Salamina were tied for first place on points, and Olympiacos was one point behind. In the game against Olympiakos Nicosia Nea Salamina was leading 2–1, but Olympiakos tied the game in allegedly excessive extra time. After clashes in the last few seconds, the game was halted and ordered replayed. <b>Omonia</b> was in first place with 50 points; Nea Salamina was second with 47 and Olympiakos third with 46. With a victory over Olympiakos Nea Salamina would win the championship, since it had more goals than <b>Omonia.</b> On 31 May 1966 many buses and cars drove from Famagusta to Nicosia, where Nea Salamina was defeated 6–3. The best defense in the league, which had allowed fifteen goals in nineteen games, allowed six in one game. For a second time, Nea Salamina finished third. This defeat affected team morale in the cup final with rival Apollon Limassol; although it was favored, the team lost 4–2. During this period Salamina had the best defense in the league, with 21 goals in 20 games (a team record).|$|E
50|$|The 2013-14 {{season is}} <b>Omonia's</b> 59th {{season in the}} Cypriot First Division and 65th year in {{existence}} as a football club.|$|R
50|$|On 18 September 2008, David Anderson, a British {{journalist}} {{writing for}} the Daily Mirror, quoted this in his match preview ahead of <b>Omonia's</b> game with Manchester City, {{which appeared in the}} web and print versions of the Mirror and the nickname was quoted in subsequent editions on 19 September.|$|R
50|$|On 6 and 7 July, Wales {{played two}} friendlies against AC <b>Omonia's</b> futsal team, the current Cypriot champions.

5|$|By 1979, Nea Salamina was {{established}} in the first division. Despite a good start to the 1978–79 season, the team was demoted in the decisive last game to the second division after a quarter-century in the first division. The team's hopes rested both on defeating Enosis Neon Paralimni FC and Evagoras Paphos not to beat AC <b>Omonia</b> or Olympiakos Nicosia FC to lose by Alki Larnaca F.C.. Nea Salamina won over Enosis Neon Paralimni FC (3–2), but none of the others happened as Evagoras won and Olympiakos tied with Alki.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} left-wing {{political}} beliefs, {{members of the}} new clubs were not accepted into the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) and they established a new football federation (the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation, or CAFF) in December 1948. The new federation organized leagues and cups, which attracted thousands of fans. The CAFF matches became more popular than those of the CFA. Six teams belonged to the CAFF: Nea Salamina in Famagusta, <b>Omonia</b> and Orfeas in Nicosia, Alki at Larnaca, AMOL at Limassol (renamed Antaeus in 1951) and Neos Asteras in Morphou.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan {{played his}} first league match for <b>Omonia</b> on 22 August 2016 {{at home against}} Nea Salamis. He {{levelled}} the match at 11 after 20 minutes, then helped his side come back from 31 down to win 53, scoring Omonia's fifth goal from the penalty spot in injury time. Sheridan went on to enjoy the most prolific season of his career to date, scoring a total of 15 goals in the league {{to add to the}} three he scored early in the season in the Europa League qualifying rounds.|$|E
5000|$|Kaiafas {{announced}} his retirement from football in May 1984, and can now look back on a remarkable career which coincided with the greatest decade in <b>Omonia's</b> history - they were league champions seven times. It is little wonder he refers to the club as [...] "my second family". In 2003, he {{was selected as the}} Golden Player of Cyprus and had the honour of representing his country in UEFA Jubilee Awards.|$|R
50|$|After {{failing to}} {{negotiate}} a new contract with a smaller wage, due to <b>Omonia's</b> financial situation, Cherfa was made to train alone, and was eventually linked to OFI Crete even though the former side stated {{it did not have}} the intention of releasing him. After the club failed to perform in their UEFA Europa League campaign, both defensively and overall, a new round of talks started, and he eventually put pen to paper to a new three-year deal.|$|R
50|$|The {{rivalry between}} teams that support {{different}} political parties has grown intense {{over the decades}} and the matches result in bloody conflicts between the fans. The fans take extreme pride in their team {{not only because the}} history of their team but because the connection their political party has with their team. The more hardcore right wing fans wave fascist symbols during matches whereas the hardcore left wing fans wave symbols associated with communism. AC <b>Omonia's</b> hardcore fans in the season 2011-2012 made an enormous choreography of the hammer and sickle, whereas APOEL FC and other right wing football clubs waved fascist symbols. The two teams mentioned above have an often violent rivalry, resulting in injuries to fans.|$|R
5|$|The 1955–56 Cypriot First Division saw {{the team}} {{participating}} {{for the first}} time as a newly promoted side. It finished third, four points behind champion AEL Limassol. Third position has been the team's highest finish, a position it has reached four times. Nea Salamina's first first-division game was against rival Anorthosis at their common ground, GSE Stadium. Nea Salamina won 3–2, its first victory against Anorthosis. The team's first years in first division saw victories over traditional league powerhouses APOEL FC, EPA Larnaca FC, Anorthosis Famagusta FC, Pezoporikos Larnaca and AC <b>Omonia,</b> at home and away.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the decade, Nea Salamina was strong in home games but weak away. Noteworthy is the conquest of the amateur {{championship}} from farm team the period 1960–61, The games of the farm team gathered the same interest with the main team among fans, who enthusiastically celebrated winning the title. During this period the nucleus for a successful team was created, including Kyriakos Koureas (who later played for Olympiakos Piraeus). In December 1963, the league disbanded; at that time, Nea Salamina was in a tight three-way race with <b>Omonia</b> and APOEL. With the creation of Cypriot National Guard, many Nea Salamina's players joined the army; players would often come straight from camps throughout Cyprus to play league games with no training.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 2015, Sheridan {{signed a}} {{contract}} with rival Cypriot club <b>Omonia.</b> He made his debut on 9 July in the second leg of the Europa League first round qualifying tie against Dinamo Batumi, helping his side to a 21 aggregate win. His first goal for his new club came on 23 July in the second leg of the next round qualfifying tie against Jagiellonia Białystok, the only goal in a 10 win which saw his side qualify for the third qualifying round. He then scored two penalties on 6 August in a 2–2 draw with Brøndby in the Europa League third qualifying round second leg, but his team were eliminated on away goals.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{geometry}} {{of an urban}} area, {{the choice of the}} building materials and the surface properties of the dwellings, significantly affect its micro-climate. The city of Athens is mainly composed of narrow streets and large blocks, which raises the already high temperatures, due to the warm macro-climate. The heatwaves of the 1990 ’s increased the annual purchase of air-conditioning systems in Greece by eight times, with most systems having been installed in Athens. This work examines {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} open space in Athens, in the form of streets and courtyards, the latter being the uncovered central spaces inside a block of buildings. The investigation is based on urban morphology and air temperature analyses. For the morphology analysis, two different case study sites are considered; the clusters of Amerikis and <b>Omonias.</b> For the air temperature analysis both in-situ temperature measurements as well as the Cluster Thermal Time Constant (CTTC) prediction model are used. The aim of this study is to identify the benefits of courtyards, which can be exploited so as to offer natural ventilation and lead to reduction of cooling consumption...|$|R
5|$|The 1989–90 {{season was}} the most {{successful}} {{in the history of}} the team when Nea Salamina won its first football title, the Cypriot Cup. The week before the final, many fans traveled to Cyprus from abroad to attend the game. Nea Salamina was the second refugee team to win a title since the 1974 occupation. In the final, on 8 June 1990, Nea Salamina defeated <b>Omonia</b> 3–2 at Tsirion Stadium in Limassol. Players competing in the final included Christakis Christofi, Artemis Andreou, Kipros Tsigkelis, Elissaios Psaras, Floros Nicholaou (captain), Kenny Dyer, Vangelis Adamou, Takis David, Christakis Mavros, Elias Elia, Charalambos Andreou (Pambis Andreou) and S. Anastasiou. Elias Elia, Christakis Mavros and Pambis Andreou scored the goals, and the coach was former Nea Salamina's player Andreas Mouskallis.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 2014, Valbuena {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Dynamo Moscow in a reported £6 million transfer. In his second game for Dynamo and first as a starter on 13 August 2014 against FC Ufa, he assisted on both of his team's goals in a 2-0 victory. In his next game against FC Arsenal Tula on 17 August 2014, he again assisted on both goals in Dynamo's 2-1 victory. On 28 August 2014, Dynamo defeated AC <b>Omonia</b> in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League play-off round, through a decisive goal by Christopher Samba in the 93rd minute of the return leg following a free kick performed by Valbuena, and qualified {{for the first time}} for the group stage of a European competition (since the group stage was introduced).

He returned to playing on 2 October 2014 in a Europa League group game against PSV Eindhoven, in which Yuri Zhirkov scored a winning goal deep into injury time after a corner delivered by Valbuena.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Manchester City {{once again}} {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup through the Fair Play rankings. As City had to play the qualifying rounds, it meant a very early start to the season, in mid-July. Their first match was {{a trip to the}} remote Faroe Islands to play EB/Streymur. As Streymur's ground had a capacity of only 1,000, the match was moved to Tórsvøllur, the Faroese national stadium. Two early goals gave City a 2–0 win. The home leg was unusual in that it was played outside Manchester. The pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium had been relaid following a Bon Jovi concert, and was not ready in time. Instead, the match was played at Barnsley's Oakwell ground. Another 2–0 win resulted in a 4–0 aggregate scoreline. In the second qualifying round City played FC Midtjylland. The first leg ended in a 1–0 defeat, only City's second ever home defeat in European competition. In the second leg City looked to be heading out of the competition until an 89th minute cross was diverted into his own net by Midtjylland's Danny Califf. The tie then went to extra time, and City progressed on penalties. In the first round proper Cypriots AC <b>Omonia</b> took the lead, but City overcame the deficit and won 2–1, and also won the second leg by the same scoreline.|$|E
5|$|He left Vale Park on a free {{transfer}} in June 1993 and {{turned down a}} move to Cyprus outfit AC <b>Omonia</b> to return to former club Hartlepool United. Injury meant he did not play {{for the man who}} signed him, Viv Busby, and instead he made his second debut for the club under John MacPhail. Houchen went on to score eight goals in 37 games as Hartlepool were relegated into the bottom tier of the Football League in 1993–94, finishing a massive 17 points behind Blackpool, who were one point above the relegation zone. MacPhail was quickly sacked and replaced by David McCreery; MacPhail blamed the fact that the club was sometimes unable to pay the player's wages as a reason for poor results on the field. Houchen was a coach at the club, but quickly fell out with temporary 'advisory coach' Sandy Clark. Houchen scored a hat-trick against Bury, though was later sent off in the match for allegedly swearing at referee Kevin Lynch; {{at the time of the}} incident Houchen was receiving treatment for knee ligament damage which would keep him out of action for six weeks. McCreery resigned on 20 April 1995, and chairman Harold Hornsey appointed Houchen as his replacement; he became the 23rd manager at the club in 38 years. He appointed his former boss Billy Horner as youth team coach and also employed Brian Honour and Mick Tait. His first game in charge was a 4–0 home win over Hereford United, and a 3–0 defeat at Preston North End and a final day 3–2 victory over Mansfield Town ensured Hartlepool an 18th-place finish. As a player, he was the club's top scorer with 14 goals in 39 appearances in 1994–95, and was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters.|$|E
25|$|The {{team would}} soon be put back on track {{starting}} in 2006, beginning with the signing of Cyprus international goalkeeper Antonis Georgallides. <b>Omonia</b> would continue its star-studded signings by acquiring Cypriot stars that had been playing abroad, such as Elias Charalambous and Stathis Aloneftis. <b>Omonia</b> would then make headlines with the shocking signing of all-time leading scorer for Cyprus, Michalis Konstantinou. In 2009, <b>Omonia</b> would also sign another Cypriot star, Konstantinos Makrides. En route, <b>Omonia</b> would also acquire young Cypriot hopefuls, 21-year-old Dimitris Christofi and 20-year-old Georgios Efrem. Efrem, who had been playing on the youth team of Arsenal and later Scottish side Rangers, would be the final piece to the puzzle needed to win its 20th Cypriot league championship. After putting the proper pieces in place, <b>Omonia</b> did just that. During the 2009–10 season, led by new captain, Elias Charalambous, <b>Omonia</b> would not lose a single derby, including play-offs matches against either, APOEL, Anorthosis Famagusta nor Apollon.|$|E
25|$|The 1990s {{would prove}} to be less {{successful}} than the previous two decades. During this time, <b>Omonia</b> only mustered one Cypriot League title during the 1992–93 season. It would be eight years before <b>Omonia</b> would see its next title. In 1997, <b>Omonia</b> signed the German Rainer Rauffmann, who would later become the second top goalscorer ever for the club. With the help of other <b>Omonia</b> great and then captain, Costas Malekkos, and a young Costas Kaiafas (the son of Sotiris Kaiafas), Rauffmann would become top scorer of the Cypriot First Division in the 1997–98, 1998–99, 1999–00 and 2000–01 seasons and led Omonoia to two titles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omonia</b> won {{its first}} trophies {{of the decade}} in 1972, when the club won both the league and the cup. Led by a young Sotiris Kaiafas, <b>Omonia</b> won seven league titles in the 1970s, six of them were {{consecutive}} (1974–1979). At {{the end of the}} decade, <b>Omonia</b> had a total of nine championship titles and three cups. At the end of the 1979 season, <b>Omonia</b> trailed its arch rival APOEL by two championships. In 1976, Sotiris Kaiafas would go on and win the European Golden Shoe for his single-season 39-goal performance. In 2003, he was awarded the UEFA Jubilee Awards for the Best Cypriot Footballer of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|<b>Omonia</b> Oroklinis renamed to Alki Oroklini.|$|E
25|$|Since 23 October 1999, <b>Omonia</b> {{has been}} using the 22,859-seat New GSP Stadium, the largest stadium in Cyprus. They share the stadium with local rival APOEL. <b>Omonia</b> played in the Makario Stadium from 1978 until 1999 and in Old GSP Stadium from 1953 to 1978. When the club was first created, it used the Goal Stadium (1948–1953).|$|E
25|$|<b>Omonia</b> {{dominated}} the Greek Cypriot Championship in the 1970s and 1980s, winning 12 championship in 13 seasons. In 1976, <b>Omonia</b> player Sotiris Kaiafas {{was the top}} scorer not only in Cyprus but also in Europe with 39 goals winning the European Golden Boot. Anorthosis Famagusta dominated Cyprus football between 1995 and 2000, losing the championship during those years only once in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The 1980–81 Cypriot First Division was the 42nd {{season of}} the Cypriot {{top-level}} football league. <b>Omonia</b> won their 10th title.|$|E
25|$|The 1992–93 Cypriot Second Division was the 38th {{season of}} the Cypriot second-level {{football}} league. <b>Omonia</b> Aradippou won their 2nd title.|$|E
25|$|After {{a disappointing}} eight seasons, the 2000s decade {{began with a}} trophy. <b>Omonia</b> celebrated its 18th Cypriot league {{championship}} title in 2001. Now captained by Costas Kaiafas, <b>Omonia</b> would win its 19th Cypriot League Championship again in 2003. Since 2003, however, the team would stumble and be without a title {{for the next several}} years. After numerous seasons of poor signings and underachieving, Omonia's reigns would be taken over by new chairman and team president, Miltiadis Neophytou in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Omonoia is {{the most}} popular club in the country with polls, showing that 27.6% of asked Cypriot {{football}} fans stating they supported <b>Omonia.</b> The fans are known for their left-leaning, socialist character, with over 80% stating in a survey that they associate themselves with the Progressive Party of Working People <b>Omonia</b> is also traditionally regarded as the club of Cyprus's working-class.
