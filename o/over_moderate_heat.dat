5000|$|Coconut sugar {{comes in}} crystal or granule form, block or liquid. It is {{essentially}} a two-step process. It starts with harvesting or [...] "tapping" [...] the blossoms of a coconut tree. Farmers make a cut on the spadix and the sap starts to flow from the cut. The sap is then collected in bamboo containers. The sap collected is then transferred into large woks and placed <b>over</b> <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> to evaporate the moisture content of the sap. The sap is translucent and is about 80% water. As the water evaporates, it starts to transform into a thick syrup-like substance known as a [...] "toddy". From this form, it is further reduced to crystal, block or soft paste form, or it remains in this form.|$|E

The presence of oxygen {{seems to have a}} negligible influence on the degradation products obtained in HBCD decomposition, at least at <b>moderate</b> <b>heating</b> rates. Based on the identified products, the main pathways of HBCD thermal degradation were assessed and a mechanism for HBCD decomposition was proposed. The results obtained indicate that hexa-, penta- and tetrabrominated polyaromatic structures seem not to be primary products of HBCD decomposition, and may only be obtained by secondary bromination reactions.

40|$|The {{temperature}} optimum of photosynthesis {{coincides with}} the average daytime temperature in a species' native environment. <b>Moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress occurs when temperatures exceed the optimum, inhibiting photosynthesis and decreasing productivity. In the present study, the temperature response of photosynthesis {{and the potential for}} heat acclimation was evaluated for Camelina sativa, a bioenergy crop. The temperature optimum of net CO 2 assimilation rate (A) under atmospheric conditions was 30 - 32 °C and was only slightly higher under non-photorespiratory conditions. The activation state of Rubisco was closely correlated with A at supra-optimal temperatures, exhibiting a parallel decrease with increasing leaf temperature. At both control and elevated temperatures, the modeled response of A to intercellular CO 2 concentration was consistent with Rubisco limiting A at ambient CO 2. Rubisco activation and photochemical activities were affected by <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress at lower temperatures in camelina than in the warm-adapted species cotton and tobacco. Growth under conditions that imposed a daily interval of <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress caused a 63 % reduction in camelina seed yield. Levels of cpn 60 protein were elevated under the higher growth temperature, but acclimation of photosynthesis was minimal. Inactivation of Rubisco in camelina at temperatures above 35 °C was consistent with the temperature response of Rubisco activase activity and indicated that Rubisco activase was a prime target of inhibition by <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress in camelina. That photosynthesis exhibited no acclimation to <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress will likely impact the development of camelina and other cool season Brassicaceae as sources of bioenergy in a warmer world...|$|R
40|$|<b>Moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress (40 °C for 30 min) on spinach {{thylakoid}} membranes induced cleavage of {{the reaction}} center-binding D 1 protein of photosystem II, aggregation of the D 1 protein with the neighboring polypeptides D 2 and CP 43, and release of three extrinsic proteins, PsbO, -P, and -Q. These heat-induced events were suppressed under anaerobic conditions or {{by the addition of}} sodium ascorbate, a general scavenger of reactive oxygen species. In accordance with this, singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals were detected in spinach photosystem II membranes incubated at 40 °C for 30 min with electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping spectroscopy. The <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress also induced significant lipid peroxidation under aerobic conditions. We suggest that the reactive oxygen species are generated by heat-induced inactivation of a water-oxidizing manganese complex and through lipid peroxidation. Although occurring in the dark, the damages caused by the <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress to photosystem II are quite similar to those induced by excessive illumination where reactive oxygen species are involved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransformation {{with the}} {{bacterial}} gene codA for choline oxidase allows Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells to accumulate glycinebetaine when choline is supplemented exogenously. First, we observed {{two types of}} protective effect of glycinebetaine against heat-induced inactivation of photosystem II (PSII) in darkness; the codA transgene shifted the temperature range of inactivation of the oxygen-evolving complex from 40 – 52  °C (with half inactivation at 46  °C) to 46 – 60  °C (with half inactivation at 54  °C) {{and that of the}} photochemical reaction center from 44 – 55  °C (with half inactivation at 51  °C) to 52 – 63  °C (with half inactivation at 58  °C). However, in light, PSII was more sensitive to <b>heat</b> stress; when <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress, such as 40  °C, was combined with light stress, PSII was rapidly inactivated, although these stresses, when applied separately, did not inactivate either the oxygen-evolving complex or the photochemical reaction center. Further our studies demonstrated that the <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress inhibited the repair of PSII during photoinhibition at the site of synthesis de novo of the D 1 protein but did not accelerate the photodamage directly. The codA transgene and, thus, the accumulation of glycinebetaine alleviated such an inhibitory effect of <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress on the repair of PSII by accelerating the synthesis of the D 1 protein. We propose a hypothetical scheme for the cyanobacterial photosynthesis that <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress inhibits the translation machinery and glycinebetaine protects it against the heat-induced inactivation...|$|R

40|$|In industrialised countries, {{people spend}} over 80 % {{of their time}} indoors and thereof a {{substantial}} part in working rooms, like offices. Hence, these buildings and rooms should be designed not only to provide healthy and comfortable room conditions, but additionally make people able to maintain their work performance. This requirement, especially {{in the field of}} thermal indoor climate, is determined by the challenge between energy efficiency of buildings and necessary energy resources for summer cooling techniques on the one side and the decrease of worker’s performance and hence, the monetary loss of productivity of a company due to inadequate working conditions on the other side. Research on this topic is available in large quantity, but no clear and generalisable relationship could be derived from this work. Common to almost all available studies is the lack of causal research, i. e. why performance seems to worsen at an elevated room temperature like it occurs in naturally ventilated buildings in summer. This work aims at making a contribution to a causal relationship between <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress as it occurs in offices in the summer months and performance and to provide a theoretical model to explain the influence of moderately elevated room temperatures upon performance. The first step is a meta-analytical synthesis of the current state of knowledge. This includes moderator analyses about the influence of different lengths of exposure to <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress, the influence of different clothing insulation values, adaptation times and other possible factors. On the basis of this analysis, which includes 49 studies with 1056 persons, <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress has a significant effect on the performance of different tasks, but this effect in total is small. Important moderators were length of exposure, clothing insulation value, the type of performance measure and time of the year. A further conclusion is the fact that despite the huge amount of work that has been done in this research field, it is hardly possible to do more detailed calculations depending on the intensity of <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress. Previous theoretical models that aim at explaining the relationship between thermal stress and performance were analysed and verified for their applicability on <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress. Indeed, none of these models was suited for this; they were either too general or only appropriate for heat stress. As consequence, a new theoretical model was established including self-control as explaining variable. Self-control is important on the one side to keep long-term goals in the focus and to override short-term unpleasant situations, but on the other side, self-control draws from a finite resource and is therefore limited in its execution. The theoretical concept is based on the job-demands-resources model of workplace stress and links the special case of moderate thermal stress with other stressors that are present on workplaces. Based on these assumptions, the hypothesis was derived that <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress additionally draws from the self-control resource and therefore, tasks that require the execution of self-control may be impaired when they have to be done under <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress. This hypothesis was tested in an experiment. 36 participants were exposed to four different room temperatures (24 °C, 27 °C, 30 °C, 33 °C) in a repeated-measures experimental design. They worked on tasks of which a part required the execution of self-control. Additionally they filled in questionnaires about subjective well-being, mood, effort, fatigue and perception of the physical indoor environment. Physiological measurements like skin temperature, skin moisture and blood glucose level, which is linked to the self-control resource, completed the experimental procedure. The experiment has shown that the performance of most of the tasks, that require self-control, is decreased at elevated room temperatures. Indeed, significant differences were mostly obvious when 24 °C and 33 °C conditions were compared. Blood glucose level, as a physiological correlate to the self-control resource, is in the afternoon significantly more decreased at 33 °C than at 24 °C. Moderator analyses showed additionally that individual (trait) self-control ability and some personality variables may influence the relationship between <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress and performance. These links are not yet generalisable due to the small sample size of this study. In this work, a first step was made towards a theoretical model to explain the relationship between <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> stress and performance. The tasks that need self-control are decreased in warmer conditions, especially in the warmest condition. Further research has to show whether differences could be elaborated in more detail when sample size is increased...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of prebiotic {{to a variety}} of food products has become a more common occurrence in recent years. Although research on the stability of prebiotics has been conducted, knowledge of the stability of prebiotics in processed foods is limited. The purpose of this research was to determine the biological stability of five prebiotics in a variety of food matrices when processed under various conditions. A biological test, the prebiotic activity assay, was used to test for stability of six food products (muffin, cookie, granola bar, breakfast cereal, sports drink, and bread) containing five different prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides (FOS), inulin, galactooligosaccharides (GOS), resistant starch, and polydextrose). The prebiotic activity assay reflects the capability of a prebiotic to support the growth of a probiotic strain relative to an enteric strain and relative to growth of both on a non-prebiotic substrate. Due to the complex matrices of the food products as well as low concentrations of prebiotics, the prebiotic activity assay was not sufficiently sensitive to assess biological stability in these food products. Additional food products (cracker, granola, and sports drink) were produced without background sugars and included a higher concentration of prebiotic, 10 %. The prebiotic activity assay was used to assess the biological stability of prebiotics within these food matrices. Overall, FOSand inulin were stable when exposed to mild to <b>moderate</b> <b>heating,</b> but were biologically degraded when exposed to an acidic environment and <b>moderate</b> <b>heat.</b> GOS was stable when exposed to mild to <b>moderate</b> <b>heat</b> as well as when exposed to an acidic environment that was processed with <b>moderate</b> <b>heat.</b> Resistant starch posed problems with being accurately tested for prebiotic stability, and no strong conclusions were able to be made based on the results obtained through this method. The prebiotic activity assay was able to assess the biological stability of prebiotics in food matrices when exposed to several processing conditions, although the assay was better suited for certain prebiotics as well as certain food matrices.
