The route proceeded along D'Olier Street, College Street (and in the opposite direction, Westmoreland Street). The route continued around College Green and Grafton Street (and in the other direction, Suffolk Street, Church Lane and Dame Street). From here, the route continued out of the city via Nassau Street, Kildare Street, North side of St. Stephen's Green, Merrion Row, Baggot Street Lower, Pembroke Street Lower, Fitzwilliam Square West and Pembroke Street Upper. This route section in the other direction (into the city centre) ran via Leeson Street Lower, East and North sides of St. Stephen's Green and Dawson Street. The N11 ran in both directions along Leeson Street Lower after the junction with Pembroke Street. Having crossed the Grand Canal the route divided again for a portion of Leeson Street Upper, with <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic</b> proceeding via Sussex Road. The route continued via Morehampton Road and Donnybrook Road, through Donnybrook, with the route becoming dual carriageway at Donnybrook Church, which marks the beginning of the Stillorgan Road.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{push-to-talk}} technology {{provides a}} walkie-talkie like service for group communication. In this paper, we propose an efficient <b>outbound</b> voice <b>traffic</b> reduction scheme in the push-to-talk environment when network congestion happens. The Open Mobile Alliancepush-to-talk over cellular (OMA PoC) architecture, {{the standard for}} this kind of group communication, is used as a base network in this paper. The PoC server {{plays an important role in}} copying and forwarding of received RTP media packets and the <b>outbound</b> voice <b>traffic</b> of this PoC Server tends to be affected by other traffic when network congestion happens. We extend the functionality of the Controlling PoC Server to accommodate the location information of PoC Clients by co-operating the location management server, which also communicates with the location reporting and packet forwarding agent node. By minimizing the <b>outbound</b> voice <b>traffic</b> of the PoC server, we improve the overall performance in terms of the end-to-end quality which is derived from the E-model. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing PoC scheme when network congestion happens...|$|R

2500|$|From {{the opening}} of the Waimate Branch, a shuttle service {{operated}} between Waimate and the main line at Studholme, while a daily mixed train ran between Waihao Downs and Waimate. [...] Motive power on the Waimate Gorge Branch was provided by FA class tank locomotives for many years, primarily by FA 10, FA 41, and FA 251. [...] Due to Waimate's status as the central town of the surrounding region, it attracted inbound freight from over 160km away, and most <b>outbound</b> <b>traffic</b> went to Timaru or Oamaru and the wharves located in those two centres. [...] Waimate is known for its berry gardens, and {{at the height of the}} season in 1898, an average of five wagons of strawberries were railed out of Waimate daily. [...] Passenger traffic on the line ceased and was replaced by buses on 9 February 1931, and around this time, the locomotive depot in Waihao Downs was closed and the Waimate Gorge Branch's regular daily mixed train was replaced by a goods service when required. [...] Passenger trains did not become wholly absent from the Waimate Branch, as picnic trains still ran on occasions.|$|E

40|$|Although endosomal {{compartments}} {{have been}} suggested {{to play a role}} in unconventional protein secretion, there is scarce experimental evidence for such involvement. Here we report that recycling endosomes are essential for externalization of cytoplasmic secretory protein tissue transglutaminase (tTG). The de novo synthesized cytoplasmic tTG does not follow the classical ER/Golgi-dependent secretion pathway, but is targeted to perinuclear recycling endosomes, and is delivered inside these vesicles prior to externalization. On its route to the cell surface tTG interacts with internalized b 1 integrins inside the recycling endosomes and is secreted as a complex with recycled b 1 integrins. Inactivation of recycling endosomes, blocking endosome fusion with the plasma membrane, or downregulation of Rab 11 GTPase that controls <b>outbound</b> <b>trafficking</b> of perinuclear recycling endosomes, all abrogate tTG secretion. The initial recruitment of cytoplasmic tTG to recycling endosomes and subsequent externalization depend on its binding to phosphoinositides on endosomal membranes. These findings begin to unravel the unconventional mechanism of tTG secretion which utilizes the long loop of endosoma...|$|R
