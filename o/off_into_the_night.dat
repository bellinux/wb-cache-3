5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Hancock is shot {{twice in}} the chest and wounded when he foils a liquor store robbery. After being hospitalized, Mary enters and {{explains}} that as each pair of immortals pair up, they begin to lose their powers and live out the remainder of their lives as ordinary humans, growing old and eventually dying. She then begins to point out various scars that Hancock has acquired over the centuries, the result of his normally heroic nature. She also explains that Hancock was savagely attacked in an alley 80 years prior, which caused his amnesia. In each instance, Mary chose to leave him in order for him to regain his powers and recover from his injuries. However, upon discovering he had no memory, Mary couldn't handle it and left. The conversation is interrupted when the hospital is raided by Red Parker, and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary is caught in the cross-fire and is mortally wounded. Hancock is able to stop and kill the two men but suffers additional injuries in the process. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary dying, Hancock flees the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her own powers. He makes several clumsy leaps away from the hospital, each of longer distance and duration as his powers slowly return, until he finally is able to fly <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> He later takes up residence in New York City. Ray is seen walking with Mary and their son discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner. In gratitude to Ray, Hancock has painted Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up to view the worldwide advertisement.|$|E

25|$|Southern Television's logo is {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} a compass, what with the directional station name {{and the fact that the}} bottom point on the logo is longest – thereby suggesting a compass pointing south, in the direction of Southern Television's service area. However, the general consensus is that it is a star, named after the Southern Star and because Southern Television's final transmission showed the logo zooming <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> sky. For the purposes of this article, the logo will be referred to as a star, to reflect what it is most popularly called.|$|E

50|$|At {{seven o'clock}} {{the crew of}} the “Little Guide,” a small craft, saw the balloon about thirty miles from shore, {{trailing}} the car through the water, and tried to reach it; but before this could be done, the balloon, as if suddenly relieved of some weight, shot up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air again and <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance. <b>Night</b> came on, and, with the cooling gas and natural loss of buoyancy, the luckless aeronauts doubtless came down upon the lake again.

The body of Grimwood was washed ashore on the farther side of the lake, and was found on 16 August. Donaldson never was found, nor any part of the balloon.|$|R
5000|$|Potter {{was first}} {{discovered}} lurking among the mossy rocks and echoing grottoes of the Forest of Dean, fit backdrop, he explained, {{to introduce a}} play full of [...] "the stonily mysterious landscapes of both my own childhood and all our fairytale-ridden memories." [...] He urged us lullingly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world of dream: [...] "Cast your mind back to the dusky evenings of childhood. Your eyelids are drooping ... the warm, cosy house is preparing itself to drift <b>off,</b> unanchored, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> ... <b>the</b> realm of once upon a time." [...] Megaliths and memory, ferns and faerie: such was the world of Cymbeline. Elijah Moshinsky, the director, obviously hadn't heard. Faerie was out; rocks were off; stonily mysterious landscapes could get stuffed. Ancient Britain in the reign of Augustus Caesar became a foppish 17th-century court, with nods to Rembrandt, Van Dyck and (when Helen Mirren {{was caught in a}} certain light and a certain dress) Vermeer. The fairytale Mr Potter had promised became a play of court intrigue and modern passion: a sort of offcut from Othello.|$|R
2500|$|Though Captain Joseph Brearethe Home Guard commanderattempted to {{take charge}} of the town's defense, Carmichael defied his orders to gather {{on the west side of}} the {{courthouse}} square, and instead posted himself and nine friends east of the square, where they ambushed Sanders and his troop as they rode into town. [...] Opening up on them simultaneously in the darkness from in front and behind, the ten Newtonians managed to scare Sanders' men bad enough that they bolted for the edge of town and rode <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> [...] The courthouse at Newton was saved, and though completely unimportant in the larger scheme of things, Carmichael and his men could still claim that they'd whipped a 'Yankee' outfit four times their size.|$|E
2500|$|As Raimi and his {{producing}} partner Robert Tapert progressed {{through various}} drafts, {{they realized that}} there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and [...] "lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions." [...] Goldin said that they [...] "spent {{a lot of time talking}} and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story." [...] The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, [...] "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disagreeing with Breare's approach, {{and unable}} to dissuade him from this course of action, Carmichael took nine {{of his friends and}} {{arranged}} them to the east of the square: Carmichael and three of the men took up positions near a hotel, while the other six formed up further down in a side street between the hotel and the square. [...] Sanders and his company rode into Newton from the southeast at full gallop, yelling [...] "huzzah, huzzah; here we are!" [...] and heading for the courthouse. [...] Carmichael and his outfit let them pass, then opened up on them from behind with double-barrelled shotguns and rifles while their friends up ahead simultaneously fired into the front of the attacking column. [...] Thoroughly alarmed by this unexpected development, the attackers bolted for the edge of town and rode <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> reportedly hampered by malfunctioning pistols and rifles as they tried to return fire. [...] A one-handed ex-corporal and his nine friends had routed a Union cavalry force four times their size—on foot and in the dark. [...] Not one of Carmichael's men was hurt or killed, while Breare's men {{on the other side of}} the square never got off a shot. Sanders, for his part, reported three dead and five wounded among his troops.|$|E

Only the player saw the UFOs as UFOs—the enemies the player fought against knew they were actually pieces of the ship.

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "HeartBreaker" [...] parodies old sci-fi films, as it commences with a low-budget flying saucer {{hovering}} {{through the air}} and abducting a cow. The scene then cuts to inside the saucer, where the Teriyaki Boyz materialize and begin performing, with Nigo in the center on the turntable. Throughout the song, each of the Teriyaki Boyz are introduced one by one using caption for their individual verses and don a variety of Bape outfits. As they perform, random objects appear within the room, including a bottle of champagne, a plastic chicken, the aforementioned cow, and car and young woman, both wearing Bape-style camouflage. The video also parodies rockabilly music, having certain scenes feature the group playing and swinging to guitars while stereotypically dressed in matching suits and dark sunglasses. The music video concludes with the flying saucer lifting <b>off</b> and disappearing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> sky.|$|R
