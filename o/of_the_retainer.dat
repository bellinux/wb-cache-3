30|$|One hundred seven {{questionnaires}} {{in total}} with 28 multiple-choice questions {{were sent to}} all members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian Orthodontic Society.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{long-term}} outcome 9 years after removal {{of two different}} types of fixed retainers used for stabilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular anterior segment. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four children who had undergone orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances in both arches were divided into two groups depending on which kind of retainer being used. Twenty-eight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients had a canine-to-canine <b>retainer</b> bonded to <b>the</b> canines and 36 had a bonded twistflex retainer 3 - 3, bonded to each tooth. Measurements were made on study models and lateral head radiographs, before and after treatment, 6 years after treatment, and 12 years after treatment, with a mean of 9. 2 years after removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retainers.</b> Results: No {{significant differences were found between}} the two groups at the long-term follow-up according to Little's Irregularity Index or available space for the mandibular incisors. The overjet and overbite were reduced after treatment in both groups and stayed stable throughout the observation period. Also, no differences in bonding failures between <b>the</b> two <b>retainers</b> were found. Conclusions: Both a canine-to-canine retainer bonded only to the canines and a twistflex retainer 3 - 3 bonded to each tooth can be recommended. However, neither <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retention types prevented long-term changes of mandibular incisor irregularity or available space for the mandibular incisors after removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retainers...</b>|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (Version 15.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> final {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abutment changes with <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> tightening torque. This could {{eventually lead to}} loss of passivity and marginal misfit <b>of</b> prostheses. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} evaluate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> three different tightening torques on <b>the</b> marginal adaptation <b>of</b> 3 -unit cement-retained implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). Materials and Methods: Two implants (Straumann) were inserted in an acrylic block so that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implants was placed vertically and the other at a 15 ° vertical angle. A straight abutment and a 15 ° angulated abutment were connected to the vertically and obliquely installed implants, respectively, so that the two abutments were parallel. Then, 10 cement-retained FDPs were waxed and cast. Abutments were tightened with 10, 20, and 35 Ncm torques, respectively. Following each tightening torque, FDPs were luted on respective abutments with temporary cement. <b>The</b> marginal adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retainers</b> was evaluated using stereomicroscope. FDPs were then removed from the abutments and were sectioned at the connector sites. <b>The</b> <b>retainers</b> were luted again on their respective abutments. Luting procedures and marginal adaptation measurement were repeated. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and least significant difference tests (α = 0. 05). After cutting the FDP connectors, the independent samples t-test was used to compare misfit values (α = 0. 05). Results: Following 10, 20, and 35 Ncm tightening torques, <b>the</b> marginal discrepancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retainers</b> <b>of</b> FDPs significantly increased (P 0. 05). The marginal gap values of angulated abutment retainers (ANRs) were significantly higher than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> straight abutment after cutting the connectors (P = 0. 026). Conclusion: Within <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> this study, <b>the</b> marginal misfit <b>of</b> cement-retained FDPs increased continuously when the tightening torque increased. After cutting the connectors, <b>the</b> marginal misfit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ANRs was higher than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> straight abutment <b>retainers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{authorization}} {{does not}} necessarily have to be explicit. It can be inferred from the terms or nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> agreement.

50|$|To a large degree, many of {{the extant}} legal records from the Germanic tribes seem to revolve around {{property}} transactions.

This system of sworn retainers was central to early Germanic society, and the loyalty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> to his lord generally replaced his family ties.|$|E

5000|$|S.O.Y. Keita and A.J. Boyce, {{authors of}} Variation in Porotic Hyperostosis in the Royal Cemetery Complex at Abydos, Upper Egypt: A Social Interpretation, {{examined}} forty-four skulls from the funerary complex of King Djer {{and discovered that}} those buried outside the tomb enjoyed better health {{than those in the}} actual tomb. This can be interpreted in two ways. First, those buried outside the tomb were believed to have enjoyed better health because they were wealthier, and consequently, had better nutritional standards. The second is that those buried inside the royal tomb could afford {{to take care of their}} illness-ridden children. Whichever explanation is correct, there is such a statistically significant difference that these two groups most likely did not share the same social status.Of the twelve sacrificed and buried in the three surrounding tombs of King Aha’s funerary complex, all identifiable retainers “were all male and around twenty years of age.” [...] Morris suggests that these retainers, due to their gender, youth, and how they were buried, “regimented alignment in straight rows,” were possibly a military guard, buried with the king to protect and serve him in the afterlife. Dr. Laurel Bestock, one of the archeologists on the New York University, Yale, and University of Pennsylvania team, recalled that the people buried in King Aha’s complex were not just lowly servants, but were also rich nobles.Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> sacrifices in the surrounding tombs of the funerary complex of King Djer at Abydos were female and probably consisted of “the king’s subsidiary wives, concubines, relatives, or maidservants.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{two types}} of fixed {{orthodontic}} retainers (a multi-stranded wire retainer and a modified retainer) in relation to established periodontal parameters. <b>The</b> multi-stranded wire <b>retainer</b> is commonly used, and <b>the</b> modified <b>retainer</b> has bends to enable free access of dental floss to interproximal areas.
