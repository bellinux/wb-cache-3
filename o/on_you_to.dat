25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E

500|$|In 1967 and 1968, Zappa {{made two}} {{appearances}} with the Monkees. The first appearance {{was on an}} episode of their TV series, [...] "The Monkees Blow Their Minds", where Zappa, dressed up as Mike Nesmith, interviews Nesmith who is dressed up as Zappa. After the interview, Zappa destroys {{a car with a}} sledgehammer as the song [...] "Mother People" [...] plays. He later provided a cameo in the Monkees' movie Head where, leading a cow, he tells Davy Jones [...] "the youth of America depends <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> show them the way." [...] Zappa had respect for what the Monkees were doing, and offered Micky Dolenz a position in the Mothers. RCA/Columbia/Colgems would not allow Dolenz out of his contract.|$|E

500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In {{response}} to the minister's fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, [...] "Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? Go back to your people and tell them to get some rest if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow and I do not give you fighting enough, I will never call <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come again." [...] Stark's forces again swelled the next day with the arrival of some Stockbridge Indians, bringing his force (excluding Warner's men) to nearly 2,000 men.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the music}} was written by Cute Is What We Aim For, while all of the lyrics were written by Hacikyan. Typically, when Hacikyan wrote lyrics he had a melody in mind, which the band fit the music around. Hacikyan {{described}} the album as being about [...] "the everyday ins-and-outs of social cliques. It’s about the pressure that they put <b>on</b> <b>you,</b> <b>to</b> live up to something that you’re not, to be somebody that someone else wants you to be." [...] The Academy Is... vocalist William Beckett provides guest vocals on [...] "There's a Class for This," [...] while All Time Low performed group vocals on [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)" [...] and [...] "Sweet Talk 101." [...] Hacikyan described Beckett as [...] "definitely an idol of mine." [...] Beckett was unable {{to come to the}} studio to record his part as he was on tour at the time. Instead, his part was recorded at the back of a tour bus and sent to the band.|$|E
500|$|Less than an {{hour before}} the {{independence}} ceremony a Belgian officer arrived to request that Lumumba depart for parliament. Kasongo was disturbed by what Lumumba planned to say and told Kanza as he left, [...] "I'm counting <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do your best to tone down that speech." [...] As Lumumba dressed, Kanza and one of the secretaries, André Mandi, read through as much of the speech as they could, replacing some individual words with less inflammatory language and crossing out several full paragraphs deemed too difficult to temper. Lumumba then left in a motorcade for his official residence to rendezvous {{with the rest of his}} government. Kanza and Mandi followed in the second car, making additional revisions to the speech. These were so extensive that both feared Lumumba would be unable to clearly read his remarks. Upon their arrival at the residence, Kanza and Mandi briefly explained their alterations to Lumumba. Greatly pleased with the result, Lumumba stated that he would read some parts of the speech verbatim, then improvise to respond to the atmosphere in the room as he saw fit. He made his own alterations to the script during the speeches given by Baudouin and Kasa-Vubu.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} her career, Chambers {{appeared}} {{primarily in}} independent films, including her last role in Solitaire. Chambers claimed that the more laid-back pace of these roles suited her as [...] "there's a lot less pressure <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> perform [...] you don't have to be young and skinny". Among these were Bikini Bistro, Angel of H.E.A.T. (with Mary Woronov), Party Incorporated, and Breakfast in Bed.|$|E
2500|$|Abbott {{formally}} {{announced his}} re-election campaign on July 14, 2017. He chose the Amtrak depot at historic Sunset Station in San Antonio for his formal announcement of candidacy: [...] "I've proven that I'm {{willing to take}} on the liberals, I'm {{willing to take on}} Washington, D.C., and I'm counting <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have my back." [...] Several protesters were led out of the hall before Abbott began speaking. The formal announcement came four days before the beginning of a special legislative session that could split the Republican Party into factions favoring Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Patrick, on one hand, and House Speaker [...] Joe Straus, a Moderate Republican who opposes much of the Abbott-Patrick conservative agenda.|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama's 2008 {{political}} platform endorsed {{the repeal of}} DOMA. On June 12, 2009, the Justice Department issued a brief defending the constitutionality of DOMA {{in the case of}} Smelt v. United States, continuing its longstanding practice of defending all federal laws challenged in court. On June 15, 2009, Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese wrote an open letter to Obama that asked for actions to balance the DOJ's courtroom position: [...] "We call <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> put your principles into action and send legislation repealing DOMA to Congress." [...] A representative of Lambda Legal, an LGBT impact litigation and advocacy organization, noted that the Obama administration's legal arguments omitted the Bush administration's assertion that households headed by opposite-sex spouses were better at raising children than those headed by same-sex spouses.|$|E

2500|$|On April 25, 2007, after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{declared}} [...] "the war is lost", Hunter wrote [...] "my highest obligation is, like yours, owed to {{our forces}} in uniform, especially {{during this time}} of war... Given your position of leadership within the United States Government, I find your pronouncement of failure irresponsible and dissering to America's armed forces. In {{light of the fact}} that this statement has both been used by our adversaries and has exhibited a marked lack of leadership to U.S. troops, I call <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> resign your leadership position". Hunter further wrote that Reid's declaration [...] "can have no effect but to demoralize the brave men and women, who are honorably fulfilling their mission in Iraq, and to encourage our adversaries... Even if you sincerely believe it to be true, your pronouncement of failure will undoubtedly be used by terrorist leaders to rally their followers – inevitably leading to increased attacks on U.S. and coalition forces".|$|E
2500|$|O'Malley {{supported}} a bill {{considered by the}} General Assembly to legalize same-sex marriage in Maryland, even though Archbishop of Baltimore Edwin O'Brien had urged him as a Catholic not to support the bill in a private letter sent two days before O'Malley voiced his support. [...] "I am well aware that the recent events in New York have intensified pressure <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> lend your active support to legislation to redefine marriage," [...] O'Brien wrote. [...] "As advocates for the truths we are compelled to uphold, we speak with equal intensity and urgency in opposition to your promoting a goal that so deeply conflicts with your faith, {{not to mention the}} best interests of our society." [...] O'Malley responded, [...] "I do not presume, nor would I ever presume as Governor, to question or infringe upon your freedom to define, to preach about, and to administer the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. But on the public issue of granting equal civil marital rights to same-sex couples, you and I disagree." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gippius saw the October Revolution {{as the end}} of Russia and {{the coming}} of the Kingdom of Antichrist. [...] "It felt as if some pillow fell <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> strangle... Strangle what — the city? The country? No, {{something}} much, much bigger," [...] — she wrote in her 26 October 1917, diary entry. In late 1917 Gippius was still able to publish her anti-Bolshevik verses in what remained of the old newspapers, but the next year was nightmarish, according to her Diaries. Ridiculing H. G. Wells ("I can see why he is so attracted to the Bolsheviks: they’ve leapfrogged him"), she wrote of Cheka atrocities ("In Kiev 1200 officers killed; legs severed, boots taken off." [...] — 23 February. [...] "In Rostov teenager cadets shot down — for being mistakenly taken for Constitutional Democratic Party cadets, the banned ones." [...] — 17 March), of mass hunger and her own growing feeling of dull indifference. [...] "Those who still have a soul in them walk around like corpses: neither protesting, nor suffering, waiting for nothing, bodies and souls slumped into hunger-induced dormancy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three days later, at 22:30 8 February, the Japanese {{began their}} assault on Singapore Island, {{landing on the}} north-west coast against Australian opposition. The {{division}} was ordered to remain {{where it had been}} posted in case of a second landing and took no part in the initial fighting. After two days of fighting, Churchill cabled Wavell, [...] "The 18th Division has a chance to make its name in history. Commanders and senior officers should die with their troops. The honour of the British Empire and of the British Army is at stake. I rely <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> show no mercy to weakness in any form". The character of Churchill's message was then relayed via Wavell to the troops. During the day, by which time Percival had drawn up a provisional plan to withdraw to a smaller perimeter around Singapore, the division was committed piecemeal to the defence. The 5th Battalion, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment was taken from the division and assigned to the 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade, while additional forces were used to create two ad hoc formations: Tomforce and Massy Force. The rest of the division remaining in its sector.|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have heard}} the order, and I must confess are in a pretty {{condition}} to obey it. I will have to return it with the endorsement upon the back that 'the First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy', despite being given orders by General Jackson. Before this day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything else. Shame <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> bring this stigma upon the fair name of your native state - to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided to your keeping their most sacred trust - their honor {{and that of the}} glorious Old State. Marylanders you call yourselves - profane not that hallowed name again, for it is not yours. What Marylander ever before threw down his arms and deserted his colors {{in the presence of the}} enemy, and those arms, and those colors too, placed in your hands by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced her honored history. Could it be possible to conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more damnable? Go home and publish to the world your infamy. Boast of it when you meet your fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts. Tell them it was you who, when brought face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants, and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards. Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised, detested, nay abhorred, by those whose confidence you have so shamefully betrayed; you will wander over the face of the earth with the brand of 'coward', 'traitor', indelibly imprinted on your foreheards, and in the end sink into a dishonored grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of every honest man and virtuous woman in the land." ...|$|E
