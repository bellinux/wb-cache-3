2500|$|An ocular prosthesis, {{artificial}} eye or glass eye {{is a type}} of craniofacial prosthesis that replaces an absent natural eye following an enucleation, evisceration, or orbital exenteration. The prosthesis fits over an orbital implant and under the eyelids. [...] Though often referred to as a glass eye, the ocular prosthesis roughly takes the shape of a convex shell and is made of medical grade plastic acrylic. A few <b>ocular</b> <b>prostheses</b> today are made of cryolite glass. A variant of the ocular prosthesis is a very thin hard shell known as a scleral shell which can be worn over a damaged or eviscerated eye. Makers of ocular prosthetics are known as ocularists. An ocular prosthesis does not provide vision; this would be a visual prosthesis. Someone with an ocular prosthesis is totally blind on the affected side and has monocular (one sided) vision.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Many {{patients}} {{are satisfied with}} their <b>ocular</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> but some describe problems with social interactions, body image and self-esteem. Although both clinical practice and research suggest that the severity of a disfiguring condition does not predict distress, {{there has been little}} research with patients living with an <b>ocular</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The objective was to explore the psychological impact of living with an artificial eye or cosmetic shell and determine the relationship between psychological well-being and clinical and psychosocial factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study between March and September 2008 at the <b>ocular</b> <b>prosthesis</b> clinic of Moorfields Eye Hospital, UK. The primary outcome measures were mood as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and appearance-related social anxiety and social avoidance, as measured by the Derriford Appearance Scale (DAS 24). Results: Mean scores on the HADS and DAS 24 were within normal range, but a considerable proportion of participants were experiencing significant levels of distress. Psychosocial adjustment was unrelated to most clinical and demographic variables, but was associated with a series of cognitive processes. Conclusions: Psychological variables, rather than clinical or demographic factors, are associated with how a patient adjusts to wearing an <b>ocular</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Such factors might be amenable to change through psychosocial intervention. ...|$|R

50|$|Anophthalmia {{has been}} {{reported}} to be present in 3 out of every 100,000 births. Many instances of anophthalmia also occur with microphthalmia. A recent study in the UK indicated that anophthalmia and microphthalmia had a combined average of 1 in every 10,000 births. The annual rate of occurrence of anophthalmia/microphthalmia in the United States is about 780 children born/year. The most extensive epidemiological survey on this congenital malformation has been carried out by Dharmasena et al and using English National Hospital Episode Statistics, they calculated the annual incidence of anophthalmia, microphthalmia and congenital malformations of orbit/lacrimal apparatus from 1999 to 2011. According to this study the incidence of congenital anophthalmia ranged from 2.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.0) per 100 000 infants in 1999 to 0.4 (0 to 1.3) in 2011. Parents that already have a child who suffers from anophthalmia has a 1 in 8 chance of having another child with anophthalmia. Approximately 2/3 of all cases of anophthalmia are determined to be of genetic basis. Anophthalmia {{is one of the leading}} causes of congenital blindness and accounts for 3-11% of blindness in children.
