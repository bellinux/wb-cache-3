25|$|In {{the decade}} that followed, the union fought off employers' efforts {{to impose the}} <b>open</b> <b>shop,</b> which {{would have made it}} very {{difficult}} for the union to maintain the standards and membership it had won. While the <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> drive may have stalled the Carpenters' growth during the decade, it did not cause the severe membership losses and wage cuts that other unions suffered.|$|E
25|$|An <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> {{does not}} require union {{membership}} in employing or keeping workers. Where a union is active, workers who do not contribute to a union may include those who approve of the union contract (free riders) {{and those who do}} not. In the United States, state level right-to-work laws mandate the <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> in some states. In Germany only open shops are legal; that is, all discrimination based on union membership is forbidden. This affects the function and services of the union.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, {{officials}} of U.S. Steel and the American Bridge Company founded the National Erectors' Association, {{a coalition of}} steel and iron industry employers. The primary goal of the National Erectors' Association was to promote the <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> and assist employers in breaking the unions in their industries. Employers used labor spies, agents provocateurs, private detective agencies, and strike breakers {{to engage in a}} campaign of union busting. Local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies generally cooperated in this campaign, which often used violence against union members. Hard pressed by the <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> campaign, the Iron Workers reacted by electing the militant Frank M. Ryan president and John J. McNamara the secretary-treasurer in 1905. In 1906, the Iron Workers struck at American Bridge in an attempt to retain their contract. However, the <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> movement was a significant success. By 1910, U.S. Steel had almost succeeded in driving all unions out of its plants. Unions in other iron manufacturing companies also vanished. Only the Iron Workers held on (though the strike at American Bridge continued).|$|E

25|$|The 1923 San Pedro Maritime {{strike was}} the biggest {{challenge}} to {{the dominance of the}} <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> philosophy that controlled Los Angeles until the 1930s. It was defeated without too much of a struggle because of the strength the shop owners, use of the Los Angeles Police Department, KKK, and others as enforcers to try and break the strike. Another factor which helped defeat the strike was the high amount of strikebreakers who were brought into the city from all other parts of the state, which helped keep the docks open enough to allow commercial business to take place. The <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> would remain the ideology that ran Los Angeles for another 15 years.|$|E

25|$|Los Angeles {{employers}} {{had been}} successfully resisting unionization {{for nearly half}} a century. Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, was vehemently anti-union. Otis first joined and then seized control of the local Merchants Association in 1896, renaming it the Merchants and Manufacturers' Association (colloquially known as the M), and using it and his newspaper's large circulation to spearhead a 20-year campaign to end the city's few remaining unions. Without unions to keep wages high, <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> employers in Los Angeles were able to undermine the wage standards set in heavily unionized San Francisco. Unions in San Francisco feared that employers in their city would also soon begin pressing for wage cuts and start an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> drive of their own. The only solution they saw was to re-unionize Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Omaha has a {{long history}} of labor unrest and {{conflict}} between management and workers. As a long-time <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> the city gained the reputation for actively breaking unions; however, with the loss of large-scale railroad operations and meat production, the labor-driven protests, rioting and civil unrest of the past appears to be gone.|$|E
25|$|The {{sticking}} {{point in the}} strike was recognition: the union demanded a closed shop, a coastwide contract and a union hiring hall. The employers offered to arbitrate the dispute, but insisted that the union agree to an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> {{as a condition of}} any agreement to arbitrate. The longshoremen rejected the proposal to arbitrate.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time that the L.A. Times was {{whipping}} up enthusiasm for the expansion of Los Angeles it was also trying to turn it into a union-free or <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> town. Fruit growers and local merchants who had opposed the Pullman strike in 1894 subsequently formed the Merchants and Manufacturers Association (M & M) to support the L.A. Times anti-union campaign.|$|E
25|$|<b>Open</b> <b>shop</b> {{scheduling}} is {{a problem}} of scheduling production processes, in which there are a set of objects to be manufactured, each object has a set of tasks to be performed on it (in any order), and each task must be performed on a specific machine, preventing any other task that requires the same machine from being performed at the same time. If all tasks have the same length, then this problem may be formalized as one of edge coloring a bipartite multigraph, in which the vertices {{on one side of the}} bipartition represent the objects to be manufactured, the vertices on the other side of the bipartition represent the manufacturing machines, the edges represent tasks that must be performed, and the colors represent time steps in which each task may be performed. Since bipartite edge coloring may be performed in polynomial time, the same is true for this restricted case of <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> scheduling.|$|E

25|$|These {{fissures}} {{contributed to}} an extent {{to the failure of}} the Iron Workers' New York City strike, called in 1921 to resist the American Plan, the <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> movement that reversed much of the labor movement's gains, particularly in construction, of the previous decade. When the strike failed, the union sued the employers, also without success. The union survived, but in a much weaker state.|$|E
25|$|In 1910, Los Angeles {{was still}} an <b>open</b> <b>shop,</b> and {{employers}} in the north threatened for a new push to open San Francisco shops. Responding, labor sent delegations south in June 1910. National organizers were sent in during a lockout of 1,200 idled metal-trades workers. Then occurred an incident that would set back Los Angeles organizing for years: on October 10, 1910, a bomb exploded at the Los Angeles Times newspaper plant that killed 21 workers.|$|E
25|$|The labor {{movement}} in Los Angeles collapsed. Employers refused to honor additional {{terms of the}} plea agreement, which required the convening of a meeting of labor union and employers {{and an end to}} the <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> campaign. Instead, employers redoubled their efforts to break the {{labor movement}} in Los Angeles. The Central Labor Council suffered severe membership losses in the early months of 1912, and the labor movement in the city did not begin to show signs of growth until the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|The ILA faced competition, {{particularly}} from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which {{had a number of}} members on the West Coast, where many workers moved into longshoring from other centers of IWW strength, such as the lumber and mining industries, and in Philadelphia, where the IWW remained a force after the prosecution and conviction of many of its leaders in 1919 largely destroyed the organization. The ILA survived, even after an <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> campaign on the West Coast and a failed strike in New York City in 1919 left it much weakened.|$|E
25|$|Formation of the Structural Building Trades Alliance was {{prompted}} {{by a series of}} strikes {{and the beginning of the}} <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> movement in 1903. A wave of jurisdictional strikes in 1903 all but shut down construction in most major cities in the United States. Building contractor associations were also forming in several large cities, forcing unions to accept contracts which prohibited sympathy strikes, banned restrictions on the kind of work an employee might perform, and permitted the unlimited introduction of new machinery, materials and working methods. Employers were also pushing hard for an end to the closed shop, which threatened unions' membership gains.|$|E
25|$|Employers also {{organized}} {{during the}} building trades strike of 1900 and the (San Francisco) City Front Federation strike of 1901, {{which led to}} the founding of the Building Trades Council. The <b>open</b> <b>shop</b> question was at stake. Out of the City Front strike came the Union Labor Party, because workers were angry at the mayor for using the police to protect strikebreakers. Eugene Schmitz was elected mayor in 1902 on the party's ticket, making San Francisco the only town in the United States, for a time, to be run by labor. A combination of corruption and unscrupulous reformers culminated in graft prosecutions in 1907.|$|E
