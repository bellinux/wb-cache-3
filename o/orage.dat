25|$|Alfred Richard <b>Orage</b> (1873-1934) was an {{influential}} British editor {{best known for}} the magazine New Age. He began attending Ouspensky's London talks in 1921 then met Gurdjieff when the latter first visited London early in 1922. Shortly thereafter, <b>Orage</b> sold New Age and relocated to Gurdjieff's institute at the Prieré and in 1924 was appointed by Gurdjieff to lead the institute's branch in New York. After Gurdjieff’s nearly fatal automobile accident in July 1924 and because of his prolonged recuperation during 1924 and intense writing period for several years, <b>Orage</b> continued in New York until 1931. During this period, <b>Orage</b> was responsible for editing the English typescript of Beelzebub's Tales (1931) and Meetings with Remarkable Men (1963) as Gurdjieff' assistant. This period is described in some detail by Paul Beekman Tayloy in his Gurdjieff and Orage: Brothers in Elysium (2001).|$|E
25|$|Gurdjieff's notable {{personal}} students include P. D. Ouspensky, Olga de Hartmann, Thomas de Hartmann, Jane Heap, Jeanne de Salzmann, Willem Nyland, Lord Pentland (Henry John Sinclair), John G. Bennett, Alfred Richard <b>Orage,</b> Maurice Nicoll, and Rene Daumal.|$|E
25|$|Gurdjieff had {{significant}} influence on some artists, writers, and thinkers, including Walter Inglis Anderson, Peter Brook, Kate Bush, Darby Crash, Muriel Draper, Robert Fripp, Keith Jarrett, Timothy Leary, Dennis Lewis, James Moore, A. R. <b>Orage,</b> P. D. Ouspensky, Maurice Nicoll, Louis Pauwels, Robert S de Ropp, George Russell, David Sylvian, Jean Toomer, Jeremy Lane, Therion, P. L.

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1930s, Boyer mainly {{continued}} making French films, and Mayerling, co-starring Danielle Darrieux in 1936, {{made him an}} international star. This was followed by <b>Orage</b> (1938), opposite Michèle Morgan. The offscreen Boyer was bookish and private, {{far removed from the}} Hollywood high life. But onscreen he made audiences swoon as he romanced Katharine Hepburn in Break of Hearts (1935), Marlene Dietrich in his first Technicolor film, The Garden of Allah (1936), Jean Arthur in History Is Made at Night (1937), Greta Garbo in Conquest (1937), and Irene Dunne in Love Affair (1939).|$|E
25|$|In October 1922 Mansfield {{moved to}} Georges Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in Fontainebleau, France, {{where she was}} put {{under the care of}} Olgivanna Lazovitch Hinzenburg (who later married Frank Lloyd Wright). As a guest rather than a pupil of Gurdjieff, Mansfield was not {{required}} {{to take part in the}} rigorous routine of the institute, but she spent much of her time there with her mentor, Alfred Richard <b>Orage,</b> and her last letters inform Murry of her attempts to apply some of Gurdjieff's teachings to her own life.|$|E
25|$|In August 1921 and 1922, Gurdjieff {{travelled}} around western Europe, lecturing {{and giving}} demonstrations {{of his work}} in various cities, such as Berlin and London. He attracted the allegiance of Ouspensky's many prominent pupils (notably the editor A. R. <b>Orage).</b> After an unsuccessful attempt to gain British citizenship, Gurdjieff established the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man south of Paris at the Prieuré des Basses Loges in Avon near the famous Château de Fontainebleau. The once-impressive but somewhat crumbling mansion set in extensive grounds housed an entourage of several dozen, including some of Gurdjieff's remaining relatives and some White Russian refugees.|$|E

25|$|Maurice Nicoll (1884-1953) was a Harley Street {{psychiatrist}} and Carl Jung's delegate in London. Along with <b>Orage</b> he attended Ouspensky's 1921 London talks {{where he met}} Gurdjieff. With his wife Catherine and their new-born daughter, he spent almost a year at Gurdjieff's Prieuré institute. A year later, {{when they returned to}} London, Nicoll rejoined Ouspensky's group. In 1931, on Ouspensky's advice he started his own Fourth Way groups in England. He is best known for the encyclopedic six volume series of articles in Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky (Boston: Shambhala, 1996, and Samuel Weiser Inc., 1996).|$|E
25|$|At Fate, Dominique celebrates Sion's {{one year}} anniversary as a bouncer by {{giving him a}} pendant. However, Mikado Special Forces led by Mugetsu storm the bar and abduct her. Volt says they will have taken her to the Mikado Building, and Kou calls Leann, {{learning}} there is a train heading for the building in thirty minutes. Leann promises she will back him up in her ship, the <b>Orage.</b> Kou, Sion and Volt catch the train, which is carrying rocket fuel for {{the launch of the}} satellite. On board, they meet Echidna, who is shocked to see Volt. They fight and defeat her, and she jumps from the train into a river.|$|E
25|$|Before the First World War Leeds was {{the home}} of an unusual modernist arts organisation, called the Leeds Arts Club, founded by Alfred <b>Orage,</b> which lasted from 1903 to 1923. Notable members {{included}} Jacob Kramer, Herbert Read, Frank Rutter and Michael Sadler. As well as advocating a radical political agenda, supporting the Suffragettes, the Independent Labour Party and the Fabian Society, and promoting the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, the Leeds Arts Club was almost unique in Britain as being an exponent of German Expressionist ideas about art and culture. As a result, it staged very early British exhibitions of work by European expressionist artists, such as Wassily Kandinsky, showing their work in the city as early as 1913, and produced its own English Expressionist artists, including Jacob Kramer and Bruce Turner.|$|E

25|$|The 66th Division was {{to swing}} eastwards {{and form a}} {{defensive}} flank on the east slopes of the plateau, to defend against counter-attacks, while the 38th Division and the XXI Corps divisions on the left, descended from the plateau to the plain of the Ailette. A wheeling manoeuvre {{so close to the}} Germans was hazardous and made worse by the narrowness of no man's land in this area, which prevented French from bombarding the German defences with super-heavy artillery; on 23 October, many of the trenches, barbed-wire entanglements and machine-gun nests remained intact. The defences were held by the 5th Prussian Guard Regiment and in the Panthéon and <b>Orage</b> quarries, whose garrisons had been relieved the night before by the 5th and 8th companies of the 3rd Grenadier Regiment, who had not been seriously shaken by the preliminary bombardment.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the <b>Orage</b> {{attacks the}} train, causing the brakes to malfunction. The trio detach the car {{containing}} the rocket fuel and {{jump from the}} train, which crashes into the station underneath the Mikado Building. They work {{their way up the}} building and find Dominique in a dome structure. Nearby, Kaldea is playing the piano. After a moment, she gets up and morphs into a panther. Meanwhile, Dauragon orders Wong to transport Dominique to the shuttle Galeos. Wong protests, telling Dauragon he is using the Mikado Group for evil, something of which his father would not approve. Dauragon attacks Wong as the trio enter, and the dying Wong tells them Dauragon must be stopped. Dauragon then reveals that Dominique is his sister. He and the panther attack the trio, defeating them, and the floor falls out underneath them.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Anderson {{enrolled}} at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art (now Parsons School of Design), and after a year there, devoted {{to the study of}} commercial art and to exploration of New York's museums and galleries, won a scholarship to study at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Here (1924–1928) he would study under iconoclastic modernists like Henry McCarter and Arthur Carles, winning a Packard Award for his animal drawing and a Cresson Traveling Scholarship which allowed him to spend a summer in France, where (he said) he was more impressed by the art of the caves and of the cathedrals than by the art he had seen in museums. In the late 1920s, he became interested in the teachings of Gurdjieff and Alfred Richard <b>Orage,</b> whom he met in New York City while studying at the Academy. During his summer in France, he is thought to have visited Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man.|$|E

500|$|Pound persuaded {{his parents}} to finance his passage back to Europe. It was nearly 30 years before he visited the United States again. On 22 February 1911 he sailed from New York on the R.M.S. Mauretania, {{arriving}} in Southampton six days later. After {{a few days in}} London he went to Paris, where he worked on a new collection of poetry, Canzoni (1911), panned by the Westminster Gazette as a [...] "medley of pretension". When he returned to London in August 1911, A. R. <b>Orage,</b> editor of the socialist journal The New Age, hired him to write a weekly column, giving him a steady income.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "new age", {{along with}} related terms like [...] "new era" [...] and [...] "new world", long predate the {{emergence}} of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning. It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the Great Seal of the United States, designed in 1782, proclaims a [...] "new order of ages", while in the 1980s the Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev proclaimed that [...] "all mankind is entering a new age". The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward. [...] In 1864 the American Swedenborgian Warren Felt Evans published The New Age and its Message, while in 1907 Alfred <b>Orage</b> and Holbrook Jackson began editing a weekly journal of Christian liberalism and socialism titled The New Age. The concept of a coming [...] "new age" [...] that would be inaugurated by the [...] return to Earth of Jesus Christ was a theme in the poetry of Wellesley Tudor Pole and Johanna Brandt, and then also appeared {{in the work of the}} American Theosophist Alice Bailey, who used the term prominently in such titles as Disciplineship in the New Age (1944) and Education in the New Age (1954).|$|E
500|$|Clusters {{were also}} used on the organ, where they proved more {{versatile}} (or their composers more imaginative). Their most frequent use on this instrument was to evoke the sound of thunder, but also to portray sounds of battle, storms at sea, earthquakes, and Biblical scenes such as {{the fall of the}} walls of Jericho and visions of the apocalypse. The noisy sound nevertheless remained a special sound effect, and was not integrated into the general texture of the music. The earliest examples of [...] "organ thunder" [...] are from descriptions of improvisations by Abbé Vogler {{in the last quarter of}} the 18th century. His example was soon imitated by Justin Heinrich Knecht (Die durch ein Donerwetter [...] unterbrochne Hirtenwonne, 1794), Michel Corrette (who employed a length of wood on the pedal board and his elbow on the lowest notes of the keyboard during some improvisations), and also in composed works by Guillaume Lasceux (Te Deum: [...] "Judex crederis", 1786), Sigismond Neukomm (A Concert on a Lake, Interrupted by a Thunderstorm), Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély (Scène pastorale, 1867), Jacques Vogt (Fantaisie pastorale et <b>orage</b> dans les Alpes, ca. 1830), and Jules Blanc (La procession, 1859). The most notable 19th-composer to use such organ clusters was Giuseppe Verdi. The storm music which opens his opera Otello (1887) includes an organ cluster (C, C, D) that is also the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture.|$|E
5000|$|At {{this time}} {{he had already been}} {{published}} as a poet, in A. R. <b>Orage's</b> The New Age, and the final Sitwell Wheels anthology. He used the pseudonyms [...] "Jasper Proude" [...] and [...] "Charles Orange." [...] His verse also was in Oxford Poetry 1924. His poetry was admired and promoted by Edith Sitwell in the late 1920s.|$|R

In 1957, she published her first book La Première pierre, a collection of stories. She was awarded the Prix des Quatre-Jurys in 1971 for Je t'apporterai des <b>orages</b> and the Prix des Deux Magots for her 1974 novel Le Bateau du courrier.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Kensington, London, and educated at St Paul's School, then worked for a small {{publisher}} for a time. He then qualified as surveyor and estate agent, {{with a view to}} entering his father's business, which is still flourishing today. In 1901 he joined the Fabian Society, with which he was closely involved for about six years. From 1907 he wrote for A. R. <b>Orage's</b> The New Age. In 1908 he published an anonymous biography of his better-known brother, G. K. Chesterton, a Criticism, but his authorship was quickly discovered.|$|R
