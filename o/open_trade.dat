Mariano was the firstborn of the Moreno family, and had {{thirteen}} brothers. During his youth he studied Latin, logic, and philosophy at San Carlos Royal College, followed by college studies of law at Chuquisaca. During these studies, he learned the new ideas of the Spanish Enlightenment. He married María Guadalupe Cuenca and returned to Buenos Aires, becoming a prominent lawyer for the Cabildo. Unlike most other criollos, he rejected the Carlotist project and the administration of Santiago de Liniers, joining instead the ill-fated mutiny of Álzaga against him. He worked for the next viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. He wrote the economic paper The Representation of the Landowners, which persuaded the viceroy to <b>open</b> <b>trade</b> with Britain.|$|E

25|$|The Revolutionary War {{disrupted}} the deerskin trade, as {{the import of}} British manufactured goods with cut off. The deerskin trade {{had already begun to}} decline due to over-hunting of deer. The lack of trade caused the Native Americans to run out of items, such as guns, on which they depended. Some Indians, such as the Creeks, tried to reestablish trade with the Spanish in Florida, where some loyalists were hiding as well. When the war ended with the British retreating, many tribes who had fought on their side were now left unprotected and now had to make peace and new trading deals with the new country. Many Native Americans were subject to violence from the new Americans who sought to settle their territory. The new American government negotiated treaties that recognized prewar borders, such as those with the Choctaw and Chickasaw, and allowed <b>open</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E
25|$|Golovnin and {{his crew}} began {{plotting}} to escape (despite a great improvement of their treatment by the Japanese). However, {{one of the officers}} of German origin, Moor, had resolved to stay and pursue a life in Japan and had made significant progress in learning Japanese. In March 1812, the Governor received a letter stating new orders from Edo to burn any Russian ships and imprison their crews. Golovnin and the crew (without Moor) decide to make their escape into the mountains. The crew went through the mountains to the shore to find a boat to commandeer, but were arrested after eight days by soldiers and brought back into imprisonment. The new governor Oga-Sawara-Isseno-Kami, presented another letter from Chwostoff stating that his attack had been motivated by Japan's refusal to <b>open</b> <b>trade</b> with Russia. They were forgiven for their escape attempt and moved back to more comfortable lodging.|$|E
25|$|To reach a final {{conclusion}} on {{the choice}} for ruler Winston Churchill, then British colonial secretary, summoned {{a small group}} of Orientalists to Egypt for the famous Cairo Conference of March 1921. The British Empire’s best minds on the Middle East would determine the fate of Mesopotamia, Transjordan and Palestine. Churchill’s objectives were to save money by reducing Britain's overseas military presence; Find a way to maintain political control over Britain's mandate areas as identified in the Sykes-Picot Agreement; Protect what was then suspected to be substantial oil reserves in Iraq; and lastly preserve an <b>open</b> <b>trade</b> route to India, the Crown Jewel of the empire. Representing the Iraqis, two members of the Council were picked to join the delegation: Sassoon Eskell and Jafar Pasha al-Askari; with the disliked Sayid Talib left behind.

25|$|When {{the admiral}} of the Dutch fleet in the East {{learned that the}} Portuguese were loading an {{exceptionally}} rich carrack in Macau, he sent orders to Abraham van den Broeck, in command of two Dutch vessels {{in the waters of}} Johor, to find this ship. If they missed the carrack, the Dutch were to proceed to Japan and try to <b>open</b> <b>trade</b> there. Van den Broeck set sail on May 10, stopping by Patani to get a supply of some silk, pepper, and lead to trade in Japan. They then laid around the Taiwan Strait in wait for the Portuguese carrack to no avail, then made way into the Japanese harbour of Hirado on July 1. As it happened, the Dutch only missed the Nossa Senhora da Graça by two days, since Pessoa sailed right into a monsoon that carried the carrack way to the south, offsetting his early lead, and landed in the harbour of Nagasaki on June 29.|$|E
25|$|In the 1870s and 1880s, renewed {{competition}} among regional rivals—primarily the pro-British ponlop of Tongsa and the anti-British, pro-Tibetan ponlop of Paro—resulted in {{the ascendancy of}} Ugyen Wangchuck, the Ponlop of Tongsa. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck had defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions in 1882-85. His victory {{came at a time}} of crisis for the central government, however. British power was becoming more extensive to the south, and in the west Tibet had violated its border with Sikkim, incurring British disfavor. After 1,000 years of close ties with Tibet, Bhutan faced the threat of British military power and was forced to make serious geopolitical decisions. The British, seeking to offset potential Russian advances in Lhasa, wanted to <b>open</b> <b>trade</b> relations with Tibet. Ugyen Wangchuck, on the advice of his closest adviser Ugyen Dorji, saw the opportunity to assist the British and in 1903-4 volunteered to accompany a British mission to Lhasa as a mediator. For his services in securing the Anglo-Tibetan Convention of 1904, Ugyen Wangchuck was knighted and thereafter continued to accrue greater power in Bhutan. Ugyen Dorji, as well as his descendants, went on to maintain British favor on behalf of the government from Bhutan House in Kalimpong, India.|$|E

The cornerstone of the reform process was a currency board, under which the peso was fixed by law at par to the dollar, and the money supply restricted to the level of hard-currency reserves. A risky policy which meant at a later stage Argentina could not devalue. After a lag, inflation was tamed. With risk of devaluation apparently removed, capital poured in from abroad. GDP growth increased significantly and total employment rose steadily until mid-1993. During the second half of 1994, the economy slowed down and unemployment increased from 10% to 12.2%.|$|E
500|$|After {{the conquest}} of Malacca in 1511, {{not only did the}} Portuguese monopolize the European spice trade, but they also met and traded avidly with Chinese merchants.

D'Albuquerque sent Jorge Álvares to explore northward; his expedition sailed along the coast of Guangdong in 1513 and hoisted a flag on [...] "Tuen Mun island". This mission was followed up later that year by Rafael Perestrello, who later traded with Chinese merchants of Canton in 1516. He provided an enticing report to other Portuguese on the lucrative trade in China. This prompted Andrade to speed up the course of his mission while stalled in Malacca and debate with his crew on whether to go to China or Bengal.|$|E

Obsle is the commensal of the Sekeve District, and was once the head of the Orgota Naval Trade Commission in Erhenrang, where he became acquainted with Estraven. Estraven describes him as the nearest thing to an honest person among the politicians of Orgoreyn.

As vice president, Fillmore presided over angry debates in the Senate as Congress decided whether to allow slavery in the Mexican Cession. [...] Fillmore supported Henry Clay's Omnibus Bill (the basis of the 1850 Compromise) though Taylor did not. [...] After President Taylor died in July 1850, Fillmore dismissed the cabinet and changed the administration's policy. [...] The new president exerted pressure to gain {{the passage of the}} Compromise, which gave legislative victories to both North and South, and which was enacted by September. [...] The Fugitive Slave Act, expediting the return of escaped slaves to those who claimed ownership, was a controversial part of the Compromise, and Fillmore felt himself duty-bound to enforce it, though it damaged his popularity and also the Whig Party, which was torn North from South. [...] In foreign policy, Fillmore supported U.S. Navy expeditions to <b>open</b> <b>trade</b> in Japan, opposed French designs on Hawaii, and was embarrassed by Narciso López's filibuster expeditions to Cuba.
