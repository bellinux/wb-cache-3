In order to understand the mechanism of the reaction, a study of structure-function relationships was undertaken with respect to modifying certain of its amino acid residues. This was done by carrying out <b>oligonucleotide-directed</b> site-specific <b>mutagenesis</b> of apoaequorin cDNA and expressing the mutagenized cDNA in Escherichia coli. Amino acid substitutions were made at the three Ca 2 +-binding sites, the three cysteines, and a histidine in one of the hydrophobic regions.

The threonine- 133 mutant fibrillae were indistinguishable from wild-type fibrillae. In contrast, replacement of lysine- 132 or arginine- 136 by threonine or serine, respectively, resulted in mutant fibrillae which had completely lost adhesive capacity, suggesting that the positive charges of these residues are essential for the interaction with the negatively charged sialic acid residue of the receptor molecules. After the replacement of tryptophan- 67 with leucine neither fibrillae nor subunits were detectable, indicating that the mutant product is unstable and that tryptophan- 67 has an essential structural role in the K 99 subunit...|$|R

40|$|<b>Oligonucleotide-directed,</b> {{site-specific}} <b>mutagenesis</b> {{has been}} utilized {{to modify the}} melB gene of Escherichia coli such {{that each of the}} seven His residues in the melibiose permease has been replaced with Arg. Replacement of His- 213, His- 442, or His- 456 has no significant effect on permease activity, while permease with Arg in place of His- 198, His- 318, or His- 357 retains more than 70 % of wild-type activity. In striking contrast, replacement of His- 94 with Arg causes a complete loss of sugar binding and transport, although the cells contain a normal complement of permease molecules.

We describe here the application of <b>oligonucleotide-directed</b> site-specific <b>mutagenesis</b> to accomplish this objective for the enzyme B-lactamase, the gene for which is contained in the plasmid pBR 322. The method uses a procedure to screen for mutant clones which depends on the DNA in the various colonies and not on the properties of the mutant protein; the method can, therefore, be widely applied and does not require, in each separate case, the development of a screening procedure which depends on some phenotypic difference between mutant and wild-type protein...|$|R
40|$|By use of <b>oligonucleotide-directed,</b> {{site-specific}} <b>mutagenesis,</b> Pro 327 in the lac permease of Escherichia coli {{has been}} replaced with Ala, Gly, or Leu. Permease with Ala at position 327 catalyzes lactose/H+ symport in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type permease. Permease with Gly at position 327, on the other hand, exhibits about one-tenth the activity of wild-type permease but catalyzes lactose accumulation to essentially the same steady-state level as wild-type permease. Finally, permease with Leu at position 327 is completely inactive. The results demonstrate {{that there is no}} relationship between permease activity and the helix-breaking (Pro and Gly) or helix-making (Ala and Leu) properties of the residue at position 327. It is suggested that it is primarily a chemical property of the side chain at position 327 (i. e., bulk, hydropathy, and/or ability to hydrogen bond) that is critical for activity and that neither cis/trans isomerization of Pro 327 nor the presence of a kink at this position is important. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of light-dependent proton translocation by bacteriorhodopsin, we have introduced single-codon changes in the gene so as to produce the following specific amino acid substitutions in the protein: Tyr- 185 to Phe, Pro- 186 to Leu, Trp- 189 to Phe, Ser- 193 to Ala, and Glu- 194 to Gln. The strategy involved replacement of a 62 -base-pair restriction fragment by synthetic DNA duplexes containing the modified nucleotide sequences.

In contrast, replacement of either histidine- 205 or histidine- 322 by arginine causes a dramatic loss of transport activity, although the cells contain a normal complement of permease molecules, as determined by immunoadsorption assays. Interestingly, although substitution of histidine- 205 or histidine- 322 by arginine results in the loss of ability to catalyze active lactose transport, permease molecules with arginine at residue 322 appear to facilitate downhill lactose movements at high concentrations of the disaccharide. The results provide strong support for the contention that histidine residues in the lac permease {{play an important role in}} the coupling between lactose and proton translocation...|$|R

40|$|The 44 -amino-acid E 5 protein of bovine {{papillomavirus}} type 1 is {{the shortest}} known protein with transforming activity. To identify the specific amino acids required for in vitro focus formation in mouse C 127 cells, we used <b>oligonucleotide-directed</b> saturation <b>mutagenesis</b> to construct an extensive collection of mutants with missense mutations in the E 5 gene. Characterization of mutants with amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic middle third of the E 5 protein indicated that efficient transformation requires a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids but not a specific amino acid sequence in {{this portion of the}} protein. Many amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal third of the protein can also undergo substitution without impairment of focus-forming activity, but the amino acids at seven positions, including two cysteine residues that mediate dimer formation, appear essential for efficient transforming activity. These essential amino acids are the most well conserved among related fibropapillomaviruses.

40|$|We {{have used}} <b>oligonucleotide-directed</b> {{site-specific}} <b>mutagenesis</b> to convert serine codon 27 of the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene to UAG, UAA, and UGA nonsense codons. The mutant cat genes, under transcriptional {{control of the}} Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, were then introduced into mammalian cells by DNA transfection along with UAG, UAA, and UGA suppressor tRNA genes derived from a human serine tRNA. Assay for CAT enzymatic activity in extracts from such cells allowed us to detect and quantitate nonsense suppression in monkey CV- 1 cells and mouse NIH 3 T 3 cells. Using such an assay, we provide the first direct evidence that an opal suppressor tRNA gene is functional in mammalian cells. The pattern of suppression of the three cat nonsense mutations in bacteria suggests that the serine at position 27 of CAT can {{be replaced by a}} wide variety of amino acids without loss of enzymatic activity. Thus, these mutant cat genes should be generally useful for the quantitation of suppressor activity of suppressor tRNA genes introduced into cells and possibly for the detection of naturally occurring nonsense suppressors...|$|R
40|$|By use of <b>oligonucleotide-directed,</b> {{site-specific}} <b>mutagenesis,</b> a lactose (lac) permease molecule {{was constructed}} in which all eight cysteinyl residues were simultaneously mutagenized (C-less permease). Cys 154 was replaced with valine, and Cys 117, - 148, - 176, - 234, - 333, - 353, and - 355 were replaced with serine. Remarkably, C-less permease catalyzes lactose accumulation {{in the presence of}} a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient (interior negative and alkaline). Thus, in intact cells and right-side-out membrane vesicles containing comparable amounts of wild-type and Cys-less permease, the mutant protein catalyzes lactose transport at a maximum velocity and to a steady-state level of accumulation of about 35 % and 55 %, respectively, of wild-type with a similar apparent K(m) (ca. 0. 3 mM). As anticipated, moreover, active lactose transport via C-less permease is completely resistant to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. Finally, C-less permease also catalyzes efflux and equilibrium exchange at about 35 % of wild-type activity. The results provide definitive evidence that sulfhydryl groups do not play an essential role in the mechanism of lactose/H+ symport. Potential applications of the C-less mutant to studies of static and dynamic aspects of permease structure/function are discussed...|$|R

Mutagenesis of a well-conserved hydrophilic region near the amino terminus of the Shiga toxin B subunit rendered the molecule nontoxic but did not affect immunoreactivity or holotoxin assembly. In addition, elimination of one cysteine residue, as well as truncation of the B polypeptide by 5 amino acids, caused a total loss of activity.
