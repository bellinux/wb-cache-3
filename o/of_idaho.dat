5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but not for a {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University <b>of</b> <b>Idaho,</b> Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University <b>of</b> <b>Idaho,</b> was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E

5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area <b>of</b> <b>Idaho,</b> a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff.

Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E

5|$|Dr. George Spomer of the University <b>of</b> <b>Idaho</b> has {{discovered}} protocarnivorous activity and function in several glandular plant species, including Cerastium arvense, Ipomopsis aggregata, Heuchera cylindrica, Mimulus lewisii, Penstemon attenuata, Penstemon diphyllus, Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, Ribes cereum, Rosa nutkana var. hispida, Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana, Solanum tuberosum, Stellaria americana, and Stellaria jamesiana. These species {{tested positive for}} protease activity, though {{it is unclear whether}} the protease is produced by the plant or by surface microbes. Two other species evaluated by Dr. Spomer, Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta, exhibited protease activity and were further examined with 14C-labeled algal protein for nutrient absorption activity. Both of these latter species displayed an ability to digest and absorb the labeled protein.|$|E
