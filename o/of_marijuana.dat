5|$|A {{number of}} {{contemporary}} national political {{issues have been}} influenced by events in Massachusetts, such as the decision in 2003 by the state Supreme Judicial Court allowing same-sex marriage and a 2006 bill which mandated health insurance for all Bay Staters. In 2008, Massachusetts voters passed an initiative decriminalizing possession of small amounts <b>of</b> <b>marijuana.</b> Voters in Massachusetts also approved a ballot measure in 2012 that legalized the medical use <b>of</b> <b>marijuana.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts <b>of</b> <b>marijuana,</b> and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential for state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E

No festival attendees were arrested. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in Seattle, Washington also attended by Oregonians, known as the world's largest annual gathering advocating decriminalization <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> for uses including but not limited to medicinal, industrial, and recreational.

5|$|By his own account, in {{the late}} 1950s, while living in San Francisco, young John A. Carradine was arrested for assaulting a police officer; he pleaded to a lesser charge of {{disturbing}} the peace. While in the Army (1960–1962) he faced court-martial, {{on more than one}} occasion, for shoplifting. After he became an established actor and had changed his name to David, he was arrested, in 1967, for possession <b>of</b> <b>marijuana.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Denver {{became the}} first major city in the U.S. to vote to make the private {{possession}} of less than an ounce <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> legal for adults 21 and older. The city voted 53.5 percent {{in favor of the}} marijuana legalization measure, which, as then-mayor John Hickenlooper pointed out, was without effect, because the city cannot usurp state law, which at that time treated marijuana possession {{in much the same way}} as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail time. Denver passed an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review panel to monitor the city's compliance with the 2005 ordinance. In 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 was signed into law by Governor John Hickenlooper and at the beginning of 2014 Colorado {{became the first}} state to allow the sale <b>of</b> <b>marijuana</b> for recreational use.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Berry bought the Southern Air, a {{restaurant}} in Wentzville, Missouri. In 1990 he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a video camera in the bathroom. Berry claimed {{that he had the}} camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Though his guilt was never proved in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. (One of the biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that, with 59 women, it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees.). His lawyers said he had been the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth. During this time Berry began using Wayne T. Schoeneberg as his legal counsel. Reportedly, a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women, one of whom being apparently a minor. Also found in the raid were 62grams <b>of</b> <b>marijuana.</b> Felony drug and child-abuse charges were filed. As the child-abuse charges were dropped, Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession <b>of</b> <b>marijuana.</b> He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and two years' unsupervised probation and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.|$|E
