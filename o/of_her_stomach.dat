500|$|A 2001 {{survey in}} Clinical Nursing Research, an {{international}} publication, found that 62% {{of people who}} have had piercings have done so in an effort [...] "to express their individuality." [...] People also pierce to commemorate landmark events or to overcome traumatic ones. According to the assistant director of the Frankfurt University Teaching Hospital for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, some sexual abuse survivors choose body piercing as a means of [...] "reclaiming body parts from memories of abuse". Piercing can also be chosen for simple aesthetic value, to highlight particular areas of the body, as a navel piercing may reflect a woman's satisfaction with the shape and condition <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> Some people pierce, permanently or temporarily, to enhance sexual pleasure. Genital and nipple piercings may increase sexual satisfaction. Some people participate in a form of body play known as play piercing, in which piercings may be done temporarily on the genitals or elsewhere on the body for sexual gratification.|$|E

"So Epimetheus got a {{great deal}} of trouble, as most men do in this world: but he got the three best things in the world into the bargain--a good wife, and experience, and hope: while Prometheus had just as much trouble, and a great deal more (as you will hear), of his own making; with nothing beside, save fancies spun out of his own brain, as a spider spins her web out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{fight was}} on. Genevieve {{clutched}} {{one hand to}} her breast and watched. She was bewildered by the swiftness and savagery of Ponta's assault, and by the multitude of blows he struck. She felt that Joe was surely being destroyed. At times {{she could not see}} his face, so obscured was it by the flying gloves. But she could hear the resounding blows, and with the sound of each blow she felt a sickening sensation in the pit <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> She did not know that what she heard was the impact of glove on glove, or glove on shoulder, and that no damage was being done.|$|E

I said to her, 'My {{knowledge}} of geography is not so profound as I wish it was but I have an idea that it is quite a walk from Premysl to Petrograd.' Cousin Sophia sighed again and said, 'The Grand Duke Nicholas is not the man I took him to be.' 'Do not let him know that,' said I. 'It might hurt his feelings and he has likely enough to worry him as it is. But you cannot cheer Cousin Sophia up, no matter how sarcastic you are, Mrs. Dr. dear. She sighed for the third time and groaned out, 'But the Russians are retreating fast,' and I said, 'Well, what of it? They have plenty of room for retreating, have they not?' But all the same, Mrs. Dr. dear, though I would never admit it to Cousin Sophia, I do not like the situation on the eastern front." ...|$|E

As {{she stepped out of}} the {{passenger}} side of a squatty Volvo onto a crumbling sidewalk, a gust of scarf-weather wind stabbed at the patch of exposed skin just above her shirt collar. There was a rapid movement <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand racing with her zipper up her torso and a slight wince embedded in the curve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth. Then nothing stirred, save a fluctuation <b>of</b> air in <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> 2 ̆...|$|R
50|$|Giordano {{married the}} former Marie Trapani, sister of fellow comics artist Sal Trapani, on April 17, 1955. She died from {{complications}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> second <b>stomach</b> cancer surgery in February 1993. They {{had three children}} together; Lisa, Dawn, and Richard Jr. Marie's death, combined with Giordano's increasing hearing loss, hastened his decision to retire from DC. Following {{the death of his}} wife, Giordano split time between homes in Florida and Connecticut. In 1995, he moved to Palm Coast, Florida, where he continued to work full-time freelancing, until his death. Giordano had suffered from lymphoma and later from leukemia, secondary to the chemotherapy. He died on March 27, 2010 due to complications of pneumonia.|$|R
50|$|Later, Tommy {{finds the}} woman's missing tooth {{wrapped in a}} piece <b>of</b> cloth in <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> They find Roman numerals, letters, and a drawing on the cloth. When Tommy finally {{separates}} the skin on her chest from the body, they find similar symbols on the inside <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skin. All {{the lights in the}} room suddenly explode. During the confusion, they see that the storage chambers are empty and that the three corpses inside them are missing. They decide to leave, but the elevator does not work and something is blocking the exit door. Tommy tries to call the sheriff using a landline, but the connection is disrupted. They hear a bell in the hallway, presumably from the movement of now living corpses, and the office door violently starts to bang, only to suddenly stop.|$|R
50|$|The book {{features}} a ten-year-old girl named Helen Finney, who fed her Golden Retriever dog Martha some alphabet soup and something very mysterious occurred.

50|$|The {{investigation}} of the collision drew nationwide attention, as Schuler's husband strongly disagreed with the conclusion that she was heavily intoxicated {{at the time of}} the crash. A toxicology report released on August 4 by Westchester County medical examiners found that Schuler had a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.19%, with approximately six grams <b>of</b> alcohol in <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> that had not yet been absorbed into her blood. The legal BAC limit for Driving While Intoxicated in New York State is 0.08%. The report also said that Schuler had high levels of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in her system. She could have smoked marijuana as recently as fifteen minutes before the accident.|$|R
2500|$|Despite its {{classical}} references, {{the characterization}} of the figure is unconventional, and the depictions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> large <b>stomach,</b> hands and feet are derived from observation rather than respect for the idealised form. Alternatively, art historian Eric Jan Sluijter proposed that the figure {{could not have been}} painted directly from a posed model, given the anatomical discrepancies (an impossibly twisted left arm, the length of the right arm, an unnatural twist of the torso, and the elongated distance from breast to groin) and inconsistencies in perspective that indicate different parts of the figure are viewed from various vantage points. Yet, the figure appears to repose naturally, without tension or movement. Whatever physical awkwardness the figure may possess when compared to classical sources, the truthfulness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> image has been seen as extraordinarily noble; according to Clark, [...] "this Christian acceptance of the unfortunate body has permitted the Christian privilege of a soul".|$|R
500|$|Soon after midnight, Charlotte began {{vomiting}} violently {{and complaining}} <b>of</b> pains in <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> [...] Sir Richard was called, and was alarmed {{to find his}} patient cold to the touch, breathing with difficulty, and bleeding.

50|$|The {{theory of}} someone {{lying in wait}} was {{reinforced}} by an empty string bean can and some melon rinds, found by officers in the kitchen waste basket.

Examination <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> revealed that she had eaten string beans {{about an hour before}} her death. Bauerdorf's jewelry and other valuables were not stolen, although almost $100 was taken from her purse. There was a large roll of $2 bills and thousands of dollars worth of sterling silver lying in an open trunk.|$|E
50|$|Martha Speaks is an American-Canadian children's {{animated}} {{television series}} {{based on the}} 1992 children's book {{of the same name}} by Susan Meddaugh, about a talking dog named Martha (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain), who is owned by ten-year-old Helen Lorraine (known in the books as Helen Finney). When Helen feeds Martha some alphabet soup, the soup travels to her brain instead <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> resulting in her ability to speak. The show focuses on synonyms and vocabulary, with each episode featuring an underlying theme illustrated with keywords. The show takes place in the fictional town of Wagstaff City, a parody of Flagstaff, Arizona.|$|E
