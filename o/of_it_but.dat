5|$|A Malay {{language}} remake titled Aku Tak Bodoh (the {{translation of}} {{the title of the}} first film) was made as a Malaysian co-production between Grand Brilliance, J Team Productions, AMC Sdn Bhd RAM Entertainment, and PMP Entertainment with Jack Neo as the executive producer and directed by his protege Boris Boo. According to Neo himself, there was already a demand to adapt the first film itself into Malay after people requested for a dubbed version <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> it took 4 years for the plan to come into fruition. The film, starring Jalaluddin Hassan and Adibah Noor among others, was released on 14 April 2011 in Singaporean cinemas.|$|E
5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|In {{these years}} Sargent tackled a wide repertoire, {{recording}} much <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> {{he was particularly}} noted for performances of choral pieces. He promoted British music, as he would throughout his career, conducting Handel's Messiah performed with large choruses and orchestras; and the premières of At the Boar's Head (1925) by Holst; Hugh the Drover (1924) and Sir John in Love (1929) by Vaughan Williams; and Walton's cantata Belshazzar's Feast (at the Leeds Triennial Festival of 1931). To popularise classical music, Sargent conducted many concerts for young people including the Robert Mayer Concerts for Children from 1924 to 1939.|$|E

5|$|Michael is {{inspired}} by the fellow churchgoers and, following inappropriate comments {{from the rest of}} the office staff, angrily lashes out at them for being disrespectful. As the church's youth ministry—which is going to Mexico to help build a school—leave, Michael decides to go with them. The other employees try to talk him out <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> Michael refuses. Just before they leave, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) boards the bus with him in an attempt to impress his ex-girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). Both get cold feet 45 minutes into the trip, and force the bus to stop. They then have Erin drive them home.|$|E
5|$|Saudi Arabia {{uses the}} bench trial system. Its courts observe few formalities. The country's first {{criminal}} procedure code {{was introduced in}} 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from Egyptian and French law. Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that judges were either ignorant of the criminal procedure code or were aware <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> routinely ignored the code.|$|E
5|$|Tammi {{returns from}} the bank and gets back in her car. Dwight surprises her {{from the back seat}} and puts a gun to her head, and tells her to drive. Dwight comes to the {{conclusion}} that Randall killed Chase because he and Tammi were together. Dwight hands Randall a gun and tells him to shoot Tammi. Tammi tries to talk Randall out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> Randall shoots through the wall next to her and kills Dwight. Randall is eventually arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away.|$|E

5|$|The 10,356 all-seater {{stadium is}} {{situated}} in Bury Park, one mile (1.6km) west of the centre of Luton. It is named after the road which runs along one end <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> the official address is 1 Maple Road. Kenilworth Road hosted football in the Southern League until 1920, then in the Football League until 2009, when Luton were relegated to the Conference Premier. It has hosted Football League matches once more since 2014.|$|E
5|$|The cattle {{industry}} continued to thrive though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various {{regions of the}} state. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce between Texas {{and the rest of}} the U.S. ({{and the rest of the}} world) expanded. As with some other states before, the lumber industry quickly decimated the forests of Texas such that by the early 20th century the major of the forest population in Texas was gone (later conservation efforts restored some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> never to the level it once was).|$|E
5|$|The lengthy {{individual}} {{time trial}} featured a climb {{in the middle}} <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> no KOM points were on offer. The course was technical and featured several turnarounds. It was the same course that was raced four times in stage eight, except that the finish line was not situated at the same place. Midway through the stage, the riders took on {{the difficulty of the}} day, the -long Liebewill. There were other small climbs to pepper the course.|$|E

5|$|After Robert Baker's {{death in}} 1623 {{and the death}} of his eldest son Samuel shortly after, his widow and her father {{purchased}} the wardship of their surviving children; the death of the next eldest son, Robert, in 1630, allowed them to effectively control the estate. Their only daughter died and her widower, Sir Henry Oxenden, retained an interest in the land. Several relatives claimed it, but after Mary Baker's death in about 1665, the estate reverted to the Crown. A great-nephew, John Baker, obtained possession of part <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> squabbled over the lands with his cousin, James Baker; trying to play one another off, they paid or granted rights to Oxenden and a speculator, Colonel Thomas Panton, but the pair eventually lost out to them. By the 1670s, Panton was developing the lands and, despite the claims of some distantly-related Bakers, he steadily built them up.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 11, Riley and {{her parents}} move to San Francisco for her father's new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with all their {{belongings}} is misdirected, her father is under stress from his business, and a poor encounter at a pizza restaurant leaves her disheartened. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry {{in front of her}} class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters, and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E

5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} came to be called the Run to the North, after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships slowly moved out of range and rendezvoused with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. Beatty {{gradually}} turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> he mistimed his manoeuvre. By 18:35 Beatty was following the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. Beatty then turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast to search for Hipper's ships.|$|E
5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E
5|$|On {{the way to}} Sicily, 65 gliders were {{released}} too early by the towing aircraft and crashed into the sea, drowning around 252 men. Of the remainder, only 87 men arrived at the Pont Grande Bridge, which they successfully captured and held beyond {{the time they were}} to be relieved. Finally, with their ammunition expended and only 15 soldiers remaining unwounded, they surrendered to the Italian forces. The Italians sought to demolish the bridge after regaining control <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> were unable to do so because the airborne forces had removed the explosive charges. Other troops from the airlanding brigade, who had landed elsewhere in Sicily, destroyed communications links and captured artillery batteries.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} castle were also positioned for particular effect. Unusually, the huge Great Gatehouse faced south-east, away from the main road, hiding its extraordinary architectural features. This may have been because Thomas intended {{to establish a new}} settlement in front <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> the gatehouse was also probably intended to be viewed from the harbour, where the most senior visitors were expected to arrive. The Lilburn Tower was positioned so as to be clearly - and provocatively - visible to Edward II's castle at Bamburgh, 9 miles (15km) away along the coast, and would have been elegantly framed by the entranceway to the Great Gatehouse for any visitors. It was also positioned on a set of natural basalt pillars, which - although inconvenient to build upon - would have enhanced its dramatic appearance and reflection in the meres.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the act, the canal company {{inherited}} the debts of the Conservators, and paid them an additional £2,000. They were required to rebuild part of the North Town Bridge in Taunton, and to return the Tone Navigation to good order. The Conservators were empowered to carry out an annual inspection, and to re-possess the river if the canal was not properly maintained. The £2,000 was held by the Conservators until 1838, when they applied for an order to dispose <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> it was not until 1843 that the order was granted. £1,000 was used to build a new wing for the Taunton and Somerset Hospital, and £1,000 was invested in the Taunton Market Trust, in line with the intentions of the 1699 act.|$|E
5|$|While {{the comics}} are set during the Sonic X timeline, their plot is original. Eggman imprisons humans inside robots {{and tries to}} use them to kill the animals, but the animals destroy the robots. Eggman uses {{malicious}} Chao to destroy Station Square, but Tikal and Chaos arrive from the past, return the Chao to normal, and bring them back to the past. Soon, Sonic finds a machine in the desert and thinks nothing <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>but</b> after fighting with Eggman in Paris and a bizarre world created by the doctor, Eggman reveals the desert machine was his and it begins to wreck Station Square. Sonic defeats it, but he is accused of working with Eggman, so he and Eggman are both locked up. Nelson bails Sonic out of jail, and he saves Cream and Chris from some ghosts.|$|E
