5|$|The German naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger was {{the first}} to {{recognize}} the pinnipeds as a distinct taxonomic unit; in 1811 he gave the name Pinnipedia to both a family and an order. American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen reviewed the world's pinnipeds in an 1880 monograph, History of North American pinnipeds, a monograph of the walruses, sea-lions, sea-bears and seals of North America. In this publication, he traced the history of names, gave keys to families and genera, described North American species and provided synopses of species {{in other parts of the}} world. In 1989, Annalisa Berta and colleagues proposed the unranked clade Pinnipedimorpha to contain the fossil genus Enaliarctos and modern seals as a sister group. Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and the suborder Caniformia (known as dog-like carnivorans). Pinnipedia was historically considered its own suborder under Carnivora. Of the three extant families, the <b>Otariidae</b> and Odobenidae are grouped in the superfamily Otarioidea, while the Phocidae belong to the superfamily Phocoidea.|$|E
5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora. It is the sole {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and eared seals (<b>Otariidae).</b> While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|E
25|$|The Steller {{sea lion}} (Eumetopias jubatus) {{also known as}} the {{northern}} sea lion and Steller's sea lion, is a near threatened species of sea lions in the northern Pacific. It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias and the largest of the eared seals (<b>Otariidae).</b> Among pinnipeds, it is inferior in size only to the walrus and the two elephant seals. The species is named for the naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described them in 1741. The Steller sea lion has attracted considerable attention in recent decades due to significant, unexplained declines in their numbers over a large portion of their range in Alaska.|$|E
500|$|The California {{sea lion}} was {{described}} by René Primevère Lesson, a French naturalist, in 1828. It is grouped with other sea lions and fur seals in the family <b>Otariidae.</b> Otariids, also known as eared seals, differ from true seals in having external ear flaps, and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles. Along with the Galapagos sea lion and the extinct Japanese sea lion, the California sea lion belongs to the genus Zalophus, which derives from the Greek words za, meaning [...] "intensive," [...] and lophus, meaning [...] "crest." [...] This refers to the protruding sagittal crest of the males, which distinguishes members of the genus.|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds (...) (from Latin pinna [...] "fin" [...] and pes, pedis [...] "foot"), {{commonly}} known as seals, are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), <b>Otariidae</b> (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|The {{lineages}} of <b>Otariidae</b> and Odobenidae split almost 28mya. Otariids {{originated in}} the North Pacific. The earliest fossil Pithanotaria, found in California, is dated to 11mya. The Callorhinus lineage split earlier at 16mya. Zalophus, Eumetopias and Otaria diverged next, with the latter colonizing the coast of South America. Most of the other otariids diversified in the Southern Hemisphere. The earliest fossils of Odobenidae—Prototaria of Japan and Proneotherium of Oregon—date to 18–16mya. These primitive walruses had much shorter canines and lived on a fish diet rather than a specialized mollusk diet like the modern walrus. Odobenids further diversified {{in the middle and}} late Miocene. Several species had enlarged upper and lower canines. The genera Valenictus and Odobenus developed elongated tusks. The lineage of the modern walrus may have spread from the North Pacific to the Caribbean (via the Central American Seaway) 8–5mya and subsequently made it to the North Atlantic and returned to the North Pacific via the Arctic 1mya. Alternatively, this lineage may have spread from the North Pacific to the Arctic and subsequently the North Atlantic during the Pleistocene.|$|E
2500|$|The term seal is used {{to refer}} to a diverse group of animals.

[...] The two main families of seals are the <b>Otariidae</b> (the eared seals; includes sea lions, and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals); animals in the family Phocidae are sometimes referred to as hair seals, and are much more adept in the water than the eared seals, though have a more difficult time getting around on land. The fur seal yields a valuable fur; the hair seal has no fur, but oil can be obtained from its fat and leather from its hide.|$|E

50|$|Pelagiarctos was a genus of walrus {{that lived}} during the Mid Miocene, approx. 13-15 mya. Its remains {{have been found}} in the Sharktooth Hill Bonebed, in Kern County, California.

50|$|Family <b>Otariidae</b> (eared seals, sea lions, fur seals) is {{distributed}} throughout the world's oceans {{with the exception of}} the North Atlantic.

50|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by E. Sivertsen in 1953. This species {{has been considered}} a subspecies of Zalophus californianus (called Z. c. wollebaeki) by many authors.

50|$|Geographic {{variation}} for {{sea lions}} have been {{determined by the}} observations of skulls of several <b>Otariidae</b> species; a general change in size corresponds with a change in latitude and primary productivity. Skulls of Australian sea lions from Western Australia were generally smaller in length whereas the largest skulls are from cool temperate localities. <b>Otariidae</b> {{are in the process}} of species divergence, much of which may be driven by local factors, particularly latitude and resources. Populations of a given species tend to be smaller in the tropics, increase in size with increasing latitude, and reach a maximum in sub-polar regions. In a cool climate and cold waters there should be a selective advantage in the relative reduction of body surface area resulting from increased size, since the metabolic rate is related more closely to body surface area than to body weight.|$|E
50|$|The Australian {{sea lion}} is a pinniped, most {{closely related to}} other species of sea lions and fur seals making up the family <b>Otariidae.</b> These mammals use their {{flippers}} to propel themselves in water and can walk on land with their flippers.

5000|$|The {{earless seals}} or true seals {{are one of}} the three main groups of mammals within the seal lineage, Pinnipedia.

The Baikal seal is the only species of exclusively freshwater seal.|$|E
50|$|Fur seals {{are any of}} nine {{species of}} {{pinnipeds}} belonging to the Arctocephalinae subfamily in the <b>Otariidae</b> family.

They are marked by their dense underfur, which made them a long-time object of commercial hunting. Eight species belong to the Arctocephalus genus and are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, while one ninth species also sometimes called fur seal, the northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), belongs to a different genus and inhabits the North Pacific.|$|E
50|$|Many carnivores, {{both large}} and small, inhabit South Africa.

The other two big cats are the African leopard and the South African cheetah. The spotted hyena is commonly found in most large game reserves, while the brown hyena inhabits the arid parts of the country, and the aardwolf is widespread. The African wild dog is an endangered species and is found mainly in the Kruger National Park and surrounding areas.|$|E
50|$|An eared seal or otariid or otary is {{any member}} of the marine mammal family <b>Otariidae,</b> one of three groupings of pinnipeds. They {{comprise}} 15 extant species in seven genera (another species became extinct in the 1950s) and are commonly known either as sea lions or fur seals, distinct from true seals (phocids) and the walrus (odobenids). Otariids are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, but breeding and resting on land or ice. They reside in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters throughout the Pacific and Southern Oceans and the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans. They are conspicuously absent in the north Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} fur seals, they {{constitute}} the family <b>Otariidae,</b> collectively known as eared seals. Until recently, sea lions were grouped {{under a single}} subfamily called Otariinae, whereas fur seals were grouped in the subfamily Arcocephalinae. This division {{was based on the}} most prominent common feature shared by the fur seals and absent in the sea lions, namely the dense underfur characteristic of the former. Recent genetic evidence, however, strongly suggests Callorhinus, the genus of the northern fur seal, is more closely related to some sea lion species than to the other fur seal genus, Arctocephalus. Therefore, the fur seal/sea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many taxonomies.|$|E

This is significant {{because there has been}} considerable debate as to whether pinnipeds share common ancestry. Interpretation of Enaliarctos indicates that all pinnipeds share a common ancestor (which, if it was not Enaliarctos, must have been something very similar, such as the more newly discovered Puijila darwini.) ...|$|E
50|$|Sea lions are sea mammals {{characterized}} by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, {{the ability to}} walk on all fours, and short, thick hair, big chest and belly. Together with the fur seals, they comprise the family <b>Otariidae,</b> eared seals, which contains six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion) in five genera. Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean. They have an average lifespan of 20-30 years. A male California sea lion weighs on average about 300 kg and is about 8 ft long, while the female sea lion weighs 100 kg and is 6 ft long. The largest sea lion is Steller's sea lion, which can weigh 1000 kg and grow to a length of 10 ft. Sea lions consume large quantities of food {{at a time and}} are known to eat about 5-8% of their body weight (about 15 - 35 lb) at a single feeding.|$|E
50|$|The {{superfamily}} Canoidea (or suborder Caniformia) - Canidae (wolves, {{dogs and}} foxes), Mephitidae (skunks and stink badgers), Mustelidae (weasels, badgers, and otters), Procyonidae (raccoons), Ursidae (bears), Ailuridae (red panda), <b>Otariidae</b> (eared seals), Odobenidae (walrus), and Phocidae (earless seals) (the last three families formerly {{classified in the}} superfamily Pinnipedia) and the extinct family Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) - are characterized by having nonchambered or partially chambered auditory bullae, nonretractable claws, and a well-developed baculum. Most species are rather plain in coloration, lacking the flashy spotted or rosetted coats like many species of felids and viverrids have. This is because Canoidea tend to range in the temperate and subarctic biomes, although Mustelidae and Procyonidae have a few tropical species. Most are terrestrial, although a few species, like procyonids, are arboreal. All families except the Canidae and a few species of Mustelidae are plantigrade. Diet is varied and most tend to be omnivorous to some degree, and thus the carnassial teeth are less specialized. Canoidea have more premolars and molars in an elongated skull.|$|E
50|$|Sea lions {{are related}} to the walrus and the seal. Nonetheless, all fur seals have certain {{features}} in common: the fur, generally smaller sizes, farther and longer foraging trips, smaller and more abundant prey items, and greater sexual dimorphism. All sea lions have certain features in common, in particular their coarse, short fur, greater bulk, and larger prey than fur seals. For these reasons, the distinction remains useful. The family <b>Otariidae</b> (Order Carnivora) contains the 14 extant species of fur seals and sea lions. Traditional classification of the family into the subfamilies Arctocephalinae (fur seals) and Otariinae (sea lions) is not supported, with the fur seal Callorhinus ursinus having a basal relationship relative {{to the rest of the}} family. This is consistent with the fossil record which suggests that this genus diverged from the line leading to the remaining fur seals and sea lions about 6 million years ago (mya). Similar genetic divergences between the sea lion clades as well as between the major Arctocephalus fur seal clades, suggest that these groups underwent periods of rapid radiation at about the time they diverged from each other. The phylogenetic relationships within the family and the genetic distances among some taxa highlight inconsistencies in the current taxonomic classification of the family.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, otariids {{had been}} {{subdivided}} into the fur seal (Arctocephalinae) and sea lion (Otariinae) subfamilies, {{with the major}} distinction between them being {{the presence of a}} thick underfur layer in the former. Under this categorization, the fur seals comprised two genera: Callorhinus in the North Pacific with a single representative, the northern fur seal (C. ursinus), and eight species in the Southern Hemisphere under the genus Arctocephalus; while the sea lions comprise five species under five genera. Recent analyses of the genetic evidence suggests that Callorhinus ursinus is in fact more closely related to several sea lion species. Furthermore, many of the Otariinae appear to be more phylogenetically distinct than previously assumed; for example, the Japanese sea lion (Zalophus japonicus) is now considered a separate species, rather than a subspecies of the California sea lion (Zalophus californius). In light of this evidence, the subfamily separation has been removed entirely and the family <b>Otariidae</b> has been organized into seven genera with 16 species and two subspecies.Nonetheless, because of morphological and behavioral similarities among the [...] "fur seals" [...] and [...] "sea lions", these remain useful categories when discussing differences between groups of species. Compared to sea lions, fur seals are generally smaller, exhibit greater sexual dimorphism, eat smaller prey and go on longer foraging trips; and, of course, there is the contrast between the coarse short sea lion hair and the fur seal's fur.|$|E
50|$|The {{lineages}} of <b>Otariidae</b> and Odobenidae split almost 28 mya. Otariids {{originated in}} the North Pacific. The earliest fossil Pithanotaria, found in California, is dated to 11 mya. The Callorhinus lineage split earlier at 16 mya. Zalophus, Eumetopias and Otaria diverged next, with the latter colonizing the coast of South America. Most of the other otariids diversified in the Southern Hemisphere. The earliest fossils of Odobenidae—Prototaria of Japan and Proneotherium of Oregon—date to 18-16 mya. These primitive walruses had much shorter canines and lived on a fish diet rather than a specialized mollusk diet like the modern walrus. Odobenids further diversified {{in the middle and}} late Miocene. Several species had enlarged upper and lower canines. The genera Valenictus and Odobenus developed elongated tusks. The lineage of the modern walrus may have spread from the North Pacific to the Caribbean (via the Central American Seaway) 8-5 mya and subsequently made it to the North Atlantic and returned to the North Pacific via the Arctic 1 mya. Alternatively, this lineage may have spread from the North Pacific to the Arctic and subsequently the North Atlantic during the Pleistocene. The ancestors of the Otarioidea and Phocoidea diverged 33 mya. The Phocidae are likely to have descended from the extinct family Desmatophocidae in the North Atlantic. Desmatophocids lived 23-10 mya and had elongated skulls, fairly large eyes, cheekbones connected by a mortised structure and rounded cheek teeth. They also were sexually dimorphic and may have been capable of propelling themselves with both the foreflippers and hindflippers.|$|E
40|$|Karyotype {{evolution}} in Carnivora is thoroughly studied by classical and molecular cytogenetics and supplemented by reconstructions of Ancestral Carnivora Karyotype (ACK). However chromosome painting information from two pinniped families (Odobenidae and <b>Otariidae)</b> is noticeably missing. We {{report on the}} construction of the comparative chromosome map for species from each of the three pinniped families: the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus, Odobenidae-monotypic family), near threatened Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus, <b>Otariidae)</b> and the endemic Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica, Phocidae) using combination of human, domestic dog and stone marten whole-chromosome painting probes. The earliest karyological studies of Pinnipedia showed that pinnipeds were characterized by a pronounced karyological conservatism that is confirmed here with species from Phocidae, <b>Otariidae</b> and Odobenidae sharing same low number of conserved human autosomal segments (32). Chromosome painting in Pinnipedia and comparison with non-pinniped carnivore karyotypes provide strong support for refined structure of ACK with 2 n = 38. Constructed comparative chromosome maps show that pinniped karyotype evolution was characterized by few tandem fusions, seemingly absent inversions and slow rate of genome rearrangements (less then one rearrangement per 10 million years). Integrative comparative analyses with published chromosome painting of Phoca vitulina revealed common cytogenetic signature for Phoca/Pusa branch and supports Phocidae and Otaroidea (Otariidae/Odobenidae) as sister groups. We revealed rearrangements specific for walrus karyotype and found the chromosomal signature linking together families <b>Otariidae</b> and Odobenidae. The Steller sea lion karyotype is the most conserved among three studied species and differs from the ACK by single fusion. The study underlined the strikingly slow karyotype evolution of the Pinnipedia in general and the <b>Otariidae</b> in particular...|$|E
