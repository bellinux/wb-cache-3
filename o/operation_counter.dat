5000|$|One of the command's {{exercises}} in the 1950s was <b>Operation</b> <b>Counter</b> Punch.

The exercise involved the national air-defense systems of Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, with Général d'Armée Jean-Étienne Valluy, French Army, NATO's Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Central Europe (CINCENT), in overall command. [...] <b>Operation</b> <b>Counter</b> Punch revealed deficiencies in the Integrated NATO Air Defense System as well as air force responsiveness to theoretical Soviet and Warsaw Pact ground advances.|$|E

5|$|The AV-8A's {{abilities}} in air-to-air combat were {{tested by the}} Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs; these exercises trained pilots to use the vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers could act as effective air-to-air fighters at close range. The success of Harrier <b>operations</b> <b>countered</b> scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been judged to be expensive failures in the past.

5000|$|In 1957, SACEUR General Lauris Norstad, USAF, {{noting the}} {{numerical}} superiority of Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces over NATO ground forces, called for [...] "about 30" [...] divisions to augment NATO’s central European front. That year Allied Command Europe carried out <b>Operation</b> <b>Counter</b> Punch, which involved AFCENT {{forces on the}} European mainland, and two other major military exercises in September 1957. Operation Strikeback {{was a series of}} multilateral naval exercises that concentrated on NATO's eastern Atlantic/northern European flank.

40|$|A {{technique}} for the redundant <b>operation</b> of <b>counter</b> modules is described. Redundant operation is maintained by detecting the zero state of each counter and clearing {{the other to}} that state, thus periodically resynchronizing the counters, and obtaining an output from both counters through AC coupled diode-OR gates. Redundant <b>operation</b> of <b>counter</b> flip flops is maintained in a similar manner, and synchronous operation of redundant squarewave clock generators of the feedback type is effected by connecting together the feedback inputs of the squarewave generators through a coupling resistor, and obtaining an output from both generators through AC coupled diode-OR gates...|$|R

50|$|Attacks have notably {{occurred}} in countries participating in Operation Inherent Resolve, the military intervention against ISIL. Examples of individual countries' efforts against ISIL include France's Opération Chammal and Germany's <b>Operation</b> <b>Counter</b> Daesh. Russia has also carried out attacks against ISIL, {{as well as}} carrying out a military campaign in support of Bashar al-Assad, the embattled president of Syria. Many attacks {{are believed to be}} motivated partly by retaliation for this military intervention against ISIL. However, even neutral countries such as Sweden and Finland have been attacked. While the security forces have been targeted by terrorists, the majority have been attacks against civilians in urban areas. This has led to increased security across Europe, including ongoing domestic military deployments in countries including France (Opération Sentinelle), Belgium, Italy, and the United Kingdom (Operation Temperer).|$|E
5000|$|Operation Hammer was a CRASH-led {{initiative}} {{that began in}} 1987 {{to crack down on}} gang violence in South Central Los Angeles. As a result of increasing gang violence and a drive-by killing resulting in the deaths of seven people, then-Chief of Police Daryl Gates responded by sending CRASH officers to arrest suspected gang members. At the height of this operation in April 1988, 1,453 people were arrested by one thousand police officers in a single weekend. While considered successful by some, this operation and the LAPD were maligned with accusations of racism; some believed that Operation Hammer heavily employed racial profiling, targeting African-American and Hispanic youths that were labelled as [...] "urban terrorists" [...] and [...] "ruthless killers." [...] However, proponents of the <b>operation</b> <b>counter</b> that it was not discriminatory as each gang member arrested had warrants for their arrests.|$|E
5000|$|As May {{turned to}} June, Major General David L. Ruffner of the 45th Division holding the right {{flank of the}} I Corps' line, was {{frustrated}} by the view that enemy observers had of his division’s positions. Opposing the 45th Division {{from east to west}} were elements of the Chinese 338th and 339th Regiments (113th Division, 38th Army), the 350th and 349th Regiments (117th Division, 39th Army), and the 344th Regiment (115th Division, 39th Army). The other infantry components of the 113th, 115th, and 117th Divisions were in reserve, as was the 116th Division, 39th Army. The Chinese had over ten battalions of artillery positioned along the front in direct or general support roles. Maj. Gen. Ruffner laid plans for <b>Operation</b> <b>Counter,</b> a two-phase operation to capture and hold 12 outposts a few thousand yards in front of the main line. One of the most prominent hills came to be called [...] "Old Baldy", which earned its nickname after artillery and mortar fire destroyed the trees on its crest. But as the highest point on a prominent east-west ridge, Old Baldy held strategic importance because it dominated terrain in three directions.|$|E
