40|$|We {{have used}} {{site-specific}} mutagenesis {{to change the}} anticodon of a Xenopus laevis tyrosine tRNA gene {{so that it would}} recognize ochre codons. This tRNA gene is expressed when amplified in monkey cells as part of a SV 40 recombinant and efficiently suppresses termination at both the <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> separating the adenovirus 2 hexon gene from a 23 -kd downstream gene and the <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> {{at the end of the}} NS 1 gene of influenza virus A/Tex/ 1 / 68. Termination at an amber codon of a NS 1 gene of another influenza virus strain was not suppressed by the (Su+) ochre gene suggesting that in mammalian cells amber codons are not recognized by ochre suppressor tRNAs. Finally, microinjection into mammalian cells of both (Su+) ochre tRNA genes and selectible genes containing ochre nonsense mutations gives rise to colonies under selective conditions. We conclude that it should be possible to isolate a wide assortment of mammalian cell lines with ochre suppressor activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{plasmid gene}} cat- 86 {{specifies}} chloramphenicol-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in Bacillus subtilis. Induction by the antibiotic is {{primarily due to}} activation of the translation of cat- 86 -encoded mRNA. It {{has been suggested that}} the inducer stalls ribosomes at a discrete location in the leader region of cat- 86 mRNA, which causes the destabilization of a downstream RNA secondary structure that normally sequesters the cat- 86 ribosome binding site. It is the destabilization of this RNA secondary structure that permits translation of the cat- 86 coding sequence. In the present report, we show that ribosomes that were stalled in the cat- 86 leader by starvation of host cells for the amino acid specified by leader codon 6 induced gene expression to a level above that detected when cells were starved for the amino acids specified by leader codons 7 and 8. Starvation for amino acids specified by leader codons 3, 4, or 5 failed to activate cat- 86 expression. These results indicate that the stalled ribosome that is most active in cat- 86 induction has its aminoacyl site occupied by leader codon 6. To determine if chloramphenicol also stalled ribosomes in the cat- 86 regulatory leader such that the aminoacyl site was occupied by codon 6, we separately changed leader codons 3, 4, 5, and 6 to the translation termination (<b>ochre)</b> <b>codon</b> TAA. Each of the mutated genes was tested for its ability to be induced by chloramphenicol. The results show that replacement of leader codons 3, 4, or 5 by the <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> blocked induction, whereas replacement of leader codon 6 by the <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> permitted induction. Collectively, these observations lead to the conclusion that cat- 86 induction requires ribosome stalling in leader mRNA, and they identify leader codon 6 as the codon most likely to be occupied by the aminoacyl site of a stalled ribosome that is active in the induction...|$|E
40|$|A {{polypeptide}} chain-terminating {{mutation in}} the yeast mitochondrial oxi 1 gene {{has been shown}} to be an ochre (TAA) mutation by DNA sequence analysis. Mitochondrially inherited revertants of this mutation include two types: In the first, the <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> has been changed to a sense codon by further mutation in the oxi 1 gene while, in the second, the <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> is still present, indicating the occurrence of an extrageneic ochre suppressor mutation. This mitochondrial ochre suppressor, termed MSU 1, has been "cloned" in rho- strains of yeast and tested against other oxi 1 mutations. Several additional mutations are also suppressible, and those examined so far are also ochre mutations. MSU 1 does not suppress known frameshift or missense mutations at oxi 1. Isoelectric focusing of the gene product (cytochrome oxidase subunit II) from a suppressed-mutant strain indicates that suppression does not involve insertion of charged amino acids. Physical mapping of the mtDNA retained in the MSU 1 -carrying rho- clones localizes the suppressor mutation to the gene coding the 15 S rRNA or a site not more than 300 base pairs from it. No known tRNA genes occur this close to the 15 S rRNA gene, and mtDNA from a suppressor-carrying rho- does not hybridize detectably to mitochondrial tRNAs. These results suggest that MSU 1 may be an alteration in the 15 S rRNA...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequencies}} of 2 -aminopurine- and 5 -bromouracil-induced A:T → G:C transitions were compared at nonsense sites throughout the rII region of bacteriophage T 4. These frequencies are influenced both by adjacent base pairs within the nonsense codons and by extracodonic factors. Following 2 AP treatment, they {{are high in}} amber (UAG) and lower in opal (UGA) codons than in allelic <b>ochre</b> (UAA) <b>codons.</b> In general, 5 BU-induced transitions are more frequent in both amber and opal codons than in the allelic <b>ochre</b> <b>codons.</b> 2 AP- and 5 BU-induced transition frequencies {{in the first and}} third positions of opal codons are correlated with those in the corresponding positions of the allelic <b>ochre</b> <b>codons.</b> Similarly, the {{frequencies of}} 2 AP-induced transition in the first and second positions of amber <b>codons</b> and their <b>ochre</b> alleles are correlated. However, there is little correlation between the frequencies of 5 BU-induced transitions in the first and second positions of allelic amber and <b>ochre</b> <b>codons...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{nonsense}} suppressor {{is a factor}} which can inhibit {{the effect of the}} nonsense mutation. Nonsense suppressors can be generally divided into two classes: a) a mutated tRNA which can bind with a termination codon on mRNA; b) a mutation on ribosomes decreasing the effect of a termination codon. It's believed that {{nonsense suppressor}}s keep a low concentration in the cell and do not disrupt normal translation most of the time. In addition, many genes do not have only one termination codon, and cells commonly use <b>ochre</b> <b>codons</b> as the termination signal, whose nonsense suppressors are usually inefficient.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of mRNA context on nonsense codon suppression {{has been studied}} by suppression measurements at one site in the Escherichia coli trpE gene and at two sites in the trpA gene. The ratio of suppression efficiencies of amber and <b>ochre</b> <b>codons</b> at each site (homotopic pairs) has been compared using ochre suppressing derivatives of tRNA 1 Tyr. This ratio is independent of differential effects of the inserted amino acid on enzyme function. We have found that mRNA context can change the ratio of suppression efficiencies of homotopic nonsense codons at the three sites in the trp gene system over a ten-fold range. The causes of such variation, and, in particular the effect of certain adjacent nucleotides on nonsense codon suppression are considered...|$|R
40|$|RNA 2 of the {{multipartite}} genome of beet necrotic yellow vein virus {{carries the}} cistron for 21 -kDa viral coat protein at its 5 ' extremity. The amber termination codon of the coat protein cistron undergoes suppression approximately 10 % {{of the time}} so that translation continues into an adjacent 54 -kDa open reading frame, yielding a 75 -kDa readthrough protein. The roles of coat protein and the readthrough protein in infection were investigated with biologically active transcripts of RNA 2. Much of the coat protein cistron of the RNA 2 transcript could be deleted without interfering with viral replication and local lesion formation on leaves, although formation of the rod-shaped virions did not occur. Mutants in which the amber coat protein termination codon was replaced with an <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> or a tyrosine codon were also viable. The <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> was suppressed both in vitro and in planta. The mutant containing the tyrosine substitution produced only the 75 -kDa read-through protein and was deficient in viral assembly. Deletions in the 54 -kDa readthrough domain were also viable in planta but had different effects on virus assembly. A deletion in the C-terminal portion of the readthrough domain did not interfere with RNA packaging but, unexpectedly, deletions in the N-terminal portion were assembly deficient, although 21 -kDa coat protein was produced in planta. Thus, the 75 -kDa protein can apparently intervene in virion assembly {{even though it has}} not been detected in purified virions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{majority}} of eukaryotic tRNAs, the guanosine at position 26 is modified by a dimethyl group, but so far a function of this modification has not been detected. We isolated the Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene, trm 1, encoding the tRNA N 2,N 2 -dimethylguanosine- 26 methyltransferase. Strains having the gene deleted completely lack N 2,N 2 -dimethylguanosine. In strains carrying the weak ochre tRNA suppressor sup 3 -i, deletion of trm 1 abolishes suppression indicating that the trm 1 deletion acts as an antisuppressor mutation. The result suggests that in vivo N 2,N 2 -dimethylguanosine- 26 increases {{the capacity of the}} sup 3 -i serine tRNA to translate the UAA (<b>ochre)</b> <b>codon...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{site-specific}} {{insertion of}} an unnatural amino acid into proteins in vivo via nonsense suppression {{has resulted in}} major advances in recent years. The ability to incorporate two different unnatural amino acids in vivo would greatly increase the scope and impact of unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. Here, we show the concomitant suppression of an amber and an <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> in a single mRNA in mammalian cells by importing a mixture of aminoacylated amber and ochre suppressor tRNAs. This result provides a possible approach to site-specific insertion of two different unnatural amino acids into any protein of interest in mammalian cells. To our knowledge, this result also represents the only demonstration of concomitant suppression of two different termination codons in a single gene in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide {{sequence}} analysis {{of one of}} several tRNA genes cloned from Tetrahymena thermophila macronuclear DNA indicated that it corresponds to a tRNA species having TTA as anticodon. Subsequently, the tRNA species corresponding to that gene was isolated and its nucleotide sequence was determined by post-labeling techniques. The nucleotide sequence {{was found to be}} pG-G-U-U-C-C-A-U-A-m 2 G-U-A-psi-A-G-D-G-G-D- D-A-G-U-A-C-U-G-G-G-G-A-Cm-U-Um-U-A-i 6 A-A-psi-C-C-C-U-U-G-A-C- m 5 C-U-G-G-G-U-psi-C-G-m 1 A-A-U-C-C-C-A-G-U-G-G-G-A-C-C-U-C-C-AOH. This tRNA sequence exactly matched the DNA sequence of the corresponding tRNA gene. The first position of anticodon is 2 '-O-methyluridine (Um), forming UmUA as the anticodon, which presumably recognizes the <b>ochre</b> termination <b>codon</b> UAA. This tRNA species is aminoacylated with glutamine by a Tetrahymena crude aminoacyl tRNA synthetase fraction, suggesting that <b>ochre</b> termination <b>codon</b> is used as a glutamine codon during cytoplasmic protein synthesis in Tetrahymena...|$|R
500|$|The three stop codons have names: UAG is amber, UGA is opal (sometimes {{also called}} umber), and UAA is <b>ochre.</b> Stop <b>codons</b> are also called [...] "termination" [...] or [...] "nonsense" [...] codons.

40|$|Translational {{attenuation}} {{has been}} proposed to be the mechanism by which the erm(B) gene is induced. Here, we report genetic and biochemical evidence, obtained by using erythromycin as the inducing antibiotic, that supports this hypothesis. We also show that erythromycin increases {{the level of the}} erm(B) transcript by stalling the ribosome on the leader mRNA and thereby facilitating the stabilization and processing of the mRNA. Erythromycin-induced mRNA stabilization and processing were observed with an <b>ochre</b> stop at <b>codons</b> 11 to 13 of the leader but not with an <b>ochre</b> stop at <b>codon</b> 10. This suggests that erythromycin does not stall the ribosome before codon 11 of the leader reaches the aminoacyl site. Secondary structure analyses of the erm(B) transcripts by in vitro and in vivo chemical probing techniques identified conformational changes in the transcripts that result from induction by erythromycin. These findings demonstrate that stalling of erythromycin-bound ribosomes at leader codon 11 causes the refolding of mRNA into a conformation in which the translational initiation site for the structural gene is unmasked and renders erm(B) translationally active...|$|R
40|$|Amber, ochre and opal {{suppressor}} tRNA genes {{have been}} generated by using oligonucleotide directed site-specific mutagenesis to change {{one or two}} nucleotides in a human serine tRNA gene. The amber and ochre suppressor (Su+) tRNA genes are efficiently expressed in CV- 1 cells when introduced {{as part of a}} SV 40 recombinant. The expressed amber and ochre Su+ tRNAs are functional as suppressors as demonstrated by readthrough of the amber codon which terminates the NS 1 gene of an influenza virus or the <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> which terminates the hexon gene of adenovirus, respectively. Interestingly, several attempts to obtain the equivalent virus stock of an SV 40 recombinant containing the opal suppressor tRNA gene yielded virus lacking the opal suppressor tRNA gene. This suggests that expression of an efficient opal suppressor derived from a human serine tRNA gene is highly detrimental to either cellular or viral processes...|$|E
40|$|We have {{established}} an {{in vitro transcription}} system to produce infectious tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA from a cloned cDNA copy. Using this system, several TMV mutants were transcribed in vitro from cDNA clones mutagenized {{at or near the}} leaky amber termination codon of the 130 K protein gene, and their infectivity was assayed on tobacco plants. Three (two frame-shift and one non-sense) mutants with an intact 130 K but a defective 180 K protein gene were not infectious, while two mutants with a one-amino-acid insertion in the 180 K protein gene were infectious. When the amber codon of the 130 K protein gene was deleted, infectivity was lost. However, when the amber termination codon was replaced with ochre or tyrosine codon, infectivity was retained. Sequence analyses revealed that introduced mutations were retained in progeny viral sequences except in the progeny of the amber-to-tyrosine mutant, which was a mixture of the parental mutagenized virus and a pseudo-revertant with <b>ochre</b> <b>codon...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{mutation}} sup- 3 in Bacillus subtilis suppresses ochre (TAA) mutations at each {{of three}} codons in the 5 ' end of the cat- 86 coding sequence. The suppressor is shown to insert lysine at ochre codons. The efficiency of suppression by sup- 3 is about 15 %, as determined by changing a cat- 86 Lys codon (codon 12) to an <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> and measuring the level of CAT in the suppressor-containing strain. The results obtained are discussed in light of previous observations that ochre mutations at cat leader codons 2 and 3 can be phenotypically suppressed by sup- 3, whereas ochre mutations at leader codons 4 and 5 cannot. Translation of the cat leader is essential to inducible expression of cat. Our data support the interpretation {{that the nature of}} amino acids 2 through 5 of the leader peptide contributes to determining whether chloramphenicol can stall a ribosome in the leader, which in turn leads to induction of cat expression...|$|E
40|$|Complete {{androgen}} insensitivity {{syndrome is}} an X-linked inherited disorder caused by mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. Using {{polymerase chain reaction}} single-strand DNA conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing, we identified a novel nonsense mutation in exon 1 of the AR gene in 2 Iranian brothers with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Despite a normal 46,XY karyotype, testes, and normal to elevated plasma levels of testosterone, they were born with female external genitalia and phenotype. This new mutation, a T-to-A transversion in exon 1, causes amino acid change of tyrosine (TAT) to <b>ochre</b> stop <b>codon</b> (TAA) at position 514 of the AR polypeptide. The Y 514 X mutation {{is located in a}} region that is normally important for the formation and function of the hormone receptor complex. We conclude that the novel Y 514 X mutation in the androgen receptor is the cause of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome in this family...|$|R

To {{identify}} genes potentially {{involved in these}} supramolecular events, {{we have used a}} colony-color assay to screen temperature-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When a sequence that mediates attachment to the nuclear matrix in vitro was inserted into the GAL 1 promoter of a lacZ fusion gene, beta-galactosidase synthesis was inhibited. This observation permitted screening for temperature-sensitive-inducible mutants on 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl beta-D-galactoside plates. Only 1 of 20 complementation groups of newly isolated mutants exhibited temperature-sensitive inducibility for the matrix association region but not for control CEN 3 or STE 6 inserts [...] a cmd 1 mutant in which the last 7 amino acids of calmodulin were truncated by an <b>ochre</b> termination <b>codon.</b> Another mutant (smi 1) exhibited a rare phenotype at the nonpermissive condition, which included S phase and budding arrest. We cloned and sequenced the SMI 1 gene, which encodes a 57 -kDa polypeptide with evolutionarily conserved epitope(s) found in mammalian cell nuclei. Thus, we provide evidence for involvement of calmodulin and another conserved protein in the in vivo binding of a matrix association region...|$|R

Previous studies established that the biosynthesis and function of iso- 1 -cytochrome c is compatible with replacements at position 9 of amino acids having widely different structures (Stewart and Sherman 1972). UV-induced revertants, selected on media requiring the reversion of {{one or two of the}} amber nutritional markers, were presumed to contain a suppressor if there was the unselected reversion of at least one other marker. The 1088 suppressors that were isolated could be divided into 78 phenotypic classes. Only 43 suppressors of three classes caused the production of more than 50 % of the normal amount of iso- 1 -cytochrome c in the cyc 1 – 179 strain. Genetic analyses indicated that all of these highly efficient amber suppressors are allelic to one or another of the eight suppressors which cause the insertion of tyrosine at <b>ochre</b> (UAA) <b>codons</b> (Gilmore, Stewart and Sherman 1971). Furthermore, only tyrosine has been identified at position 9 in iso- 1 -cytochrome c in cyc 1 – 179 strains suppressed with these efficient amber suppressors...|$|R
40|$|Dihydroorotase, {{the third}} enzymatic {{activity}} of the pyrimidine pathway, is encoded in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by a single gene URA 4, which is induced {{at the transcriptional level}} by accumulation of ureidosuccinic acid. A regulatory gene PPR 2 (pyrimidine pathway regulatory 2) acting specifically on this step, has been characterized, cloned and sequenced. The main open reading frame is 384 nucleotides long and potentially codes for a basic protein, favoring a molecular mechanism involving direct binding of a regulatory protein to DNA. The short length of the PPR 2 polypeptide chain and the presence of seven cysteine residues suggest that the active form of the protein is an oligomer assembled through disulphide bonds. An uninducible allele has been cloned and sequenced. The mutation corresponds to an A leads to T transversion changing a lysine triplet into an <b>ochre</b> <b>codon.</b> The uninducible phenotype of this mutant is completely suppressed by an ochre suppressor, strengthening the hypothesis that PPR 2 acts on URA 4 transcription through the synthesis of a regulatory protein...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} better {{the characteristics of}} the coliphage T 3 S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) hydrolase (AdoMetase, E. C. 3. 3. 1. 2) and its expression in phage-infected Escherichia coli, we determined the DNA sequence of the cloned gene and its surrounding ribonuclease (RNase) III mRNA transcript processing sites. The AdoMetase gene contains two in-frame protein translation initiation sites specifying peptides 17105 and 13978 daltons in size. Both proteins terminate at the same <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> making the shorter peptide identical to the carboxy terminal 82 % of the 17 kd protein. Our data explain the existence of two AdoMetase-related peptides in preparations of the purified enzyme as well as identify sequences that might serve to regulate the enzyme's expression. Comparisons between this T 3 sequence and the homologous 0. 3 gene region of the closely related coliphage T 7 show both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences to be unrelated. The RNase III mRNA processing sites that bracket these genes in T 3 and T 7 are highly conserved in both their primary and secondary structures...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome rearrangements which place {{euchromatic}} genes {{adjacent to}} a heterochromatic break-point frequently result in gene repression (position-effect variegation). This repression is thought to reflect the spreading of a heterochromatic structure into neighboring euchromatin. Two allelic dominant suppressors of position-effect variegation were found to contain mutations within the gene encoding the heterochromatin-specific chromosomal protein HP- 1. The site of mutation for each allele is given: one converts Lys(169) into a nonsense (<b>ochre)</b> <b>codon,</b> while {{the other is a}} frameshift after Ser(10). In flies heterozygous for one of the mutant alleles (Su(var) 2 - 5 (04)), a truncated HP- 1 protein was detectable by Western blot analysis. An HP- 1 minigene, consisting of HP- 1 cDNA under the control of an Hsp 70 heat-inducible promoter, was transduced into flies by P element-mediated germ line transformation. Heat-shock driven expression of this minigene results in elevated HP- 1 protein level and enhancement of position-effect variegation. Levels of variegating gene expression thus appear to depend upon the level of expression of a heterochromatin-specific protein. The implications of these observations for mechanism of heterochromatic position effects and heterochromatin function are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{replacement}} {{mediated by}} Tn 5 sequences {{was used to}} integrate the Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD- 1 delta-endotoxin gene (tox) into the chromosome of two corn root-colonizing strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens. A Tn 5 transposase deletion element containing the tox gene (delta Tn 5 -tox) was substituted for a Tn 5 element previously present in the P. fluorescens chromosome. Two classes of delta Tn 5 -tox elements were made. The first class encodes kanamycin resistance {{in addition to the}} Tox protein, whereas the second class encodes only the Tox protein. Both classes of delta Tn 5 -tox elements can no longer transpose, owing to a 324 -base-pair deletion in the transposase gene of IS 50 R, minimizing the potential for horizontal gene transfer of the tox gene to other bacterial species. A frameshift mutation in the transposase gene of IS 50 L was also constructed to eliminate the possibility of suppression or of a spontaneous reversion at the <b>ochre</b> termination <b>codon</b> that would create an active transposase. Expression of the Tox protein in P. fluorescens strains 112 - 12 and Ps 3732 - 3 - 7 was demonstrated by an immunological assay (Western blot) and toxicity against larvae of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) ...|$|R
40|$|Elongator {{has been}} {{reported}} to be a histone acetyltransferase complex involved in elongation of RNA polymerase II transcription. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in any of the six Elongator protein subunit (ELP 1 –ELP 6) genes or the three killer toxin insensitivity (KTI 11 –KTI 13) genes cause similar pleiotropic phenotypes. By analyzing modified nucleosides in individual tRNA species, we show that the ELP 1 –ELP 6 and KTI 11 –KTI 13 genes are all required for an early step in synthesis of 5 -methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm 5) and 5 -carbamoylmethyl (ncm 5) groups present on uridines at the wobble position in tRNA. Transfer RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the Elp 1 and Elp 3 proteins specifically coprecipitate a tRNA susceptible to formation of an mcm 5 side chain, indicating a direct role of Elongator in tRNA modification. The presence of mcm 5 U, ncm 5 U, or derivatives thereof at the wobble position is required for accurate and efficient translation, suggesting that the phenotypes of elp 1 –elp 6 and kti 11 –kti 13 mutants could be caused by a translational defect. Accordingly, a deletion of any ELP 1 –ELP 6 or KTI 11 –KTI 13 gene prevents an ochre suppressor tRNA that normally contains mcm 5 U from reading <b>ochre</b> stop <b>codons...</b>|$|R

This vector, pFG 1, causes only a slight growth inhibition in the laboratory strain MG 1363 but is unstable in the industrial strains tested. As supB suppresses both amber and <b>ochre</b> stop <b>codons,</b> which are present in 82 % of all known lactococcal genes, this undesirable finding may result from the accumulation of elongated mistranslated polypeptides. Here, we report {{the development of a new}} food-grade cloning vector, pFG 200, which is suitable for overexpressing a variety of genes in industrial strains of Lactococcus lactis. The vector uses an amber suppressor, supD, as selectable marker and consists entirely of Lactococcus DNA, with the exception of a small polylinker region. Using suppressible pyrimidine auxotrophs, selection and maintenance are efficient in any pyrimidine-free medium including milk. Importantly, the presence of this vector in a variety of industrial strains has no significant effect on the growth rate or the rate of acidification in milk, making this an ideal system for food-grade modification of industrially relevant L. lactis strains. The usefulness of this system is demonstrated by overexpressing the pepN gene in a number of industrial backgrounds...|$|R
40|$|The his 4 - 917 {{mutation}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{results from}} the insertion of the Ty element Ty 917 into the regulatory region of the HIS 4 gene and renders the cell His-. The hist 4 - 912 delta mutant, which carries a solo delta in the 5 '-noncoding region of HIS 4, is His+ at 37 degrees C but His- at 23 degrees C. Both these mutations interfere with HIS 4 expression at the transcriptional level. The His- phenotype of both insertion mutations is suppressed by mutations at the SPT 2 locus. The product of the wild-type SPT 2 gene apparently represses HIS 4 transcription in these mutant strains; this repression is relieved when the SPT 2 gene is destroyed by mutation. The repression of transcription by SPT 2 presumably results from an interaction between the SPT 2 + gene product and Ty or delta sequences. In this paper, we report the cloning and DNA sequence analysis of the wild-type SPT 2 gene and show that the gene is capable of encoding a protein of 333 amino acids in length. In addition, we show that a dominant mutation of the SPT 2 gene {{results from the}} generation of an <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> which is presumed {{to lead to a}} shortened SPT 2 gene product...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{studies of}} basal {{nonsense}} suppression, orthogonality of tRNAPyl variants, and cross recognition between codons and tRNA anticodons are reported. E. coli displays detectable basal amber and opal suppression but shows a negligible ochre suppression. Although detectable, basal amber suppression is fully inhibited when a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) -tRNAPyl_CUA pair is genetically encoded. trnaPyl_CUA is aminoacylated by an E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase {{at a low}} level, however, this misaminoacylation is fully inhibited when both PylRS and its substrate are present. Besides that it is fully orthogonal in E. coli and can be coupled with PylRS to genetically incorporate a NAA at an <b>ochre</b> <b>codon,</b> tRNAPyl_UUA {{is not able to}} recognize an UAG codon to induce amber suppression. This observation is in direct conflict with the wobble base pair hypothesis and enables using an evolved M. jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNAPyl_UUA pair and the wild type or evolved PylRS-tRNAPyl_UUA pair to genetically incorporate two different NAAs at amber and ochre codons. tRNAPyl_UCA is charged by E. coli tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, thus not orthogonal in E. coli. Mutagenic studies of trnaPyl_UCA led to the discovery of its G 73 U form which shows a higher orthogonality. Mutating trnaPyl_CUA to trnaPyl_UCCU not only leads to the loss of the relative orthogonality of tRNAPyl in E. coli but also abolishes its aminoacylation by PylRS...|$|E
40|$|Ribonuclease LS in Escherichia coli is a {{potential}} antagonist of bacteriophage T 4. When T 4 dmd is mutated, this RNase efficiently cleaves T 4 mRNAs and leads to the silencing of late genes, thus blocking T 4 growth. We previously found that, when two consecutive ochre codons {{were placed in the}} open reading frame of T 4 soc, RNase LS cleaved soc mRNA at a specific site downstream of the ochre codons. Here, we demonstrate that RNase LS cleaves soc RNA at the same site even when only a single <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> is present or is replaced with either an amber or an opal codon. On the other hand, disruption of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, a ribosome-binding site required for the initiation of translation, eliminates the cleavage. These results strongly suggest that RNase LS cleaves in a manner dependent on translation termination. Consistent with this suggestion, the cleavage dependency on an amber codon was considerably reduced in the presence of amber-codon-suppressing tRNA. Instead, two other cleavages that depend on translation of the region containing the target sites occurred farther downstream. Additional analysis suggests that an interaction of the ribosome with a stop codon might affect the site of cleavage by RNase LS in an mRNA molecule. This effect of the ribosome could reflect remodeling of the high-order structure of the mRNA molecule...|$|E

The ability of chemicals to induce such gene conversions can easily be monitored in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tester strain YHE 2, a derivative of strain D 7. For the detection of drug-induced gene conversions, two mutations in the TRP 5 locus are used, trp 5 - 12 and trp 5 - 27. Here we report on the characterization of the stable allele trp 5 - 27. Our analysis revealed two relevant mutations in trp 5 - 27 : (a) a transition C to T at position 121 after ATG that results in an amber stop codon and abolishes gene expression and (b) a transversion A to T at position 1555 that creates an <b>ochre</b> stop <b>codon.</b> Simultaneous amber and ochre suppression with the suppressors SUP 3 and SUP 11, respectively, was capable of relieving the tryptophan-requiring phenotype of strains carrying the trp 5 - 27 allele. These findings have implications on the length of gene conversion tracts in conversion events between trp 5 - 12 and trp 5 - 27 : conversion tracts can cover several kilobases, if the site of the mutation in trp 5 - 12 lies outside of the positions mutated in trp 5 - 27.

40|$|Two {{efficient}} {{systems have}} been used for high-level expression of Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase in Escherichia coli, including the production of protein generally and specifically labeled with 13 C and 15 N. A system based on T 7 RNA polymerase led to the production of dihydrofolate reductase at a level of 37 % of the total soluble protein of the host strain: 50 mg of pure enzyme was obtained from a 1 liter of culture (or 14 mg/g wet weight of cells). In this system, a small amount of the enzyme (less than 5 %) was identified as a catalytically active 21 -kDa fusion protein. Introduction of a second in-frame (<b>ochre)</b> stop <b>codon</b> did not eliminate the production of this fusion protein. The same expression system was also used to prepare dihydrofolate reductase generally labeled with 15 N and to prepare single and double mutants of the enzyme. In order to have an expression system which can be used with a range of auxotrophic strains of E. coli, a system based on the tac promoter was used. This led to the production of dihydrofolate reductase at a level of 29 % of total soluble protein; a yield of 40 mg enzyme per liter of culture (or 11 mg/g wet weight of cells). This system was successfully used to produce mutants of the enzyme as well as the enzyme selectively labeled with [gamma- 13 C]aspartic acid. 7648...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of the tRNA ochre suppressors SUP 11 and SUP 5 is found to induce meiosis I nondisjunction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The induction increases with increasing dosage of the suppressor and decreases in the {{presence of}} an antisuppressor. The effect is independent of the chromosomal location of SUP 11. Each of five different chromosomes monitored exhibited nondisjunction at frequencies of 0. 1 %- 1. 1 % of random spores, which is a 16 - 160 -fold increase over wild-type levels. Increased nondisjunction is reflected by a marked increase in tetrads with two and zero viable spores. In the case of chromosome III, for which a 50 -cM map interval was monitored, the resulting disomes are all in the parental nonrecombinant configuration. Recombination along chromosome III appears normal both in meioses that have no nondisjunction and in meioses for which there was nondisjunction of another chromosome. We propose that a proportion of one or more proteins involved in chromosome pairing, recombination or segregation are aberrant due to translational read-through of the normal <b>ochre</b> stop <b>codon.</b> Hygromycin B, an antibiotic that can suppress nonsense mutations via translational read-through, also induces nonrecombinant meiosis I nondisjunction. Increases in mistranslation, therefore, increase the production of aneuploids during meiosis. There was no observable effect of SUP 11 on mitotic chromosome nondisjunction; however some disomes caused SUP 11 ade 2 -ochre strains to appear white or red, instead of pink...|$|R
40|$|Sex-lethal (Sxl), a key sex {{determination}} gene in Drosophila melanogaster, {{is known to}} express a set of three early transcripts arising during early embryogenesis {{and a set of}} seven late transcripts occurring from midembryogenesis through adulthood. Among the late transcripts, male-specific mRNAs were distinguished from their female counterparts by the presence of an extra exon interrupting an otherwise long open reading frame (ORF). We have now analyzed the structures of the late Sxl transcripts by cDNA sequencing, Northern (RNA) blotting, primer extension, and RNase protection. The late transcripts appear to use a common 5 ' end but differ at their 3 ' ends by the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. Two of these sites lack canonical AATAAA sequences, and their use correlates in females with the presence of a functional germ line, suggesting possible tissue-specific polyadenylation. Besides the presence of the male-specific exon, no additional sex-specific splicing events were detected, although a number of non-sex-specific splicing variants were observed. In females, the various forms of late Sxl transcript potentially encode up to six slightly different polypeptides. All of the protein-coding differences occur outside the previously defined ribonucleoprotein motifs. One class of Sxl mRNAs also includes a second long ORF in the same frame as the first ORF but separated from it by a single <b>ochre</b> <b>codon.</b> The function of this second ORF is unknown. Significant amounts of apparently partially processed Sxl RNAs were observed, consistent with the hypothesis that the regulated Sxl splices occur relatively slowly...|$|E

Sequencing of the ORF- 6 of mutant sus 1 (629) showed that a C in the wild-type (wt) phage had been changed to a T at nt position 19 of the ORF- 6, giving rise to a TAA <b>ochre</b> <b>codon,</b> indicating that this ORF corresponds to gene 1. ORF- 6 was cloned in plasmid pPLc 28 {{under the control of}} the pL promoter of phage λ and, after induction, a protein of about 10 kDa was overproduced, which was absent in the corresponding cells harbouring a recombinant plasmid with the sus 1 (629) mutation, indicating that the 10 -kDa protein is the product of gene 1. In addition, a protein of lower Mr was synthesized after induction of the cells harbouring recombinant plasmids with the wt or the sus 1 (629) DNA. Both proteins were purified and characterized by N-terminal sequence determination and amino acid analysis. The low-Mr protein, named Δ 1, has a size of 6 kDa and corresponds to an internal in-phase initiation event in ORF- 6.

40|$|The lpxB gene of Escherichia coli, {{believed}} to be the structural gene for lipid A disaccharide synthase, is located in the min 4 region of the chromosome. It is adjacent to and clockwise of the lpxA gene, which is thought to encode UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase. Preliminary evidence suggests that lpxA and lpxB are cotranscribed in the clockwise direction and thus constitute part of a previously unknown operon (D. N. Crowell, M. S. Anderson, and C. R. H. Raetz, J. Bacteriol. 168 : 152 - 159, 1986). We now report the complete nucleotide sequence of a 1, 522 -base-pair PvuII-HincII fragment known to carry the lpxB gene. This sequence contained an open reading frame of 1, 149 base pairs, in agreement with the predicted size, location, and orientation of lpxB. There was a second open reading frame 5 ' to, and in the same orientation as, lpxB that corresponded to lpxA. The <b>ochre</b> <b>codon</b> terminating lpxA was shown to overlap the methionine codon identified as the initiation codon for lpxB, suggesting that these genes are cotranscribed and translationally coupled. A third open reading frame was also shown to begin at the 3 ' end of lpxB with analogous overlap between the opal codon terminating lpxB and the methionine codon that putatively initiates translation downstream of lpxB in the clockwise direction. These results argue that at least three genes constitute a translationally coupled operon in the min 4 region of the E. coli chromosome. The accompanying paper by Tomasiewicz and McHenry (J. Bacteriol. 169 : 5735 - 5744, 1987) presents 4. 35 kilobases of DNA sequence, beginning at the 3 ' end of lpxB, and argues that dnaE and several other open reading frames may be members of this operon...|$|E
40|$|A general {{approach}} to site-specific insertion of amino acid analogues into proteins in vivo {{would be the}} import into cells of a suppressor tRNA aminoacylated with the analogue of choice. The analogue would be inserted at any site in the protein specified by a stop codon in the mRNA. The only requirement is that the suppressor tRNA must not be a substrate {{for any of the}} cellular aminoacyl–tRNA synthetases. Here, we describe conditions for the import of amber and ochre suppressor tRNAs derived from Escherichia coli initiator tRNA into mammalian COS 1 cells, and we present evidence for their activity in the specific suppression of amber (UAG) and <b>ochre</b> (UAA) <b>codons,</b> respectively. We show that an aminoacylated amber suppressor tRNA (supF) derived from the E. coli tyrosine tRNA can be imported into COS 1 cells and acts as a suppressor of amber codons, whereas the same suppressor tRNA imported without prior aminoacylation does not, suggesting that the supF tRNA is not a substrate for any mammalian aminoacyl–tRNA synthetase. These results open the possibility of using the supF tRNA aminoacylated with an amino acid analogue as a {{general approach}} for the site-specific insertion of amino acid analogues into proteins in mammalian cells. We discuss the possibility further of importing a mixture of amber and ochre suppressor tRNAs for the insertion of two different amino acid analogues into a protein and the potential use of suppressor tRNA import for treatment of some of the human genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations...|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{sequence}} {{changes of}} 31 mutations altering the attenuation control {{mechanism of the}} histidine operon are presented. These mutations are {{discussed in terms of}} a model for operon regulation that involves a his leader peptide gene whose translation regulates formation of alternative stem-loop structures in the his leader messenger RNA. Three suppressible mutations generate nonsense <b>codons</b> (<b>ochre</b> and UGA) in the his leader peptide gene, demonstrating that translation of this gene is essential for operon expression. Eight mutations presumably reduce the efficiency of translation initiation of the his leader peptide gene, causing reduced levels of operon expression. Five of these mutations directly alter the leader peptide gene initiator codon (AUG). Three mutations alter sequences {{just in front of the}} initiator codon and presumably alter the ribosome recognition site. Fourteen mutations reduce the stability of the h,is leader mRNA stem-loop structures that are alternatives to the attenuator stem. The properties of these mutations provide support for the role of these stem-loop structures in preventing formation of the attenuator stem. Finally, we show that mutations that alter the attenuator ste...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies induced against {{mammalian}} single-stranded DNA binding protein (ssDBP) UP I {{were shown}} to be cross-reactive {{with most of the}} basic hnRNP core proteins, the main constituents of 40 S hnRNP particles. This suggested a structural relationship between both groups of proteins. Using the anti-ssDBP antibodies, a cDNA clone (pRP 10) was isolated from a human liver cDNA library in plasmid expression vector pEX 1. By DNA sequencing this clone was shown to encode in its 949 bp insert the last 72 carboxy terminal amino acids of the ssDBP UP I. Thereafter, an open reading frame continued for another 124 amino acids followed by a UAA (<b>ochre)</b> stop <b>codon.</b> Direct amino acid sequencing of a V 8 protease peptide from hnRNP core protein A 1 showed that this peptide contained at its amino terminus the last 11 amino acids of UP I followed by 19 amino acids which are encoded by the open reading frame of cDNA clone pRP 10 immediately following the UP I sequence. This proves that ssDBP UP I arises by proteolysis from hnRNP core protein A 1. This finding must lead to a re-evaluation of the possible physiological role of UP I and related ssDBPs. The formerly assumed function in DNA replication, although not completely ruled out, should be reconsidered in the light of a possible alternative or complementary function in hnRNA processing where UP I could either be a simple degradation product of core protein A 1 (as a consequence of controlling the levels of active A 1) or may continue to function as an RNA binding protein which has lost the ability to interact with the other core proteins.
