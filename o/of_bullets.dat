5|$|For {{the next}} year, the {{different}} band members then worked part-time jobs {{along with the}} rest of their work with the band. After continuous gigging around the Midlands, it wasn't long until word of mouth helped them become a popular unsigned band. The band then sent out a one track demo cd <b>of</b> <b>Bullets,</b> earning them the interest of several British labels, with thirty A reps coming to see them play at Birmingham. In October 2004, the group signed to Newcastle based indie label Kitchenware Records. Upon signing to the record label they changed their band name to Editors.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Henry Hamilton, a British Lieutenant Governor of Canada, {{began to}} recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. On April 24, Shawnee Indians led by Chief Blackfish {{attacked}} Boonesborough. Boone {{was shot in}} the ankle while outside the fort, but he was carried back inside amid a flurry <b>of</b> <b>bullets</b> by Simon Kenton, a recent arrival at Boonesborough. Kenton became Boone's close friend, as well as a legendary frontiersman in his own right.|$|E

The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. Each bullet in these boxes is an event final, the number <b>of</b> <b>bullets</b> per box representing the number of finals that were contested on that day. On the left the calendar lists each sport with events held during the Games, and at the right how many gold medals were won in that sport. There is a key {{at the top of}} the calendar to aid the reader.|$|E

The two agents put all their effort in to finding Johnson {{before it is too}} late.

Frank shows up; after tying up Johnson, Frank shoots two of the zombies in the head. As his gun runs out <b>of</b> <b>bullets</b> and death seems imminent for Mulder and Frank, Scully arrives and shoots the final zombie.|$|E
5|$|The North Weald pair, No. 504 and 257 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Dorniers with 20 Hurricanes. One German pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe {{developed}} engine trouble and lagged {{half a mile}} behind the main bomber stream. His Dornier attracted a swarm of fighters. Eventually Ray Holmes of 504 Squadron, out <b>of</b> <b>bullets,</b> rammed the bomber. The tail came off and air pressure snapped off the outer wings short of the engines. The bomber crashed onto the forecourt of London Victoria station. During its spinning dive, the gravitational force on the Dornier caused its bombs to be released, which hit or landed near to Buckingham Palace nearby, damaging the building. Zehbe bailed out and landed near The Oval and was severely wounded by a civilian mob. He was rescued by the British Army but died of his wounds. Holmes' Hurricane was badly damaged, crashing near the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Holmes bailed out injured but survived.|$|E

2500|$|The choice <b>of</b> <b>bullet</b> for the [...]357 Magnum {{cartridge}} varied {{during its}} development. During the development at Smith & Wesson, the original Keith bullet was modified slightly, {{to the form}} <b>of</b> the Sharpe <b>bullet,</b> which itself was based upon the Keith bullet, but which had 5/6 of the bearing surface <b>of</b> the Keith <b>bullet,</b> Keith bullets typically being made oversized and sized down. Winchester, however, upon experimenting further during the cartridge development, modified the Sharpe-bullet shape slightly, while keeping the Sharpe contour <b>of</b> the <b>bullet.</b> [...] The final choice <b>of</b> <b>bullet</b> was hence based upon the earlier Keith and Sharpe bullets, while additionally having slight differences from both.|$|R
50|$|The rest <b>of</b> the <b>bullet's</b> {{kinetic energy}} {{is spent in}} the {{deformation}} or shattering <b>of</b> the <b>bullet</b> (depending on bullet construction), damage to the target (depending on target construction), and heat dissipation. In other words, because the bullet strike on the target is an inelastic collision, only a minority <b>of</b> the <b>bullet</b> energy is used to actually impart momentum to the target. This is why a ballistic pendulum relies on conservation <b>of</b> <b>bullet</b> momentum and pendulum energy rather than conservation <b>of</b> <b>bullet</b> energy to determine bullet velocity; a bullet fired into a hanging block of wood or other material will spend much of its kinetic energy to create {{a hole in the}} wood and dissipate heat as friction as it slows to a stop.|$|R
