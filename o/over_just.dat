Kansas converted its three takeaways into 17points, giving the Jayhawks an enormous advantage on the scoreboard. Virginia Tech failed to convert its sole turnover recovery into any points.|$|E
5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both {{style and}} ideology. Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding <b>over</b> <b>just</b> one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E
5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them {{he would be able to}} perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor <b>over</b> <b>just</b> another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} was costly for both sides. Although the Australians halted the advancing Chinese 117th Division and inflicted numerous casualties on them, they also suffered heavy losses. In the aftermath the inexperienced Australian battalion commander—Lieutenant Colonel Floyd Walsh—was relieved {{of his position}} by the British brigade commander, having taken <b>over</b> <b>just</b> six days earlier {{following the death of}} the previous commanding officer at Chongju. Nonetheless, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade succeeded in preventing a Chinese break-through at Pakchon, keeping open vital withdrawal routes across the river and securing the UN left flank. Suffering significant casualties, the Chinese offensive was halted the next day due to logistic difficulties. The Chinese and North Koreans were temporarily forced to withdraw north, while the UN successfully reinforced its positions, holding on the Chongchon Line. Yet by late November the US Eighth Army was again forced to withdraw after the Chinese began their Second Phase Offensive, starting a long retreat south. The UN forces were expelled from North Korea, and withdrew to the 38th Parallel where they sought to re-establish defensive positions.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions {{vary widely}} in strength. On the one extreme there are effusive Hawaiian eruptions, which are {{characterized}} by lava fountains and fluid lava flows, which are typically not very dangerous. On the other extreme, Plinian eruptions are large, violent, and highly dangerous explosive events. Volcanoes are not bound to one eruptive style, and frequently display many different types, both passive and explosive, even {{in the span of}} a single eruptive cycle. Volcanoes do not always erupt vertically from a single crater near their peak, either. Some volcanoes exhibit lateral and fissure eruptions. Notably, many Hawaiian eruptions start from rift zones, and some of the strongest Surtseyan eruptions develop along fracture zones. Scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward—a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica’s Irazú Volcano in 1963 was likely triggered by magma that took a nonstop route from the mantle <b>over</b> <b>just</b> a few months.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned <b>over</b> <b>just</b> what {{experiments}} {{had been}} conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E

Boole and Jevons struggled <b>over</b> <b>just</b> this issue in 1863, {{in the form of}} the correct evaluation of x + x. Jevons argued for the result x, which is correct for + as disjunction.

25|$|Veracruz was {{the first}} Spanish {{settlement}} founded in what became New Spain, but it endured as the only viable Gulf Coast port, the enduring gateway for Spain to New Spain. But the difficult topography around the port itself affected not only local development, but also affected New Spain as a whole. Going from the port to the central plateau entailed a daunting 2000 meter climb from the narrow tropical coastal plain in <b>over</b> <b>just</b> a hundred kilometers. The narrow, slippery road in the mountain mists was treacherous for mule trains, {{and in some cases}} mules were hoisted by ropes. Many tumbled with their cargo to their deaths. Given these transport constraints, only high value low bulk goods continued to be shipped in the transatlantic trade. It stimulated local production of foodstuffs, rough textiles, and other products for a mass market. Although New Spain produced considerable sugar and wheat, these were consumed exclusively in the colony even though there was demand elsewhere. Philadelphia, not New Spain, supplied Cuba with wheat.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} 1995 championship, the PCA folded, and Kasparov had no {{organisation}} to choose his next challenger. In 1998 he formed the World Chess Council, which organised a candidates match between Alexei Shirov and Vladimir Kramnik. Shirov won the match, but negotiations for a Kasparov–Shirov match broke down, and Shirov was subsequently omitted from negotiations, {{much to his}} disgust. Plans for a 1999 or 2000 Kasparov–Anand match also broke down, and Kasparov organised a match with Kramnik in late 2000. In a major upset, Kramnik won the Classical World Chess Championship 2000 match with two wins, thirteen draws, and no losses, thereby becoming the Classical World Chess Champion. Meanwhile, FIDE had decided to scrap the Interzonal and Candidates system, instead having a large knockout event in which {{a large number of}} players contested short matches against each other <b>over</b> <b>just</b> a few weeks (see FIDE World Chess Championship 1998). Very fast games were used to resolve ties {{at the end of each}} round, a format which some felt did not necessarily recognize the highest quality play: Kasparov refused to participate in these events, as did Kramnik after he won Kasparov's title in 2000. In the first of these events, champion Karpov was seeded straight into the final, but subsequently the champion had to qualify like other players. Karpov defended his title in the first of these championships in 1998, but resigned his title in anger at the new rules in 1999. Alexander Khalifman took the title in 1999, Anand in 2000, Ruslan Ponomariov in 2002 and Rustam Kasimdzhanov won the event in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Ili {{returned}} to the Saints in 2017 for another run at a title. He was a dominate force {{in his second season}} as a Saint, highlighted by his pass-first nature to his free-scoring teammates. On 6 April 2017, Ili didn't put a shot up from the field in his side's 100–87 win over the Taranaki Mountainairs, scoring one point from a free-throw in 19 minutes, but he managed 10 assists and turned the ball <b>over</b> <b>just</b> once. With characteristic humbleness, Ili said after the game that his job was made a lot easier by the talented players around him, such as his backcourt starting partner Corey Webster. Throughout April, Ili continued his maturation into the league's best local point guard. On 17 April, he had 22 points and 15 assists in a 102–79 win over the Canterbury Rams. Eight days later, he had 27 points, 10 assists and six steals in a 110–84 win over the Nelson Giants. On 19 May, he scored a career-high 30 points in a 109–94 win over the Southland Sharks. He guided the Saints to a perfect 18–0 regular season and helped them earn another grand final appearance. In the NZNBL championship decider on 17 June, Ili set a new career high with 31 points in the Saints' 108–75 rout of the Sharks. The win saw the Saints collect their 10th NBL Championship, with Ili winning his third straight NZNBL title. The Saints became the first team to complete an unbeaten season, capping off a perfect 20–0 campaign with their grand final win over Southland. Ili's 31-point effort earned him Finals MVP honours. He also picked up All-Star Five honours in the end-of-season awards. For the season, he averaged career highs with 16.1 points, 6.5 assists and 2.3 steals, to go with 4.2 rebounds while appearing in all 20 games.|$|E
