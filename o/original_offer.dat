5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Donna {{accepts the}} Doctor's <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> to travel in the TARDIS. The Doctor makes it clear to her that he only wants to be friends and nothing more, and she emphatically agrees. She makes a detour to leave her car keys in a litter bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be Rose Tyler, who fades from view as she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred. He sees her in his {{telescope}} and celebrates on his allotment.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins as}} Walt furiously notices a motion-detecting {{surveillance}} camera {{that has been}} installed in the lab. Later that day, Skyler convinces Walt {{in a meeting with}} Saul to buy the car wash by mentioning how the owner insulted his manhood. She devises a plan to trick the owner into selling by having a con artist (supplied by Saul) pretend to be a water-tester who is shutting down the business out of concerns over contaminants. The owner promptly sells to her, agreeing to an even lower price than her <b>original</b> <b>offer.</b> Jesse is still feeling numb from recent events, attempting to clear his head with nostalgic go-kart trips. He continues to open his house up for all-night drug-fueled orgies, deliberately throwing piles of money {{in the midst of the}} chaos. Angry and frustrated by Hank's continuous cold shoulder, Marie resumes her kleptomania; she starts stealing objects from real-estate open houses, where she also makes up elaborate stories about who she is, but is eventually caught by a real-estate agent. A livid Hank pulls strings with a senior police officer to get her out of being charged. The same officer drops by the Schrader residence to seek Hank's help by giving him Gale's lab notes to look at. Hank initially shoves away the notebook, but begins to read it later that night.|$|E
5|$|The second Sydney punchbowl had a {{much more}} {{circuitous}} journey to the present. The bowl first appeared in May 1932, when Sir Robert Witt, chairman of the British National Art Collections Fund, wrote to James MacDonald, Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, inquiring if a Sydney museum {{would be interested in}} acquiring the second punchbowl. The Gallery Director referred the offer to William Herbert Ifould, Principal Librarian of the Public Library of New South Wales, in August 1932. Ifould wrote directly to Sir Robert Witt indicating that the bowl was not required by the Library as a very similar one was already held. Ifould received a reply dated 31October 1932, stating that during the intervening months the owner of the bowl in England – whose name was undisclosed – had since sold the bowl to another undisclosed buyer. The bowl's subsequent whereabouts was unknown until 1988. In the <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> by Sir Robert – who had also co-founded the Courtauld Institute of Art in London – a suggestion was made that this bowl had been made to the order of Arthur Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales (in office 1788–1795) who established the settlement at Sydney Cove. However, no evidence to support this view was given in Witt's letter.|$|E

500|$|Fiona Collins {{noted in}} Turning the Page: Children's Literature in Performance and the Media that while Burningham's book is open ended, with Emily {{ultimately}} {{left alone to}} contemplate her grandfather's death, the film offers a less [...] "stark" [...] interpretation; his death is explored through her implied remembrance {{of him in the}} final scene. Collins suggests that this was probably because the <b>original</b> <b>offered</b> an unremittingly bleak ending that would be difficult for its intended child audience.|$|R

25|$|On June 5, a {{movement}} was reportedly building in Texas {{to force the}} Pac-10 to invite Baylor instead of Colorado. This would give Texas a solid voting block of 4 Texas schools and two strongly aligned Oklahoma schools. The Pac-10 quickly eliminated that possibility by modifying their <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> (a package deal for all six schools) to be a standalone offer for Colorado and a package deal for the other five.|$|E
25|$|Packer {{took this}} idea, then fleshed {{it out into}} a full series between the best Australian players and a team {{from the rest of}} the world. His mistrust of cricket's administrators deepened when the ACB {{recommended}} the TCCB accept an offer for their broadcasts rights from the ABC, even though ABC's $210,000 offer was only 14% of the offer from Packer. For the first time, the game's officialdom had a demonstration of Packer's wherewithal: he immediately doubled his <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> and won the contract. But he never forgot the machinations involved in winning the bid.|$|E

[...] Similarly, GameSpot reviewer Shane Satterfield described the remake as [...] "one amazing game that clearly stands as the best the series has to offer", while Edge magazine remarked that the game's unforgiven gameplay and technical artistry improve the tension and anxiety that the <b>original</b> <b>offered.</b>|$|R

25|$|The 2012–13 NHL lockout {{lasted from}} September 15, 2012 to January 19, 2013, after {{the owners and}} players failed {{to agree on a}} new {{collective}} bargaining agreement. The owners' <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> retained the framework established following the 2004–05 NHL lockout but made numerous changes to player salary and movement rights, including reducing the players' share of hockey-related revenues from 57 percent to 46 percent, introduce term limits on contracts, eliminate salary arbitration, and change free agency rules. As the deadline for work stoppage approached, the union unsuccessfully challenged the league's ability to lock out players of the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers (appealing to the Alberta Labour Relations Board), and the Montreal Canadiens (appealing to the Quebec Labour Relations Board).|$|E
25|$|An {{acceptance}} with amplifications, limitations {{or other}} alterations {{shall be deemed}} to be a refusal of the <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> {{and the making of}} a new offer. In cases where according to customs or owing {{to the nature of the}} affair, a notice of acceptance is not necessary, the contract shall be constituted when, within a reasonable time, there is a fact, which may be considered as an acceptance of the offer. If a notice of withdrawing an offer arrives after the arrival of the offer itself, though it should usually arrive before or simultaneously with the arrival of the offer within a reasonable time by its transmitting manner, and this might be known to the other party, the other party so notified should notify the offerer immediately of such delay.|$|E
25|$|Williams had {{neglected}} to tell Mansell that Prost had signed for 1993 at {{only the second}} race of the 1992 season in Mexico, a position that Mansell felt {{would be similar to}} their days together at Ferrari. To boot, Ayrton Senna had expressed a strong desire to drive for Williams and even offered to drive for them at no salary (only to later be rebuffed as Prost, whose rivalry with the Brazilian was just as intense as the one he had with Mansell, had a clause written into his contract which enabled him to block Senna's effort). Williams decided that there was little sense in paying the high fees Mansell went on to demand. With the <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> revoked, and with the premiere teams already committed to their incumbent drivers, Mansell decided to move on. An 11th hour offer was made to him at the Italian Grand Prix, but by then the damage was done; Mansell retired from F1.|$|E

The ornate style of the <b>original</b> <b>offered</b> no difficulty to Sylvester, who was himself a disciple of the Euphuists and added many adornments of his own invention. The Sepmaines of Du Bartas appealed most to his English and German co-religionists, and the translation was immensely popular.

His popularity ceased with the Restoration, and John Dryden called his verse [...] "abominable fustian." ...|$|R

500|$|On 30 August 1945, Birkett {{received}} a letter from the Lord Chancellor asking him to serve as the British judge at the Nuremberg Trials of German War Criminals. He accepted, saying that it was [...] "a great honour to be selected". But when he went to London to discuss it, he was informed that the Foreign Office wanted a more senior judge to be in attendance, ideally a Law Lord, but since no Law Lord was available, they had requested that a judge from the Court of Appeal should be appointed. Geoffrey Lawrence was made the main British judge, and Birkett was offered the position of alternate judge for the trials, which he accepted, although with less enthusiasm than he had shown when accepting the <b>original</b> <b>offer.</b> He became friends with the American judge Francis Biddle, although when they first met he accidentally confused him with Anthony Drexel Biddle and remarked how useful his diplomatic training would be in the trials.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{the first two}} months of the season with the Browns, where he went 24 record in 11 games, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians on June 15, 1948, who added pitcher Bill Kennedy to go with their <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> of $100,000, a move which Bill Veeck called [...] "a case of begging for him on our knees." [...] For the Indians, he served both as a relief pitcher and a fifth starting pitcher as he did with the Browns. On August 18, he faced his former team, and threw a complete game shutout, defeating the Browns, 30. A month later, he won two back-to-back games against the Detroit Tigers, both in extra innings. During his time with the Indians, he went 9-6 with a 2.81 ERA in 23 games, 12 of them starts. He was on the Indians roster for the 1948 World Series and warmed up for all six games in the Indians' bullpen, but was never called upon to pitch; he was one of two on the roster who did not see any action in the World Series.|$|E
500|$|On May 3, 2011, IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard {{announced}} that a $5,000,000 (USD) purse would be awarded to any driver not on the IndyCar circuit to enter the race at Las Vegas and win while starting {{from the back of}} the field. Bernard's <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> was exclusively to [...] "any race car driver in the world outside of the IZOD IndyCar Series," [...] hoping to attract interest from Formula 1 or NASCAR. Bernard received offers that he deemed viable from Travis Pastrana, Alex Zanardi, and Kasey Kahne. Pastrana, however, suffered an ankle injury earlier in the year, while Zanardi and Kahne wanted to drive only for Chip Ganassi Racing and Team Penske respectively, who both had drivers (Dario Franchitti and Will Power) competing against each other for the championship. Bernard later revised the challenge to include a driver who had only competed in IndyCar part-time during the 2011 season; the challenge was accepted by 2011 Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon, who had run only one additional race that season (Kentucky). Wheldon also agreed to split the purse with a fan if he went on to win.|$|E

500|$|On 8 November 2010, Lawless joined York's Conference Premier rivals Luton Town, {{initially}} on loan, with {{a permanent}} transfer due {{to take place in}} January 2011. York were reluctant to let him leave, but relented when Luton increased their <b>original</b> <b>offer</b> on three occasions. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at Wrexham on 11 November 2010 and, in the following game, Lawless scored his first Luton goal with the winner in a 1–0 victory at Altrincham. Lawless signed for Luton permanently for an undisclosed fee on a one-and-a-half-year contract on 5 January 2011. His first appearance after signing was as a 74th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw at Bath City on 8 January 2011. After the departure of fellow midfielder Andy Drury to Ipswich Town in late January 2011, Lawless played a much more prominent role in a Luton team that eventually finished the 2010–11 season third in the table. He scored the opening goal, a 35yard strike described as [...] "superb", in Luton's 3–0 play-off semi-final first leg victory away at Wrexham. He then played in the 2–1 home victory in the second leg, and in the 2011 Conference Premier play-off Final against AFC Wimbledon at Wembley he missed the opening penalty kick in the penalty shoot-out, which Luton lost 4–3.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} a {{contract}} to be formed, the parties must reach mutual assent (also called {{a meeting of the}} minds). This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the [...] "mirror image rule". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met. If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the <b>original</b> <b>offer.</b> The Uniform Commercial Code disposes of the mirror image rule in §2-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted objectively {{from the perspective of a}} reasonable person, as determined in the early English case of Smith v Hughes [...] It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.|$|E
