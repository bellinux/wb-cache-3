40|$|The cost of feed {{is usually}} the {{greatest}} operating cost in aquaculture. Over feeding results in left over feed, which leads to not only the extra-cost, but also poor water quality, stress to the fish and an extra-load on the mechanical filters, biofilters and <b>oxygenation</b> <b>equipment.</b> Feeding management {{is as important as}} the design of the diet itself and knowing when to stop feeding is of great importance for successful feed management. Timer-controlled automatic feeders with a rotating plate and scrubber are widely used in the indoor re-circulating eel culturing industry in Taiwan. The device was designed to run at preset times for a preset duration with no other control. An intelligent feedback control system was developed. The gathering behavior of eels was observed by an infrared photoelectric sensor and converted to digital signals. The feeder equipped with such a sensor and governing control strategy is able to stop feeding according to the gathering behavior of eels. The control strategy contains six user-adjustable parameters with default values. If the sensor fails to detect the gathering behavior for three (default) consecutive trials, the feeder will stop feeding until the next wake-up, thus reducing the risk of polluting the water, etc...|$|E
50|$|Reoxygenating {{the system}} {{water is a}} crucial part to obtaining high {{production}} densities. Fish require oxygen to metabolize food and grow, as do bacteria communities in the biofilter. Dissolved oxygen levels can be increased through two methods aeration and oxygenation. In aeration air is pumped through an air stone or similar device that creates small bubbles in the water column, {{this results in a}} high surface area where oxygen can dissolve into the water. In general due to slow gas dissolution rates and the high air pressure needed to create small bubbles this method is considered inefficient and the water is instead oxygenated by pumping in pure oxygen. Various methods are used to ensure that during oxygenation all of the oxygen dissolves into the water column. Careful calculation and consideration must be given to the oxygen demand of a given system, and that demand must be met with either <b>oxygenation</b> or aeration <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
