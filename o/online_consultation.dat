25|$|In May 2008, Waterfront Toronto (the former TWRC) {{proposed}} {{the demolition of}} the segment from Jarvis Street to the Don River and construction of a widened Lake Shore Boulevard {{in the style of}} University Avenue at a projected cost of $200 to $300 million. The proposal shelved the previous plan to demolish the central section and the construction of the Front Street Extension. Waterfront Toronto proposed to get started on the environmental assessment of the demolition, which is expected to take up to five years and cost $10 million. Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong criticized the proposal, pointing out that the city already had a $300 million backlog of road repairs. Mayor David Miller endorsed the proposal, noting that the funds for the demolition and the eight-lane boulevard would come from monies saved by not building the Front Street Extension, and money saved on the maintenance of the elevated highway. In July 2008, City Council voted to proceed with the environmental assessment. In March 2009, Waterfront Toronto started the environmental assessment consultation process, with open houses and an <b>online</b> <b>consultation</b> web site. The Terms of Reference were approved by City Council in May 2009 and the Government of Ontario in September 2009 and an Environmental Assessment was expected to start in April 2010.|$|E
500|$|The {{announcement}} {{followed an}} <b>online</b> <b>consultation</b> {{in which the}} public was invited {{to vote on the}} name during a limited period. The voting options were [...] "Toronto Northmen", [...] "Inter Toronto FC", [...] "Toronto Reds", and [...] "Toronto FC". MLSE's strategy in choosing [...] "Toronto FC" [...] following this process was based on two reasons. Firstly, over 40percent of the online vote supported the simple Toronto FC name during the consultation; secondly, MLSE hoped that the fairly generic name would help the new club earn a more organic nickname from the Toronto fans rather than having one imposed upon the club. The team has been called [...] "TFC" [...] and [...] "the Reds" [...] by the media and the club. The [...] "FC" [...] in the team's name became the conventional initialism for Football Club.|$|E

In conclusion, load balancing is an efﬁcient alternative approach that can avoid possible over-crowding or underloaded situations in an <b>online</b> medical <b>consultation</b> system...|$|R
