The commercial nature of the leasehold is shown by the very considerable premium of £670,000 paid on the 1994 extension of the lease, with all maintenance {{at the expense of the}} leaseholder, and no charges resulting to the Crown Estate. Independent advice from a leading firm of chartered surveyors taken by the Crown Estate on the 1994 lease extension used the valuation methods applicable to a leaseholder's statutory rights on renewal of a lease. As the property was acquired in an <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>transaction,</b> the leasehold of the property may be sold except in the last five years of the lease. Therefore, although Thatched House Lodge is a royal residence by virtue of being inhabited by Princess Alexandra, it is in fact private property, the sub-lease of which was acquired on the open market, and the leasehold having been bought by Ogilvy. As a result, the property may be sold by the princess or her heirs, subject to the underlying Crown Estate long lease.

40|$|Real estate {{economists and}} {{practitioners}} have been cognizant of spatial autocorrelation in housing prices {{for more than}} three decades. In the early days, they relied to a huge extent on techniques developed in statistical science and focused exclusively on its identification and quantitative assessment in housing studies. It has been well-acknowledged that the presence of spatial autocorrelation in housing prices will compromise the applicability of conventional hedonic statistics, which may lead to biased and inconsistent estimates. In light of this, recent studies in the area have spawned an immense literature aimed at devising sophisticated econometric models such as hedonic spatial lag model and hedonic error model as correction methods. Interestingly, the underpinning factors attributing to its existence remain relatively theoretically unexplored due perhaps to a paucity of quality goereferenced housing data as well as the indifferent attitude espoused by the researchers. Although some general propositions regarding its causes have been proposed, they are accused of lacking inferential basis. Acknowledging the above research gap, this thesis attempts to investigate the underlying factors affecting the formation of, and change in, spatial autocorrelation in housing prices. Specifically, we conjecture that spatial autocorrelation is crucially determined by one of the economic workings of the housing market—price determination process. It is posited that the occurrence of the spatial phenomenon is a direct consequence of how market participants in search of past information in the market ascertain current housing prices. Specifically, spatial autocorrelation is deemed to be established, or increase, when property traders infer current housing prices from past sales of properties (i. e. comparables) located in the same neighborhood as the subject houses. Based on the above information search framework, we put forward three hypotheses to facilitate our examination. First, it is hypothesized that market volatility depresses spatial autocorrelation. As in any other commodity market, past sales transactions in real estate are important sources of price information, which become more obsolescent, and hence, fail to be a good price signal when the market is more volatile. Traders are compelled to rely less on past sales in establishing the current prices of the housing units. Accordingly, spatial autocorrelation will be diminished; following broadly the same line of logic, the second hypothesis is constructed, which states that market liquidity (defined as total market transaction volume) dampens spatial autocorrelation. Given that market liquidity reflects the amount of price information being circulated in the market, traders in accessing property values in a “thick” market do not have to necessarily infer from comparables that are located further away from the subject properties. Hence, a weaker spatial autocorrelation relationship between prices is resulted; third, building age is a critical factor in assessing a house’s redevelopment potential, whose value is largely independent of the transaction prices of the surrounding housing units. Given that a house’s total value can be perceived as an addition of its use value and redevelopment value (i. e. real option value of redevelopment), and that the former’s role decreases whereas the latter’s increases with building age in appraising its total value, it is therefore hypothesized that spatial autocorrelation decreases as building age increases. Several spatial autoregressive hedonic models are developed, with which the three hypotheses are tested using geo-coded <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>transaction</b> data in Hong Kong for the period of 1997 to 2008. The results indicate no contrary evidence rejecting any of the hypotheses at the 1 % significance level. They soundly confirm the roles market volatility, market liquidity and building age played in the price determination process in real estate, {{as well as in the}} formation of spatial autocorrelation. The research findings of this thesis carry several straightforward but far-reaching implications beyond the theoretical literature, among which is the significance to, and impact on, property valuation and economic analysis of local housing systems. A better conceptual understanding on the causes of spatial autocorrelation in housing prices can greatly prompt the development of more parsimonious hedonic models, which are econometrically appealing. In this sense, statistical problems and complications (e. g. loss of degrees of freedom) associated with traditionally-used models, which generally routinely incorporate a long list of locational variables, can be circumvented. In addition, hedonic models derived based on our research findings, which give a simpler yet more realistic representation of the housing market, make real estate mass appraisals much less computationally-intensive. Real estate mass appraisals are used for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to taxation, mortgage assessment, government policy-making, and investment. They are of specific interest to accountants, bankers, real estate developers and investors, government authorities and economists. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. Under the {{previous}} accommodation system the monetary {{policy of the}} South African Reserve Bank failed to operate by means of <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>transactions,</b> and interest rate movements was solely {{the discretion of the}} South African Reserve Bank and was driven by means of the traditional Bank rate. The need for a more efficient and transparent accommodation system that is based on <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>transactions</b> and determined by demand and supply of liquidity was evident, and therefore the introduction of the repurchase agreement system in March 1998 was unavoidable. The ultimate objective of monetary policy is to achieve price stability, i. e. to ensure that the Reserve Bank has a goal of maintaining inflation at a level that would be more or less in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of South Africa's major trading partners and international competitors. It is important that the Reserve Bank enhances transparency for the effective operation of an inflation-targeting framework. Transparency introduces predictability and helps to ensure that market expectations are consistent with the objective of price stability. The level of interest rates in a country can influence price stability directly. A transparent monetary policy will mean that changes in short-term interest rates should not surprise the market. Markets should anticipate decisions taken by the Reserve Bank and therefore transparency should promote the predictability of monetary policy. Since its implementation, the current accommodation system (repurchase agreement) has raised some concerns regarding transparency. The government's new monetary policy framework of inflation targeting also has some limitations that can influence the achieving of such targets. The one influences the other, and if interest rates and inflation is not managed transparently, it will have a severe impact on the overall efficiency of monetary policy in South Africa...|$|R

We find strong evidence that future decisions to repurchase equity are negatively influenced by poorly timed past repurchases. Specifically, we show that the past losses on stock repurchases reduce the propensity to engage in additional repurchases in the future. We find almost no evidence that past gains on repurchases positively or negatively influence future repurchasing activity. These results are robust to various firm characteristics, estimation and sampling methods. Further analyses show that losses on past repurchases influence dividend policy. We show that the dividend-repurchase substitution rate slows down for firms that experience losses in their past repurchase activities. Overall, results suggest that managerial behavioral biases have a strong influence on future repurchase decisions consistent with the loss-aversion concept of prospect theory. ^ The second essay examines the relation between insider (officers and directors) <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>transactions</b> and the outcome of past insider trading to better understand what motivates insiders to trade.

The dissertation {{is divided into three}} papers. ^ In the first paper, I examine the information content of voluntary disclosures accompanying <b>open</b> <b>market</b> purchases made by top executives. Analysis of variance indicates that, compared to <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>transactions</b> without disclosures, insider trades caused by contractual obligations (a voluntary disclosure) result in significantly smaller abnormal returns on Form 4 filing dates. I also find that disclosures confirming trades’ <b>open</b> <b>market</b> nature have no information content. Finally, I find evidence that the insider ownership structure resulting from the transactions has information content. ^ In the second paper, I investigate whether insider sell-trades filed under Rule 10 b 5 - 1 engender a different market response than nonprotected <b>open</b> <b>market</b> sell-trades disclosed by top executives. Contrary to findings in previous studies, I find that 10 b 5 - 1 trades have information content. However, the information content of these trades has not increased over time. Finally, my evidence suggests that trades must be previously planned under Rule 10 b 5 - 1 for their information content to be affected by other disclosures. ^ In the third paper, I compare Form 4 submissions with insider data provided by Thomson Reuters (TFN). I find that the TFN cleansing process improves the accuracy of a small number of transactions and that cleansed values cannot be inferred from data submitted in Form 4. I also find that supplementary disclosures associated with nonderivative acquisitions provide clues for classifying these transactions equivalently to TFN data. Finally, I find that mandatory disclosures are reflected in the TFN dataset. In general, my results suggest that users who access the electronically filed Form 4 from the SEC website potentially are exposed to a richer dataset than are TFN users. ...|$|R

Based on this agency cost perspective, I describe the market for debt repurchases and examine whether debt repurchase activity is consistent with a firm’s desire to mitigate debt overhang. I present an agency model of debt which demonstrates that when a firm faces a debt overhang problem, the value of a reduction in debt can outweigh the cost of the repurchase and increase the welfare of both stockholders and bondholders. Using a sample of debt repurchases initiated by U. S. firms over the period 1996 to 2004, I find evidence consistent with the agency cost model of corporate debt policy. Specifically, I find that firms are more likely to repurchase outstanding debt either by <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>transactions</b> or tender offers when potential transfers to bondholders are high. Employing a matching methodology based on propensity scores, I document significant increases in firm investment levels and efficiency for repurchasing firms relative to a control sample. This improvement is more pronounced for firms with higher expected transfers to bondholders (overhang). In addition, the efficiency improvements are concentrated in investment expenditures related to new investment projects, rather than in expenditures on maintaining existing assets. This finding is robust to corrections for selection bias and endogeneity, as well as various proxies for growth opportunities...|$|R

The objective of the thesis is to examine the expediency of taxing the planned profit which would collect part of growth of real estate value, which occurs when there is a change of use from agricultural land to residential use. With the help of good practices from abroad, I attempted to find a system which would work in my country, reduce property speculation and consistently follow the plan passed by local communities. I analysed transactions of agricultural and residential properties in 2011 in the Municipality of Ljubljana.

40|$|The {{existing}} literature on transfer of development rights (TDRs) {{focuses on the}} mechanics of the tool and a few exemplary programs. Understudied in the academic research is the use of TDR in a broader policy and geographic context. This research fills this gap with an analysis of the adoption and performance of Florida TDR programs used to manage growth. The dissertation documents the breadth and history of Florida local government use of TDRs, examining the geographic extent, evolution over time, common approaches, and outcomes of county-level TDR programs. The dissertation combines an exploratory scan, statistical analysis, and comparative case study research to test two hypotheses. First, it is hypothesized that Florida counties adopt TDR primarily to comply with state growth management and property rights policies. Second, it is expected that TDR programs will demonstrate variation in use and outcomes based on local political and contextual factors. The research identifies two phases in Florida TDR program use, each corresponding to a distinct approach to TDR. In the first phase, local governments adopted TDR in compliance with state growth management requirements. A second phase of TDR use emerged in the 2000 s, when state property rights legislation as well as local factors including growth pressures in rural areas, development interests among large property owners, and political support for smart growth led to adoption {{of a new generation of}} TDR programs. The dissertation finds that the majority of Florida county TDR programs demonstrate a combination of market failure and government failure, with limited transaction activity and growth management outcomes overall. The research finds that development interests influence use of TDR, which can mask a pro-growth reality or present an unworkable tension between conservation and development. In particular, new generation TDR programs, which direct development to rural areas, increase sprawl and infringe on resource lands, while the promise of compact communities envisioned under these programs remains uncertain. The research finds evidence that, in Florida, smaller-scale TDR programs best facilitate <b>open</b> <b>market</b> <b>transactions</b> while pro-growth interests can appropriate large area programs. These findings indicate that market-based tools may be inadequate to achieve significant growth management outcomes. ...|$|R
