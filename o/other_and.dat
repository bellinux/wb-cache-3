5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} in the bar, Diane returns to the office and accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office to say something to her. They argue, admit their feelings for each <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each <b>other</b> <b>and,</b> at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E

40|$|THE rate of gastric {{emptying}} in dogs {{is determined}} primar-ily by the particle size (Meyer <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1979), energy den-sity (Meyer <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1994, Wyse <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2001) <b>and</b> osmolarity (Lin <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1993) of the ingested meal. In addition, {{the rate of}} solid-phase emptying may {{be affected by the}} age (Weber <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002), <b>and</b> body size of the dog (Allan <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1996), <b>and</b> by stress (Gue <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1989, Mistiaen <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002). All of these variables combine to determine the rate at which food is delivered from the stom-ach to the duodenum, and their complex inter-relationship accounts for the wide variability that has been reported for the rate of gastric emptying in human beings (Roland <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1990), <b>and</b> dogs (Lester <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999, Wyse <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2001).

5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive.

5|$|A limited genetic {{sampling}} of species in a 1996 study by Annette Kretzer and colleagues showed Suillus bovinus {{was related to}} a lineage that diverged to S.punctipes, S.variegatus and S.tomentosus. A 2001 study found it was not closely related to other European species, and that all populations tested were more closer to each other than any <b>other</b> <b>and</b> hence it was a cohesive species.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused to each <b>other</b> <b>and</b> to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus.

There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E
40|$|PNEUMONIA in {{domestic}} and wild ruminants is usually associat-ed with Pasteurella species (Callan <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1991, Miller <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1991, Whiteley <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1992). In wild ruminants, such as bighorn sheep (Ovis canadiensis), pasteurellosis {{is a major}} cause of mortality (Onderka <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1988, Callan <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1991) while in cattle acute pleuropneumonia is caused by P haemolytica (Whiteley <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1992). Chromobacterium violaceum is commonly found in soil and water (Wilson and Miles 1975, Liu <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1989). However, it rarely causes disease in mammals (Liu <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1989), although pyogenic and septicaemic infections have been reported in man (Sneath <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1953), monkeys (Groves <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1969, Komegay <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1991), pigs (Sippel <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1954, Wijewanta <b>and</b> Wettimuny 1969) and dogs (Gogolewski 1983) and acute pleuropneumonia has been reported in pigs (Liu an...|$|R

40|$|RENAL {{dysplasia}} (RD) is {{a developmental}} disorder of the renal parenchyma characterised by anomalous differentiation of the nephrons and collecting ducts (Woolf <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2004). In human medicine, RD {{is one of}} the principal causes of childhood end-stage renal failure. In veterinary medicine, it has been described in several species, including cattle (Dunham <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1989, Simon <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999, Ohba <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2001, Castro <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2007, Maxie <b>and</b> Newman 2007, Aresu <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2009, Philbey <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2009). In Japanese Black cattle, RD shows autosomal recessive inheritance, caused by CLDN 16 mutations (Hirano <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2000, Ohba <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2000, Hirano <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002). These mutations affect {{one of the members of}} the claudin family of genes which plays an important role in the formation of tight junctions in the kidney (Simon <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 1999). In Japanese Black cattle, RD is classified into two types, according to two independent CLDN 16 mutations (Hirano <b>and</b> <b>others</b> 2002), but no morphological or histopathological differences between the two types have been reported.
