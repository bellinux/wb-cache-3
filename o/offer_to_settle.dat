25|$|Joint control {{steadily}} grew less tolerable {{for both}} sides. After a British minister rejected U.S. President James K. Polk's <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> the boundary at the 49th parallel north, Democratic expansionists {{called for the}} annexation of the entire region up to Parallel 54°40′ north, the southern limit of Russian America as established by parallel treaties between the Russian Empire and the United States (1824) and Britain (1825). However, after {{the outbreak of the}} Mexican-American War in April 1846 diverted U.S. attention and military resources, a compromise was reached in the ongoing negotiations in Washington, D.C., and the matter was settled by the Polk administration (to the dismay of its own party's hardliners) to avoid a two-war situation and a third war with the formidable military strength of Great Britain in less than 70 years.|$|E
500|$|According to DeVries, {{the battle}} was [...] "significant and perhaps even could be defined as decisive". Almost the entire Frankish elite of Athens and its vassal states lay dead in the field, and when the Catalans moved onto the lands of the Duchy, there was scant resistance: the Greek {{inhabitants}} of Livadeia immediately and willingly surrendered their strongly fortified town, {{for which they were}} rewarded with the rights of Frankish citizens; Thebes, the capital of the Duchy, was abandoned by many of its inhabitants, who fled to the Venetian stronghold of Negroponte, and plundered by the Catalan troops; and finally Athens itself was surrendered to the victors by Walter's widow, Joanna of Châtillon. The entirety of Attica and Boeotia passed peacefully {{into the hands of the}} Catalans, and only the lordship of Argos and Nauplia in the Peloponnese remained in the hands of Brienne loyalists. The Catalans' Turkish allies however refused the <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> in the Duchy, and instead, taking their share of the booty, departed to return to Asia Minor, only to be attacked and almost annihilated by the joint forces of the Byzantines and the Genoese as they were trying to cross the Dardanelles a few months later.|$|E

50|$|In 1958, Officer Thomas Grady shot Daniel Bell in the back, killing him. Investigations at {{the time}} cleared Grady of any wrongdoing. In 1978, Grady's partner {{indicated}} that the officer had planted a knife on Bell's body to falsely indicate he had been armed. Grady plead guilty to reckless homicide and perjury. Milwaukee city officials, unwilling to pay the sum awarded to the Bell family, appealed and repeatedly refused the family’s <b>offers</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for smaller sums. In September 1984, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago awarded $1.6 million, twice the amount the family had <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for earlier.|$|R
50|$|Before filing suit, Capitol Records <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for $5,000, but Thomas-Rasset declined. The {{ultimate}} damage order {{came after}} several trials and appeals in 2007-2013. The damage award at one stage reached $1,920,000.|$|R
2500|$|Liebeck {{sought to}} settle with McDonald's for $20,000 {{to cover her}} actual and {{anticipated}} expenses. Her past medical expenses were $10,500; her anticipated future medical expenses were approximately $2,500; and her daughter's loss of income was approximately $5,000 {{for a total of}} approximately $18,000. Instead, the company offered only $800. [...] When McDonald's refused to raise its offer, Liebeck retained Texas attorney Reed Morgan. Morgan filed suit in New Mexico District Court accusing McDonald's of [...] "gross negligence" [...] for selling coffee that was [...] "unreasonably dangerous" [...] and [...] "defectively manufactured". McDonald's refused Morgan's <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for $90,000. Morgan offered to settle for $300,000, and a mediator suggested $225,000 just before trial, but McDonald's refused these final pre-trial attempts to settle.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Abstinence" [...] — Kramer's face ages prematurely when {{he turns}} his {{apartment}} into a smoking lounge. Kramer consults with Jackie about filing suit against the tobacco companies for his disfigurement. Jackie describes Kramer's face as [...] "sallow, unattractive, disgusting." [...] When Kramer asks {{if he has a}} case, Jackie's reply is [...] "Your face is my case." [...] Jackie and Kramer then meet with a tobacco company lawyer, who alleges that Kramer's face gives him a sense of [...] "rugged masculinity." [...] Jackie replies, [...] "Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head." [...] After the lawyer says she will have an <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> out of court the next morning, Jackie tells Kramer, [...] "Jackie's cashing in on your wretched disfigurement." [...] Kramer settles the case without Jackie's knowledge for a Marlboro Man style billboard in Times Square featuring his own face. Jackie dubs this [...] "the most public yet of my many humiliations." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed {{a lawsuit}} against Morgan Stanley. Two facts were at issue: Did Morgan Stanley know about the {{problems}} with Sunbeam and was Ronald Perelman misled? [...] During the discovery phase, the judge became exasperated with what she perceived as deliberate stonewalling on the part of Morgan Stanley and ordered the jury to assume Morgan Stanley deliberately and knowingly defrauded Perelman. Hobbled, Morgan Stanley {{had no choice but to}} argue that Perelman was too savvy an investor to have fallen for their transparent tricks. After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion. The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman's <b>offer</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> the case for $20 million. [...] Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge's decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began. [...] In 2007, the courts of appeal reversed the judgement. The judges' declared Perelman hadn't provided any evidence showing he'd suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley's actions. Perelman appealed, but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision. Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was [...] "a classic example of fraud on the court". [...] The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida's 4th Circuit to reopen the case.|$|E

50|$|An {{exception}} to this rule holds for settlements, such as an accord and satisfaction. If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000, and <b>offers</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> it for $5,000, it is still binding, if accepted, even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000.|$|R
