Other than Mac Murchada himself, {{another man}} making {{a bid for}} the high-kingship was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1198). Within {{the same year as}} Mac Lochlainn's demise, Ua Conchobair and his allies expulsed Mac Murchada from not only Dublin, but Ireland altogether; and Ua Conchobair himself was duly {{recognised}} as High King of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is {{complaining}} {{about his job}} one day, while cutting meat in his shop. As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> thumb, which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse into a pile. The screen darkens and closes in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive. It remains on the screen, shouting insults during the credits, and then falls asleep.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{had learned}} about Katagiri's plans {{and as a result}} the 9th Division commander, Wootten, decided to put <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{offensive}} plans while the Japanese attack was dealt with. It came {{in the early hours of}} 17 October, and over the course of the following week heavy fighting ensued around Katika and Jivevaneng. Forewarned, the Australians were able to check these attacks with assistance from American support units, and by the time that the Japanese called off their offensive on 25 October, the Japanese 20th Division had suffered 352 men killed and 564 wounded, while the Australians had suffered 228 casualties. It was during the early stages of this fighting that an American soldier, Private Nathan Van Noy, from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, performed the deeds that resulted in him being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|In a rare change, Milligan's run on {{the title}} starts with John living in {{domestic}} bliss with a nurse, Phoebe. Over {{the course of the}} first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a Babylonian demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the Liverpool dockers' strike gone insane and sought help from Shade, The Changing Man, after chopping <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian, and traveled to India {{to try to find a}} way of saving her. Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine's niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom.

25|$|Pacific Mail's woes were {{exacerbated}} {{after the}} stock speculator Jay Gould, in a clandestine attempt {{to acquire the}} company's stock cheaply, persuaded the U.S. Congress to rescind its $500,000 annual subsidy.

25|$|For a while, India {{looked to}} {{threaten}} their worst all out score in ODI cricket of 54 against Sri Lanka, but Bond and Adams were taken {{off and the}} other bowlers just couldn't threaten.

Four balls earlier, Bond had dropped Pathan <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> bowling. With {{the end of the}} partnership – worth 118 runs, eight off the Indian record – that broke Yadav's resistance, and he was out attempting a lofted drive over Craig McMillan, who could hold a simple catch to end the game.|$|E

In the final against India, he picked up one wicket bowling Rahul Dravid as Australia won, completing an undefeated campaign.|$|E
25|$|Ban Thomas Erdődy {{wanted to}} take {{advantage}} of the victory and take Petrinja, where the remnants of the Ottoman army fled. However, Colonel General Eggenberg considered that there was not enough food for their army and the attack on Petrinja was halted. After news of the defeat reached Constantinople, a revenge was demanded from the military leaders and the Sultan's sister, whose son Mehmed was killed in the battle. Although the action of Hasan Pasha was not in accordance with the interests and policy of the Porte, the Sultan felt that such an embarrassing defeat even of a vassal acting <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> bat could not go unavenged. Sultan Murad III declared war on Emperor Rudolf II that same year, starting the Long War that was fought mainly in Hungary and Croatia.
