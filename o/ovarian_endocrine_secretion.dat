Secondly, a relatively new area of ovarian physiology concerned with intra-ovarian regulation is explored, since this area holds potential for exploration of the direct effects of toxicological or environmental agents upon gonadal endocrine cells...|$|R

40|$|In {{the adult}} {{mammalian}} ovary morphogenesis and differentiation processes are under hormonal control and, thus, {{occur in a}} highly regulated way during the sexual cycle. Cell-cell interactions, such as cell adhesion and cell separation, are crucial during these events. Here we show that the <b>ovarian</b> <b>endocrine</b> cells, which are prototypes of steroid-producing cells, express neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs). The combined use of in situ hybridization histochemistry, immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels, S 1 nuclease protection assays, and Western blotting revealed that in the ovary of the adult rat during the estrus cycle and pregnancy, NCAM mRNA and the 140 -kDa isoform of this protein are expressed mainly in granulosa cells of growing preantral and antral follicles and in corpora lutea. Since the granulosa cells lining the forming antrum and the antral fluid were strongly immunoreactive, a role for NCAM {{in the formation of}} the follicular antrum is proposed. The expression of NCAM was also associated with luteal cells of the active corpus luteum, indicating a role for NCAM in the morphogenesis of this endocrine compartment. Moreover, thecal cells of large follicles and hypertrophic thecal cells of atretic follicles expressed NCAM, as did interstitial cells, which are derived from thecal cells of atretic follicles. We propose that the adhesion molecule, NCAM, is an important factor involved in the recognition and intercellular interaction of <b>ovarian</b> <b>endocrine</b> cells and, thus, participates in the regulation of the cyclic remodeling processes of the <b>ovarian</b> <b>endocrine</b> compartments...|$|R

40|$|Interaction {{partners}} of follicular cells {{play a significant}} role in steroidogenesis, follicular formation, and development. Androgen secreted by theca cells (TCs) can initiate follicle development and ovulation and provide precursor materials for estrogen synthesis. Therefore, studies on ovarian microenvironment will not only lead to better understanding of the steroidogenesis but also have clinical significance for <b>ovarian</b> <b>endocrine</b> abnormalities such as hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study applied the Transwell coculture model to investigate if the interaction between granulosa and theca cells may affect androgen production in theca cells. Concentrations of testosterone and androstenedione in the spent medium were measured by radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The results show that the coculture with granulosa cells (GCs) increases steroidogenesis in TCs. In addition, testosterone and androstenedione productions in response to LH stimulation were also increased in the coculture model. Significantly increased mRNA expressions of steroidogenic enzymes (Star, Cyp 11 a 1, Cyp 17 a 1, and Hsd 3 b 2) were observed in the cocultured TCs. Thus, GCs were capable of promoting steroidogenesis and LH responsiveness in TCs.

40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} ovarian follicles declines with age {{resulting}} in a significant decrease of fertility {{by the age of}} 40. However, the age when follicle loss starts to affect <b>ovarian</b> <b>endocrine</b> function is not well recognized. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate age-related ovarian/adrenal androgen secretion, which is crucial for estrogen biosynthesis in healthy women and in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Another aim of the study was to compare the usefulness of different serum markers in assessing ovarian aging and in diagnosing polycystic ovaries (PCOs) and PCOS. The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test was used to study the endocrine potential of ovaries/adrenals. The ovarian capacity to secrete and synthesize androgens was found to be decreased as early as at the age of 30 in regularly menstruating women. In women with PCOS, both basal and hCG-stimulated androgen levels were about 50 % higher than in healthy women and they remained high until late reproductive age. Similarly to regularly menstruating women, the androgen secretion capacity in PCOS subjects decreased with age, and estradiol concentrations remained unchanged until the age of 44 years. Adrenal androgen synthesis was not changed during hCG-tests. Since serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were changed significantly after the age of 25 years in regularly menstruating women, they may be considered as useful serum markers reflecting the ovarian aging process. In women with PCOS, AMH levels were continuously 2 - to 3 -fold higher than in healthy women possibly reflecting high follicle number in these women. A decline in <b>ovarian</b> <b>endocrine</b> function before the age of 30 is one of the first signs of ovarian aging. However, in women with PCOS ovarian androgen secretion capacity is markedly increased and remain high throughout the reproductive years. The results of the present studies also indicate that LH/hCG does not play a role in adrenal androgen synthesis, since LH/hCG did not stimulate adrenal androgen synthesis. The measurement of AMH is a useful tool to estimate ovarian aging process as well as to diagnose PCOs/PCOS...|$|R
