40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the test results of normal 4 -month-old infants on the Movement Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> with the {{published}} Movement Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> a priori profile. We tested 50 healthy 4 -month-old infants (24 white, 20 black, 6 other races) on 65 Movement Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> items, encompassing the categories of muscle tone, primitive reflexes, automatic re-actions, and volitional movements. The total-risk score was a sum of categorical risk scores. A between-group analysis of variance showed that the total-risk scores did not differ significantly by sex or race. Thirty percent <b>of</b> the <b>infants</b> we tested had total-risk scores greater than 7, which differed significantly from the 15 % in the original Movement Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Infants</b> data.

40|$|Background: The {{first three}} years of life have a pivotal role in growth and {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>infants.</b> Extra-uterine environment largely affects brain development <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> {{during the first year of}} life. However,no specific programs are available for brain development stimulation in foster homes. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of motor development stimulation package on anthropometric indices <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> staying in foster homes. Method: This experimental study was conducted on 50 infants aged 1 - 12 months at Ali Asghar foster home of Mashhad, Iran in 2013. Infants were randomly divided into two groups of intervention (n= 25) and control (n= 25). Motor development stimulation packages were used for intervention group three times a week for eight consecutive weeks (24 sessions, two hours each). Anthropometric indices <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> were evaluated using standard instruments before and after intervention. Data analysis was performed in SPSS V. 11. 5 using independent T-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: In this study, mean age <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> in intervention and control groups was 6. 04 ± 3. 48 and 4. 3 ± 3. 70 months, respectively. In total, 68 % <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> were male, and 32 % were female. After intervention, Mann-Whitney test results showed no statistically significant difference in height (P= 0. 47) and head circumference (P= 0. 11) <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> between the groups. However, independent T-test showed a statistically significant difference in body weight <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> (P= 0. 007) between the groups after intervention with the stimulation care package. Implications for Practice: According to the results of this study, use of evidence-based motor development stimulation package for eight weeks resulted in increased weight <b>of</b> <b>infants,</b> while it had no effect on height and head circumference. Therefore, it is recommended that complementary studies be conducted in this regard...|$|R
5|$|Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's {{views on}} baptism by {{appealing}} to Calvin, the idea that baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality, {{and the idea of}} baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the idea that baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed liberation theologian Jürgen Moltmann, on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship. Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> baptism despite these critiques.|$|E

5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was {{far more important than}} the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

40|$|Australia (EYLF) {{offers the}} {{potential}} for a change in collective thinking about the social and emotional capabilities <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> and toddlers. Classical theories of young children’s development have held that infants and toddlers are egocentric in being and engage predominantly in solitary play. Common perceptions of important social behaviours such as social and emotional perception, action and understanding are thought to develop primarily in the preschool years. Grounded in an image of the child as able to contribute to his or her own learning, the strong theoretical base of the EYLF affords a view <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> and toddlers as intentional and active participants in their world. This article explores popular societal misconceptions of the social and emotional capacities <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> and toddlers, and uses both psychological and contextual research to put forth a more accurate view. Reflection on the philosophical grounding of the EYLF shows the place <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> and toddlers within it, while examples in practice of observations of children and interpretations of educators help support this.

5|$|Following {{the demise}} of Ivan Asen II (r. 1218–1241), the large Bulgarian Empire began to decline {{as a result of}} a {{succession}} <b>of</b> <b>infant</b> emperors and internal struggles among the nobility. To the north the country faced constant Mongol invasions after the 1240s. Although Ivan Asen II defeated the Mongols shortly before his death, the regency of Kaliman I Asen (r. 1241–1246) agreed to pay an annual tribute to the Mongols to avoid devastation. The Mongol invasion led to the collapse of the loosely held Cuman confederation in the western part of the Eurasian Steppe and the foundation of the Mongol Golden Horde. This had long–term political and strategic consequences for Bulgaria— the Cumans were Bulgarian allies and often supplied the Bulgarian army with auxiliary cavalry while the Golden Horde proved to be a hostile entity. To the south, Bulgaria lost large portions of Thrace and Macedonia to the Nicaean Empire, which had escaped the initial Mongol attacks. The lands to the north-west, including Belgrade, Braničevo and Severin Banat, were conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the problems <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> <b>of</b> diabetic mothers and to determine risk factors of mothers during pregnancy. Material and Methods: The morbidity rates <b>of</b> 31 <b>infants</b> <b>of</b> diabetic mothers who were born and followed in neonatal intensive unit between January 2013 and December 2013 at Gaziosmanpasa University and demographic properties of mothers were retrospectively evaluated in the study. Results: A total <b>of</b> 31 <b>infants</b> were included. The incidence of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was % 22, 6 and the incidence of gestational diabetes was % 77, 4. Mothers' mean age was 32, 6 +/- 7, 9 years and HbA 1 c level was 5, 4 +/- 1 (4, 2 - 10, 2). The mean gestational age <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> was 37, 5 +/- 1, 5 weeks and the mean birth weight <b>of</b> <b>infants</b> was 3322, 5 +/- 695, 8 g.
