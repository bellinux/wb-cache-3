5000|$|In 2004, the New England Patriots, {{who have}} a {{substantial}} <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> waiting list, received media attention for not allowing {{the son of a}} deceased <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holder to retain his father's <b>season</b> <b>tickets.</b> The following year, the New England Patriots introduced the [...] "Pass It On" [...] transfer program, which allows <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders to transfer <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> to immediate family members for $2,000 to $5,000 per ticket, depending on the location of the seat.|$|R
25|$|A 2002 {{report by}} a {{researcher}} at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while {{it was true that}} a higher proportion of City <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). However, the report warned that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders had risen hugely; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> sales to increase further. The 2002 report has lost most of its validity as both clubs <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> sales have fluctuated further as of 2010, with United selling 52,000 <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> and City selling out all of its allocated 36,000 <b>season</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of April 2014, {{there were}} 34,100 <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> were sold for the 2014 season, surpassing the {{previous}} <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> record of 32,227 that were purchased {{prior to the}} start of the 2010 season.

The team managed to attract 15,500 <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders in its first MLS season and 13,000 for the second.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Season</b> <b>ticket</b> sales began June 1, 2011, with Manitoba Moose <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders having priority.

Within the first three-and-a-half hours, the new {{franchise}} sold 1,870 packages to Moose <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders. <b>Season</b> <b>tickets</b> opened to the general public on June 4 and sold out in just 17 minutes. Once the [...] "Drive to 13,000" [...] was completed, True North started a <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> waiting list, which was shut down after 8,000 people had signed up in two hours. In July 2011, tickets for October 9 home opener against the Montreal Canadiens were listed for an average price of $1,711 on Stubhub, with an average selling price of $713.|$|R

50|$|Even {{though the}} team {{did not begin}} play until the spring 2014 season, the team {{announced}} in November 2013 that it had already sold over 7,000 <b>season</b> <b>tickets,</b> and in capping <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> sales, became the first team in NASL history to have a wait list for <b>season</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R

50|$|For the Gateshead Thunder game in 2009, {{chairman}} Steve O'Connor offered {{free admission}} for all Vikings fans. As <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders did {{not benefit from}} this special offer (as they had already paid for the game when purchasing their <b>season</b> <b>ticket),</b> the club decided they would give vouchers to the 2009 <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders who renewed their <b>season</b> <b>tickets</b> during an 'Ealry Bird' promotion. The vouchers were for fans to use on kit manufacturer O'Neills merchandise in the January sales.|$|R

50|$|<b>Season</b> <b>Ticket</b> Football 2003 {{differs from}} most sports video game titles {{in that it}} does not allow the player to athletically dictate the results of games, but rather from a 'behind-the-scenes' {{business}} aspect of the sport as a franchise owner, similar to its companion titles, <b>Season</b> <b>Ticket</b> Basketball 2003 and <b>Season</b> <b>Ticket</b> Baseball 2003.|$|R
25|$|PSV have {{attracted}} around 33,000 people to Eredivisie matches on {{average in the}} last years. The record attendance stands at 35,200, achieved in a match against Feyenoord at 17 November 2002. The club always reserves tickets for away fans and individual ticket purchases; {{the maximum number of}} <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders therefore is 29,200.

More recently in 2013, PSV sold 28,000 <b>season</b> <b>tickets.</b> Research showed that over 25,000 <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders hail from Noord-Brabant, with other significant groups coming from Limburg, Gelderland, Zuid-Holland, Noord-Holland and Belgium.|$|R

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holders (STH) to sporting organisations, we empirically examine a scale for measuring their attitudes to the <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> product. This involved identifying through qualitative research and past literature, the various elements that are perceived to comprise the <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> package and developing items to measure STH attitudes to them. The <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> package was decomposed into six key components, closely mirroring past research. A survey of over 2, 500 STH of a professional sporting organisation was then conducted, incorporating items related to these six areas, overall satisfaction and disconfirmation of expectations. The results of Exploratory Factor Analysis on those items is presented here, with results suggesting the items are valid measures of <b>season</b> <b>ticket</b> holder attitudes that capture {{the breadth of the}} STH experience. <br /...|$|R
