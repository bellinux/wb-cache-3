5|$|The Premier League {{was formed}} with the {{intention}} of English football's top clubs capitalising on television rights. Whereas in the Football League money is distributed to the lower leagues, the Premier League intended to sell its <b>own</b> <b>rights,</b> with earnings from broadcasts divided equally between the member clubs only. The decision to break away and start a new league also gave clubs the chance to vote on decisions through a one club-one vote motion.|$|E
5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed {{to bring the}} case against Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter, and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees {{the case against the}} abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's <b>own</b> <b>rights</b> as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} from the onset that Stephen's reign in Serbia would be short-lived. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror {{considered}} Stephen's enthronement an unwarranted violation of his <b>own</b> <b>rights,</b> for the Ottomans too considered Serbia their vassal state. Mehmed promptly launched an attack on Smederevo in June, and there was no serious consideration of trying to defend it. King Thomas rushed to his son's aid, trying to divert the Turks by laying siege to their fortress of Hodidjed, in the middle of Bosnia. Aware that Smederevo could not withstand Mehmed's attack, Stephen surrendered the fortress on 20 June. The Ottoman proceeded to annex the rest of the Serbian state to their empire within a year.|$|E

25|$|Any {{attempt by}} Ibn Tulun to {{lay claim to}} Mecca, however, was bound to stir up hostility against him. Not only would such a move be {{naturally}} opposed by al-Muwaffaq, {{but it would also}} create conflict with 'Amr ibn al-Layth, the powerful Saffarid governor of Sijistan and much of the Islamic East, who had been assigned various responsibilities over the pilgrimage and the Holy Cities. As with Ibn Tulun, 'Amr enjoyed a high degree of independence from the Abbasid government, but unlike the Egyptian ruler he was on relatively cordial terms with the caliphal court during this period, and in regards to Mecca he proved to be particularly jealous to preserve his <b>own</b> <b>rights</b> in the city.|$|E
25|$|The Teutonic Order used Königsberg {{to fortify}} their conquests in Samland {{and as a}} base for campaigns against pagan Lithuania. Under siege during the Prussian uprisings in 1262–63, Königsberg Castle was {{relieved}} by the Master of the Livonian Order. Because the initial northwestern settlement was destroyed by the Prussians during the rebellion, rebuilding occurred in the southern valley between the castle hill and the Pregel River. This new settlement, Altstadt, received Culm rights in 1286. Löbenicht, a new town directly east of Altstadt between the Pregel and the Schlossteich, received its <b>own</b> <b>rights</b> in 1300. Medieval Königsberg's third town was Kneiphof, which received town rights in 1327 and was located on an island of the same name in the Pregel south of Altstadt.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{appealed the}} COJ's ruling to the Supreme Court of Alabama on December 10, 2003. A special panel of retired judges and justices was {{randomly}} selected {{to hear the}} case. Moore argued that the COJ did not consider the underlying legality of the federal courts' order that the monument {{be removed from the}} courthouse. The Alabama Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying that the COJ did not have the authority to overrule the federal courts, only to determine whether Moore violated the Canons of Judicial Ethics. Therefore, the Court reasoned, it was enough to show that a procedurally-valid order was in place against Moore. Moore also argued that the COJ had imposed a religious test on him to hold his office, and that the COJ's actions had violated his <b>own</b> <b>rights</b> under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

25|$|Sviatoslav's successor, Yaropolk I (r. 972-980), {{seems to}} have had a more conciliatory {{attitude}} towards Christianity. Late medieval sources even claim that Yaropolk exchanged ambassadors with the Pope. The Chronicon of Adémar de Chabannes and the life of St. Romuald (by Pietro Damiani) actually document the mission of St. Bruno of Querfurt to the land of Rus', where he succeeded in converting to Christianity a local king (one of three brothers who ruled the land). Alexander Nazarenko suggests that Yaropolk went through some preliminary rites of baptism, but was murdered at the behest of his pagan half-brother Vladimir (whose <b>own</b> <b>rights</b> to the throne were questionable) before his conversion was formalized. Following this theory, any information on Yaropolk's baptism according to the Latin rite would be suppressed by the later Orthodox chroniclers, zealous to keep Vladimir's image of the Rus Apostle untarnished for succeeding generations.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Catholic Church - through {{lobbying}} of Axis officials, {{provision of}} false documents, and hiding {{of people in}} monasteries, convents, schools, among families and {{the institutions of the}} Vatican itself - saved hundreds of thousands of Jews from being murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. The Israeli diplomat and historian Pinchas Lapide estimated the figure at between 700,000 and 860,000 - although the figure is contested. The Catholic Church itself faced persecution in Hitler's Germany, and institutional German Catholic resistance to Nazism centred largely on defending the Church's <b>own</b> <b>rights</b> and institutions. Broader resistance tended to be fragmented and led by individual effort in Germany - but in every country under German occupation, priests played a major part in rescuing Jews. Aiding Jews met with severe penalty and many rescuers and would-be rescuers were killed - as with St Maximillian Kolbe, Giuseppe Girotti and Bernard Lichtenberg who were sent to the Concentration Camps.|$|E
25|$|Prohibition of Third-party standing: A {{party may}} only assert {{his or her}} <b>own</b> <b>rights</b> and cannot raise the claims of a third party who is not before the court; {{exceptions}} exist where the third party has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, or a person unprotected by a particular law sues to challenge the oversweeping of the law into the rights of others. For example, a party suing over a law prohibiting certain types of visual material, may sue because the 1st Amendment rights of theirs, and others engaged in similar displays, might be damaged.Additionally, third parties {{who do not have}} standing may be able to sue under the next friend doctrine if the third party is an infant, mentally handicapped, or not a party to a contract. One example of a statutory exception to the prohibition of third party standing exists in the qui tam provision of the Civil False Claims Act.|$|E
