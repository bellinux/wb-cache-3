5|$|A country's {{decision}} to operate an <b>open</b> <b>economy</b> and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications {{captured by the}} balance of payments. It also renders exposure to risks in international finance, such as political deterioration, regulatory changes, foreign exchange controls, and legal uncertainties for property rights and investments. Both individuals and groups may participate in the global financial system. Consumers and international businesses undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs.|$|E
5|$|Real {{advantages}} of the peace came in the economic field. As an <b>open</b> <b>economy,</b> the Republic needed unhindered trade. It was heavily dependent on exports of agricultural products to the British markets, and on its services sector (especially its large merchant fleet, and the banking sector), whereas its industry (whatever remained of it after a century of being confronted by foreign protectionism) also was dependent on exports. All these sectors had suffered enormously from the war: the British blockade and French and British privateering had almost brought marine trade to a standstill, whereas a commercial treaty with France (which would have ended French discrimination of Dutch trade in industrial goods) proved an ever-receding fata morgana. True, much of the trade had shifted to flags of convenience (especially that of the U.S.A. and European neutrals like Prussia), but the peace made the resurgence of the Dutch carrying trade fully practicable. Nevertheless, some changes proved irreversible, like the shift of trade patterns to German ports, {{and the decline of}} the fisheries.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} how the monetary policy works in small <b>open</b> <b>economies</b> with inflation target. To do so, we build a dynamic stochastic {{general equilibrium model}} that incorporates the basic features of these economies. We conclude that the monetary policy {{in a group of}} representative small <b>open</b> <b>economies</b> (including Australia, Chile, Colombia, Peru and New Zealand) presents strong differences due to shocks from the international financial markets (risk premium shocks, mainly) that explain mostly the variability of the real exchange rate, which has important reallocation effects in the short run. By using the allocations of the Ramsey problem as benchmark, this article shows that if the central banks in small <b>open</b> <b>economies</b> want to reduce the observed volatility of the inflation rate and the output gap, more exchange rate intervention is necessary {{in order to reduce the}} volatility produced by risk premium shocks.

25|$|Another millionaire Aniceto Arce (1888–92), {{although}} elected legally {{in elections}} of 1888 was an autocrat {{who managed to}} stay in power only through repression. His main economic accomplishment was to extend the Antofagasta-Calama Railroad to Oruro. The extension of the railroad drastically reduced the cost of transporting minerals to the Pacific coast. Economic growth was skewed, as railroads that were built to export minerals started to bring imported wheat from Chile; in 1890 Chilean wheat was cheaper in La Paz than wheat from Cochabamba. The <b>open</b> <b>economy</b> also hurt local industry.|$|E
25|$|In the 1984 {{legislative}} elections, Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, {{enough to}} give the party one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. Kahane refused to take the standard oath of office, and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from Psalms, to indicate that when national laws and the Torah conflict, the Torah (Biblical) law should have supremacy over {{the laws of the}} Knesset. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an <b>open</b> <b>economy,</b> transferring the Arab population out from the Land of Israel, revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations, based on the Code of Jewish Law compiled by Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah.|$|E
25|$|Through productivity-enhancing {{investments}} in fixed capital, {{the use of}} a large amount of energy (heat energy from peat as an industrial fuel, wind power) per worker, and a substantial investment in human capital (as witnessed by the high literacy rate), the Dutch managed to raise labor productivity above the levels prevailing in other European countries. This is illustrated by {{the fact that in the}} mid-17th century the agricultural sector, employing less than 40 percent of the labor force, could already almost be a net food exporter (which it became by 1800), and the fact that nominal wages between 1600 and 1800 were the highest in Europe. In the <b>open</b> <b>economy</b> of the Republic such a wage gap could only be sustained by enduring productivity differences.|$|E

25|$|In a move {{to expand}} new export {{opportunities}} that attract employment and diversify Mexico's crucial export sector away from excessive dependence on the US market, Mexico also expanded its trade accords beyond the US borders and sought to increase trade with the European Union, East Asia and Latin America. It was hoped that new infrastructure would help diversify Mexico's economy and improve stability in years to come. One new cooperative accord between major Latin American nations on the Pacific coast, called PaCiFiCa by the Economist, has helped to isolate the participating nations {{from some of the}} fluctuations stemming from the European debt crisis as it looks towards greater trade with Asian nations. Mexico maintains positive trading relationships and trade discussions throughout the world so as to make Mexico an <b>open</b> <b>economy</b> with a growing number of trade opportunities for all regions of Mexico and aided by new infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|The in-game {{economy in}} Eve Online is an <b>open</b> <b>economy</b> {{that is largely}} player-driven. Non-player {{character}} (NPC) merchants sell skill books used by players to learn new skills and blueprints to manufacture ships and modules. NPC merchants also buy and sell Trade Goods. Some Trade Goods are only for trade between NPC merchants while others have a functional use and are not good for trade with NPC's. The characters themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture {{almost all of the}} ships and ship modules in the game. NPC ships can be looted and salvaged for items and materials. Non-player created ships and equipment may be purchased from various NPC factions as a character gains status with them, and can be resold in the in-game economy.

25|$|A Committee of Experts deemed Brussels {{to be the}} {{one option}} to have all the {{necessary}} features for a European capital: a large, active metropolis, without a congested centre or poor quality of housing; good communications with other member states' capitals, including to major commercial and maritime markets; vast internal transport links; an important international business centre; plentiful housing for European civil servants; and an <b>open</b> <b>economy.</b> Furthermore, it was located on the border between the two major European civilisations, Latin and Germanic, and was at the centre of the first post-war integration experiment: the Benelux. As a capital of a small country, it also could not claim to use the presence of institutions to exert pressure on other member states, it being more of a neutral territory between the major European powers. The Committee's report was approved of by the Council, Parliament and Commissions, however the Council was still unable to achieve a final vote on the issue and hence put off the issue for a further three years despite all the institutions now leading in moving to Brussels.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{rules for}} monetary policy in <b>open</b> <b>economies.</b> If policymakers seek to stabilize output and inflation, optimal rules in <b>open</b> <b>economies</b> differ considerably from optimal rules in closed <b>economies.</b> In <b>open</b> <b>economies,</b> stability is best achieved by targeting long-run inflation' {{a measure of}} inflation adjusted to remove transitory effects of exchange-rate movements. Stability is also enhanced by adding an exchange-rate term to "Taylor rules" for setting interest rates. Finally, central banks must choose whether their policy instrument is an interest rate or a "monetary conditions index": an average of the interest rate and the exchange rate. The nature of shocks to the exchange rate determines which of these choices keeps output and inflation more stable. ...|$|R

[...] Many in the KMT’s right-wing claimed the speech betrayed the party’s historic commitment to destroy the communists; Chiang countered by instructing Lee to publish the entire speech in the party’s official journal. The role Lee played in the lifting of martial law in Taiwan and subsequent reforms to the National Assembly led to assembly members characterizing Lee as one of the Red Guards.|$|E

40|$|This article reconsiders {{the role}} of {{dividend}} taxation {{and its effect on}} the cost of capital of small firms. Using a simple portfolio model for small <b>open</b> <b>economies,</b> we show that a decrease in dividend taxes on large companies unambiguously increases the required rate of return for small companies. A dividend tax cut for both, large and small companies may however lead to the counter-intuitive result of increasing cost of capital for small firms. For different small <b>open</b> <b>economies,</b> we further provide statistics on the correlation between the return of large and small firms that drives the counter-intuitive result. Our results suggest that mitigating payout taxes in small <b>open</b> <b>economies</b> can have ambiguous effects on the cost of capital of small, domestically owned firms. This is particularly relevant when tax reforms are designed to stimulate investments by small firms scarce in internal funds...|$|R
2500|$|The post-Keynesian {{economist}} Thomas Palley {{argues that}} MMT {{is largely a}} restatement of elementary Keynesian economics, but prone to [...] "over-simplistic analysis" [...] and understating the risks of its policy implications. Palley denies the MMT claim that standard Keynesian analysis doesn't fully capture the accounting identities and financial restraints on a government that can issue its own money. He argues that these insights are well captured by standard Keynesian stock-flow consistent IS-LM models, and have been well understood by Keynesian economists for decades. He also criticizes MMT for essentially assuming away the problem of fiscal - monetary conflict. In Palley's view the policies proposed by MMT proponents would cause serious financial instability in an <b>open</b> <b>economy</b> with flexible exchange rates, while using fixed exchange rates would restore hard financial constraints on the government and [...] "undermines MMT’s main claim about sovereign money freeing governments from standard market disciplines and financial constraints". He also argues that MMT lacks a plausible theory of inflation, particularly {{in the context of}} full employment in the 'Employer of last resort' policy first proposed by Minsky and advocated by Bill Mitchell and other MMT theorists; of a lack of appreciation of the financial instability that could be caused by permanently zero interest rates; and of overstating the importance of government created money. Palley concludes that MMT provides no new insights about monetary theory, while making unsubstantiated claims about macroeconomic policy, and that MMT has only received attention recently due to it being a [...] "policy polemic for depressed times".|$|E

The reason is that a large <b>open</b> <b>economy</b> has the characteristics of both an autarky and a small <b>open</b> <b>economy.</b> In particular, it may not face perfect capital mobility, thus allowing internal policy measures to affect the domestic interest rate, and it may be able to sterilize balance-of-payments-induced changes in the money supply (as discussed above).|$|E

This highlights the role of monetary policy regimes in cushioning small <b>open</b> <b>economies</b> from adverse external output shocks. To assess the welfare impact of external shocks on key macroeconomic variables under different monetary policy regimes, we numerically solve and calculate the welfare loss function of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. We find that CPI inflation targeting minimizes welfare losses for import-to-GDP ratios from 0. 3 to 0. 9. However, welfare under the pegged exchange rate regime is almost equivalent to CPI inflation targeting when the import-to-GDP ratio is one while the Taylor-type rule minimizes welfare when the import-to-GDP ratio is 0. 1. We calibrate the model and derive welfare implications for eight East Asian small <b>open</b> <b>economies.</b> ...|$|R
