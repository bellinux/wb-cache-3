In 1918, mutinies broke out in the military. Food shortages were extensive, due to the control the belligerents exercised over the Dutch. Each wanted their share of Dutch produce. As a result, the price of potatoes rose sharply because Britain had demanded so much from the Dutch. Food riots even broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> A big problem was smuggling. When Germany had conquered Belgium, the Allies saw it as enemy territory and stopped exporting to Belgium. Food became scarce for the Belgian people, since the Germans seized all food.

The lyrics capture his resignation to his fantasies. The song as a whole captures their full emotional effect on him. [...] The first two verses establish the theme and explore the narrator's daydreams, in which he and the object of his affections are lovers preparing to be married, to [...] "raise a family" [...] and build [...] "a cozy little home / <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> / with two children, maybe three." [...] In the bridge, the narrator prays that he will never lose her love to another, or he will surely die." [...] By introducing this doubt, the musical bridge simultaneously bridges the movement from dream to reality, completed when the final lines shift from imagery to bald statement: [...] "But in reality / she doesn't even know me." [...] For Erlewine, [...] "the Temptations' performance has a dream-like quality, quietly drifting through the singer's hopes and desires." [...] We must add that just as the lyrics track the movement from dream to reality, the chorus goes on to anchor the drifting melody in a robust and highly memorable rhythm.|$|E
