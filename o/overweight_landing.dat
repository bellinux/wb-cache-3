25|$|On May 1, 2000, RA-86113 (c/n 081) {{suffered}} an apparent engine failure and fire on departure from Sochi. The flight crew brought {{the machine to}} a safe <b>overweight</b> <b>landing.</b> The failure and fire indications {{were found to have}} been spurious. No casualties.|$|E
5000|$|... 51 (DF): Damage during flight operations, bird or {{lightning}} strike, turbulence, heavy or <b>overweight</b> <b>landing</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Where {{aircraft}} <b>overweight</b> <b>landing</b> is permitted, {{a structural}} inspection or {{evaluation of the}} touch-down loads before the next aircraft operation will be required in case damage has occurred.|$|E
500|$|On 31 May 2017, Malaysia Airlines Flight 128, {{operated}} by an Airbus A330-300 9M-MTI to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), returned to Melbourne after a passenger attempted {{to enter the}} cockpit, which was prevented by other passengers and the flight crew. The <b>overweight</b> aircraft <b>landed</b> safely, landing on runway 16, 15 minutes after departure. Passengers were not disembarked until about 90 minutes after landing. Malaysia Airlines reported {{that they would like}} to stress that at no point was the aircraft [...] "hijacked". The next day (1 June 2017), police announced the man was a 25 year old Sri Lankan national, who was currently living in the Melbourne suburb of Dandenong on a student visa.|$|R
2500|$|... 737s are not {{equipped}} with fuel dump systems. The original aircraft {{were too small}} to require them, and adding a fuel dump system to the later, larger variants would have incurred a large weight penalty. Boeing instead demonstrated an [...] "equivalent level of safety". Depending upon {{the nature of the}} emergency, 737s either circle to burn off fuel or <b>land</b> <b>overweight.</b> If the latter is the case, the aircraft is inspected by maintenance personnel for damage and then returned to service if none is found.|$|R
50|$|Since most {{twin jet}} airliners can meet these requirements, most {{aircraft}} {{of this type}} such as the Boeing 737 (all models), the DC-9/MD80 and Boeing 717, the A320 family and various regional jet ("RJ") aircraft do not have fuel dump systems installed. In {{the event of an}} emergency, requiring a return to the departure airport, the aircraft circles nearby in order to consume fuel to get down to within the maximum structural landing weight limit, or, if the situation demands, simply <b>lands</b> <b>overweight</b> without delay. Modern aircraft are designed with possible overweight landings in mind, but this is not done except in cases of emergency, and various maintenance inspections are required afterwards.|$|R
50|$|Many smaller {{aircraft}} have {{a maximum}} landing weight {{that is the}} same as the maximum take-off weight, in which case issues of <b>overweight</b> <b>landing</b> due to excess fuel being on board cannot arise.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 November 1969, BOAC G-ASGK had a {{major failure}} of No.3 engine, debris from that engine damaged No.4 engine causing a fire. A safe <b>overweight</b> <b>landing</b> was made at Heathrow without any casualties.|$|E

50|$|On June 28, 1998 a United Airlines Boeing 747-400 flying United's {{regularly}} scheduled transpacific service from San Francisco Airport to Sydney Airport {{was forced to}} shut down one of its right-wing engines and nearly collided with San Bruno Mountain while recovering from the engine failure. The aircraft was able to dump fuel over the Pacific Ocean and return to San Francisco for an <b>overweight</b> <b>landing,</b> but the occurrence prompted United to change pilot training requirements.|$|E
5000|$|... 27 June 1979: P-3B BuNo 154596 from VP-22 {{operating}} from NAS Cubi Point Philippines, had a propeller overspeed shortly after departure. The number 4 propeller then departed the aircraft striking the number three with a subsequent fire on that engine. While attempting an <b>overweight</b> <b>landing</b> with 2 engines out, the aircraft stalled, rolled inverted and crashed in Subic Bay just past Grande Island. Four crew and one passenger {{were killed in}} the crash.|$|E
5000|$|After the near-miss, UA863 was {{vectored}} {{out to sea}} to dump fuel {{to reduce}} weight and return to San Francisco for an <b>overweight</b> <b>landing.</b> During the climbout, the first officer stated he had noted the aircraft was handling sluggishly and was slow to climb, which he instinctively responded to by [...] "pulling the nose up just a bit more to climb away from the ground." [...] The first officer had limited experience, having made only one takeoff and landing in a 747 during the year preceding the occurrence.|$|E
50|$|It is the abnormal, {{non-routine}} flight where {{landing weight}} {{can be a}} problem. If a flight takes off at the maximum takeoff weight and then faces a situation where it must return to the departure airport (due to certain mechanical problems, or a passenger medical problem for instance), {{there will not be}} time to consume the fuel meant for getting to the original destination, and the aircraft may exceed the maximum landing weight to land at the departure point. If an aircraft lands at more than its maximum allowable weight it might suffer structural damage, or even break apart on landing. At the very least, an <b>overweight</b> <b>landing</b> would require a thorough inspection for damage.|$|E
50|$|Normally {{the portion}} of the aircraft's weight that exceeds the maximum landing weight (but falls within the maximum {{take-off}} weight) is entirely composed of fuel. As the aircraft flies, the fuel burns off, {{and by the time the}} aircraft is ready to land, it is below its maximum landing weight. However, if an aircraft must land early, sometimes the fuel that remains aboard still keeps the aircraft over the maximum landing weight. When this happens, the aircraft must either burn off the fuel (by flying in a holding pattern) or dump it (if the aircraft is equipped to do this) before landing to avoid damage to the aircraft. In an emergency, an aircraft may choose to land overweight, but this may damage it, and at the very least an <b>overweight</b> <b>landing</b> will mandate a thorough inspection to check for any damage.|$|E
