40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The use of cellular polyurethanes either as microporous foams in shoe upper materials (poromerics) or in closed cell form as soling materials has increased rapidly {{during the last few}} years in the footwear industry. Compared with <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers,</b> these materials have high strength over an extended temperature range, high set and good resistance to cut growth. The research now presented. has been concerned with determining the reasons for these mechanical properties of polyurethane as compared with compounded conventional <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers.</b> The supplementary contribution to the thesis presents a review of earlier work on the strength and reinforcement of crystalline, amorphous and filled <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers</b> and includes a short section on the effect of crosslinking on ultimate failure properties of natural rubber. This study has been extended by the author into the effect of chain branching in polyurethane elastomers on the failure properties. The viscoelastic properties of natural and artificial leathers are also discussed in order to demonstrate similarities between the different materials and show how a cellular polyurethane sheet has hysteresial properties similar to those of a natural material of fibrous structure. It is shown that a cubical lattice model can be applied to explain the differences between such mechanical properties as modulus, tensile and tear strength of a cellular polyurethane and the corresponding solid material of the same polymer. This model, which has previously been applied to the mechanical properties of a natural rubber latex foam, indicates that the strength of cellular polyurethanes is due to the very high strength of the solid material. An extensive investigation into the effect of time and temperature on the tensile properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes is presented in order to show that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics have a very broad relaxation spectrum extending over 18 decades of time. Because of this response to deformation, the failure properties remain fairly constant over the temperature range from 21 – 160 °c. Above 160 °c, the tensile properties fall quite markedly. Stress softening in these polyurethanes is very high and can only be reversed by heating to temperatures above 160 °c. The cut growth and fatigue properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes are considered. Following a brief review of the investigation on cut growth and fatigue of <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers</b> involving the use of tearing energy theory, it is shown that cut growth and hysteresis properties of <b>vulcanised.</b> <b>rubbers</b> can be correlated. The lower limit of tearing energy (To) below which no cut growth takes place in the absence of chemical effects is found to be higher for polyurethanes than for <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers.</b> Fatigue failure of cellular polyurethanes is found to be due to cut growth from the largest pore in the sample. These data are also compared with measurements on other two phase elastomer systems such as styrene butadiene copolymer vulcanisates with high styrene content and polystyrene-polybutadiene thermoplastic rubbers. From an extensive review of the literature on the structure of polyurethane elastomers, it is deduced that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics consist of a segmented structure of long polyester chains connected to very minute (25 Å) hard urethane segments. The cohesion of the hard segments is primarily due to hydrogen bonding and other physical forces. It is concluded that the high strength, good cut growth resistance and broad relaxation spectrum of polyurethanes are due to the reinforcement given by the hard urethane segments which act as well dispersed minute filler particles in the polyester rubber matrix. The hydrogen bonding between the hard segments dissociates at approximately 170 °c so giving a degree of thermoplasticity which produces a very high permanent set.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{reinforcement}} of elastomers {{by the addition}} of fillers {{is one of the most}} important aspects in rubber science and technology. In order to optimise the filler – polymer interface, innovative in situ generation of silica within isoprene rubber was carried out by means of a bottom-up approach through a sol – gel process starting from tetraethoxysilane as silica precursor. The main aim was the study of the effect of the silica concentration and of the presence of coupling agent on the morphology and the dynamic mechanical behaviour of the composites. RESULTS: The in situ generated silica particles were homogeneously dispersed in the <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubber</b> with dimensions from a few nanometres to the submicrometre scale. In the presence of coupling agent a good polymer – filler adhesion was observed. The dynamic mechanical behaviour was nonlinear for silica contents higher than 20 wt%. In this range of compositions silica exerted a marked reinforcement on the low-amplitude storage modulus, which is related to the silica content according to the Huber–Vilgis model. CONCLUSION: Isoprene rubber can be effectively reinforced by the in situ generation of silica for silica contents higher than 20 wt%, and the interaction at the silica – rubber interface can be optimised by using suitable coupling agents...|$|R
40|$|As Charles Goodyear {{discovered}} in 1839, {{when he first}} <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubber,</b> a macromolecular liquid {{is transformed into a}} solid when a sufficient density of permanent crosslinks is introduced at random. At this continuous equi- librium phase transition, the liquid state, in which all macromolecules are delocalised, is transformed into a solid state, in which a nonzero fraction of macromolecules have spontaneously become localised. This solid state is a most unusual one: localisation occurs about mean positions that are distributed homogeneously and randomly, and to an extent that varies randomly from monomer to monomer. Thus, the solid state emerging at the vulcanisation transition is an equilibrium amorphous solid state: it is properly viewed as a solid state that bears the same relationship to the liquid and crystalline states as the spin glass state of certain magnetic systems bears to the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states, in the sense that, like the spin glass state, it is diagnosed by a subtle order parameter. In this review we give a detailed exposition of a theoretical approach to the physical properties of systems of randomly, permanently crosslinked macromolecules. Our primary focus is on the equilibrium properties of such systems, especially in the regime of Goodyear's vulcanisation transition.

During the four London 2012 ceremonies, the track was protected via synthetic covering. For the stadium's transformation, the track was protected from construction work for the 2015 events by covering it with a plastic sheet layer and burying it under 75 cm of soil. The Mondotrack surface was removed in early 2016 and a new surface, using 17,000 sqm of the improved Mondotrack/WS, was laid that May. Some of the original running track from (mainly) the home straight was kept so that it could be sold and auctioned to the public, thereby raising money to reinvest into operating the stadium and its neighbouring community track. The grass playing field was lengthened by several metres at either end for the 2015 rugby matches to fit a suitably-sized rugby/football pitch, and was reseeded with a Desso GrassMaster artificial-natural hybrid pitch approved for Premier league matches of 105 by 68 m, ready for West Ham United, complete with undersoil heating.
