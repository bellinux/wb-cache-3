In this interval, the Kabeljauws {{delivered}} the countship to William V, who, {{as it turned}} <b>out,</b> <b>came</b> back mad {{from a trip to}} England in 1357. Thereupon his younger brother, Albert of Bavaria, was called to Holland to succeed him, which led to another flare-up in the civil war when a third brother, Louis the Roman, tried to take the countship for himself, {{with the support of the}} Hoek nobles.|$|E

25|$|Greenidge {{scored two}} double centuries against England in the 1984 summer Test series. This series was {{also known as}} the Blackwash series which WI won by a margin of 5–0. He scored 214 not out during the second Test at Lord's in June 1984, then {{followed}} up with 223 during the fourth Test at Old Trafford in late July. The 214 not <b>out</b> <b>came</b> upon the fifth and last day of the Test Match as West Indies successfully chased 342 for victory. It remains the highest run chase at Lords.|$|E
25|$|In the {{southern}} hemisphere winter in 1959, Simpson played a season in the Lancashire League in England as Accrington's professional player, receiving a 950-pound contract. He scored 1444 runs at 103.14, returning a better statistical analysis than Gary Sobers, and took 47 wickets at 20.82. Simpson's top-score of 122 not <b>out</b> <b>came</b> against Ramsbottom and added another triple-figure score against Bacup, and his season included 11 consecutive fifties including a century, seven of which were unbeaten.

25|$|Following World War I Woolley was {{a regular}} in the side until 1931, mostly {{appearing}} as an opening batsman he passed 1,000 runs in a season on seven occasions between 1921 and 1929. His most productive season came in 1928 when he scored 1,602. His second first-class century came in 1921 and {{proved to be the}} highest score of his career and only double century. The innings of 204 not <b>out</b> <b>came</b> against Worcestershire at Northampton. His best bowling of his career also occurred in 1921, against Glamorgan at Cardiff Arms Park, he took 6/30 in the first innings and followed that with 4/22 as the home side followed on. The match figures of 10/52 were the only occasion he took ten wickets in a match.|$|E
25|$|Aibara was a {{right-handed}} middle order batsman {{and often}} captained Hyderabad. He {{played a part}} in both of Hyderabad's two Ranji Trophy wins despite them being 50 years apart, as a player in 1937-38 where he scored the match winning hundred and as coach in 1986-87. His effort in the 1937-38 Final against Nawanagar is what he is best remembered for, his innings of 137 not <b>out</b> <b>came</b> in a game where the next highest score by a player from either team was 67 and it was his maiden first-class hundred. Hyderabad had been dismissed for just 113 in their first innings and were set the task of chasing 310 to win in the fourth innings. Aibara came into bat with his side at 3 for 67 and guided Hyderabad home with just one wicket to spare.|$|E
25|$|Kallis {{returned}} to form after an indifferent 2008 and averaged over 50 {{in his next}} six series. During this time, the Proteas won one series (against West Indies), drew four (two against India, one against England, and one against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates), and lost one series to a resilient Australia. Kallis scored a masterful 173 in Nagpur in 2010 before the Centurion Test against India {{later in the year}} when he scored his maiden double-century in Test match cricket. His 201 not <b>out</b> <b>came</b> in a landslide victory for South Africa as two of the team's future batting stars contributed significant hundreds of their own (AB de Villiers and future captain Hashim Amla). For the second time in his career, Kallis scored twin centuries in a match, during the third test of the series at his home-ground, Newlands in Cape Town.|$|E

25|$|Day Four {{was played}} with no {{disruptions}} from {{the weather and}} 100 overs to be played. Michael Hussey made his 4th Test Century in the fifth over of the day's play. Gillespie and Hussey pushed on to bat making great progress through the day with Hussey punishing the pacemen while Gillespie took on the spinners with great drives {{and a couple of}} magnificent sixes. Hussey and Gillespie both reached 150, and compiled a fourth wicket partnership of 320 runs, before Hussey was dismissed for 182 from only 203 deliveries before lunch. Then, shortly after the lunch break, Gillespie reached a double century. His 201 not <b>out</b> <b>came</b> from 425 balls, 574 minutes, and was spread across four days of batting. His second hundred was much faster than his first, coming from only 129 balls. His score is the highest ever by a nightwatchman, and the highest score by an Australian against Bangladesh. Ricky Ponting declared after Gillespie's double century, with the score 4/581, a lead of 384 runs.|$|E
25|$|Lifmann {{made his}} senior debut for the Netherlands in September 1978, playing against the New Zealanders {{returning}} from their tour of England. His first international tournament for the Netherlands was the 1982 ICC Trophy in England. At the tournament, Lifmann scored 250 runs from four matches, ranking him {{fifth in the}} competition for runs (and first among his teammates). His highest score, 155 not <b>out,</b> <b>came</b> against Malaysia, and set a new tournament record for the highest individual innings (later broken by Hong Kong's Simon Myles). Lifmann remained in good form at the 1986 ICC Trophy, scoring 395 runs from ten matches to rank third among Dutch batsmen and fifth overall. His tournament included scores of 98 against Papua New Guinea and 110 against Israel, {{as well as a}} team-high 41 in the final against Zimbabwe. Lifmann was a regular for the Netherlands for several more years, playing his last international in 1989 (against the Australians returning from their a tour of England). His club cricket was played for VOC Rotterdam.|$|E
25|$|When the WNCL started, Sthalekar did {{not have}} a heavy {{workload}} with the bat. New South Wales won seven of their eight round-robin matches, five of these by seven or more wickets in run-chases. As a result of the effectiveness of the first three batsmen in the order, Sthalekar only had to bat six times in these eight matches, and was twice unbeaten on single-figure scores when the target was reached. Her top-score of 57 not <b>out</b> <b>came</b> in the final match when she guided New South Wales to a three-wicket win over Victoria. By the end of the round-robin phase, she had scored 175 runs and been dismissed only once, in the only match in which her state did not bat last. With the ball, Sthalekar took two wickets in three of the first four matches for a total of seven wickets in those matches, but only took two in the last four matches. In the final, she took 0/29 from seven overs as New South Wales dismissed Victoria for 117. She then made 16 in a six-wicket win. Sthalekar ended the competition with 191 runs at 95.50 and ten wickets at 22.70 at an economy rate of 2.80.|$|E

25|$|This time though, the openers began solidly {{putting on}} 50 {{for the first}} time in the series. When Ramesh was dismissed, Ganguly sent in VVS Laxman. Rahul Dravid had been {{struggling}} for runs for a while and Laxman had been stroking the ball well before his unfortunate dismissal. Interestingly, Laxman had been asked to open the innings in this match but had refused. He seemed to pick up from where he had left off, batting serenely, and at times aggressively – a reminder that there were no demons in the pitch. Das departed, unfortunate to hit the stumps with his heels while having executed an immaculate pull shot to end a promising partnership with Laxman. Tendulkar soon followed, for a second failure in the match but Laxman found a willing ally in Sourav Ganguly. The pair set about repairing the damage done raising a hundred for the 4th wicket, but just when it seemed India would end the day with some semblance of balance, McGrath induced an edge that was lapped up gleefully by Gilchrist to dismiss Ganguly 2 runs short of a deserved half century. <b>Out</b> <b>came</b> Rahul Dravid, with scorecard reading 232/4. Laxman duly completed a hundred in Dravid's company.|$|E
500|$|Making his Test debut {{against the}} West Indies in March 1971, [...] Gavaskar scored his first {{century in the}} third Test of the same series. In the final Test at Port of Spain he scored centuries in both innings of the match with scores of 124 and 220, {{becoming}} the second Indian player to perform the feat. He became {{the first player to}} score two centuries in a Test match for the third time, when he made 107 and 182 not out in a match against the West Indies in December 1978. Gavaskar's highest Test score of 236 not <b>out</b> <b>came</b> against the West Indies at Chennai in 1983, an Indian record at that time. He has scored 150 or more runs in a Test match innings on twelve occasions. Gavaskar was most successful against the West Indies and Australia scoring 13 and 8 centuries respectively.|$|E

Lawless signed for the club on a free transfer and manager Leroy Rosenior said [...] "It's important that the supporters are patient with these youngsters and give them time to learn and develop". He made his debut on 6 August 2005 in a 0–0 draw at home to Notts County, although he only lasted 26 minutes before being replaced by substitute Tony Bedeau. His return from an injury after nearly a month <b>out</b> <b>came</b> in a 2–1 victory over Shrewsbury Town in September, which was Torquay's first win of the season. He picked up another injury in November 2005, and made his return {{after three months of}} not playing by starting in a 1–0 victory over Bristol Rovers on 17 December 2005. He scored an own goal after 86 minutes against Wycombe Wanderers on 26 December 2005, which resulted in Torquay drawing 2–2.
