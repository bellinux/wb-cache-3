During the storage period, weight loss, colour, firmness, soluble solids, titratable acidity and overall quality were evaluated. Non treated fresh-cut cauliflower maintained soluble solid content, good firmness and showed low weight loss, but marketability was limited to 14 days, mainly due to the browning occurring in the cut zones. The hot air treatment increased weight loss during storage, but strongly reduced colour changes of minimally processed cauliflower. This lead to prolonged shelf life up to 3 weeks...|$|E

It was found difficult to effect a landing anywhere, owing to a heavy surf and to the coral having extended itself to a considerable distance from the shore.

Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine Lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. Corals of every shape and hue were there; some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms; <b>others,</b> <b>cabbages</b> from an inch to three feet in diameter: while a third bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not the so-much-needed supply of water and provisions.|$|R

30|$|Brassica oleracea, {{a species}} {{commonly}} {{known for its}} polymorphism, comprises a number of varieties of significant importance for human consumption. This opulent species includes, among <b>others,</b> <b>cabbage,</b> broccoli, brussels sprouts and cauliflower, and because of its nutritional importance is a subject of both conventional and biotechnological breeding and modifications (Vinterhalter et al. 2007). Moreover, some of the cole crops (e.g. broccoli and cauliflower) were proved {{to reduce the risk}} of cancer in several organs (Spini and Kerr 2006). For these reasons, research on genetic engineering of the Brassicaceae family has aroused huge interest in recent years, especially since a quite good background of repeatable regeneration protocols became available. As it can be seen from the literature data, the prerequisite for genetic engineering—a plant regeneration system for in vitro propagation—has been established for many Brassica vegetables, e.g. reports by Gerszberg et al. 2015; Kumar and Srivastava 2016; Munshi et al. 2007; Pavlović et al. 2010; Ravanfar et al. 2014; Shahid et al. 2010. Genetic transformation of the cole crops was achieved by direct DNA uptake and by the Rhizobium-mediated technique (Bhalla and Singh 2008; Chakrabarty et al. 2002; Nugent et al. 2006; Radchuk et al. 2002). However, those closely related botanical varieties obviously display substantial differences in the response to regeneration and transformation approaches (Pavlović et al. 2010; Sretenović-Rajićić et al. 2006). Thus, a successful protocol for one genotype does not mean a fruitful transformation for another.|$|R

6000|$|Although we {{see such}} great {{differences}} in the shape, size, colour, arrangement, and manner of growth of the leaves and stem, and of the flower-stems in the broccoli and cauliflower, {{it is remarkable that}} the flowers themselves, the seed-pods and seeds, present extremely slight differences or none at all. (9/66. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 52; Metzger 'Syst. Beschreibung der Kult. Kohlarten' 1833 s. 6.) I compared the flowers of all the principal kinds; those of the Couve Tronchuda are white and rather smaller than in common cabbages; those of the Portsmouth broccoli have narrower sepals, and smaller, less elongated petals; and in no <b>other</b> <b>cabbage</b> could any difference be detected. With respect to the seed-pods, in the purple Kohlrabi alone, do they differ, being a little longer and narrower than usual. I made a collection of the seeds of twenty- eight different kinds, and most of them were undistinguishable; when there was any difference it was excessively slight; thus, the seeds of various broccolis and cauliflowers, when seen in mass, are a little redder; those of the early green Ulm savoy are rather smaller; and those of the Breda kail slightly larger than usual, but not larger than the seeds of the wild cabbage from the coast of Wales. What a contrast in the amount of difference is presented if, on the one hand, we compare the leaves and stems of the various kinds of cabbage with their flowers, pods, and seeds, {{and on the other hand}} the corresponding parts in the varieties of maize and wheat! The explanation is obvious; the seeds alone are valued in our cereals, and their variations have been selected; whereas the seeds, seed- pods, and flowers, have been utterly neglected in the cabbage, whilst many useful variations in their leaves and stems have been noticed and preserved from an extremely remote period, for cabbages were cultivated by the old Celts.

40|$|The {{offspring}} of parasitoids, Aphidius colemani Viereck, reared on Brussels sprouts and emerging from Myzus persicae Sulzer on a fully defined artificial diet, show no preferences in a four-way olfactometer, either for the odour of the diet, the odour of Brussels sprouts, or the odour of two <b>other</b> crucifers (<b>cabbage</b> and Chinese cabbage). A similar lack of odour preferences is shown when the host aphids are exposed for parasitization (for 48 h) on cabbage, Chinese cabbage or wheat. However, if parasitization occurs on Brussels sprouts, a weak but statistically highly significant response to Brussels sprout odour is observed. Although {{as many as}} 30 - 35 % of the parasitoids show no response to any odour, another 35 % respond positively to the odour of Brussels sprout compared with responses to the odours of cabbage, Chinese cabbage or wheat of only approximately 10 %. An analagous result is obtained when the parent parasitoids are reared on cabbage. In this case, significant positive responses of their offspring to cabbage odour occur only if the 48 -h parasitization has occurred also on cabbage. However, with parasitoids from Brussels sprouts parasitizing the aphids for 48 h also on Brussels sprouts, the offspring subsequently emerging from pupae excised from the mummies show no preference for Brussels sprout odour. Thus, although the Brussels sprout cue had been experienced early {{in the development of}} the parasitoids, they only become conditioned to it when emerging from the mummy. Both male and female parasitoids respond very similarly in all experiments. It is proposed that the chemical cue (probably glucosinolates in these experiments) is most likely in the silk surrounding the parasitoid pupa, and that the mother may leave the chemical in or around the egg at oviposition, inducing chemical defences in her offspring to the secondary plant compounds that the offspring are likely to encounter...|$|R
40|$|Glucosinolates are the {{biochemical}} {{compounds that}} provide defense to plants against pathogens and herbivores. In this study, the relative expression level of 48 glucosinolate biosynthesis genes was explored in four morphologically-different cabbage inbred lines by qPCR analysis. The content of aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate molecules present in those cabbage lines was also estimated by HPLC analysis. The possible association between glucosinolate accumulation and related gene expression level was explored by {{principal component analysis}} (PCA). The genotype-dependent variation in the relative expression level of different aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes is the novel result of this study. A total of eight different types of glucosinolates, including five aliphatic and three indolic glucosinolates, was detected in four cabbage lines. Three inbred lines BN 3383, BN 4059 and BN 4072 had no glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin detected, but the inbred line BN 3273 had these three aliphatic glucosinolate compounds. PCA revealed that a higher expression level of ST 5 b genes and lower expression of GSL-OH {{was associated with the}} accumulation of these three aliphatic glucosinolate compounds. PCA further revealed that comparatively higher accumulation of neoglucobrassicin in the inbred line, BN 4072, was associated {{with a high level of}} expression of MYB 34 (Bol 017062) and CYP 81 F 1 genes. The Dof 1 and IQD 1 genes probably trans-activated the genes related to biosynthesis of glucoerucin and methoxyglucobrassicin for their comparatively higher accumulation in the BN 4059 and BN 4072 lines compared to the other two lines, BN 3273 and BN 3383. A comparatively higher progoitrin level in BN 3273 was probably associated with the higher expression level of the GSL-OH gene.

40|$|Cropping systems require careful {{nitrogen}} (N) {{management to}} increase the sustainability of agricultural production. One important route towards enhanced sustainability is to increase nitrogen use efficiency. Improving nitrogen use efficiency encompasses increasing N uptake, N utilization efficiency, and N harvest index, each involving many crop physiological mechanisms and agronomic traits. Here, we review recent developments in cultural practices, cultivar choice, and breeding regarding nitrogen use efficiency. We add a comparative analysis of our own research on designing breeding strategies for nitrogen use efficiency in leafy and non-leafy vegetables, literature on breeding for nitrogen use efficiency in <b>other</b> vegetables (<b>cabbage,</b> cauliflower), and literature on breeding for nitrogen use efficiency in grain crops. We highlight traits that are generic across species, demonstrate how traits contributing to nitrogen use efficiency differ among crops, and show how cultural practice affects the relevance of these traits. Our review indicates that crops harvested in their early or late vegetative phase or reproductive phase differ in traits relevant to improve nitrogen use efficiency. Head-forming crops (lettuce, cabbage) depend on the prolonged photosynthesis of outer leaves to provide the carbon sources for continued N supply and growth of the photosynthetically less active, younger inner leaves. Grain crops largely depend on prolonged N availability for uptake and on availability of N in stover for remobilization to the grains. Improving root performance is relevant for all crop types, but especially short-cycle vegetable crops benefit from early below-ground vigor. We conclude that there is sufficient genetic variation available among modern cultivars to further improve nitrogen use efficiency but that it requires integration of agronomy, crop physiology, and efficient selection strategies to make rapid progress in breeding. We also conclude that discriminative traits related to nitrogen use efficiency better express themselves under low input than under high input. However, testing under both low and high input can yield cultivars that are adapted to low-input conditions but also respond to high-input conditions. The benefits of increased nitrogen use efficiency through breeding are potentially large but realizing these benefits is challenged by the huge genotype-by-environment interaction and the complex behavior of nitrogen in the cropping system. </p...|$|R

This cabbage patch, planted {{in such a way}} as to spell the word CABBAGE immediately captured the imagination of both the media and the public and engendered a flurry of other activities on the site, culminating in a week-long festival... when the cabbages were ceremonially harvested." [...] While a work of conceptual sculpture, this intervention is also an early example of guerrilla gardening in New Zealand. Thomas' work remained for six months, [...] "astonishingly unvandalised, as a living, breathing sculpture in the heart of the city." [...] Christina Barton writes that in the months that followed, [...] "it captured the hearts and minds of Wellingtonians, who followed the growth of the cabbages, adding their own embellishments to the site, and contributed to the week of festivities (with poetry readings, performances, and the distribution of free coleslaw) that celebrated their harvest", describing the work as [...] "a provocation to the local council and the city's developers". Thomas' documentation of the project was recently purchased by New Zealand's national gallery Te Papa, who described the work as an [...] "important moment in New Zealand’s art and social history" [...] with links to the [...] "Occupy movement, urban farming and guerrilla gardening".|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} paperisto {{find out}} which plants the Cistercian monks might have {{cultivated}} in Sweden during the Middle Ages and which types of plants {{it would have been}} practical to grow inside or outside of the Cistercian monastery precinct. Archaeologicaland archaeobotanical studies have been consulted to find out which plants were available in Sweden during the Middle Ages. Examples, mainly from Scandinavia, but also from the continent, are used to show that the monasteries were large institutionsthat had to feed {{a large number of people}} and that there would not have been enough space to cultivate everything needed within the monastery precinct. Secondary sources have in the main been used to gather this information, except in the case of the Swedish monastery of Nydala where F-Topo, a database developed by the County Museum of Jönköping,has been used to analyse the amount of land and the types of properties owned by the monastery. The conclusion is that for practical reasons the monks would have cultivated plants that needed to be close at hand, that were rare or delicate, that could not be stored for long periods and that were used in small quantities within the monastery precinct. This would include medicinal plants, herbs for cooking and some vegetables like lettuce, spinach,and similar,that do not keep well. Most <b>other</b> items, grains, <b>cabbages,</b> root vegetables, peas and beans could equally well be cultivated outside the walls. As yet there is no complete list over plant introductions in Sweden. The most comprehensive list available has been included in the Appendix together with indications of usage area; medicinal, food or miscellaneous...|$|R
40|$|Zambian {{nutritional}} {{experts are}} echoing findings by local agricultural scientists, {{in order to}} encourage consumers to grow and buy time-tested traditional food varieties. Zam Seed, the national seed company funded by the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), has already begun selling seed packets of traditional vegetables. Roots, leaves, tubers and fruits which were discovered, grown and collected largely by women farmers, went out of fashion in Zambia when people left the land to work in the copper mines or towns. According to Dr N. A. Mnzava of Zambia's National Irrigation Research Station (NIRS) Zambians should take a new look at their traditional varieties now that the country's food imports cost US$ 150 million a year. Scientific research into traditional food is yielding good results. The leafy green weed Cleome gynandra (known locally as 'suntha') is more nutritious than the domestic cabbage favoured by most Zambians. Cleome leaves have four times more protein, six times more iron and calcium and 30 times more vitamin A than <b>cabbage.</b> <b>Other</b> traditional crops include cabbage-like leaves of the brassica family, the African eggplant (Solanum macrocarpon) and various species of amaranthus (a wild grain species). Researchers have developed two strains of amaranthus, one bred for its leaf, and the other for the grain, from which biscuits have been made locally on a trial basis. Most of the experimental research on wild vegetables has been carried out at NIRS, located south of Lusaka. Dr Mnzava and his colleagues have found that cleome seeds contain 50 % polyunsaturated mechanically extractable oil, which is edible without refining. More than 300 kilogrammes of seeds can be harvested from one hectare.

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Not usually {{cultivated}} as animal feed. Japanese radishes & kale {{are produced}} as feed for livestock. When market prices are low or crops are damaged by hail, etc., {{it is sometimes}} fed to stock. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Turnips, radishes, cabbages, cauliflowers, and Brussel sprouts (Brassicaceae) are all vegetables which are produced for human consumption. They do not grow naturally in the wild. The tubers of some are utilised, (turnips, radishes, etc.), while the leaves and flowers and fruit of <b>others</b> are consumed (<b>cabbages,</b> cauliflowers, etc.). Weeds like wild radish and wild mustard do grow wild. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Haemopoietic: • The toxic principle of the Brassicaceae is dimethyl disulphide produced from SMCO. • Dimethyl disulphide reacts with the thiol group of GSH which is then not available to prevent oxidative damage of the red blood cell. • With oxidative damage the haemoglobin is denatured and the protein precipitate as Heinz bodies. • The affected erythrocytes are removed by the RE-system or intravascular haemolysis ensues resulting in haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria. Urogenital: Organic nitriles and glucosinolates are goitrogenic and teratogenic. SYNDROMES: Heinz body anemia. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Haemopoietic and urogenital systems. CLINICAL SIGNS: Acute: • Haemoglobinuria. Pale, anaemic mucous membranes • Icterus (jaundice) • Diarrhoea • Ruminal stasis Chronic: • Subclinical anaemia. • Ill-thrift. • Poor milk production, poor growth, emaciation. • Infertility. NECROPSY: Macroscopical findings: Icterus. Anemia – pale mucous membranes, watery blood. Haemoglobinuria and dark pigmented kidneys. Git irritation. TREATMENT: • Remove feed immediately • Blood transfusion in valuable or stud animals. PREVENTION: • Brassica’s should be fed only in limited quantities • Feed with other good quality hay, concentrate, etc. • Can slowly increase the percentage of Brassica’s in the ration • Avoid frost damaged plants - may have a higher concentration of the toxic principle.

40|$|Vegetable {{production}} in conservation tillage {{has increased in}} Brazil, with positive effects on the soil quality. Since management systems alter {{the quantity and quality}} of organic matter, this study evaluated the influence of different management systems and cover crops on the organic matter dynamics of a dystrophic Red Latosol under vegetables. The treatments consisted of the combination of three soil tillage systems: no-tillage (NT), reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT) and of two cover crops: maize monoculture and maize-mucuna intercrop. Vegetables were grown in the winter and the cover crops in the summer for straw production. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. Soil samples were collected between the crop rows in three layers (0. 0 - 0. 05, 0. 05 - 0. 10, and 0. 10 - 0. 30 m) twice: in October, before planting cover crops for straw, and in July, during vegetable cultivation. The total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), oxidizable fractions, and the carbon fractions fulvic acid (C FA), humic acid (C HA) and humin (C HUM) were determined. The main changes in these properties occurred in the upper layers (0. 0 - 0. 05 and 0. 05 - 0. 10 m) where, in general, TOC levels were highest in NT with maize straw. The MBC levels were lowest in CT systems, indicating sensitivity to soil disturbance. Under mucuna, the levels of C HA were lower in RT than NT systems, while the C FA levels were lower in RT than CT. For vegetable production, the C HUM values were lowest in the 0. 05 - 0. 10 m layer under CT. With regard to the oxidizable fractions, the tillage systems differed only in the most labile C fractions, with higher levels in NT than CT in the 0. 0 - 0. 05 m layer in both summer and winter, with no differences between these systems in the <b>other</b> layers. The <b>cabbage</b> yield was not influenced by the soil management system, but benefited from the mulch production of the preceding maize-mucuna intercrop as cover plant...|$|R
