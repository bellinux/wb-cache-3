5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket.</b> Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

25|$|In the {{majority}} of Native American hunter-gatherer societies, wolves were usually killed for body parts used in rituals, or to stop them raiding food caches, though some tribes would raid wolf dens to kill pups when wolf populations became too large for the Natives to live with. This {{also served as a}} method of acquiring food, as wolf pups were considered a delicacy. Native Americans were aware of the dangers of habituated wolves, and would quickly dispatch wolves following them too closely. Active hunting of wolves was rare because many tribes believed that such an act would cause game animals to disappear or bring retribution from other wolves. The Cherokee feared that the unjust killing of a wolf would bring about the vengeance of its pack mates, and that the weapon used for the deed would be useless in future unless exorcised by a medicine man. However, they would kill wolves with impunity if they knew the proper rites of atonement, and if the wolves themselves happened to raid their fish nets. When the Kwakiutl killed a wolf, the animal would be laid out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> and have portions of its flesh eaten by the perpetrators, who would express regret at the act before burying it. The Ahtna would take the dead wolf to a hut, where it would be propped in a sitting position with a banquet made by a shaman set before it. When men from certain Eskimo tribes killed a wolf, they would walk around their houses four times, expressing regret and abstaining from sexual relations with their wives for four days. Young Apaches would kill wolves, cougars or bears as a rite of passage. Although some of the first European colonists traveling to North America would report back that wolves were more populous in the New World than in Europe, writings from the Lewis and Clark Expedition indicate that wolves were seldom seen except in aboriginal buffer zones.|$|E
500|$|After {{forming in}} 1986 in Cincinnati, The Afghan Whigs—vocalist and rhythm guitarist Greg Dulli, bassist John Curley, lead guitarist Rick McCollum, and drummer Steve Earle—released their 1988 debut album Big Top Halloween on an {{independent}} record label and gained {{the attention of}} Seattle-based label Sub Pop. With their second album Up in It (1990) released on the label, the band toured regularly in the United States {{for two years and}} occasionally in Europe before recording Congregation. Sub Pop gave the band a $15,000 advance to record the album, which Dulli later said was a [...] "then-unheard-of" [...] and [...] "bloated" [...] amount. Along with a collective interest in classic rock, the band members had other individual tastes in music, including McCollum's interest in free jazz, experimental, and Indian music, and Dulli's love of hip hop, soul, and funk, particularly Motown artists and Prince. Their African-American music influences were comically referred to by Congregations cover photo, which depicted a nude black woman sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> with a white baby held in her arms.|$|E

500|$|Stojanović was in {{the field}} {{hospital}} for about 10 days before he was moved to a house around [...] away. At the end of March 1942, the Operational Headquarters for Bosanska Krajina and {{the headquarters of the}} 4th Krajina Detachment were both located in Jošavka. The two headquarters and the field hospital were attacked on the night of 31March by members of the Jošavka Partisan Company, who had joined the Chetnik side under the influence and leadership of Radoslav [...] "Rade" [...] Radić, the deputy commissar of the 4th Krajina Detachment. That night, the Chetniks killed 15 Partisans in Jošavka. According to Danica Perović, the physician who attended Stojanović, the Chetniks took his weapons and posted a sentry outside the house. Through a messenger, Radić told Stojanović to write a letter ordering Danko Mitrov to remove all Partisan units from the area around Jošavka. Stojanović, however, wrote a letter encouraging Mitrov to continue the Partisan fight. The next night, a group of Chetniks came to Stojanović, placed him <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket,</b> and carried him out of the house. When they approached a nearby stream called Mlinska Rijeka, one of them shot Stojanović twice, killing him.|$|E
500|$|Bobby {{explains}} {{that the man who}} attacked Sam is Jeremy Frost; he was unable to dream because his father brutally hit him {{in the head with a}} baseball bat. The target's DNA is a required ingredient for the dream-root tea, and Jeremy acquired Bobby's by offering him a beer. Dean realizes that he made the same mistake. Vulnerable to Jeremy, they both stay awake for two days while attempting to track him down. Unable to endure it any longer, Dean goes to sleep to face Jeremy, and Sam uses the dream root to enter his dream. The brothers encounter a dream version of Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson)Dean's former love interestoutside <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> with a picnic basket. She invites Dean to join her, and tells him that she loves him before disappearing. Though Dean denies ever having that dream before, it is an obvious lie. Sam then sees Jeremy nearby and chases after him, and Dean finds himself in a long hallway. He enters his motel room, and comes face-to-face with a dream version of him; he is his own worst nightmare. The Dream Dean comments on the real Dean's feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing; he also deems Dean to be as [...] "mindless and obedient as an attack dog", noting that his possessions, personality, and motives all stem from his father. When the Dream Dean calls him a [...] "good soldier and nothing else", the real Dean reacts violently and exclaims that he did not deserve the burdens that his father put onto him and that he does not deserve to go to Hell. The real Dean shoots his doppelganger with a shotgun, but he returns to life as a demon. The Dream Dean taunts him that he cannot escape his fate, and reminds him that exposure to Hell will transform him into a demon.|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{reported}} finding blood <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> {{and noted}} the [...] "sickly-sweet smell of death" [...] at the site. It seemed {{clear that there}} were no survivors. Sullivan noted that recovery of remains would be very difficult as the glacier was already covered by fresh snow eight feet deep. Near the remains of the aircraft, drifted snow was piled up to hundreds of feet. Apparently, the crash had also triggered avalanches that had further buried the remains. Because of the difficult conditions, the recovery effort was terminated after a week and the victims' families were told they would have no remains to bury. The debris was then covered by snow and ice, and was lost for the next 60 years.|$|E

2500|$|Berlin {{was born}} on May 11, 1888, in the Russian Empire. His exact birthplace is unknown. Although Berlin's family came from the shtetel of Tolochin (in latter-day Belarus), {{he may have been}} born in Tyumen, Siberia. He was one of eight {{children}} of Moses (1848–1901) and Lena Lipkin Beilin (1850–1922). His father, a cantor in a synagogue, uprooted the family to America, as did many other Jewish families in the late 19th century. In 1893 they settled in New York City. Upon their arrival at Ellis Island, the name [...] "Beilin" [...] was changed to [...] "Baline". According to biographer Laurence Bergreen, as an adult Berlin admitted to no memories of his first five years in Russia except for one: [...] "he was lying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> by the side of a road, watching his house burn to the ground. By daylight the house was in ashes." [...] As an adult, Berlin said he was unaware of being raised in abject poverty since he knew no other life.|$|E
