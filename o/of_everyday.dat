40|$|The {{sociology}} of childhood framework is generating {{new approaches to}} researching children as competent informants <b>of</b> their own <b>everyday</b> experience. Seeing children as competent research participants contrasts much educational research that sees children as developing and seeking to attain competence and provides valuable methodological insights of home and school. Participants were children aged 7 - 12 years enrolled in two Brisbane schools. This paper investigates children's own accounts <b>of</b> their <b>everyday</b> practices in two Brisbane schools. It provides accounts of how children, themselves, make sense <b>of</b> their <b>everyday</b> lives and {{how they feel about}} making decisions or having decisions made for them. The paper demonstrates that negotiating various forms of adult- etermined regulation and control is an important and necessary part <b>of</b> children's <b>everyday</b> lives. So too, it shows that some forms of adult regulation are more acceptable to children than others and that finding social spaces outside adult regulation is an important part <b>of</b> their <b>everyday</b> lives...|$|R

5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad dance and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a dance style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the Popcorn, and the Jerk; and the movements <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> people. As a dance style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature dance style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life across Springfield are shown, and one by one, with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Despite these grand designs Domitian was {{determined}} to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. According to Suetonius, the imperial bureaucracy never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among provincial governors and elected officials.|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life, {{much more so than}} in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E

5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E
5|$|In the Netherlands, a {{particularly}} vibrant artistic culture developed. The work of Hugo van der Goes and Jan van Eyck was particularly influential {{on the development}} of painting in Italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation (see Renaissance in the Netherlands). Later, the work of Pieter Brueghel the Elder would inspire artists to depict themes <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots {{began to emerge}} in the professional era, taking the place <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|E

5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major part <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life and culture in {{occupied}} Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country. Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling {{the actions of the}} official Belgian government in peacetime. In the eyes of contemporaries, the CNSA became a symbol of national unity and of passive resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{genre of}} Midas bears {{the marks of}} gender debates, as well, with Percy writing in the {{traditionally}} male-dominated form of the lyric and Mary focusing on the details <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> life in her verse drama. Since the play's first publication in 1922, critics have {{paid more attention to}} Percy Shelley's lyrics than Mary Shelley's drama. However, in the last fifteen years or so, this trend has reversed itself as scholars explore works of Mary Shelley other than Frankenstein (1818).|$|E
5|$|The press, the radio, and the {{television}} also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new {{freedom of the press}} and the introduction of television into the lives <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.|$|E
