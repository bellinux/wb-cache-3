5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for himself, because he can <b>only</b> <b>think</b> of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could <b>only</b> <b>think</b> of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E

The winters in Port-Royal were less rigorous, but {{nonetheless}} long and dull.|$|E

25|$|Patrik Jensen and Jonas Björler had a {{discussion}} at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband, and when Jensen asked Björler {{as to who}} should be the new vocalist in the band, Björler could <b>only</b> <b>think</b> of former member, Marco Aro. A few days after, Jensen phoned Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and tempted to rejoin but at first was hesitant due hectic touring he had done with the band in the past, which Aro {{was not interested in}} doing, but The Haunted had done it for almost a decade straight after Aro left, getting all the touring out of them. More hesitation came when Aro struggled with drug addiction back then and with him {{to be back in the}} band again, he didn't want it to reoccur as it had also given him problems within his family, who he needed to discuss rejoining the band with also. Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have {{a discussion}} with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there was good news coming from the band. His picture was in a silhouette on the band's official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. Adrian Erlandsson, a former member, returned to the band also and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band's new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled Eye of the Storm which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had also been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup to perform for the first time live with this lineup at the 70000 Tons of Metal which sat sail 27–31 January 2014.|$|E

500|$|... "We Belong Together" [...] is an R ballad. Rolling Stone {{called it}} [...] "soulful." [...] The song is {{propelled}} by a programmed Roland TR-808-styled kick and hi-hat, which is prominently utilized in hip hop music. Reviewer Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News commented that Carey's spare and understated singing approach gave the song more power, {{which would not}} have been achieved if she had belted. The song also incorporates 1980s retro-soul music by [...] "cleverly" [...] referencing Bobby Womack's [...] "If You Think You're Lonely Now" [...] (1981) and the Deele's [...] "Two Occasions" [...] (1987), with Babyface. In the second verse of [...] "We Belong Together", Carey sings: [...] "Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me, 'If you think you're lonely now'." [...] She then flips across a radio dial: [...] "So I turn the dial, tryin’ to catch a break / And then I hear Babyface / 'I <b>only</b> <b>think</b> of you...'." [...] The line [...] "If you think you're lonely now" [...] is from the song of the same name and [...] "I <b>only</b> <b>think</b> of you" [...] is from the chorus of [...] "Two Occasions." [...] In the remix she also says [...] "I <b>only</b> <b>think</b> of you / On two occasions / That's day and night..." [...] Due to the inclusion of the lyrics from both songs, the songwriters were given co-writing credits on the song. [...] "We Belong Together" [...] follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three distinct sections, with each section presenting the protagonist in different emotions. The first section chronicles the break-up of the couple, and a sorrowful tone is established as she laments her former mistakes. In the second section, the narrative switches to the present, and the protagonist becomes increasingly agitated and feels [...] "all out of her element" [...] when she attempts to distract herself by listening to the radio, but fails. [...] "We Belong Together" [...] does not have a bridge; instead, Carey transitions into the third section by raising the pitch an octave, which emphasizes the sheer frustration and desperation of the protagonist. Metro Times writer Johnny Loftus described the song's production, lyrics and vocals in detail: ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "" [...] (1993), Tessa {{witnesses}} {{the brutal}} murder of former artist Anne Wheeler (Diana Barrington), and reacts angrily when {{she realizes that}} the police will do nothing about it, saying: [...] "I'm not hysterical, I don't see things, and I'm not looking for attention. I just want something to be done." [...] She decides to find the murderer on her own. When MacLeod tells Tessa that she is stronger than Anne, and that if something happened to him she would be fine, Tessa retorts, [...] "You <b>only</b> <b>think</b> so because it suits you." [...] The murderer is Chief Police Officer Andrew Ballin (Tom Butler) who is beheaded by MacLeod after Ballin failed to kill Tessa.|$|E
500|$|O'Neill {{was highly}} {{regarded}} for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said [...] "once set {{he was the}} most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see—he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would <b>only</b> <b>think</b> of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers—you can't really describe how good they were." [...] His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was [...] "one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say [...] "the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant" [...] Wisden opined that [...] "A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power." ...|$|E

500|$|Poe {{considered}} the hoax {{an opportunity to}} prove that Bostonians did not know good literature. Based on critical reaction, he believed he was right. The editor of the Boston Courier reviewed [...] "The Messenger Star" [...] as [...] "an elegant and classic production, based on the right principles, containing the essence of true poetry, mingled with a gorgeous imagination". When Poe claimed that he wrote the poem before he had turned 12, Cornelia Wells Walter of the Boston Evening Transcript wrote of her shock: [...] "A poem delivered before a literary association of adults, as written by a boy! <b>Only</b> <b>think</b> of it!" [...] It is unclear how old Poe {{was at the time}} he wrote the poem because, in part, he frequently changed his claim. Lewis Gaylord Clark said Poe's age at writing the poem was irrelevant and, though he admitted the audience did not know the author's age, [...] "they only knew it was sad stuff". Modern biographer Daniel Stashower compared Poe's stunt with the story [...] "The Imp of the Perverse", in which Poe wrote about [...] "an earnest desire to tantalize a listener... The speaker is aware that he displeases." ...|$|E
500|$|Abductive logic {{has three}} parts. First, {{there is the}} {{surprising}} fact—also called the result—that both Mulder and Scully are hallucinating, despite not taking any drugs. Second, there is Scully's hypothesis—the rule—that, {{if it were true}} the hallucination [...] "would be a matter of course". Third, there is the conclusion—the case—that [...] "there is a reason to suspect [...] as true." [...] This abduction, Abrams and Cooke point out, is an example of creative abduction, because Scully manages to pull three, separate ideas [...] "creatively" [...] together. Mulder, however, next makes an abductive conclusion. While discussing the events with Skinner, he states that he is not convinced, because drugs do not wear off only when one notices their effects. This abduction also has three parts. The result is the surprising fact that Mulder and Scully's escape seems problematic. The rule is that Mulder and Scully <b>only</b> <b>think</b> that they have escaped, but they really are still underground and being digested. Finally, the case states that [...] "there is reason to suspect that" [...] Mulder and Scully have not escaped from the mushroom. This type of logic is an example of undercoded abduction, because it is the most plausible rule among many.|$|E

2500|$|In {{interview}}s, Walcott {{has both}} affirmed and denied that Omeros {{is tied to}} the epic form. [...] In one interview he stated that it was a type of epic poem, but in another interview he said the opposite, stating as part of his evidence that there are no epic-like battles in his poem. [...] In Omeros Walcott implies that he has never read Homer, which is probably untrue based on the character names derived from Homer. Walcott's denial of his poem being tied too heavily to the epic form may stem from his concern that people might <b>only</b> <b>think</b> of it as being an epic-influenced poem instead of transcending the epic genre.|$|E
2500|$|Loos {{returned}} to California just as Griffith, {{who wanted to}} make longer films, was leaving Triangle, and she joined director and future husband John Emerson for a string of successful Douglas Fairbanks films. Loos and company realized that Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatics were an extension of his effervescent personality and parlayed his natural athletic ability into swashbuckling adventure roles. His Picture in the Papers (1916) was noted for its wry style of discursive and witty subtitles: [...] "My most popular subtitle introduced {{the name of a}} new character.
