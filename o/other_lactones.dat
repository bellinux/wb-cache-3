40|$|Autografts are the {{orthopedic}} “gold standard” for repairing bone voids. Autografts are osteoconductive {{and do not}} elicit {{an immune}} response, but they {{are in short supply}} and require a second surgery to harvest the bone graft. Allografts are currently the most common materials used for the repair of segmental defects in hard tissue. Unlike autografts, allografts can cause an undesirable immune response and the possibility of disease transmission is a major concern. As an alternative to the above approaches, recent research efforts have focused on the use of composite materials made from hydroxyapatite (HA) and bioresorbable polymers, such as poly-L-lactide (PLLA). Recent results have shown that the surface hydroxides on HA can initiate the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of L-lactide and <b>other</b> <b>lactones</b> creating a composite with superior interfacial strength. ^ This thesis demonstrates that the surface of porous biologically derived HA substrates, such as coralline HA and trabecular bone, can be used to initiate the ROP of L-lactide and <b>other</b> <b>lactones</b> from the vapor phase. This process increases the strength of the porous scaffold through the deposition of a thin, uniform polymer coating, while maintaining the porous structure. The kinetics of the chemical vapor deposition polymerization (CVDP) are described using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The reaction temperature and monomer vapor pressure are found to affect the rate of the polymerization. Also described in this thesis is the preparation of a porous polymer scaffold that mimics the structure of demineralized bone matrix (DBM). This demineralized bone matrix simulant (DBMS) is created using anorganic bovine bone as a template to initiate the polymerization of various lactones, followed by the removal of the HA scaffold. This material retained its shape and exhibits mechanical properties superior to DBM. Finally it is shown that HA can be used to initiate the ROP of å-caprolactam and the biocompatibility of various HA/bioresorbable polymer composites are described through the use of cell cultures run in collaboration with a research group specializing in immunology. ...|$|E

Although stirred tanks (STR) are the most common industrial bioreactors used for aerobic fermentations, agitation conditions tend to cause some shearing stress to the cells. This can be prevented using aeration as driving force to promote agitation that is the principle of airlift reactors. This work analyses the influence of agitation (mechanical or pneumatic) and oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) on γ-decalactone production by Y. lipolytica in a biphasic culture medium with CO as substrate. Y. lipolytica has the ability of performing the biotransformation of ricinoleic acid (the major fatty acid of CO), into γ-decalactone through peroxisomal β-oxidation.

Intraspecies materials are often in short supply and interspecies materials are subject to immunological barriers such as disease and tissue rejection. Synthetic composites are unencumbered by these limitations. Poly lactic acid (PLLA) and its copolymers have been used in medicine due to their ability to be resorbed by the body without adverse effects. PLLA’s are currently most commonly used in resorbable sutures and gauzes, but there is increasing interest in using them in conjunction with hydroxyapatite (HA) as bioceramics for hard tissue replacement. Early attempts to create a viable PLLA/HA involved dispersing HA particles in a PLLA matrix. There are well defined phase transitions in these types of mixtures. These transitions readily become material failures when placed under stresses or strains. Fortunately the surface hydroxyls on HA can serve as an effective initiator for the ring-opening-polymerization of lactide and <b>other</b> <b>lactones</b> of biological interest. I have shown that bioceramics made in this manner produce materials with superior interfacial strength and that mammalian sources of HA can be used to prepare biomimetic materials that further enhance the physical properties of the resulting composites.

Experiments designed to elucidate the influence of these parameters on reaction rate reveal that two competing processes determine the polymerization rates. Firstly, specific surface area decreases with sintering time, and since the polymerization is initiated by surface nucleophiles, decreased surface areas give slower polymerization rates. Secondly, thermal decomposition of carbonate to oxide or hydroxide generates nucleophiles in the HA during sintering, resulting in increased heterogeneous rate constants. I have also performed preliminary tests to examine the basic physical properties that these composites possess. ...|$|E

PHAs were produced using a lipase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of the corresponding lactones. Poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate), PHB, was obtained in up to 89 % yield with a degree of polymerization of 3 [...] 12. Polymerization of <b>other</b> <b>lactones,</b> including beta-propiolactone, gamma-butyrolactone, and e -caprolactone, also yielded the corresponding polyesters in good yields with degrees of polymerization up to 25. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy was used to characterize the polymer products. The growth and kinetics of PHB granules produced in an in vitro polymerization were studied using TEM and CRYO-TEM in conjunction with image analysis. The in vitro reaction was confirmed to be a pseudoemulsion polymerization. The average granule diameter and volume increased with reaction time while the number of granules fell throughout the reaction due to coalescence. Basic kinetic parameters including KM, Vmax, and the rate constants of polymerization were determined and compared to those obtained for the in vivo biosynthesis of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate). With the aim of improved understanding of the mechanism of depolymerase action on water insoluble crystalline PHAs, folded chain lamellar single crystals of PHAs were partially degraded with PHA depolymerases and examined using TEM. Enzymatically degraded single crystals of bacterial PHB were found to be splintered by PHB-depolymerase A from Pseudomonas lemoignei parallel to their long axes into a needle-like morphology. These results support an "edge attack" model for the degradation of PHB single crystals and suggest that PHB-depolymerase A has both endo and exo activity. A further study was performed using single crystals of a number of PHAs which were partially degraded with depolymerases from Pseudomonas lemoignei and examined by TEM. In contrast to previous results with single crystals of bacterial PHB, the predominant effect observed with all crystals was a significant narrowing of the lamellae. This suggests an edge attack mechanism which because of lateral disorder of the crystals (caused by the introduction of valerate or repeat units of opposite stereochemistry) leads to a narrowing of the crystalline lamellae as opposed to the splintering effect previously observed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis reports studies {{into the}} {{ring-opening}} polymerisation (ROP) of large ring lactones (macrolactones) and e-substituted e-lactones (eSLs). Additionally, the copolymerisations of these monomers with <b>other</b> <b>lactones</b> were investigated {{in order to}} determine the conditions that define the sequencing of lactone copolymers. The ability to produce one-pot lactone copolymers with tuneable properties is explored and carried forward to introduce functional groups for post-polymerisation functionalisation. The ability to produce sequence controlled block copolymers using only lactone monomers is also outlined for the first time in this thesis. Chapter 1 provides an overview for the current published literature on the ROP of macrolactones, including the factors that affect macrolactone polymerisation and copolymerisation with a variety of other monomers. In Chapter 2, the ‘immortal’ ROP (iROP) of the macrolactone, ω-pentadecalactone (PDL), is demonstrated with the use of a Mg catalyst. The technique is shown to be achievable in a non-inert environment, with no undesired side reactions affecting the properties of the final polymers compared to polymers produced in an inert environment. Furthermore, the catalyst is demonstrated to be able to ‘immortally’ polymerise smaller ring lactones. Chapter 3 describes the copolymerisation of PDL with a variety of lactones of smaller ring-sizes. The sequencing of the copolymers is characterised throughout the copolymerisation using quantitative 13 C NMR spectroscopy and demonstrates the randomisation of the polymer sequencing in each case. The thermal and crystalline properties of the copolymers is explored and optimised in order to produce PDL copolymers with independently tuneable thermal and degradative properties. In Chapter 4, the copolymerisation of PDL with the eSL, menthide (MI), is examined and shown to produce a copolymer with a block-like sequencing. This sequencing is demonstrated in the case of PDL copolymerisation with other eSL monomers. This discovery is then used in order to produce a block copolymer of PDL with an alkene functionalised eSL. The ability of this copolymer to undergo post-polymerisation modification is demonstrated through thiol-ene addition onto the pendent alkene groups. Chapter 5 goes on to use MI in copolymerisations with other non-substituted lactones {{in order to determine}} the factors that affect the sequencing of eSL copolymers. The production of macrolactone/eSL copolymers with a random sequencing is then attempted. The sequencing of copolymers produced from two eSLs is also demonstrated to produce block-like copolymers. As a consequence of the large difference in reactivity between eSLs, the potential for sequence controlled lactone copolymers is established. A general summary of Chapters 2 - 5 is presented in Chapter 6, with the concluding findings outlined. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{half-life}} of N-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C 6 -HSL) {{was determined}} under various pH and temperature conditions, {{and in several}} plant environments. C 6 -HSL was sensitive to alkaline pH, a process that was also temperature-dependent. In addition, C 6 -HSL disappeared from plant environments, i. e. axenic monocot and dicot plants cultivated under gnotobiotic, hydroponic conditions, albeit with variable kinetics. The disappearance was rapid at the root system of legume plants such as clover or Lotus, and slow or non-existent at the root system of monocots such as wheat or corn. These variable kinetics were not dependent upon pH changes that may have affected the growth media of the plants. Furthermore, C 6 -HSL did not accumulate in the plant, and the plant did not produce inhibitors of the C 6 -HSL signal. HPLC analyses revealed that C 6 -HSL disappeared from the media, and hence, Lotus exhibited a natural C 6 -HSL inactivating ability. This ability was not specific for C 6 -HSL and allowed the degradation of <b>other</b> N-acyl-homoserine <b>lactones</b> such as 3 -oxo-C 6 -HSL, 3 -oxo-octanoyl-HSL and 3 -oxo-decanoyl-HSL. Preliminary investigation revealed that the inactivating ability is temperature-dependant and possibly of enzymatic origin...|$|R
40|$|Artemisinin-based {{combination}} therapies (ACTs) {{are currently}} the recommended treatment for uncomplicated and severe cases of malaria. [1] Additionally, artemisinins, {{as well as}} a number of <b>other</b> sesquiterpene <b>lactones</b> (SLs), are currently in phase I–II clinical trials against breast, colorectal and nonsmall-cell lung cancers. [2] As outlined by the iron-dependent activation hypothesis,[3] the activity of artemisinin (ART) is dependent on the endoperoxide bridge. [4] The peroxide is cleaved by endogenous sources of FeII to generate highly reactive carbon-centred radicals (CCRs), which are believed to react with critical cellular targets. [3] ART demonstrates selectivity towards rapidly proliferating cancer cell lines that possess a high intracellular iron content required to sustain their characteristic high rates of multiplication. [5] Iron activation links this particular potency of ART towards rapidly proliferating cancer cell lines; differentiation between healthy and cancerous cells by variation of iron concentration provides a strategy for selective cytotoxicity by ART and its derivatives. [4] The mechanism by which ART exerts its cytotoxic activity still remains elusive. ART acts by disruption of proliferation,[6, 7] oxidative stress,[8] anti-angiogenesis,[9] NF-kB signalling,[10] apoptosis[4] and interfering with iron uptake and metabolism. [6] ART also induces DNA breakage,[11] and it has been reported that artesunate-mediated DNA damage contributes to its therapeutic efficacy...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi with plant roots {{is the oldest}} and ecologically most important symbiotic relationship between higher plants and microorganisms, yet the mechanism by which these fungi detect {{the presence of a}} plant host is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that roots secrete a branching factor (BF) that strongly stimulates branching of hyphae during germination of the spores of AM fungi. In the BF of 					Lotus, a strigolactone was found to be the active molecule. Strigolactones are known as germination stimulants of the parasitic plants 					Striga and 					Orobanche. In this paper, we show that the BF of a monocotyledonous plant, 					Sorghum, also contains a strigolactone. Strigolactones strongly and rapidly stimulated cell proliferation of the AM fungus 					Gigaspora rosea at concentrations as low as 10 					− 13 M. This effect was not found with <b>other</b> sesquiterperne <b>lactones</b> known as germination stimulants of parasitic weeds. Within 1 h of treatment, the density of mitochondria in the fungal cells increased, and their shape and movement changed dramatically. Strigolactones stimulated spore germination of two other phylogenetically distant AM fungi, 					Glomus intraradices and 					Gl. claroideum. This was also associated with a rapid increase of mitochondrial density and respiration as shown with 					Gl. intraradices. We conclude that strigolactones are important rhizospheric plant signals involved in stimulating both the pre-symbiotic growth of AM fungi and the germination of parasitic plants...|$|R
50|$|The {{isolation}} of arglabin was first reported in 1982 by Adekenov et al. It is {{isolated from the}} epigeal portion of the Artemesia glabella plant, {{also known as a}} smooth wormwood, commonly found in the Kent mountains of Kazakhstan. Arglabin can also be found in A. myiantha, a plant commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Adekenov et. al analyzed chloroform extracts and found that the new sesquiterpene lactone had a melting point of 100-102 °C, a molecular composition of C15H18O3, and α20D +45.6. IR spectroscopy analysis revealed peaks at 1760 cm−1 corresponding to the carbonyl of a γ-lactone and 1660 cm−1 corresponding to C=C. UV spectroscopy reveals absorption at 204 nm with an ε of 19,800 which is characteristic of an exocyclic methylene that is conjugated with the γ-lactone carbonyl. Mass spectroscopy data showed fragments with m/z of 231 which corresponds to a methyl group attached to an epoxide, 213 (M-CH2-H2O)+, 203 (M-CH3-CO)+, and 185 (M-CH3-H2O-CO)+. Further determination of the epoxide was done by opening the epoxide and analyzing it's spectroscopy data. The structure was further elucidated by NMR spectroscopy in CDCl3. The exocyclic methylene was present at 6.10 ppm with J=3 Hz. By using the physiochemical constants and comparing NMR spectra from <b>other</b> sesquitterpene <b>lactones</b> that were isolate, Adekenov et. al proposed the structure and the stereochemistry was confirmed using X-ray crystallography.|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{degrading}} the quorum-sensing (OS) signal molecule N-hexanoylhomoserine lactone {{were isolated}} from a tobacco rhizosphere. Twenty-five isolates degrading this homoserine lactone fell into six groups {{according to their}} genomic REP-PCR and rrs PCR-RFLP profiles. Representative strains from each group were identified {{as members of the}} genera Pseudomonas, Comamonas, Variovorax and Rhodococcus. All these isolates degraded N-acylhomoserine <b>lactones</b> <b>other</b> than the hexanoic acid derivative, albeit with different specificity and kinetics. One of these isolates, Rhodococcus erythropolis strain W 2, was used to quench OS-regulated functions of other microbes. In vitro, W 2 strongly interfered with violacein production by Chromobacterium violaceum, and transfer of pathogenicity in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In planta, R. erythropolis W 2 markedly reduced the pathogenicity of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum in potato tubers. These series of results reveal the diversity of the QS-interfering bacteria in the rhizosphere and demonstrate the validity of targeting OS signal molecules to control pathogens with natural bacterial isolates...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: PON 1 is the best-studied {{member of}} a family of enzymes called serum paraoxonases, or PONs, {{identified}} in mammals (including humans) and other vertebrates as well as in invertebrates. PONs exhibit a range of important activities, including drug metabolism and detoxification of organophosphates such as nerve agents. PON 1 resides on HDL (the “good cholesterol”) and is also involved in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Despite this wealth of activities, the identity of PON 1 ’s native substrate, namely, the substrate for which this enzyme and other enzymes from the PON family evolved, remains unknown. To elucidate the substrate preference and other details of PON 1 mechanism of catalysis, structure-activity studies were performed with three groups of substrates that are known to be hydrolyzed by PON 1 : phosphotriesters, esters, and lactones. We found that the hydrolysis of aryl esters is governed primarily by steric factors and not the pKa of the leaving group. The rates of hydrolysis of aliphatic esters are much slower and show a similar dependence on the pKa of the leaving group to that of the nonenzymatic reactions in solution, while the aryl phosphotriesters show much higher dependence than the respective nonenzymatic reaction. PON 1 -catalyzed lactone hydrolysis shows almost no dependence on the pKa of the leaving group, and unlike all <b>other</b> substrates, <b>lactones</b> seem to differ in their KM rather than kcat values. These, and the relatively high rates measured with several lactone substrates (kcat/KM 106 M- 1 s- 1) imply that PON...|$|R
40|$|Quorum-sensing {{signals are}} found in many species of legume-nodulating rhizobia. In a well-characterized strain of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae, a variety of autoinducers are synthesised, and all have been {{identified}} as N-acyl-homoserine lactones. One of these N-acyl-homoserine lactones, is N-(3 -hydroxy- 7 -cis-tetradecenoyl) -L-homoserine lactone, previously known as small bacteriocin, which inhibits the growth of several R. leguminosarum strains. The cinRI locus is responsible for the production of small bacteriocin. CinR induces cinI in response to the AHL made by CinI, thus forming a positive autoregulatory induction loop. A complex cascade of quorum-sensing loops was characterized, in which the cinIR locus appears to be the master control for three other AHL-dependent quorum-sensing control systems. These systems include the raiI/raiR, traI/triR and rhiI/rhiR. Other rhizobial strains appear to share some of these quorum sensing loci, but not all loci {{are found in}} all strains. Small bacteriocin along with the <b>other</b> N-acyl-homoserine <b>lactones</b> produced by these three AHL-based control systems regulate (i) growth inhibition of sensitive strains, (ii) transfer of the symbiotic plasmid pRL 1 JI, and (iii) expression of the rhizosphere-expressed (rhi) genes that influence nodulation. Some of the genes regulated by these systems have been identified. While the functions of some, such as the trb operon regulated by triR are clear, several of the regulated genes have no homologues of known function. It is anticipated that several other genes regulated by these systems have yet to be identified. Therefore, despite the regulation {{of one of the most}} complex quorum-sensing cascade being understood, several of the functions regulated by the quorum-sensing genes remain to be elucidated.

40|$|Activated carbon (AC) is very {{effective}} for multi-pollutant removal; however, the complicated components in flue gas can influence each other's adsorption. A series of adsorption experiments for multicomponents, including SO 2, NO, chlorobenzene and H 2 O, on AC were {{performed in a}} fixed-bed reactor. For single-component adsorption, the adsorption amount for chlorobenzene was larger than for SO 2 and NO on the AC. In the multi-component atmosphere, the adsorption amount decreased by 27. 6 % for chlorobenzene and decreased by 95. 6 % for NO, whereas it increased {{by a factor of}} two for SO 2, demonstrating that a complex atmosphere is unfavorable for chlorobenzene adsorption and inhibits NO adsorption. In contrast, it is very beneficial for SO 2 adsorption. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) results indicated that the binding strength between the gas adsorbates and the AC follows the order of SO 2 > chlorobenzene > NO. The adsorption amount is independent of the binding strength. The presence of H 2 O enhanced the component effects, while it weakened the binding force between the gas adsorbates and the AC. AC oxygen functional groups were analyzed using TPD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The results reveal the reason why the chlorobenzene adsorption is less affected by the presence of <b>other</b> components. <b>Lactone</b> groups partly transform into carbonyl and quinone groups after chlorobenzene desorption. The chlorobenzene adsorption increases the number of C = 0 groups, which explains the positive effect of chlorobenzene on SO 2 adsorption and the strong NO adsorption.
