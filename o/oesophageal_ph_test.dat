40|$|Twenty four hour {{oesophageal}} intraluminal pH probe {{studies were}} performed in 114 children (range age: one month- 12 years) referred for symptoms or signs compatible with gastroesophageal reflux. Forty five patients had reflux disease alone, 69 had evidence of oesophagitis which was assessed endoscopically and histologically. Recordings were also performed in 63 control patients. The occurrence of reflux was analysed {{for the total}} study period and particularly while awake, asleep, fasting, and during postcibal periods. Oesophageal acid exposure time {{and the number of}} reflux episodes lasting greater than five minutes during the total study period provided the best discrimination between patients and controls; however, 20 % and 30 % of all reflux patients had both normal (with 2 SD of control) acid exposure time and number of long lasting reflux episodes, respectively. Patients with oesophagitis had significantly more acid reflux than those with simple uncomplicated disease during postcibal, fasting, awake periods, but not during sleep; however, increasing severity of oesophagitis was not associated with increasing acid exposure. The ability of the intraluminal <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>test</b> to discriminate patients with various degrees of reflux disease decreased if only postprandial pH variables were taken into account. We conclude that: (1) the 24 hour intraoesophageal pH monitoring may present false negative results that limit overall sensitivity of the test; (2) the presence of oesophagitis {{does not seem to be}} associated with increased oesophageal acid exposure during sleep; (3) limiting the pH recording to postprandial periods reduces the discriminatory power of the test...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine prospectively the rate of cough before and after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication performed for the control of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.  METHODS—One hundred and ninety five consecutive patients (76 men) of mean (SD) age 46. 9 (14. 1) years with proven gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, who were either on long term omeprazole (n = 187) or who had not responded to a trial of omeprazole (n = 8), took part in the study which was carried out in a university teaching hospital that included a regional respiratory referral centre. Patients underwent oesophageal manometry, 24 hour <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> <b>testing,</b> and symptom score evaluation by an independent observer before and six months after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.  RESULTS—One hundred and thirty three patients presented with reflux symptoms and 62 with respiratory symptoms; 68 % of patients complained of cough before surgery (86 % with respiratory symptoms, 60 % with gastrointestinal symptoms). The percentage reflux time in 24 hours fell significantly (p< 0. 0001) from a mean (SD) of 9. 38 (10. 99) % to 1. 22 (2. 92) %, lower oesophageal sphincter tone rose significantly (p< 0. 0001) from a mean (SD) of 7. 71 (5. 90) mm Hg to 21. 74 (10. 84) mm Hg, and the cough score fell from a median value of 8. 0 (IQR 12. 0) to 0 (IQR 3) following surgery. Of the patients with cough, 51 % were cough free after surgery and 31 % improved. The patients with respiratory symptoms had a higher cough score before (median 12. 0 (IQR 5. 5) versus 4. 0 (IQR 8. 75), p< 0. 0001) and after surgery (median 1 (7. 5) versus 0. 0 (IQR 1. 0), p = 0. 0045) than those with gastrointestinal symptoms.  CONCLUSIONS—Patients who present to gastroenterologists with severe reflux commonly complain of cough. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is effective in the control of cough in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, with or without primary respiratory disease. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Monitoring <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> {{conventionally}} detects "acid reflux" (pH {{less than}} 4). The pH of the gastric contents determines {{whether or not}} reflux can be detected.  AIM—To monitor gastric and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> simultaneously {{in order to determine}} the effect of milk feeds on gastric pH and how this would influence interpretation of the <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> record.  METHODS—Milk fed infants for whom <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring was requested underwent simultaneous gastric and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring using a dual channel pH probe.  RESULTS—Twenty of 24 records were technically satisfactory. Mean reflux index was 1. 0 %, range 0. 0 - 4. 0 %. Gastric pH was less than 4 for 24. 5 % (range 0. 6 - 69. 1 %) of the total time. The average time the gastric pH was greater than 4 after feeds was 130 minutes (range 29 - 212 minutes). The corrected reflux index (limited to the time the gastric pH was less than 4) was 2. 6 % (range 0. 0 - 11. 0 %).  CONCLUSION—The pH of the gastric contents may be greater than 4 for prolonged intervals, during which <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring using current criteria cannot detect reflux nor correlate it with clinical events. A low reflux index may reflect prolonged buffering of gastric acidity rather than the absence of reflux. ...|$|R

Over past decades, considerable shifts in thinking about the disease have taken place.

Background: The {{diagnostic}} use of 24 hour <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring {{in infants}} is controversial {{because of the}} impact of feed buffering of gastric acidity. Aim: To re-evaluate the effect of feeding on gastric pH and reflux using multipoint pH measurements. Subjects: Fifteen healthy premature infants fed every four hours. Methods: <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> and intragastric pH at 3, 6, and 9 cm below the lower oesophageal sphincter were simultaneously measured using a four channel pH probe for four hours after bolus feeding. Parameters of pH were compared for the different levels within the stomach. During reflux episodes, the nadir pH was compared with intragastric pH at all levels. Results: The proximal stomach was more significantly buffered by feeding and slower to re-acidify postprandially than the mid and distal stomach (42. 2 % of the time at pH < 4 compared with 58. 7 % and 55. 7 % respectively). During 27 of 62 gastro-oesophageal reflux episodes, nadir <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> was lower than the pH of the proximal stomach but always equal to or higher than the pH of the distal stomach.

40|$|AIMS: The primary aim was {{to assess}} whether there were {{differences}} in symptoms, laboratory data, and oesophageal pH-metry between infants with primary gastro-oesophageal reflux and those with reflux secondary to cows' milk protein allergy (CMPA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 96 infants (mean(SD) age 7. 8 (2. 0) months) with either primary gastro-oesophageal reflux, reflux with CMPA, CMPA only, or none of these (controls) were studied. Symptoms, immunochemical data, and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> were compared between the four groups {{and the effect of}} a cows' milk protein-free diet on the severity of symptoms was also assessed. RESULTS: 14 out of 47 (30 %) infants with gastro-oesophageal reflux had CMPA. These infants had similar symptoms to those with primary gastro-oesophageal reflux but higher concentrations of total IgE and circulating eosinophils (p < 0. 005) and IgG anti-beta lactoglobulin (p < 0. 003).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS—The {{pulmonary}} {{symptoms of}} patients with lung disease may be ascribed to gastro-oesophageal reflux although a causal relationship between acid reflux and coughing or wheezing has not been proved. Does cough cause reflux or does reflux cause cough? The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate 24  hour <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> tracings of asthmatics with gastro-oesophageal reflux to determine the temporal association between acid reflux and coughing or wheezing.  METHODS—The oesophageal tracings of 128  asthmatics from the outpatient clinics who underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, oesophageal manometry, and 24  hour <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring were analysed. Three possible temporal relationships between the occurrence of acid reflux and the occurrence of coughs or wheezes were evaluated: (1) pulmonary symptoms preceding reflux; (2) reflux preceding pulmonary symptoms; and (3) unrelated occurrence of both events.  RESULTS—Of 128  asthmatics, 53  recorded five or more coughs and 19  recorded three or more wheezes during the 24  hour recording period. Mean acid contact time was similar in asthmatics with and without pulmonary symptoms (12. 2  (1. 2) % v 10. 4  (0. 6) %). Of all coughs and wheezes, 46 % and 48 %, respectively, were associated with acid reflux. For the individual asthmatic, the likelihood of reflux induced coughing increased as the number of coughs increased.  CONCLUSIONS—Half of all coughs and wheezes in asthmatics are associated with acid reflux into the oesophagus. While an occasional coughing episode can lead to reflux, it is rather the reflux episode in the vast majority of instances that leads to cough.    Keywords: asthma; gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; erosive oesophagitis; <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring; lung disease; pulmonary symptom...|$|R

Animals Forty Domestic Short Hair laboratory cats, 19 females and 21 males, aged 12 - 15 weeks and weighing 0. 57 - 1. 73 kg (mean 1. 13 +/- SD 0. 26). Methods Kittens were anaesthetized twice, once using the LMA and once the ET. Following induction of anaesthesia with isoflurane in an anaesthetic chamber and intubation of the trachea with the ET or placement of the LMA, a pH-electrode was introduced into the lower oesophagus. Monitoring of the <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> was performed for 45 minutes while anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. At {{the end of the}} experiment, gastric pH was measured. Kittens that had GOR during the experiment were treated with sucralfate, cisapride and ranitidine for 15 days. Results <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> was 6. 51 +/- 0. 76 and gastric pH was 1. 54 +/- 0. 59.

We evaluated prospectively the presence of acid reflux disease, oesophagitis and the accuracy of pH monitoring in the prediction of oesophagitis in a population of irritable infants. A 24 -h <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring with a glass electrode and an upper gastro-intestinal tract endoscopy with grasp biopsies were performed in 60 irritable infants, aged 1 to 6 months, not responding to cow's milk elimination. The 24 -h <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring was considered abnormal in 40 / 60 (66 %) babies and histological oesophagitis was present in 26 / 60 (43 %). In the infants with histological oesophagitis, the reflux index (% of the investigation time with a pH 5 % in 18 / 26 (69 %). Histology of the oesophagus was normal in 22 of the 40 (55 %) infants with an abnormal pH monitoring. The mean reflux index in the group with oesophagitis (12. 20 %) was significantly higher than in the group with normal histology (8. 74) (P = 0. 036), although there was an important overlap. The sensitivity and specificity to predict oesophagitis with a reflux index of 5. 0 % or more was 69. 2 and 35. 3, respectively. There was not a reflux index which could be related to a clinically useful sensitivity and specificity to predict oesophagitis. Conclusion: Acid gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and/or histological oesophagitis were diagnosed in 66 % and 43 % of irritable infants, respectively.

Twenty patients had raised oesophageal acid exposure and reflux symptoms consistent with GORD, and 80 had <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> profiles within the conventional normal range. Forty four of the 80 had severe or moderate reflux symptoms and were classified as having reflux like functional dyspepsia (RFD); 36 had minimal or absent reflux symptoms, and were categorised as having non-reflux dyspepsia (NFD). While <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> profiles lay within the conventional normal range in both functional dyspepsia subgroups, patients with RFD had consistently greater acid exposure values as follows: mean (SEM) total oesophageal acid exposure time, RFD 16. 2 (2. 56) min v NFD 9. 05 (2. 0) min (p < 0. 03); percentage of time with pH < 4, RFD 1. 4 (0. 2) v NFD 0. 8 (0. 2) (p < 0. 03); DeMeester scores, RFD 12. 8 (0. 5) v NFD 11. 4 (0. 4) (p < 0. 03). The RFD group had a pain/reflux event correlation of 23. 8 (5. 3) % v 8. 1 (3. 7) % for the NFD group (p < 0. 01). This study shows that patients with RFD have oesophageal acid exposure that lies below the diagnostic threshold for GORD, but exceeds that of patients with NFD. The high pain/reflux event correlation in RFD, suggests that subthreshold oesophageal acid exposure may be associated with troublesome reflux symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Radiotelemetric {{ambulatory}} 24 hour <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> measurement {{was carried}} out in 17 patients with symptomatic manometrically proven achalasia before and after pneumatic dilatation. Before dilatation an abnormally high percentage acid exposure time was present but typical episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred in only one patient. In nine patients who had a oesophageal food residue these values were significantly greater than those found in the remaining patients without retained food. Analysis of oesophageal food residues revealed that the low pH was predominantly caused by lactic acid. These findings indicate that preoperative <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> studies do not offer a valid means of selection of patients in whom an antireflux procedure should be combined with cardiomyotomy. Repeat studies one week after pneumatic dilatation showed a fall in the acid exposure time in patients with initial food residue presumably resulting from improved oesophageal emptying after treatment. A significant rise in acid exposure time after dilatation was seen in those patients without initial food residue presumably resulting from gastro-oesophageal reflux after therapeutic disruption of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Troublesome symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux were, however, uncommon after bag dilatation...|$|R
40|$|Effect of Helicobacter pylori {{eradication}} on oesophageal peristalsis, lower oesophageal sphincter {{pressure and}} 3 -hour postprandial pH monitoring. INTRODUCTION Helicobacter pylori (Hp) {{has been shown}} to be an aetiological factor in gastrointestinal diseases such as gastritis, peptic ulcer, mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and gastric cancer. Eradication of Hp infection has been recommended to prevent and/or to treat these diseases. Despite the reports that reduced acid secretion related to H. pylori corpus gastritis might protect from reflux oesophagitis and reports of reflux oesophagitis occurring after H. pylori eradication, the pathogenesis and possible relationship of Hp infection with reflux oesophagitis remains controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated oesophageal function amongst Hp infected Greek patients before and after Hp eradication and compared these results to Hp negative Greek patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD). We introduced the 3 -hour postprandial <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring as a more flexible and well tolerable test to evaluate the presence of GORD in this group of patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Hp infection and reflux oesophagitis. This relationship was assessed mainly according to manometric and 3 -hour postprandial <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring findings. ...|$|R
40|$|In 24 h <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring, pH 4 {{is widely}} but {{arbitrarily}} {{used as the}} threshold between reflux and non-reflux pH values. The aim {{of the study was}} to define pH thresholds objectively, based on Gaussian curve fitting of pH frequency distributions. Single-channel 24 h <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring was performed in 26 healthy volunteers and 26 patients with pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux, and five-channel pH-metry was performed in 14 healthy volunteers and 14 patients. The calculated pH thresholds varied between healthy volunteers from 5 center dot 0 to 6 center dot 4 in the upright position and from 4 center dot 5 to 5 center dot 7 in the supine position, but were constant between different oesophageal recording sites. In 15 and nine patients (single-channel and five-channel pH-metry respectively), pH thresholds could not be determined at the distal oesophageal sites. However, the calculated pH thresholds in the proximal oesophagus were in the same range as in the control subjects. The authors conclude that the use of the conventional threshold of pH 4 leads to underestimation of the extent of gastrooesophageal reflux, but are reluctant to advocate the use of higher thresholds in clinical practic...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{simultaneously}} record tracheal and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> in mechanically ventilated {{children to}} determine: (1) the feasibility {{and safety of}} the method; (2) the incidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and pulmonary contamination; and (3) their associated risk factors. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Paediatric intensive care unit in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty mechanically ventilated children (mean age 6. 7 years) who met the following inclusion criteria: endotracheal tube with an internal diameter of 4 mm or more (cuffed or uncuffed), mechanical ventilation for an acute disease, no treatment with antiacids, prokinetics, or H 2 -receptor blockers, and no nasogastric or orogastric tube. METHODS: The tracheal antimony pH probe was positioned 1 cm below the distal end of the endotracheal tube. The <b>oesophageal</b> antimony <b>pH</b> probe was positioned at the lower third of the oesophagus. pH was recorded on a double channel recorder and analysed with EsopHogram 5. 01 software and by examination of the trace. The following definitions were used: GOR index, percentage of time pH 4. 8 %; tracheal reflux, fall in tracheal pH 10 % (p < 0. 01) and were more frequent with a maximal inspiratory pressure of < 25 cm H 2 O (p = 0. 03), but were {{not related to the}} indication for mechanical ventilation, whether the endotracheal tube was cuffed or not, age, or drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous tracheal and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>pH</b> monitoring was feasible in the setting of this study. Tracheal reflux can occur without pathological GOR, and GOR may occur without tracheal reflux. Further prospective studies in larger groups of patients are now justified...|$|R
