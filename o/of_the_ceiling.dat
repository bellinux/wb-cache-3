5|$|Because of {{the height}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and the inaccessibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> frescoes, the precise {{nature of the}} damage and the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and {{the response of the}} restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> has had various interpretations in the past, {{some elements}} {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Along {{the central}} section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> Michelangelo {{depicted}} nine {{scenes from the}} Book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible. The pictures are organized into three groups of three alternating large and small panels.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} is highlighted by decorative elements that fill the spaces, such as columns, the decoration on the walls, floors and <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> <b>The</b> auditorium stresses <b>the</b> grandiosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space, <b>the</b> rhythmic organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balconies, which are highly decorated, in Neo-Baroque elements.|$|R
50|$|Francis Bernasconi, {{acknowledged}} as <b>the</b> greatest designer <b>of</b> fine plasterwork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era, created the magnificent central staircase, that connects all four storeys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central tower. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> were painted by Cornelius Dixon.|$|R
50|$|During {{lunch time}} on Wednesday (28 December), one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> Jurong East {{shopping}} mall Jem was leaking {{for more than}} three hours, leaving water puddles inside the building as reported by Lianhe Zaobao.|$|R
5|$|Cave 16 {{is a small}} dwelling, on a {{slightly}} higher level above cave 15. It has a cell with a bench along its right wall and a veranda, {{which leads to the}} cell through a door. The side walls as well as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> are broken.|$|E
5|$|For {{the central}} section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> Michelangelo has taken four episodes {{from the story}} of Adam and Eve as told in the first, second and third {{chapters}} of Genesis. In this sequence of three, two of the panels are large and one small.|$|E
5|$|Room of Castagnoli: {{named after}} the painter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> frescoes. In this room are exposed Portraits of the Medici and Lorraine ruling families, and the Table of the Muses, a masterwork of stone-inlaid table {{realized}} by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure between 1837 and 1851.|$|E
50|$|Both rooms {{retain their}} early {{skirting}} boards and <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cottage {{is lined with}} plaster - walls, ceilings, partitioning wall and chimney. Much of this is early lathe and plaster work and early cement render, but sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> have been replaced with recent plasterboard sheeting.|$|R

5|$|The Ignudi are the 20 athletic, nude males that Michelangelo painted as {{supporting}} figures at {{each corner}} of the five smaller narrative scenes that run along the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The figures hold or are draped with or lean {{on a variety of}} items which include pink ribbons, green bolsters and enormous garlands of acorns.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> meet.|$|E
50|$|Etruria Hall {{was built}} between 1768-1771 by Joseph Pickford, for Josiah Wedgwood, near his new {{recently}} built, Etruria works. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'ceilings, ornamental friezes and chimney pieces' {{were designed by}} John Flaxman between 1781-1787. An entry in the 1784-1785 Wedgwood company ledger indicates {{that at least one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> was designed by William Blake, although it cannot be certain that this design was ever implemented.|$|R

50|$|During <b>the</b> bombing <b>of</b> January 1945, <b>the</b> triforiums <b>of</b> {{all three}} apses were destroyed. At the same time, <b>the</b> {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central tower sustained a direct hit. In the final bombardment by Allied forces, on March 2, 1945, the city received its heaviest damage. Almost ninety-five percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{buildings in the}} old city were damaged, and at Great Saint Martin, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> in <b>the</b> church had been destroyed, or very badly damaged.|$|R
5|$|The {{narrative}} elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{illustrate that}} God made the World {{as a perfect}} creation and put humanity into it, that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God. Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace, and was punished by the Great Flood. Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity, Christ Jesus. The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world. The various components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> are linked to this Christian doctrine. Traditionally, the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament. Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect {{of the life of}} Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist. Jonah, for example, was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus' death and resurrection.|$|E
5|$|The roof of {{the front}} aisle has panels with murals in the centre {{of male and female}} figurines flying in the clouds; the male figure is yaksha holding a sword and a shield. Decoration of lotus blooms are also seen on the panels. The {{roof of the}} hall is divided into nine panels {{slightly}} above the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The central panel here depicts a deva mounted on a ramconjectured to be Agni. Images of Brahma and Varuna are also painted on the central panels; the floating figures are seen in the remaining panels.|$|E
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of the restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage {{of the process and}} which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
50|$|Four columns {{are used}} for <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and are <b>the</b> only {{remainder}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architectural accents. At <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> each of these columns, save one, sits a large, decorative marble urn. These urns originally sat in the four niches in <b>the</b> Chapel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crematory building but were moved to the columbarium upon cessation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chapel. These urns contain <b>the</b> ashes <b>of</b> four individuals, and they now serve as beautiful focal points for the Columbarium.|$|R
5|$|The house's room {{arrangement}} was planned for convenience and comfort, {{as compared to}} typical English mansions, which often were built with kitchens far from the dining room. Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> three 'Islamic' <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cappella Palatina in Palermo, <b>the</b> royal chapel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman kings <b>of</b> Sicily, were {{commissioned}} by king Roger 11 around 1143. The grandiose muqarnas (stalactite) <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave and <b>the</b> two smaller <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two aisles were {{just one part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opulent, multifaceted decoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal chapel, that included also Byzantine mosaics with Christian scenes and Southern- Italian marble pavements and revetments. As with other medieval chapels <b>of</b> palaces, <b>the</b> Cappella Palatina served concomitantly as a royal audience hall, a thing evidenced by the great throne platform at its west end. <b>The</b> paintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>ceilings</b> present 'Islamic' figural and ornamental decoration and Arabic inscriptions, <b>the</b> salient subject-matter <b>of</b> which is <b>the</b> Islamic royal banquet, the majlis, centered upon the king. The study presents new stylistic and iconographic {{evidence to show that}} <b>the</b> painters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> came mainly from Fatimid Egypt, and that the paintings could reflect also some impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian arts <b>of</b> that country, if not <b>the</b> actual participation <b>of</b> Coptic artists in their production. Despite the predominantly Islamic subject-matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paintings, their imagery was simultaneously enriched with Christian themes, the models for which were likely provided by Romanesque, Middle-Byzantine, and - to a lesser extent - Coptic artwork. Far from being an alien 'Oriental' element incorporated into the otherwise Christian chapel, <b>the</b> designer/s <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel actually sought to manipulate the Islamic princely imagery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> through <b>the</b> insertion <b>of</b> Christian 'triumphal' themes and a few crosses in the paintings. The Christian scenes were, moreover, placed in focal programmatic points at <b>the</b> <b>ceilings,</b> and associated spatially with ceremonial and-liturgical features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel, namely: the royal throne platform at the west end, and the entrance to the sanctuary at the east. The 'Islamicate' - rather than Islamic - ceilings and their imagery were thus adapted to the Christian setting within <b>the</b> palatine chapel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman monarchs.

5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E
5|$|Pietrangeli, in his {{foreword}} to The Sistine Chapel, written {{after the}} restoration of the lunettes, but prior to the restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.|$|E
5|$|Rook Lane Chapel was a noncomformist chapel built between 1705 and 1707 by James Pope. The chapel had {{a gallery}} around three sides and the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was domed and {{supported}} by two Tuscan columns. Rook Lane ceased {{to be used as}} a chapel in 1968 and there followed twenty-five years of neglect. In the early 1990s the building was compulsorily purchased by Somerset County Council and transferred to the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust, which carried out repairs and restorations. In 2001 it was converted by a firm of architects, the ground floor becoming a community hall and arts centre managed by Rook Lane Arts Trust and the galleried upper floor becoming offices for the architectural firm NVB Architects.|$|E

50|$|According to the survey, <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass <b>ceiling</b> is {{extremely}} high. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass <b>ceiling,</b> {{women and minorities}} {{are not able to}} break into higher level positions. This causes a large turnover in employees. So, if they cannot get into a higher position then they will leave the company in order to find a position at another company {{that will allow them to}} be in a higher position. On average this costs a company 150% of an annual salary of a mid-level managerial position.|$|R

5|$|The Sistine Chapel {{was built}} by Pope Sixtus IV within the Vatican {{immediately}} {{to the north of}} St. Peter's Basilica and completed in about 1481. Its walls were decorated by a number of Renaissance painters who were among the most highly regarded artists of late 15th century Italy, including Ghirlandaio, Perugino, and Botticelli. The Chapel was further enhanced under Pope Julius II by the painting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512 and by the painting of the Last Judgment, commissioned by Pope Clement VII and completed in 1541, again by Michelangelo. The tapestries on the lowest tier, today best known from the Raphael Cartoons (painted designs) of 1515–16, completed the ensemble.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence on the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and {{in some of the}} frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
5|$|The gun gallery was {{situated}} in the Recreation Yard and mounted {{on one of the}} dining hall's exterior walls. There was a metal detector outside of the dining hall for security purposes. The dining hall had tear-gas canisters attached to the rafters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> which could be activated by remote control, should prisoners riot or attempt to escape. The first warden, James A. Johnston, always entered the dining hall alone and unarmed, due to heavy guarding around him. Several riots did break out in the dining hall during Alcatraz's history. Those prisoners who were not involved in the fighting hid under the dining hall tables to escape possible gunfire.|$|E
