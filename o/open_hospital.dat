At this time, Queens Hospital Center was considered antiquated, with over 90 {{percent of the}} hospital beds below state health standards, along with overcrowding of hospital wards and shortages of equipment. The large and <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> wards with dozens of beds that Queens General and Triboro Hospital were built with were now in violation of modern health codes. An entire corridor of Triboro Hospital had been flooded in 1971 due to a broken faucet. The city sought to relocate Queens Hospital Center farther south in Jamaica or South Jamaica. Meanwhile, it was proposed to sell or close Triboro Hospital. Queens Hospital was not relocated, due to community opposition and the city's fiscal crisis at that time.|$|E

40|$|To {{speak of}} <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> spaces is to explore, first and foremost, their identity, {{as well as}} their role and their {{function}} in practical terms. Can they be considered ‘places’? Can it be said that the open spaces of today’s hospital structures present characteristics sufficient to qualify them as public spaces? The public that frequents hospital structures has a well-defined identity, consisting of patients, visitors and medical staff, each with its own specific needs and expectations. The spaces in question are not those traditionally found in urban areas, such as squares or streets, nor are they traditional urban parks. The first step towards understanding the nature and the function of <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> spaces, {{in order to be able}} to plan and design them adequately, is to investigate the behaviour and the expectations of the users of such spaces. What is needed is a ‘survey’ of the current conditions and uses of the existing structures, in the form of a critical examination of the behaviour of the people who deal with the distribution of time and spaces in hospitals on a daily basis. Using the approach to analysing human behaviour in open spaces developed by Jan Gehl, an attempt is made to calibrate this methodology to the distinctive characteristics of <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> spaces, in order to arrive at an understanding of their dynamics and, as a result, succeed in adequately fine-tuning the objectives of their design and planning. Quantifying the users in light of their different activities, determining the various categories, identifying the areas where individuals tend to concentrate, observing the activities that predominate in order to gain an understanding of real needs, recording the duration of such activities: these are the goals of a ‘survey’ carried out through an attentive observation and collection of the available data. A number of recent experiences point to a radical change in outlook in the design and planning of hospital structures, with the starting point for such change tied to the increased attention paid to the therapeutic component of their outdoor spaces. An example is what has been done at the John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, as well as recent projects in Europe where the design of open spaces played a key role in the overall planning and design strategies...|$|E

The copy of record {{is available at the}} IET Digital Library. This paper presents empirical results from a measurement campaign to investigate futuristic body-centric medical mesh networks for a hospitalized patient using flexible body-contouring antennas. It studies path loss in a medical environment (in a hospital bed in an <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> ward) for UWB and four narrowband schemes concurrently. It firstly investigates the antenna contouring effects due to mounting the flexible antennas on various body surfaces, then uses statistical analysis to explore optimal body locations for a master node to inform allocation of processing power (assuming point-to-point link from other nodes). Results indicated how the most suitable body location varies depending on the posture and frequency scheme used. Also investigated are best route selections for multi-hop mesh network topologies for opportunistic networking for each of the presented postures and frequencies; this reveals how less hops were required to navigate around the narrowband network compared to UWB which effectively reduces required processing power and data traffic. Understanding how disparate body-centric medical devices communicate with one another in a body-mesh network is instrumental to the strategic and informed development of next generation healthcare patient monitoring solutions...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{possible}} correlations between casual measurements and automatic monitoring analyzed with the chronobiologic technique in hospitalized hypertensive patients. Forty-three patients (24 men and 19 women) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were studied in an <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> ward 5 to 7 days after admission. Meal times, sleep times, and visiting hours were standardized. A clinical value of blood pressure was calculated as the arithmetic mean of three sphygmomanometric measurements taken in the morning (patient seated; 5 -min interval between measurements). Then, a basal value of blood pressure was considered as the lowest systolic and the lowest diastolic blood pressure among six sphygmomanometric measurements obtained every 5 min (patient supine). Noninvasive, automatic recording of blood pressure was also obtained every 15 min for 24 hours by a quasiportable oscillometric instrument. Blood pressure recordings were analyzed according to the "cosinor" method of Halberg. On average, clinical blood pressure was 160 / 96 +/- 14 / 10 mmHg, significantly higher (p less than 0. 005) than either basal blood pressure (150 / 91 +/- 12 / 8 mmHg) or 24 -h recorded blood pressure mesor (144 / 88 +/- 13 / 9 mmHg). The differences were not entirely due to diurnal variations, since morning casual measurements were significantly higher than daytime average blood pressure. A chronobiologic assessment of hypertension in hospitalized patients is more representative of true blood pressure behavior, not only because of the multiple recordings but also because of the absence of an alarm reaction that may trigger a pressor response...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the blood {{pressure}} profile of chronic renal failure in comparison with essential hypertension. Thirty hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure due to non-vascular nephropathies were matched by age, sex, and mean 24 h blood pressure, with 30 patients affected by uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. They were studied in an <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> ward. Diet, meal times, sleep times, and activity schedules were standardized. Noninvasive, automatic, blood pressure recordings were performed for 48 h at sampling intervals of 15 min. The mean 24 h blood pressure almost coincided in the two groups. However, in essential hypertension a mean (+/- SD) nocturnal fall of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found (12. 7 +/- 3. 8 and 12. 9 +/- 4. 8 mm Hg, respectively), while renal patients displayed an average nocturnal increase of 2. 7 +/- 8. 9 mm Hg and 3. 7 +/- 7. 8 (P less than. 001). The renal patients had also higher heart rates, with a significantly blunted nocturnal fall (4. 4 +/- 4. 5 beats/min as compared to 9. 3 +/- 3. 1 beats/min of essential hypertension; P less than. 001). Among the renal patients, the day-night blood pressure changes showed no significant correlation with age, creatinine clearance, hematocrit, nocturnal change in heart rate, or day or night mean blood pressure levels. These data suggest that an abnormal day-night pattern of blood pressure is present in chronic renal failure patients independently from external interfering factors. Hence, casual measurements of blood pressure confined to daytime may underestimate a hypertensive condition associated with chronic renal failure...|$|E
40|$|Davidson et al {{reported}} an excellent study correlating a blunted nocturnal fall in BP with the subsequent decline in renal function. I would like {{to mention that the}} loss or reversal of the physiologic nocturnal fall in BP was demonstrated many years ago in chronic kidney disease, independently from external interfering factors. Patients with chronic nephropathies and patients with essential hypertension were matched by age, sex, and mean 24 -hour BP values. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed in an <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> ward for 48 hours at 15 -minute sampling intervals after standardization of diet, meal times, sleep times, and activity schedules. In essential hypertension, the nocturnal fall in BP was preserved as in normal conditions, whereas patients with renal impairment displayed blunted or reversed nocturnal BP and heart rate patterns. Hence, it appeared that casual measurements of BP confined to daytime may underestimate a hypertensive condition associated with chronic kidney disease. Increased sympathetic tone related to renal impairment was proposed {{to play a role in}} such a finding. Some years later, however, a polysomnographic study using continuous BP monitoring with a Finapres device (Finapres Medical Systems BV, Amsterdam, the Netherland) showed that nondipping status is also present in a minority (15 %) of essential hypertensive patients and is strictly associated with undiagnosed sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by apneic snoring. Furthermore, only continuous BP recording during the night allowed the proper identification of the nondipping condition, since a notable proportion of cases were miscategorized as nondipping by ambulatory BP monitoring. It appeared that polysomnography is necessary to differentiate sleep apnea from other possible underlying mechanisms. In view of the higher amount of target organ damage, which is to be expected in patients with nondipping status (including the renal function deterioration reported by Davidson et al), and the high prevalence of undiagnosed sleep-related breathing disorder in the adult population, the recommendation that one should incorporate an assessment of the subject’s sleep history into the routine diagnostic screening of any type of hypertension seems justified...|$|E

Detta har lett till att vårdavdelningar överbeläggs, vilket hittills lösts bland annat genom att utlokalisera patienter till andra avdelningar än den dit de egentligen tillhör. Följande studie behandlar olika aspekter relaterade till vården av dessa patienter, även kallade satellitpatienter. Syfte: Syftet med studien var att beskriva sjuksköterskors erfarenheter av att vårda satellitpatienter. Metod: En intervjustudie med deduktiv ansats genomfördes, där data samlades in via semistrukturerade intervjuer med åtta sjuksköterskor. Intervjuerna spelades in, transkriberades och analyserades slutligen utifrån Hsieh och Shannons beskrivning av kvalitativ innehållsanalys. Resultat: Sex huvudkategorier har identifierats; Effekter av att utlokalisera patienter, Kommunikation mellan vårdgivare, Vårdpersonalens kompetens, Arbetsmiljö, Teamarbete samt Förslag till förbättringar.

This study’s background presents a variety of aspects related to these patients’ care, who sometimes also are called satellite patients. Aim: To describe nurses’ experiences of caring for satellite patients. Method: An interview study with a deductive approach has been conducted. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews with eight registered nurses. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and lastly analyzed from Hsieh and Shannon’s description of qualitative content analysis. Result: Six categories were identified; Effects of Outlocating Patients, Communication Between Caregivers, Competence Among Nursing Staff, Work Environment, Teamwork and Suggestions for Improvement. Together, these describe the nurses’ experiences of caring for satellite patients. Conclusion: Nurses’ experiences of caring for these patients were mainly characterized by a concern for patient safety. The participants also mentioned that nurses’ work environment and work terms needs to improve in order to <b>open</b> <b>hospital</b> beds, reduce the number of satellite patients and thereby maintain a safe and equivalent care. ...|$|E
