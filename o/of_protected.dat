5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival.

5|$|The Nino Bixio {{class was}} a pair <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> cruisers built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the 1910s. The two ships, , and , were built in Castellammare between 1911 and 1914. They were {{intended}} to serve as scouts for the main Italian fleet, and as such required a high top speed. They were overweight as built, which prevented them from reaching their intended maximum speed. They were a disappointment in service, especially compared to the earlierand fastercruiser , which cut their careers short.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{found in the}} spring, often on duff under {{conifers}} shortly after the snow melts. In North America, {{where it has been}} noted to occur only between March and July, it is widespread in the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest. C.fulgens has been collected in Britain, and possibly arrived there from imported infected seeds. It has also been collected from Japan, Sweden, The Netherlands, and Turkey. It is listed on the Red List <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> species in Slovakia.|$|E
5|$|Various {{conservation}} {{techniques are}} employed {{to prevent these}} extinctions, including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure, the establishment <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas to prevent further habitat loss, the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild (ex situ conservation), and the translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations.|$|E
5|$|During the {{considerations}} {{prior to}} the establishment of the national park, there was a conflict with the mining industry. Svalbard Minerals had found baryte within the national park borders, and Arktikugol holds two mining claim areas just south of the national park. The national park was established on 9 September 2005. It completed a several-year-long plan to increase the amount <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas of Svalbard from 55% to 65%, which had two years earlier resulted in Nordenskiöld Land National Park, Sassen – Bünsow Land National Park and Nordre Isfjorden National Park.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up {{a status}} survey and {{conservation}} action plan for dragonflies. This proposes the establishment <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas {{around the world and}} the management of these areas to provide suitable habitat for dragonflies. Outside these areas, encouragement should be given to modify forestry, agricultural, and industrial practices to enhance conservation. At the same time, more research into dragonflies needs to be done, consideration should be given to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the Indian {{economy was}} the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by {{purchasing}} power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India {{became one of}} the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country. However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption, malnutrition, and inadequate public healthcare. A nuclear weapons state and regional power, it has the third largest standing army in the world and ranks fifth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal republic governed under a parliamentary system and consists of 29 states and 7 union territories. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society and is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> habitats.|$|E
5|$|It {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which means it is not {{considered}} threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found in a number <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. The IUCN lists it as a species of least concern, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.|$|E

5|$|It may {{always have}} been thinly spread, {{but there has been}} {{widespread}} deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Parks are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.|$|E
5|$|Like most of Southern California, the {{majority}} of San Diego's current area was originally occupied by chaparral, a plant community made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. The endangered Torrey pine has the bulk of its population in San Diego in a stretch <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> chaparral along the coast. The steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create {{a number of different}} habitats within the city limits, including tidal marsh and canyons. The chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire, and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century, due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.|$|E
5|$|N. menagensis {{is listed}} in CITES Appendix I, which {{prevents}} international commercial trade; it is also protected by Indonesian law. The species is often confused with other slow lorises in animal rescue centers, as it is not well-covered in field guides. The species occurs in a number <b>of</b> <b>protected</b> areas throughout its range, including some fragmented forests. Threats to the species include the illegal local exotic pet trade and habitat loss due to burning and conversion to palm oil plantations. Additionally, uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also {{a threat to the}} species.|$|E
