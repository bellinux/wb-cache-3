25|$|After two near-fatal overdoses, Phillips voluntarily entered Fair Oaks Hospital {{to undergo}} treatment. After she {{completed}} treatment in 1981, {{the producers of}} <b>One</b> <b>Day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> invited {{her back to the}} show. However, in 1982, Phillips resumed her cocaine use and the following year, she collapsed on the show's set. When she refused to take a drug test, she was fired again, this time for good. Her character was written out of the series. In 1992, she entered a long-term drug rehabilitation program and underwent intensive treatment for nine months.|$|E
25|$|Phillips gained stardom in the 1970s, {{when she}} played boy-crazy {{teenager}} Julie Cooper (when the character got married, her married name was Horvath) on the long-running television show <b>One</b> <b>Day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time,</b> {{for which she}} earned $50,000 a week. During the show's third season in 1977, Phillips was arrested for disorderly conduct. Because of her drug and alcohol abuse, Phillips began arriving late and was even incoherent for rehearsals. The producers ordered her to take a six-week break to overcome her addiction but were ultimately forced to fire her in 1980.|$|E
25|$|With season two, {{the series}} moved up {{an hour to}} the Wednesday 9:00pm time slot, where it stayed for three years. During that time, the series competed with such popular shows as <b>One</b> <b>Day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time,</b> The Jeffersons, and Diff'rent Strokes. The {{transition}} from Fawcett to Cheryl Ladd in the second season proved to be popular with viewers. While viewership dipped marginally in the second season, the series still remained {{in the top five}} for the 197778 season, placing fourth in the ratings, tying with 60 Minutes and All in the Family. In the third season, viewership stabilized, but the series began losing traction as it ranked twelfth behind newcomers Mork & Mindy, The Ropers, and Taxi for the 197879 season. With Jackson's departure and Shelley Hack entering the cast, the show's fourth season saw some ratings erosion as it ranked seventeenth for the 197980 season.|$|E

500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{models from}} the Date and Datejust are almost identical, however the Datejust have 36mm and 41mm cases {{paired with a}} 20mm bracelet, {{compared}} to the Date's 34mm case and 19mm bracelet. Modern versions of the Oyster Perpetual Date and Datejust models share Rolex's 3135 movement, with the most recent change to the 3135 movement being the introduction of Rolex's [...] "parachrom bleu" [...] hairspring, which provides increased accuracy. As the Date and Datejust share a movement, both {{have the ability to}} adjust the date forward <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> without adjusting the time; this feature is not confined to the Datejust. Compared to the Date, the Datejust has a much wider range of customization options, including other metals beyond stainless steel, various materials for the dial, and optional diamonds on the dial and bezel. The Datejust II, which was released in 2009, has a bigger case (41mm diameter) than the standard Datejust and it also features an updated movement, being only available in steel with white, yellow or rose gold on an Oyster bracelet. In 2016, Rolex released the Datejust 41, which has the same 41mm diameter case as the Datejust II, however the Datejust 41 has smaller indexes and a thinner bezel compared to the Datejust II.|$|E
