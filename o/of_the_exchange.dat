5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades.

5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Exchange</b> and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to {{have been made in the}} late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under the central part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Exchange.</b> Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|Internally, however, it {{consisted}} of various spaces. On {{either side of the}} front entrance in Corn Street were a coffeehouse and tavern, each of four storeys. Above and below the main entrance were rooms designed as strongrooms. In the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Exchange</b> was an open court, surrounded by a colonnade. At the back of the building was a two-storey range, consisting of an arcade on the ground floor and a long first-floor room. Facing All Saints Lane were two four-storey houses for business or trades persons, and on the frontage to Exchange Avenue were a further three houses. Below these various elements were cellars. Those below the five houses were each separate; the others were mostly interconnected.|$|E

NY345 was realigned two years later to follow old NY56A to Potsdam {{as a result of a}} highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and St. Lawrence County.

During World War II, Calleia led the Malta War Relief organization in the U.S. The house {{where he was born}} was destroyed in 1942; his family took refuge underground, in ancient catacombs, during the near-constant aerial bombing of Malta by the Axis powers that continued for more than two years. Under the auspices of the Motion Picture Division of USO Camp Shows, he made personal appearances at U.S. military facilities in 1943. He also accepted an invitation from the Hollywood Victory Committee to make a tour of military camps in North Africa, particularly because the tentative itinerary included Malta. On the 20,000-mile trip Calleia and his small troupe entertained service personnel in Natal, Dakar, along the coast to Casablanca and across to Tunis before going to Malta, which Calleia had not visited since 1922. They gave two shows a day and visited all of the hospitals at each stop; and they presented six shows in Malta as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> program between U.S. and British entertainment units.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde {{resigned}} {{as vice president}} and was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1991, and re-elected in 1995. He ran for president in 1999, being defeated by Fernando de la Rúa. De la Rúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Congress appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodríguez Saá as president. When Rodríguez Saá also resigned, Congress appointed Duhalde. During Duhalde's term in office, a huge currency devaluation and an increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> rate led to a gradual recovery. He successfully supported the obscure candidate Néstor Kirchner against Menem, who sought a new presidential term. Duhalde had political disputes with Kirchner in later years, and is largely retired from politics since his defeat in the 2011 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Forster's force landed {{near the}} American-occupied fort on May 18, and sent in {{a demand for}} surrender.

During the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exchange,</b> Forster received word that Sherburne had crossed the Ottawa River from the island of Montreal to Quinze-Chênes, but, believing The Cedars to have fallen already, had retreated back across the river. This news caused the besiegers to redouble their efforts the next day. Additional help arrived for the British {{in the form of}} about 40Canadiens under Jean-Baptiste Testard de Montigny; Forster sent them to harass Sherburne. Word then came to Forster that Sherburne had resumed his advance; Butterfield, unaware of this, surrendered the fort. The terms of capitulation included a guarantee of the personal safety of the captured men. The Iroquois plundered the fort's stores, and denied some of the captives small pouches of sometimes valuable personal items.|$|E

As he is being interrogated, another ransom demand for Jhilmil is made and she is apparently killed in the process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exchange,</b> though her body is never found. In order to conclude the case, the police try to frame Barfi for Jhilmil's murder. Policeman Sudhanshu Dutta, who grew fond of Barfi after investigating him for his nuisances, asks Shruti to take him away, offering him a second chance at life. She agrees and hopes that now Jhilmil is gone, she can finally be with Barfi.|$|E

5|$|By 1950, Boosey & Hawkes was {{a leading}} {{international}} music company with an extensive catalogue of serious composers and offices in Bonn, Johannesburg, New York, Paris, Toronto and Sydney. However, from the late 1940s, strains had begun {{to appear in the}} relationship between Leslie Boosey and Ralph Hawkes, and this led to factions supporting each man forming in the company. It was discovered that Hawkes had borrowed capital of £100,000 during the war without the permission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exchange</b> control authorities, and Boosey was forced to clear up the situation at great personal cost. Hawkes secretly wanted to buy out the music publishing side of the business and manage it from New York, leaving Boosey in London with the musical instrument business which Hawkes found dull. However, he died suddenly on 8 September 1950, and representation of his faction was taken over by his flamboyant but unreliable brother Geoffrey who spent much of the company's money on ventures such as the manufacture of mouth organs and ovens, which failed. Geoffrey Hawkes also sold shares in the company to fund his philandering, {{to the point that the}} company was forced to go public to raise cash. Leslie Boosey allowed Geoffrey his turn as chairman, but within two years the profitable company was on the brink of insolvency and Geoffrey Hawkes died of leukaemia in 1961.|$|E

40|$|I {{show that}} the {{empirical}} impulse response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>exchange</b> rate is hump-shaped. This fact can explain why {{a number of recent}} authors have been unable to match <b>the</b> persistence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>exchange</b> rate using sticky-price business cycle models driven by monetary shocks. <b>The</b> key failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> models used in the recent literature is that they yield monotonic impulse responses for <b>the</b> real <b>exchange</b> rate. While it is extremely difficult for models that have this feature to match <b>the</b> empirical persistence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>exchange</b> rate, models that yield hump-shaped impulse responses for <b>the</b> real <b>exchange</b> rate can easily match <b>the</b> empirical persistence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>exchange</b> rate.

This model can match <b>the</b> half-life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>exchange</b> rate as well as and <b>the</b> humped shape <b>of</b> its impulse response. ...|$|R
