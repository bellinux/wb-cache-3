HM Treasury subscribed for £5billion in preference shares and underwrote the issuance of £15bn of new <b>ordinary</b> <b>shares</b> offered to RBS shareholders and new institutional shareholders at the fixed price of 65.5p. As a consequence of the mismanagement which necessitated this rescue, the chief executive, Fred Goodwin (who secured the takeover of NatWest), offered his resignation, which was duly accepted. Chairman Sir Tom McKillop also confirmed he would stand down from that role when his contract expired in 2009. Goodwin was replaced by Stephen Hester, previously chief executive of British Land.|$|E

25|$|Attempts to {{sell the}} mine, or its assets, came to nothing.

25|$|After {{a change}} of {{government}} in 1997, the Labour administration decided to keep the Post Office state-owned but with more commercial freedom. This led to the Postal Services Act 2000, where the Post Office became a public limited company in which the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry owned 50,004 <b>ordinary</b> <b>shares</b> plus 1 special share, and the Treasury Solicitor held 1 ordinary share. The company was renamed Consignia plc in 2001 and the new name was intended {{to show that the}} company did more than deliver mail; however, the change was very unpopular with both the public and employees.

25|$|Efforts {{were made}} to {{regularise}} the financial position of the company, but it was unable to escape from its difficulty and went into receivership {{for a second time}} in 1889. By then it had become obvious that continuing inaction was impossible, and discussion had taken place with the Great Western Railway with a view to the larger company buying the Wye Valley concern. The unsatisfactory situation dragged on, and finally in December 1904 the sale was agreed. The GWR was to pay 2.5% of face value on <b>ordinary</b> <b>shares,</b> and 12.5% on preference shares. Ordinary shareholders had thus lost nearly all their money. The sale took formal effect on 1 July 1905. As the GWR had been working the line from the beginning, there was no obvious outward change so far as the travelling public were concerned.|$|E

25|$|Independent {{television}} {{was introduced to}} Britain in September 1955. Initially only available in the London region, commercial television steadily became available in other regions. After a financially difficult time for the first ITV companies, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) decided to offer independent television {{to the rest of}} the country and advertised for bids. Several offers were submitted, including from the existing four companies, to the ITA. North East England was the last of the English regions without a television transmitter. Sir Richard Pease headed a local consortium that included film producer Sydney Box and News Chronicle executives George and Alfred Black. This consortium, was chosen from among eleven applicants because of its strong local links, commitment to local programming, concentrating on regional topical matters, and educational and children's programmes. The contract was awarded on 12 December 1957. Experienced television executive Anthony Jelly was appointed as managing director, although historian Andrew Spicer credits the Black brothers as the driving force and public face of Tyne Tees; George was programme director, and both brothers were prominent board members. The company opened its first Newcastle office at Bradburn House on Northumberland Street, and it was from there, on 3 January 1958, the company directors issued 300,000 <b>ordinary</b> <b>shares</b> at fours shillings each.|$|E

500|$|In 1855, {{the first}} full year after opening, the Great North of Scotland {{declared}} a dividend of [...] per cent, which rose to [...] the following year and 5 per cent in 1859. The dividend reached a maximum of [...] per cent in 1862 before dropping to 7 per cent the following year and 5 per cent in 1864, but in 1865 the directors could not pay any dividend on <b>ordinary</b> <b>shares.</b> At the directors' suggestion a committee {{was set up to}} look into their actions; the report's main recommendation was the abandonment of the Port Gordon extension. The opening of direct route over the Highland Railway to the south had lost the through mail business, resulting in the withdrawal of Sunday services, and had lost revenue equivalent to a five per cent dividend. Joining the Clearing House system had resulted in the loss of twenty-five per cent of goods traffic income and the conflict over the joint station in Aberdeen had been expensive and resulted in an overpriced lease on the Deeside. The collapse of Overend, Gurney and Company Bank in 1866 meant that for three months the bank rate rose to 10 per cent, making the company's financial situation worse.|$|E
500|$|The act forbade {{the company}} from issuing shares below £10 so, to make them easier for {{ordinary}} people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten {{so they could be}} paid for in instalments. [...] The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only £3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept £500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as £3 million of <b>ordinary</b> <b>shares</b> and £4million of preference shares. Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887. Barings and Rothschild jointly issued a prospectus for the sale of the preference shares on 15 July, and by 21 July the issue had been fully underwritten, allowing construction to begin. [...] The first sod was cut on 11 November 1887, by Lord Egerton of Tatton, who had taken over the chairmanship of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from Adamson.|$|E
500|$|King Leopold {{decided to}} give {{concessions}} of his territory to private companies who would then collect the rubber tax and export it. With this in mind he approached British Colonel John Thomas North, who had made a fortune through speculating on Chilean nitrates, for capital with which to fund a concession company. North agreed and provided £40,000 of the 250,000 Belgian francs' (fr) initial investment. As a result, the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (informally known as Abir) was established at Antwerp on 6 August 1892. The company was divided into 2,000 shares of 500 fr value each. British investors (including North) held 1880 shares whilst Belgians held the remaining 120 shares. In addition to the 2,000 <b>ordinary</b> <b>shares</b> there were 2,000 [...] "actions" [...] which entitled the holder to {{a share of the}} profits after a 6% dividend was paid to the shareholders. The Congo Free State was the holder of 1,000 of these actions. In return Abir received exclusive rights to all forest products from the Maringa-Lopori basin for 30 years and all land within twenty miles of eight designated posts and had police powers within the limits of the concession. The Free State also had to supply guns, ammunition and soldiers to help establish the posts. In preparation two State employees were ordered to establish a headquarters for Abir at Basankusu but this was barely begun before the local villagers rebelled against State rule and killed both men.|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{strategic}} asset allocation {{is an important}} problem in both finance and actuarial science. There are two key issues in long-term {{strategic asset}} allocation, namely, the presence of inflation risk {{and the impact of}} changes in (macro) -economic conditions on model dynamics. In this article, we take into account the two key issues in our model formulation and develop a quantitative model for long-term strategic asset allocation. A continuous-time, regime-switching market with the presence of inflation risk is considered. There are three tradeable assets in the market, namely, a fixed interest security, an <b>ordinary</b> <b>share</b> and an inflation-linked bond. We assume that the nominal rate of interest on the fixed interest security, the expected rate of return from the <b>ordinary</b> <b>share</b> and the appreciation rate of inflation are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, hidden Markov chain. The states of the chain represent different states of an economy. With knowledge about the price of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>share</b> and the price index level, an investor wishes to maximize the expected utility of real terminal wealth. By making use of the separation principle, we solve the optimal portfolio selection problem and the estimation problem independently. We derive a robust estimate of the hidden state of the chain and develop a robust, filter-based, EM algorithm for the on-line recursive estimates of the key model parameters. 16 page(s...|$|R
