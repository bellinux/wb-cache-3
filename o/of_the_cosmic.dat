Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> background radiation. Recent measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture.

5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E

5|$|Hindu scriptures provide diverse {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Kamadhenu. While some narrate that she emerged from the churning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> ocean, others describe her as the daughter of the creator god Daksha, and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of the cows - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{believed}} that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> order; thus humans, animals and plants {{were believed to be}} members of a single whole. Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The solar {{images are}} taken by <b>the</b> CCD {{detectors}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun monitoring satellites such as SOHO, TRACE, STEREO, SDO, and so on. The solar images are constructed after removing <b>the</b> traces <b>of</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays on <b>the</b> raw CCD data files. Thus, while applying <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> removing <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays traces, we can estimate <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays flux by counting <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> traces. <b>The</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray flux in the steady state might be <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar and galactic <b>cosmic</b> rays.

The results using <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> SOHO/EIT are presented. <b>The</b> estimated <b>cosmic</b> ray flux in the steady state is the anti-correlated with sunspot numbers, which shows <b>the</b> minima in <b>cosmic</b> ray flux at the solar cycle maxima defined by the sunspot numbers. <b>The</b> profiles <b>of</b> estimated solar cosmic ray associated with ground level enhancements observed by the ground neutron monitor have the significant increase in <b>the</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray flux with good correlation.
