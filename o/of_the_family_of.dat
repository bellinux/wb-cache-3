5|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued {{to bring in}} additional luxuries, including pet dogs or cats to control the local vermin. The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, {{and a collection of}} 133 books. Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively normally. The prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various confiscations by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: <b>The</b> needs <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> {{intensive}} care unit patients have been studied, but {{little is known about}} <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> general hospital inpatients, especially patients with chronic diseases. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to identify <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> general hospital inpatients and investigate associations between these needs and the patients' clinical and psychiatric profiles. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study, in a public teaching hospital. METHODS: A random sample of 47 patients and members <b>of</b> their <b>families</b> was studied. Family members' needs were investigated using <b>the</b> critical care <b>family</b> needs inventory and the patients' clinical profiles were investigated using the hospital anxiety and depression scale, confusion assessment method and Karnofsky performance status. <b>The</b> frequencies <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members' needs were described and the patients' clinical and psychiatric characteristics were correlated with the needs using the chi-squared test. RESULTS: Chronic patients predominated and the needs for reassurance and information were indicated as the most important by all members <b>of</b> their <b>families.</b> No associations were found between the patients' characteristics and <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> their <b>families</b> during <b>the</b> hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The needs indicated by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> general hospital inpatients were similar to those <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> patients in {{intensive care}} units: they considered it very important to be reassured and kept informed throughout the hospitalization...|$|R
5|$|After {{his arrival}} in New England, Wheelwright preached {{primarily}} to the Boston settlers who owned land at Mount Wollaston, still considered a part of Boston, but located about ten {{miles south of the}} Boston meetinghouse. Within months, someone had alerted magistrate John Winthrop, a lay person in the Boston church, that Wheelwright was harboring familist and antinomian doctrines. Familism, the theology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>of</b> Love, involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin, and the responsibility for it. Antinomianism, or being freed from moral law under the covenant of grace, was a form of familism. Most of the New England Puritan ministers were adamantly opposed to these theological doctrines, seeing them as the cause of the violent and bloody ravages of the anabaptists in Germany during the Münster Rebellion of the 1530s. When confronted with accusations of familism, Wheelwright denied preaching such a doctrine. While Winthrop and many of the colony's ministers may have viewed Wheelwright as a familist, Cotton saw him as an orthodox minister.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 1914, {{the ship}} was reassigned to the 4th CS of the North America and West Indies Station and sailed that day to join the squadron. She arrived at Jamaica on the 31st and was ordered to depart for Mexico after recoaling to protect British {{interests}} during the ongoing Mexican Revolution. Bristol spent most of June in Tampico, but sailed for Veracruz {{at the end of}} the month where Rear-Admiral Christopher Craddock, the squadron commander, inspected the ship and her crew on 1 July. The ship departed for Puerto México (present day Coatzacoalcos) on the 15th and served as temporary refuge for members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> ex-president Victoriano Huerta for a few days as they were fleeing the country at the time of the United States occupation of Veracruz. Bristol sailed for Jamaica on the 31st as tensions with Germany rose.|$|E
5|$|Reginald {{was the son}} of Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, {{although}} he was possibly born before his father became a priest. Reginald was a great-great-grandson of Humphrey de Bohun, one of the companions of William the Conqueror. Some sources say that he was born while his father was studying law in Italy. His uncle Richard de Bohon was Bishop of Coutances from 1151 to 1180. He was also related to Robert, Earl of Gloucester. Savaric FitzGeldewin, Reginald's successor at Bath, was Reginald's father's second cousin. Reginald's mother may have a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> the counts of Maurienne. He was born and brought up in Italy, which led to him sometimes being referred to as Reginald Italus, Reginald Lombardus or Reginald the Lombard. He was appointed Archdeacon of Wiltshire by his father before 8 December 1161, when he first signed a document as archdeacon. He served in Thomas Becket's household after Becket became archbishop, and by June 1164 was serving Becket's interests in France at both the court of the French King Louis VII and the papal Curia. It was probably in November 1164 that Louis named Reginald abbot of the Abbey of Corbeil.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's second (or third) wife, Maria of Mangup, was <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> the princes of Theodoro. She was {{probably}} also cousins with the Muscovite Grand Princess Sophia Palaiologina, and {{was related to}} Trebizond's royal couple, Emperor David and Empress Maria. The Stephen–Maria marriage took place in September 1472, but she died in December 1477. During her brief stay in Moldavia, Maria supported the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, contributing to the friendly contacts between Stephen and Catholic powers. Stephen's third (or fourth) wife, Maria Voichița, {{was the daughter of}} Radu the Fair, Voivode of Wallachia. She was the mother of Stephen's immediate successor, Bogdan, and a daughter named Maria Cneajna. The latter married into the House of Sanguszko. Stephen is known to have fathered two other sons who died in childhood, {{at a time when he}} was married to Maria Voichița: Bogdan died in 1479, and Peter (Petrașco) in 1480. Scholars are divided as to whether their mother was Evdochia or Maria. Archivist Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu believes that Bogdan also had a twin, Iliaș.|$|E
5|$|The Order {{remained}} in collateral branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> the Dukes of Jülich and Berg until 1521, when the male line holding the two duchies {{and the county}} of Ravensberg became extinct. A daughter, Maria von Geldern, remained to inherit the duchies and the county, but, under the Salic law practiced in the northwestern German states, women could only hold property through a husband or guardian. Consequently, the territories passed to her husband—who was also her distant relative—John III, Duke of Cleves and Mark. The couple had three daughters, one of whom, Ann of Cleves, married Henry VIII of England in 1540, and one son, Wilhelm, who subsequently inherited the duchies and {{the administration of the}} Order. The duchies included most of the present-day North Rhine-Westphalia that lay outside the ecclesiastical territories of the Electorate of Cologne and Münster. Wilhelm was known as Wilhelm the Rich.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>of</b> both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E
