30|$|Brassica spp. {{oilseeds}} {{are grown}} {{throughout the world}} as sources of vegetable oil and protein-rich animal feed (Henriksen et al. 2009). According to statistical data from the Canada Grains Council (2011), the average annual production of Canadian canola over the period 2001 - 2010 was 9.2 million tonnes, and the Canadian <b>oilseed</b> <b>crushing</b> industry produced an average of 2.1 million tonnes of canola meal annually between 2001 - 2010. Commercial oilseed extraction may include solvent extraction, mechanical expeller-press extraction, or combinations of mechanical and solvent extraction to produce oil and meal. Canola meal is the portion remaining after extraction of oil from canola seed and it is widely used as a protein source in poultry, swine, beef, and dairy cattle feeds because of its excellent amino acid profile (Hickling 2011).|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the ongoing}} Alternative Crops {{research}} programme at Oak Park five new crop species were evaluated. The three oilseeds, Turnip rape, Winter linseed and Sunflowers produced promising results with a potential for commercialisation. Commercial development depends, to a large extent, on the provisions of an <b>oilseed</b> <b>crushing</b> facility in Ireland. Phacelia performs well and is an option for set-aside management or {{as a means of}} reducing nitrate leaching. Meadowfoam development, in terms of breeding agriculturally acceptable varieties, has still some way to go before the crop could be considered as a commercially viable proposition. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the field performance of a number of crop species not previously grown in Ireland. Although the species evaluated, Turnip rape (Brassica rapa, var. annua) Winter linseed (Linum usitatissimum), Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus L.), Phacelia and Meadowfoam (Limanthes alba), are widely grown in other EU countries very little data is available on their agronomic performance in Ireland.

50|$|The {{economy of}} Hull {{was built on}} trading and seafaring, firstly whaling and later seafishing. Merchant's houses such as Blaydes House and some {{warehouses}} survive in the Old Town, where trade was centred on the River Hull, later shifting to the Humber docks. Another major industry was <b>oilseed</b> <b>crushing.</b> Although the fishing industry declined in the 1970s, the city remains a busy port, handling 13 million tonnes of cargo per year. The port operations run by Associated British Ports and other companies in the port employ 5,000 people. A further 18,000 are employed {{as a direct result}} of the port's activities.The port area of the city has diversified to compensate for the decline in fishing by the introduction of Roll-on Roll-off ferry services to the continent of Europe. These ferries now handle over a million passengers each year.Hull has exploited the leisure industry by creating Hull Marina from the old Humber Street Dock in the centre of the city. It opened in 1983 and has 270 berths for yachts and small sailing craft.|$|R
40|$|This study {{identifies}} variables which increase Japan’s {{imports of}} canola (soybeans) {{at the expense}} of soybeans (canola), and quantifies their impacts by estimating an import demand model. A key finding is that lower Japanese meat production tends to increase rapeseed imports while lowering soybean imports. Thus, Canada bene-fited from U. S. and Australian efforts to open Japan’s market for imported beef, since the vast majority of Japan’s canola imports are from Canada. Key Words: canola, meat trade liberalization, rapeseed, soybeans Japan is the single largest importer of soybeans and rapeseed, accounting for approx-imately 19 % of world soybean imports between 1972 and 1994 (78 % of which was supplied by the United States) and 40 % of world rapeseed imports (almost all of which was supplied by Canada). Soybeans and rapeseed dominate <b>oilseed</b> <b>crush</b> in Japan, accounting for just over 90 % of all oilseed imports from 1979 onward. How-ever, the improved rapeseed varieties (known as canola) have emerged as a strong competitor against soybeans, as Japan’s soybean imports have stagnated in recent years while rapeseed imports have continued to grow (figure 1) [Japan Oil and Fa...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} impact of a {{potential}} TTIP bilateral free trade agreement on the EU and US bio-economies (feedstock, biofuels, by-products, and related competing crops) and major trade partners in these markets. The analysis develops a multi-market model that incorporates bilateral trade flows (US to EU, EU to US, and similarly with third countries) and is calibrated to OECD-FAO baseline for 2013 - 2022 to account for recent policy decisions. The major policy reforms from a TTIP involve tariff and TRQ liberalization and their direct contractionary impact on US sugar supply, EU biofuel production, and indirect negative effect on US HFCS production. EU sugar and isoglucose productions expand along with US ethanol and biodiesel and <b>oilseed</b> <b>crushing.</b> EU sugar would flow to the US, US biofuels and vegetable oil to the EU. We further quantify nontariff measures (NTM) affecting these trade flows between the EU and the US. EU oilseed production contracts, and EU crushing expands with improving crushing margins following reduced NTM frictions.

50|$|Gelder {{had entered}} the {{architectural}} profession {{at the time of}} the Victorian era development of Hull. According to one source it was largely thanks to Gelder’s ability and energy that Hull was a city transformed - with old buildings removed, new wide streets introduced and attractive shops and public offices erected. Under Gelder’s supervision, Hull was being hailed as one of the country’s finest cities with the slums and disorder of the Victorian city giving way to broad, straight thoroughfares. During Gelder’s time the city centre was reconstructed and a new bridge, the Drypool Bridge, was built across the River Hull. In recognition of Gelder’s contributions, the new road built through the city centre to link with this bridge was named Alfred Gelder Street. In the 1930s Gelder was associated with the works to transform Queen’s Dock into Queen’s Gardens. One of Gelder and Kitchen’s specialisms was the design of flour mills and <b>oilseed</b> <b>crushing</b> mills at a time when Hull was a major European centre for the industry. One of the firm’s most famous clients for its revolutionary roller mill was Joseph Rank who, like Gelder, was a noted Methodist and Gelder also did architectural work for Joseph Rank’s son, the industrialist and film producer, J Arthur Rank. His devout attachment to Methodism caused Gelder to design numerous chapels, including the Brunswick Chapel on Holderness Road in 1890 and the Princes Avenue Chapel in 1904. As well as in Hull, there were commissions for chapels and flour mills, fromall over the country.|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJason BergtoldMarkets for {{alternative}} fuels are emerging and are {{of great interest}} to both public and private companies, as well as government agencies looking to differentiate fuel sources to achieve improved and sustainable operational efficiencies. This creates a growing need for innovation and an increased supply of biofuel feedstocks for bioenergy options such as bio-jet fuel. This thesis aims to assess the logistical feasibility of producing oilseed bio feedstocks and the practicality of building new crush facilities specifically for bio-jet fuel production in Kansas. A logistical optimization model is built by applying data to estimate the potential Kansas supply of rapeseed as a possible feedstock option; transportation and facility costs associated with building; and proposed crushing facility sites, by considering the estimated demand for bio-jet fuel within Kansas. The developed optimization model determined that even average yields per acre and modest adoption rates by farmers willing to incorporate rapeseed into their crop rotations could provide enough feedstock to supply one or two crushing facilities, depending on a variety of additional factors, including bio-jet fuel demand in Kansas. Sensitivity analysis was performed on key model factors and determined that the most influential factor on both size and number of proposed crushing facilities was the market demand for bio-jet fuel. Ultimately, further research is required to better understand the actual market demand for bio-jet fuel within Kansas and how competition or supply supplementation of other bio feedstocks can affect the size or number of proposed crushing facilities. There are currently six <b>oilseed</b> <b>crushing</b> facilities operating in Kansas; although all are dedicated to soybean or sunflower seed. Further studies may find these sites as viable alternative options to building new crushing facilities for a separate type of feedstock...|$|R
40|$|Japan’s oilseed {{sector is}} divided into two main {{components:}} 1) a large oilseed-crushing industry that produces vegetable oil and oilseed meal, and 2) industries using oilseeds for food, without crushing them for oil. In general, the oilseed-crushing industry is protected by tariffs on vegetable oil at the border, but receives no domestic subsidies. Oilseed production for food, in contrast, generally has no border protection but receives domestic subsidies. Japan’s policies support soybean producer incomes by paying the difference between market prices and higher target prices that reflect costs of production in Japan. Farmers who plant soybeans on fields diverted from rice production receive additional subsidies. In recent years, soybean production has grown in response to the large incentives offered by these policies. Tariffs on soy and canola oil favor <b>crushing</b> of <b>oilseeds</b> in Japan, at the expense of vegetable oil consumers. Removal of the tariffs would lead to greater imports of oil and meal into Japan, while imports of <b>oilseeds</b> for <b>crushing</b> would fall...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} factors that affected {{the prices of}} corn and soybean meal {{and the impact of}} these prices on market demand and supply for U. S. broilers. An econometric model consisting of four structural equations and one identity was formulated and estimated using quarterly data from 1976 to 1996. One of the results reveals that soybean meal price flexibilities with respect to soybean prices were highly elastic in both the short and long run. This means that changes in soybean prices have a relatively large effect on meal price. In contrast, meal price and oil price moved in opposite directions. An increase in oil price encourages an increase in <b>crushing</b> <b>oilseeds,</b> resulting in an increase in both oil and meal supply. In addition, results indicated that a sustained increase in corn and soybean meal prices will have an immediate impact on broiler quantities and prices. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
40|$|In many foods, lipids {{are present}} as {{droplets}} dispersed {{in an aqueous}} matrix. This dispersed state favours the oxidation of unsaturated lipids and leads to the degradation of sensory and nutritional qualities of the foods. This work was aimed to (1) investigate the influence on lipid oxidation of physico-chemical characteristics of the lipid-water interface and the aqueous phase in oil-in-water emulsions, designed to mimic dispersion state of lipids in foods, and (2) evaluate the sensory impact of the produced volatile compounds. Analysis of oxidation kinetics of emulsions varying {{by the nature of}} the emulsifier, the pH of the aqueous phase or the presence of a hydrosoluble metal chelator, demonstrates the key roles of metal location and reactivity of the emulsifying protein on oxidation initiation and on relative proportions of produced volatile compounds. Most of the volatiles exhibit an odour activity. Their formation lead to an early detection of an odour, which was characterised by cut grass, mushroom, <b>oilseeds,</b> rancid, <b>crushed</b> wood bug, deep fried and painty descriptors. The odour evolved with time as shown by changes in the relative contributions of the intensities of these descriptors. The contribution to the odour of volatile compounds perceived alone or as mixtures was investigated by olfactometric analysis. This work contradicts models based on the charge of the interface and suggests new interpretations for oxidative stability of lipids in complex dispersed media. It also gives practical information about formulation of foods containing unsaturated lipids...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:A ghani is {{a machine}} and pestle device which grinds oilseed into fine {{particles}} and extract oil from it. The oilseeds and subsequently the expressed oil {{are held in}} a scooped circular pit in the exact centre of a circular mortar made of stone or wood. In it works a stout, upright pestle which descends from a top curved or angled piece, in which the pestle rests in a scooped-out hollow that permits the pestle to rotate, eased by some soapy or oily lubricant. Today the single angled piece {{takes the form of}} two shorter pieces pinioned or chained together. The bottom of the lower angled piece is attached to a load-beam; one end of the load-beam rides around the outside of the barrel, while the other is yoked to the animal. The load-beam is weighted down with either heavy stones or even the seated operator. As the animal moves in a circular ambit, the pestle rotates, exerting lateral pressure on the upper chest of the pit, first pulverizing the <b>oilseed</b> and then <b>crushing</b> out its oil. But with the advent of oil expeller technology, almost all ghani were closed down. But still some ghani are running which are now made of iron and steel and it is driven by 2 HP motor. In India, oil extraction machine for extracting oil from seeds was designed and fabricated for market oriented production. The procedures employed include the design stage, construction and testing. The machine components are: Wooden hopper, wooden crusher, Connecting Rod, The reduction gear, the electric motor (2 hp, 3 -phase), the frame, the belt. oil are produced on a large scale which is used for various purposes such as Edible etc...|$|R
