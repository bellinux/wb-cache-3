40|$|In the {{previous}} decade, four species of non-native goby have invaded the middle {{section of the}} River Danube. To understand {{the problems associated with}} these invasions better, we examined the external morphology of 184 round goby Neogobius melanostomus specimens using both triple regression (distance-based measurements) and geometrical (coordinates-based measurements) analysis within an <b>ontogenetical</b> and epigenetical aspect. Using geometrical analysis of distance-based characters, we found that the external body shape in four size groups of round goby remained essentially unchanged. Such direct development represents a strongly precocial (i. e. specialized) life-history, whereas earlier maturation in this non-native population suggests a shift back towards more altricial (i. e. less specialized, more generalized) life history. This combination of altricial–precocial trajectories seems to be typical for invasive round gobies and may be one of key factors for their successful colonization of new environments...|$|E

The Vichian nascimento of thought as imagination aims at defining the realrelationship between mind and body outside their often false opposition. The archeology of thinking does not rest on a presumptive centered substance governing the human flesh and passions, but on a network of powerful images, enabling the first humans to implement their faculty of intellection as acuity.

The following <b>ontogenetical</b> differences could be observed between both species: (1) a retardation {{in the development of}} the abaxial side of the lateral flowers of A. moschatellina; (2) the initiation of the corolla lobes of S. ebulus upon a ring-like extension and not directly on a flattened floral apex as in A. moschatellina; (3) the formation of a depression in the floral apex as the first step of the gynoecial development in S. ebulus, which was not observed in A. moschatellina. These differences are interpreted as variations of a same basic developmental pattern. Therefore, it is concluded that Adoxa evolved from an ancestor shared with Sambucus (or another Dipsacalean taxon).

Fertilizer and sulfur were applied to conifer seedlings at seven sites near Corvallis, OR. Growth and browse damage data were collected for all seedlings over a period of 17 months. Additionally, foliar concentrations of monoterpenes and simple carbohydrates were assessed in western redcedar (Thuja plicata) seedlings over a period of three years. Fertilization and sulfur treatments had a moderate impact on growth and no influence on browse damage or the chemical responses. Over the course of the study, browse damage diminished while foliar monoterpene concentrations increased in redcedar. It appears that silvicultural manipulation via sulfur application and/or soil amendment cannot accelerate or alter the <b>ontogenetical</b> changes that may naturally defend seedlings against mammalian herbivores. In a brief trial with captive deer, redcedar browse resistance was influenced by seedling maturation, but not monoterpene content. Other maturation effects may yield significant browse protection to young seedlings...|$|E
40|$|Pollen wall {{ontogeny}} of Rondeletia odorata was {{studied with}} {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) from tetrad stage until maturity. The ontogenetic sequence of wall development in Rondeletia follows, to some extent, the basic scheme in the angiosperms, i. e., development starts centripetally with the pro-columellae in a plasmalemma surface coating (primexine) at the early tetrad stage when the microspores are still enveloped by callose, until intine formation in young pollen grains. The main <b>ontogenetical</b> features of Rondeletia odorata pollen are (1) the very thin irregular foot layer, (2) development of a continuous layer of radially oriented membranous granular material under the thick endexine, (3) initiation of intine before first mitosis with characteristic radial plasmalemma invaginations, and (4) a strong stretching force upon engorgement just prior to dehiscence, which leads to reduction in thickness of all wall layers. The possible function of Golgi vesicles in the considerable increase in surface area of the plasmalemma at intine initiation is discussed.

40|$|Analyses of {{the degree}} of filling and the state of {{digestion}} of four species (Diaphus watasei, Benthosema fibulatum, Myctophum brachygnatum and Diaphus garmani) revealed that all but D. watasei were cyclic feeders feeding at or near the surface during the night. Diaphus watasei was an acyclic feeder feeding close to the bottom. Prey analysis of 14 myctophid species showed that crustacea, mainly copepods, was the main food. Molluscs and bivalve larvae, larvaceans and salps, chaetognaths and polychaetes were also eaten. For Diaphus watasei, euphasiids, squids (family Onychoteuthidae), fish and fish larvae (family Myctophidae), contributed a great deal. All but three species were opportunistic feeders. Diaphus nielseni, Diaphus jenseni (both feeding specifically on copepods) and Myctophum brachygriatum (feeding specifically on molluscs and bivalve larvae) were selective feeders. The myctophids showed food partitioning by feeding at different depths, on selected sizes and selected taxa. <b>Ontogenetical</b> resource partitioning was also observed.

40|$|External {{morphology}} {{of native}} Canadian (River Otonabee, Looncall Lake) and non-native Slovak (River Danube) pumpkinseed was examined using both triple regression analysis (distance-based measurements) and geometrical analysis (coordinate-based measurements) within an <b>ontogenetical</b> aspect. In general, {{the results from}} the geometrical analysis comply with those from the triple regression analysis. The smallest pumpkinseed (predominantly juveniles) differed significantly from the largest pumpkinseed (predominantly adults) in all the three populations. The major difference was that adults had a deeper body and larger belly area than juveniles, which is probably associated with more space for gonads in mature fish. Developmental patterns and external morphology in pumpkinseed from the River Otonabee seemed to be closer to pumpkinseed from the Danube than to those from Lake Looncall. This suggests that, in the pumpkinseed examined, ontogenetic changes in external shape depend on environmental conditions (epigenetical information) rather than on geographical and/or genetical isolation. Further examination of early development, fecundity, number of spawning acts per season, parental care, egg size, age at maturation, etc., will follow to test this hypothesis...|$|E

Recent analyses based on morphological as well as molecular data revealed a close relationship between the genus Samolus L. of Primulaceae and the monophyletic family Theophrastaceae. We studied the floral development of six species from four different genera of Theophrastaceae and compared it to floral <b>ontogenetical</b> data of Samolus valerandi L. to find support for a close relationship. Samolus {{and the members of}} Theophrastaceae share the presence of staminodes and a similar development of the placenta and the ovules. Apart from the different habit and distribution, however, we also observed some major differences between both lineages, such as the absence of common primordia in Theophrastaceae, the development of a gynoecial cap in Samolus, and the difference in development, shape, and structure of the staminodes.

The first gateway to GM is the playing with the interstratal relationship as in puns, followed by lexical metaphor, transcategorization as a linguistic process leading to GM, rankshifted embeddings, faded metaphor and technical terms. These processes pave the pathways to the entry to adult language. The findings illustrate that there is {{a significant increase in the}} use of GM at the age of 9, before puberty. This finding contradicts with Halliday’s claim that the use of GM considerably increases during the onset of puberty and entry to secondary school.

40|$|Component {{analysis}} is {{the analysis of}} variation of complex character based on the variation of its components. For assessing the variation, components should be arranged in <b>ontogenetical</b> order. This allows determination of the mutually independent contributions of the components to the variation of complex character. Component analysis provides the necessary data for the exploitation of recombinative heterosis in plant breeding. Recombinative heterosis is the phenomenon where in, the progeny value of a complex character exceeds the mid parental value {{as a result of}} the multiplicative relationship between the complex character and its component traits. It is suggested that this form of heterosis may be an important cause of specific combining ability. As such, it may be involved in the heterosis of complex characters in F 1 hybrids and in the hybrid- vigor encountered in interspecific hybrid populations. It is demonstrated how recombinative heterosis may be explained by a quantitative genetical model involving additive inheritance of the component traits. Current study was focused to predict progeny performance for the complex character from parental data for the component traits. This requires regression of individual components on the preceding primary characters.

D. puntazzo specimens were observed using a scanning electron (n = 67) {{and a light}} micro-scope (n = 7). The results concerned four <b>ontogenetical</b> stages of sharpsnout seabream: larval, post-larval, transitional, and juvenile stages. The yolk-sac larval stage was not detected as the smallest larvae at our disposal (3. 1 mm TL; 2 nd day from hatching) showed no external appearance of the yolk. During the larval stage (3. 1 – 4. 7 mm TL), sharpsnout seabream is equipped with free neuromasts and olfactory ciliated receptor cells. In the post-larval stage (5 – 28. 6 mm TL), mechano- and chemo-reception is implemented: {{the inner and outer}} taste buds differentiation, the nasal formation, the lateral line system canalization occur. The precocious differentiation of chemo-receptors makes post-larvae particularly sensitive to the organoleptic properties of administered preys. D. puntazzo, {{at the end of this}} phase, could be considered a juvenile (complete squamation is acquired), except for the mouth and pharyngeal teeth. During the subsequent phase (‘transitional’), in fact, eight chisel-type and two lateral series of molar-like teeth progressively substituted the conical ones on each jaw, and three different types of teeth on the upper and lower pharynx differentiated.

40|$|Glucosinolates are plant {{secondary}} metabolites used {{in plant}} defense. For insects specialized on Brassicaceae, {{such as the}} diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), glucosinolates act as "fingerprints" that are essential in host plant recognition. Some plants in the genus Barbarea (Brassicaceae) contain, besides glucosinolates, saponins that act as feeding deterrents for P. xylostella larvae, preventing their survival on the plant. Two-choice oviposition tests were conducted to study the preference of P. xylostella among Barbarea leaves of different size within the same plant. P. xylostella laid more eggs per leaf area on younger leaves compared to older ones. Higher concentrations of glucosinolates and saponins were found in younger leaves than in older ones. In 4 -week-old plants, saponins were present in true leaves, while cotyledons contained little or no saponins. When analyzing the whole foliage of the plant, the content of glucosinolates and saponins also varied significantly in comparisons among plants that were 4, 8, and 12 weeks old. In Barbarea plants and leaves of different ages, there was {{a positive correlation between}} glucosinolate and saponin levels.
