2500|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} {{frequently}} presents with {{shortness of breath}} with exertion, <b>orthopnea,</b> and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. [...] It affects between 1â€“2% of the general United States population and occurs in 10% of those over 65years old. Risk factors for acute decompensation include high dietary salt intake, medication noncompliance, cardiac ischemia, dysrhythmias, renal failure, pulmonary emboli, hypertension, and infections. Treatment efforts are directed towards decreasing lung congestion.|$|E
2500|$|Breath sounds on {{the side}} of the rupture may be diminished, {{respiratory}} distress may be present, and the chest or abdomen may be painful. [...] <b>Orthopnea,</b> dyspnea which occurs when lying flat, may also occur, and coughing is another sign. [...] In people with herniation of abdominal organs, signs of intestinal blockage or sepsis in the abdomen may be present. [...] Bowel sounds may be heard in the chest, and shoulder or epigastric pain may be present. [...] When the injury is not noticed right away, the main symptoms are those that indicate bowel obstruction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} MI {{are dependent on}} which phase of the disease process the individual is in. [...] Individuals with acute MI are typically severely symptomatic and will have the {{signs and symptoms of}} acute decompensated congestive heart failure (i.e. shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, <b>orthopnea,</b> and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), as well as symptoms of cardiogenic shock (i.e., shortness of breath at rest). Cardiovascular collapse with shock (cardiogenic shock) may be seen in individuals with acute MI due to papillary muscle rupture, rupture of a chorda tendinea or infective endocarditis of the mitral valve.|$|E

50|$|<b>Orthopnea</b> {{is often}} a symptom of left {{ventricular}} heart failure and/or pulmonary edema. It can also occur in those with asthma and chronic bronchitis, as well as those with sleep apnea or panic disorder. It is also associated with polycystic liver disease. From a neuromuscular perspective, <b>orthopnea</b> is a sign of severe diaphragmatic weakness. Under such circumstances, patients may describe shortness of breath when they bend over (e.g. when tying shoelaces).|$|E
5000|$|The word <b>orthopnea</b> uses {{combining}} {{forms of}} [...] + , from Greek ortho, straight, regular, + pnoia, breath. See pronunciation information at dyspnea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthopnea</b> {{is due to}} {{increased}} distribution of blood to the pulmonary circulation while recumbent, but usually {{can be attributed to}} a more fundamental cause.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthopnea</b> or orthopnoea is {{shortness}} of breath (dyspnea) that occurs when lying flat, causing the person to have to sleep propped up in bed or sitting in a chair. It is commonly seen as a late manifestation of heart failure, resulting from fluid redistribution into the central circulation, causing an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure. It is also seen in cases of abdominal obesity or pulmonary disease. <b>Orthopnea</b> {{is the opposite of}} platypnea, {{shortness of}} breath that worsens when sitting or standing up.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{manifestations of}} HFpEF {{are similar to}} those {{observed}} in HFrEF and include shortness of breath including exercise induced dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and <b>orthopnea,</b> exercise intolerance, fatigue, elevated jugular venous pressure, and edema.|$|E
5000|$|Platypnea or platypnoea is {{shortness}} of breath (dyspnea) that is relieved when lying down, and worsens when sitting or standing. It {{is the opposite of}} <b>orthopnea.</b> The condition was first described in 1949 and named in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, <b>orthopnea,</b> and {{hemoptysis}} (sign of pulmonary venous congestion): this {{symptoms are}} less frequent in Lutembacher's syndrome {{and are more}} associated with MS and small ASD or patients who develop reverse Lutembacher's syndrome. This symptom is caused by mitral stenosis.|$|E
50|$|Backward {{failure of}} the left {{ventricle}} causes congestion of the lungs' blood vessels, and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature. Backward failure can be subdivided into the {{failure of the}} left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The patient will have dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called <b>orthopnea,</b> occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, and in <b>orthopnea,</b> the patient may resort to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise.|$|E
50|$|Pericardial {{mesothelioma}} is {{not well}} characterized, but observed cases have included cardiac symptoms, specifically constrictive pericarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac tamponade. They have also included nonspecific symptoms, including substernal chest pain, <b>orthopnea</b> (shortness of breath when lying flat), and cough. These symptoms are caused by the tumor encasing or infiltrating the heart.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of TACO are dyspnea, <b>orthopnea,</b> peripheral edema, and rapid increase of blood pressure. TACO must be suspected {{when there is}} respiratory distress with other signs, including pulmonary edema, unanticipated cardiovascular system changes, and evidence of fluid overload (including improvement after diuretic, morphine or nitrate treatment), during or up to 24 hours after transfusion.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms usually {{include one}} or more of the following: <b>orthopnea</b> (difficulty {{breathing}} while lying flat), dyspnea (shortness of breath on exertion), pitting edema (swelling), cough, frequent night-time urination, excessive weight gain during the last month of pregnancy (1-2+ kg/week; two to four or more pounds per week), palpitations (sensation of racing heart-rate, skipping beats, long pauses between beats, or fluttering), and chest pain.|$|E
50|$|Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or {{paroxysmal}} nocturnal dyspnoea (PND) {{refers to}} attacks of severe {{shortness of breath}} and coughing that generally occur at night. It usually awakens the person from sleep, and may be quite frightening. Though simple <b>orthopnea</b> may be relieved by sitting upright {{at the side of}} the bed with legs dangling, in those with PND, coughing and wheezing often persist in this position.|$|E
5000|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} {{frequently}} presents with {{shortness of breath}} with exertion, <b>orthopnea,</b> and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. [...] It affects between 1-2% of the general United States population and occurs in 10% of those over 65 years old. Risk factors for acute decompensation include high dietary salt intake, medication noncompliance, cardiac ischemia, dysrhythmias, renal failure, pulmonary emboli, hypertension, and infections. Treatment efforts are directed towards decreasing lung congestion.|$|E
50|$|Less common signs/symptoms include {{non-productive}} cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting. Coughing up of blood may occur in some patients, particularly those with specific subtypes of pulmonary hypertension such as heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, Eisenmenger syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary venous hypertension typically presents with {{shortness of breath}} while lying flat or sleeping (<b>orthopnea</b> or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), while pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) typically does not.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} MI {{are dependent on}} which phase of the disease process the individual is in. Individuals with acute MI are typically severely symptomatic and will have the {{signs and symptoms of}} acute decompensated congestive heart failure (i.e. shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, <b>orthopnea,</b> and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), as well as symptoms of cardiogenic shock (i.e., shortness of breath at rest). Cardiovascular collapse with shock (cardiogenic shock) may be seen in individuals with acute MI due to papillary muscle rupture, rupture of a chorda tendinea or infective endocarditis of the mitral valve.|$|E

[...] When the injury is not noticed right away, the main symptoms are those that indicate bowel obstruction.|$|E
50|$|PND {{is caused}} {{in part by}} the {{depression}} of the respiratory center during sleep, which may reduce arterial oxygen tension, particularly in patients with interstitial lung disease and reduced pulmonary compliance.Also, in the horizontal position there is redistribution of blood volume from the lower extremities and splanchnic beds to the lungs (<b>orthopnea).</b> In normal individuals this has little effect, but in patients in whom the additional volume cannot be pumped out by the left ventricle because of disease, there is a significant reduction in vital capacity and pulmonary compliance with resultant shortness of breath. Additionally, in patients with congestive heart failure the pulmonary circulation may already be overloaded because the failing left ventricle is suddenly unable to match the output of a more normally functioning right ventricle; causing pulmonary congestion. It is also important to note that left-sided heart failure can lead to right-sided heart failure. Pulmonary congestion decreases when the patient assumes a more erect position, and this is accompanied by an improvement in symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{of heart failure}} are largely determined by {{which side of the}} heart fails. The left side pumps blood into the systemic circulation, whilst the right side pumps blood into the pulmonary circulation. Whilst left-sided heart failure will reduce cardiac output to the systemic circulation, the initial {{symptoms of}}ten manifest due to effects on the pulmonary circulation. In systolic dysfunction, the ejection fraction is decreased, leaving an abnormally elevated volume of blood in the left ventricle. In diastolic dysfunction, the end-diastolic ventricular pressure will be high. This increase in volume or pressure backs up to the left atrium and then to the pulmonary veins. Increased volume or pressure in the pulmonary veins impairs the normal drainage of the alveoli and favors the flow of fluid from the capillaries to the lung parenchyma, causing pulmonary edema. This impairs gas exchange. Thus, left-sided heart failure often presents with respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, <b>orthopnea,</b> and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.|$|E
50|$|The {{increased}} peripheral {{resistance and}} greater blood volume place further {{strain on the}} heart and accelerates the process of damage to the myocardium. Vasoconstriction and fluid retention produce an increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries. This shifts the balance of forces in favor of interstitial fluid formation as the increased pressure forces additional fluid out of the blood, into the tissue. This results in edema (fluid build-up) in the tissues. In right-sided heart failure, this commonly starts in the ankles where venous pressure is high due {{to the effects of}} gravity (although if the patient is bed-ridden, fluid accumulation may begin in the sacral region.) It may also occur in the abdominal cavity, where the fluid buildup is called ascites. In left-sided heart failure edema can occur in the lungs - this is called cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This reduces spare capacity for ventilation, causes stiffening of the lungs and reduces the efficiency of gas exchange by increasing the distance between the air and the blood. The consequences of this are dyspnea (shortness of breath), <b>orthopnea</b> and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} symptom of {{pulmonary}} edema is difficulty breathing, but may include other {{symptoms such as}} coughing up blood (classically seen as pink, frothy sputum), excessive sweating, anxiety, and pale skin. Shortness of breath can manifest as <b>orthopnea</b> (inability to lie down flat due to breathlessness) and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (episodes of severe sudden breathlessness at night). These are common presenting symptoms of chronic pulmonary edema due to left ventricular failure. The development of pulmonary edema {{may be associated with}} symptoms and signs of [...] "fluid overload"; this is a non-specific term to describe the manifestations of left ventricular failure {{on the rest of the}} body and includes peripheral edema (swelling of the legs, in general, of the [...] "pitting" [...] variety, wherein the skin is slow to return to normal when pressed upon), raised jugular venous pressure and hepatomegaly, where the liver is enlarged and may be tender or even pulsatile. Other signs include end-inspiratory crackles (sounds heard at the end of a deep breath) on auscultation and the presence of a third heart sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} the hole between {{the right and left}} atrium to close shortly after birth is the cause behind ASD primium. During fetal {{development}} blood will pass from the umbilical cord and flow into the left atrium through an hole between the two atria. Once a baby is born and the lungs begin to fill with air, the blood flow of the heart changes; a tissue flap (septum primium) normally closes the hole (foramen ovale) between the two atria and becomes part of the atrial wall. During ASD primium, after birth the hole is not completely closed allowing deoxygenated blood to flow into the left atria from the right atria. With the {{failure of the}} blood to pass from the right atrium into the right ventricle and then into the pulmonary veins, blood will not obtain any oxygen before it is leaves the heart and goes {{to other parts of the}} body. Due to the incorrect blood flow, symptoms such as fatigue (from decreased systemic blood flow), palpitations (from blood flowing from left atria to right atria), weight gain, edema, right upper chest pain (all caused from the left to right atria blood flow), and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (shortness of breath during sleep), <b>orthopnea</b> (difficulty in breathing while lying down), and hemoptysis or coughing up blood (all caused by small ASD that cause blood flow from left to right atria).|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of expiratory flow limitation (FL) in <b>orthopnea</b> during acute left heart failure (LHF). BACKGROUNDOrthopnea is typical of acute LHF, but its mechanisms are not completely understood. In other settings, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea correlates best with expiratory FL and can, therefore, be interpreted as, in part, {{the result of a}} hyperinflation-related increased load to the inspiratory muscles. As airway obstruction is common in acute LHF, postural FL could contribute to <b>orthopnea.</b> METHODSFlow limitation was assessed during quiet breathing by applying a negative pressure at the mouth throughout tidal expiration (negative expiratory pressure [NEP]). Flow limitation was assumed when expiratory flow did not increase during NEP. Twelve patients with acute LHF aged 40 â€“ 98 years were studied seated and supine and compared with 10 age-matched healthy subjects. RESULTSCompared with controls, patients had rapid shallow breathing with slightly increased minute ventilation and mean inspiratory flow. Breathing pattern was not influenced by posture. Flow limitation was observed in four patients when seated and in nine patients when supine. In seven cases, FL was induced or aggravated by the supine position. This coincided with <b>orthopnea</b> in six cases. Only one out of the five patients without <b>orthopnea</b> had posture dependent FL. Control subjects did not exhibit FL in either position. CONCLUSIONSExpiratory FL appears to be common in patients with acute LHF, particularly so when <b>orthopnea</b> is present. Its postural aggravation could contribute to LHF-related <b>orthopnea...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Orthopnea</b> is a {{sensation}} of shortness of breath, which occurs in recumbent position {{and is usually}} improved by standing or sitting. The authors report a case of an 81 -year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with a two-week history of <b>orthopnea,</b> fever and low back pain resistant to analgesics. Radiological findings confirm {{the presence of a}} diafragmatic hernia, and clinicians should pay attention to any history of trauma, because their absence in symptomatic adult patients directs towards a congenital cause.

Methods: In nine nonobese (ie, mean [SD] body mass index, 24 5 kg/m 2), never-smoker patients (two men and seven women; mean age, 77 7 years) with acute LHF (mean ejection fraction, 43 15...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Objective: To {{determine}} the possible correlation of NYHA classification with clinical and paraclinical parameters in elderly diagnosed with heart failure. Material and methods: Patients aged over 65 years, diagnosed with heart failure, {{were included in}} study. Clinical data, biochemical markers and imagistic parameters were determined, and {{the presence or absence}} of comorbidities was noted. Results: A number of 178 patients were included in study. In univariate analysis, NYHA classification was associated with: <b>orthopnea,</b> jugular venous distention, rales, bilateral ankle edema, pleural effusion, hepatomegaly, atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), C-reactive protein (CRP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), and left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). The multivariate analysis showed the independent markers linked to NYHA classification: presence of <b>orthopnea</b> (p< 0. 001), bilateral ankle edema (p= 0. 05), chronic kidney disease (p= 0. 05), high levels of CRP (p= 0. 04) and altered LVEF (p= 0. 02). Conclusion: <b>Orthopnea,</b> bilateral ankle edema, renal dysfunction, inflammation and low LVEF are correlated with NYHA classification.
