5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source <b>of</b> <b>annoyance,</b> however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E
5|$|Naomi {{lives with}} her hippy mother Gina (Olivia Colman) and fifteen other people in a {{communal}} living arrangement. This is a source <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> to Naomi, whose privacy is invaded when she wakes up one morning, naked, to discover that a male hippy is sleeping in her bed. At college, she avoids Emily to meet with her politics teacher Kieran instead. In the students' common room, they are informed of the upcoming elections for Student President. Emily encourages Naomi to run for president, but Naomi refuses. She later comes across Cook, who tries to persuade her {{to have sex with}} him. She jokingly tells him that he has a better chance of winning the student elections, which he sees as a challenge and decides to register. Kieran walks her {{home at the end of}} the day and urges her to run in the elections, giving her a registration form. When she arrives at her house, she finds Emily waiting in her bedroom with another registration form. Emily starts to leave when Naomi is rude and standoffish to herdespite taking Emily's advice to enter the electionsbut returns and confronts her. She coldly tells her that she is not obsessed with pursuing a sexual relationship with her, and Naomi suggests she stay the night with her.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} noise and {{vibration}} on annoyance in buildings during {{the passage of a}} nearby high-speed train have been investigated in a laboratory experiment with recorded train noise and 20 Hz vibration. The noises included the effects of two types of fac¸ade: windows-open and windows-closed. Subjects were exposed to six levels of noise and six magnitudes of vibration, and asked to rate annoyance using an 11 -point numerical scale. The experiment consisted of four sessions: (1) evaluation <b>of</b> noise <b>annoyance</b> in the absence of vibration, (2) evaluation <b>of</b> total <b>annoyance</b> from simultaneous {{noise and vibration}}, (3) evaluation <b>of</b> noise <b>annoyance</b> in the presence of vibration, and (4) evaluation <b>of</b> vibration <b>annoyance</b> in the absence of noise. The results show that vibration did not influence ratings <b>of</b> noise <b>annoyance,</b> but that total annoyance caused by combined noise and vibration was considerably greater than the annoyance caused by noise alone. The noise annoyance and the total annoyance caused by combined noise and vibration were associated with subject self-ratings of noise sensitivity. Two classical models <b>of</b> total <b>annoyance</b> due to combined noise sources (maximum of the single source annoyance or the integration <b>of</b> individual <b>annoyance</b> ratings) provided useful predictions <b>of</b> the total <b>annoyance</b> caused by simultaneous noise and vibration...|$|R

25|$|People with BPD {{may feel}} {{emotions}} with greater ease, depth {{and for a}} longer time than others do. A core characteristic of BPD is affective instability, which generally manifests as unusually intense emotional responses to environmental triggers, with a slower return to a baseline emotional state. People with BPD often engage in idealization and devaluation of others, alternating between high positive regard for people and great disappointment in them. In Marsha Linehan's view, the sensitivity, intensity, and duration with which people with BPD feel emotions have {{both positive and negative}} effects. People with BPD are often exceptionally enthusiastic, idealistic, joyful, and loving. However, they may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions ("anxiety, depression, guilt/shame, worry, anger, etc."), experiencing intense grief instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead <b>of</b> <b>annoyance,</b> and panic instead of nervousness.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, All in the Family added two new neighbors to the neighborhood, Frank Lorenzo and his feisty Irish-American wife, Irene. Lear had been the {{publicity}} man for Call Me Mister, All in the Family writers Bernard West and Mickey West knew Garrett from her days with the American Youth Theatre, and Jean Stapleton {{had been in the}} cast of Bells Are Ringing, so Garrett appeared to be a frontrunner for the role of Irene. It went instead to Sada Thompson, but, unhappy after filming one episode, Thompson asked to be released from her commitment, freeing the role for Garrett. Irene was Catholic -- a source <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> for Protestant Archie -- and assumed many of the household duties normally associated with husbands, and she therefore presented a kind of nemesis to Archie Bunker. She later worked with Archie at his place of employment, driving a forklift, and was paid less than the man she replaced (but more than Archie). Garrett remained with the series from 1973 through 1975. She won the 1974 Golden Globe for her performance on the series.|$|E
25|$|As a {{reaction}} to this criticism units based at Celle voluntarily restrict themselves to circle the aerodrome only over the mostly uninhabited area {{to the south of}} the air base and to avoid training approaches over Westercelle as much as possible. Flight movements at lunch time are kept to a minimum. Approach as well as departure over densely populated areas is prohibited. These restrictions relieve the built-up areas surrounding the air base of noise pollution to a certain degree. They have, however, the effect that flight movements are now channelled along the remaining routes permitted leading to an increase of noise and <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> to the population affected. Since many retired soldiers and staff formerly working at the base still live in and around Celle there are not only critics of the air base but also supporters who voice their opinion in various forums and letters to the editor stressing the economic factor of the air base {{and the fact that the}} air base had existed since 1934 so that the opponents were in full knowledge of its existence when they bought property at reduced prices in its vicinity.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} Pythian ode, {{composed}} in 470 BC {{in honour of}} the Sicilian tyrant Hieron, Pindar celebrated a series of victories by Greeks against foreign invaders: Athenian and Spartan-led victories against Persia at Salamis and Plataea, and victories by the western Greeks led by Theron of Acragas and Hieron against the Carthaginians and Etruscans at the battles of Himera and Cumae. Such celebrations were not appreciated by his fellow Thebans: they had sided with the Persians and had incurred many losses and privations {{as a result of}} their defeat. His praise of Athens with such epithets as bulwark of Hellas (fragment 76) and city of noble name and sunlit splendour (Nemean 5) induced the authorities in Thebes to fine him 5000 drachmae, to which the Athenians are said to have responded with a gift of 10000 drachmae. According to another account, the Athenians even made him their proxenus or consul in Thebes. His association with the fabulously rich Hieron was another source <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> at home. It was probably in response to Theban sensitivities over this issue that he denounced the rule of tyrants (i.e. rulers like Hieron) in an ode composed shortly after a visit to Hieron's sumptuous court in 476–75 BC (Pythian 11).|$|E
500|$|Later in his reign, Ernest's actions {{managed to}} {{continually}} anger his sister-in-law. Though Victoria loved Ernest {{because he was}} Albert's brother, she was displeased that Ernest was writing his memoirs, worrying about their contents mainly in regard to her dead husband. Despite their disputes, Ernest still met with Victoria and her family occasionally. In 1891, they met in France; Victoria's lady-in-waiting commented [...] "the old Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha has been here today with his wife. He is the Prince Consort's only brother and an awful looking man, the Queen dislikes him particularly. He is always writing anonymous pamphlets against the Queen and the Empress Frederick, which naturally creates a great deal <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> in the family".|$|E

500|$|The only British {{military}} {{presence on the}} island was a garrison of about 450 men from the Royal American Regiment {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel George Etherington, most of whom were poorly trained recruits and about half of whom were unfit for duty. Etherington, rather than training and drilling his troops, or fully staffing the island's outposts, was employing significant numbers of them to clear land on an estate on the north-west side of the island. [...] Etherington's estate was on territory on the Carib side of the island, and its grant (for Etherington's service in the Seven Years' War, but made under circumstances the Caribs viewed as illegal) was a major source <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> to the Caribs. [...] Governor de Bouillé had established regular contact with the Caribs, and was supplying them with arms. [...] In late August 1778 French officials met with Carib leader Joseph Chatoyer, and in early September Governor Morris was confronted by Caribs bearing new French muskets {{on a tour of the}} border areas.|$|E
500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details now seem discredited.|$|E
500|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Civil Aviation Act aircraft in flight are specifically exempted from trespass and nuisance controls, which denies any form of redress to those living near airports who are disturbed by noise. Government sanctioned measurements of noise near airports take an average sound level, measured in decibels (dB), over a 16‑hour day, and are expressed as an LAeq figure. Officially, 57dB LAeq is the threshold at which noise levels become disturbing, 63dB LAeq represents moderate disturbance, whilst 69dB LAeq represents high disturbance. Technological improvements in aircraft design means that aircraft are becoming quieter. Taking Heathrow as an example, between 1990 and 2004 the area around the airport affected by noise levels of 57 db LAeq and above fell by 60 per cent, whilst the number of people similarly affected fell by 51 per cent. Campaign groups dispute the methodology used to measure noise, asserting that it is flawed in a number of ways. Amongst other issues they point to the World Health Organisation view that annoyance begins at 50 db LAeq whilst serious annoyance begins at 55dB LAeq, and they assert that the LAeq measurement does not give sufficient weight to the increasing incidence of noise events. Their conclusion is that noise levels, and the number of people affected, have increased rather than decreased. This is borne out by the latest survey of attitudes to noise published in November 2007 which reports that, compared with over 20years ago, more people today are annoyed by the same level of noise as measured by LAeq. Whilst this may be attributable to changing attitudes, the report concludes that the contribution of aircraft numbers to annoyance has increased, and that an alternative method of estimating levels <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> that takes this into account would appear to be more relevant than the LAeq measurement. The report has attracted criticism in peer reviews, and one such review, characterising the survey as inconclusive, counsels [...] "...against using the detailed ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for School Library Journal, Cara von Wrangel Kinsey found Fairy Cube [...] "more {{accessible}} than Yuki's previous works," [...] despite covering {{subjects such}} as murder and revenge. A. E. Sparrow of IGN gave the first volume a favorable review, enjoying the series' different view of the fairies. Mania Entertainment's Danielle Van Gorder wrote that the story {{reminded her of the}} pre-Victorian version of the fairytale [...] "Snow White" [...] or the British Sidhe fairies, in her review of the first volume. Van Gorder worried that the cover would mislead readers into believing that it was [...] "a light and fluffy kind of story" [...] and drive away the target audience. In a follow-up review of the final volume, she wrote that the conclusion of the series was less confusing than that of Yuki's earlier work Angel Sanctuary (1994–2000) and thought the story was [...] "well-executed," [...] though it still had some flaws. Rating the series 3 out of 4 stars, Jason Thompson, author of [...] (2007), wrote that while it reminded him of Angel Sanctuary, it covered [...] "more original subject matter" [...] and had [...] "tighter" [...] plotting. Anime News Network's Casey Brienza highly recommended the first volume, praising her inclusion of Celtic mythology. She enjoyed the plot and described the cover as beautiful, though she disliked the artistic inconsistencies caused by Yuki's use of assistants. According to [...] Katherine Dacey of PopCultureShock in her review of the first volume, the story succeeded through Yuki's use of [...] "outlandish touches," [...] creating [...] "an intoxicating—if occasionally ridiculous—mix of horror, romance, and revenge." [...] In her review of the final volume, Dacey expressed her feelings <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> that the characters spent much of the volume talking with very little action, and wrote that the story, despite a promising start, went downhill with the introduction of the beauty contest in the second volume. Categorizing [...] "Psycho Knocker" [...] as [...] "comeuppance theater," [...] she enjoyed it more than Fairy Cubes conclusion, though still wrote that [...] "it isn't her best work." [...] A reviewer of the French edition disliked how quickly the story progressed, commenting that the protagonists' personalities were not fully explored as a result. The reviewer praised the covers of the first and third volumes as [...] "magnificent".|$|E
500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards equivocation. [...] Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by [...] "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards [...] "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" [...] apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. [...] Mrs Russell, attractive to [...] "a number of clients among the youth, who are fond of beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her [...] "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". [...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated {{so as not to}} be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree <b>of</b> <b>annoyance</b> on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E
