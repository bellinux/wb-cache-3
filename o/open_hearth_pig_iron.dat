50|$|In 1945, {{the works}} had an output of around 200,000 tons (<b>pig</b> <b>iron)</b> pa, with its main {{products}} being angles, and rails. In 1947, the company received {{approval from the}} Iron and Steel board for a £1.7 million investment into the works, with a new blast furnace and 300 ton <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> steelmaking plant to be added, together with improvements to equipment intended to increase steel making capacity 40% to over 300,000 tons (<b>pig</b> <b>iron)</b> pa. In the same year the Loftus Ironstone Mine was transferred from the parent Pease and Partners to the Skinningrove company.|$|R
5000|$|Until recently, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was {{typically}} poured {{directly out of}} {{the bottom of the}} blast furnace through a [...] into a ladle car for transfer to the steel mill in mostly liquid form; in this state, the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was referred to as hot metal. The hot metal was then poured into a steelmaking vessel to produce steel, typically an electric arc furnace, induction furnace or basic oxygen furnace, where the excess carbon is burned off and the alloy composition controlled. Earlier processes for this included the finery forge, the puddling furnace, the Bessemer process, and the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace.|$|R
50|$|The Bessemer {{process was}} the first {{inexpensive}} industrial process for the mass production of steel from molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> before {{the development of the}} <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace. The key principle is removal of impurities from the iron by oxidation with air being blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.|$|R

50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>hearth</b> {{furnaces}} {{are one of}} {{a number}} of kinds of furnace where excess carbon and other impurities are burnt out of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to produce steel. Since steel is difficult to manufacture due to its high melting point, normal fuels and furnaces were insufficient and the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace was developed to overcome this difficulty. Compared to Bessemer steel, which it displaced, its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), was easier to control, and it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap iron and steel.|$|R
25|$|Cleveland Rolling Mill {{expanded}} {{its presence in}} 1868 {{with the construction of}} the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. By the end of 1872, the combined Cleveland plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state.|$|R
50|$|The {{product of}} the blast furnace, <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> is so called because of the odd shape {{acquired}} as the molten metal sets and cools in sand pits made for the purpose. The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is subjected to a refining process, from which it emerges {{in the form of}} ingots. The ingots pass through various departments, such as the <b>open</b> <b>hearth,</b> where they are refined further, and the rolling mill, where they are reduced, rolled, and sheared into required lengths. The sizes vary from 8-,10-, and 12 in in width to 30 ft in length. The annual capacity of the rolling mill is about 420,000 gross tons, and the product is classified as semi-finished.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> may be {{made into}} steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|R
2500|$|The Bessemer and <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> {{processes}} {{were much}} more efficient than making steel by the puddling process because they used the carbon in the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> {{as a source of}} heat. [...] The Bessemer (patented in 1855) and the Siemens-Martin (c. 1865) processes greatly reduced the cost of steel. By the end of the 19th century, Gilchirst-Thomas “basic” process had reduced production costs by 90% compared to the puddling process of the mid-century.|$|R

50|$|The {{puddling}} furnace is a metalmaking technology {{used to create}} wrought iron or steel from the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> produced in a blast furnace. The furnace is constructed to pull the hot air over the iron without the fuel coming into {{direct contact with the}} iron, a system generally known as a reverberatory furnace or <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace. The major advantage of this system is keeping the impurities of the fuel separated from the charge.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> {{process is}} a batch process and a batch is called a [...] "heat". The furnace is first {{inspected}} for possible damage. Once it is ready or repaired, it is charged with light scrap, such as sheet metal, shredded vehicles or waste metal. The furnace is heated using burning gas. Once it has melted, heavy scrap, such as building, construction or steel milling scrap is added, together with <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> from blast furnaces. Once all the steel has melted, slag forming agents, such as limestone, are added. The oxygen in iron oxide and other impurities decarburize the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> by burning excess carbon away, forming steel. To increase the oxygen contents of the heat, iron ore {{can be added to}} the heat.|$|R
50|$|In 1917 the Sharon Steel Hoop Company {{expanded}} by buying the Youngstown Iron and Steel Company, with a steel plant at Lowellville, and sheet mills in Youngstown. The newly purchased Lowellville Works {{was equipped with}} four <b>open</b> <b>hearths,</b> several soaking pits, a blooming mill, and bar mill, and the Youngstown Plant with eight sheet mills, a jobbing mill, and a 72” plate mill. The Sharon Steel Hoop Company also acquired the Mary Furnace from the Ohio Iron and Steel Company to secure a source of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> supply for the Lowellville Plant, and added to the Mary Plant two new <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces, a 34” reversing blooming mill, and a 21&$#148; bar mill, These improvements {{made it possible to}} abandon the now obsolete steel making facilities and blooming mill at the Sharon Works in 1920.|$|R
5000|$|Puddled iron—the {{puddling}} process {{was the first}} large-scale process to produce wrought iron. In the {{puddling process}}, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is refined in a reverberatory furnace to prevent harmful sulphur from the coal or coke from contaminating the <b>iron.</b> The molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is manually stirred and iron ore, an oxygen source, is added, which decarburizes the iron. As the iron is stirred, globs of wrought iron are collected into balls by the stirring rod (rabble arm or rod) and those are periodically removed by the puddler. Puddling was patented in 1784 and became widely used after 1800. By 1876, annual production of puddled iron in the UK alone was over 4 million tons. Around that time, the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace was able to produce steel of suitable quality for structural purposes, and wrought iron production went into decline.|$|R
50|$|The Lorraine steel {{industry}} grew rapidly from 1893 to 1913.Dreux undertook {{a series of}} upgrades to the plant, adding new blast furnaces to supply molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to six basic Bessemer converters at Mont-Saint-Martin.As of 1 May 1901 there were seven blast furnaces.Dreux set up Siemens-Martin <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces to make special steels, and mills to roll steel into different forms.Georges Rolland of the Corps des mines was made President of the Aciéries de Longwy in 1903. That year he also {{became a member of}} the board of the Comité des forges.|$|R

A second <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace was constructed in 1876, and the company leased the works and the Proton Furnace of the Cleveland Iron Co. in 1878. Cleveland Rolling Mill built a [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace at the leased site a year later, by which time Cleveland Rolling Mill occupied [...] of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood.|$|R
2500|$|Steel {{is often}} cited as {{the first of several}} new areas for {{industrial}} mass-production, which are said to characterise a [...] "Second Industrial Revolution", beginning around 1850, although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the 1860s, when Sir Henry Bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> into steel in large quantities. However, it only became widely available in the 1870s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality. [...] Bessemer steel was being displaced by the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace {{near the end of the}} 19th century.|$|R
50|$|During the company's early period, much of {{the works}} output (<b>pig</b> <b>iron)</b> was shipped to Scotland - changes in the iron and steel market caused the works to start {{producing}} steel on site. Under Hutchinson's management, the number of furnaces was increased to four and later five; other improvements included the installation of Cowper stoves for heat regeneration, use of the Talbot process (a continuous <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> process); and installation of electrically driven mill machinery. The works established its own mines at Boulby. The steel works were operational by 1911. Hutchinson remained manager {{until his death in}} 1918.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant was}} an {{integrated}} steel mill. Raw materials were shipped in by rail, processed into steel and steel products, and then reshipped by rail and truck to their final market. The plant, {{in addition to}} having all of the facilities for primary steel making, included on-site conversion of coal into coke, plus other facilities for post-processing of coal byproducts, including production of inorganic fertilizers. Blast furnaces converted raw <b>iron</b> ores into <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> and final conversion into steel was via <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces. Rolling mill facilities for forming steel into plate, pipe, and some structural shapes were also located there.|$|R

50|$|With the Carnegie-Illinois {{working at}} full {{capacity}} producing bar plates, the American Steel and Tin Plate Company and the American Steel and Wire Company, quick {{to realize the}} advantages of being near the source of bar plate output, in 1900 established themselves {{in close proximity to}} the Carnegie, and converted the Carnegie products into sheet steel, tin plate, and wire, respectively. These firms were added milestones to the progress of Farrell.Since the American Sheet and Tin Plate Company, the Carnegie, and the American Steel and Wire Company were now the mainstays if industry in Farrell, we should note some of the high points of their history. The original furnaces produced the first <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> on December 9, 1901. Six years later, on June 9, 1907, seven <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces were added, and nine years later, on March 21, 1916, three more were added. The first rolling mills began their operations on May 10, 1901, and the first <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> was made on April 30, 1901. The original bar and billet mill was replaced by the present mill in March, 1918.|$|R
50|$|Before about 1860 steel was an {{expensive}} product, made in small quantities and used mostly for swords, tools and cutlery; all large metal structures {{were made of}} wrought or cast iron. Steelmaking was centered in Sheffield, Britain, which supplied the European and the American markets. The introduction of cheap steel {{was due to the}} Bessemer and the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> processes, two technological advances made in England. In the Bessemer process, molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is converted to steel by blowing air through it after it was removed from the furnace. The air blast burned the carbon and silicon out of the <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> releasing heat and causing the temperature of the molten metal to rise. Henry Bessemer demonstrated the process in 1856 and had a successful operation going by 1864. By 1870 Bessemer steel was widely used for ship plate. By the 1850s, the speed, weight, and quantity of railway traffic was limited by the strength of the wrought iron rails in use. The solution was to turn to steel rails, which the Bessemer process made competitive in price. Experience quickly proved steel had much greater strength and durability and could handle the increasingly heavy and faster engines and cars.|$|R
2500|$|The Siemens-Martin process, or <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> process, {{produced}} a suitable grade structural steel. <b>Open</b> <b>hearth</b> steel displaced wrought iron as a structural {{material in the}} 1880s. [...] <b>Open</b> <b>hearth</b> steel began being used {{in a wide variety}} of applications including high rise buildings, ships, machinery, pipelines, rails and bridges.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> {{can also}} be used to produce gray iron. This is {{achieved}} by remelting <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> often along with substantial quantities of steel and scrap iron, removing undesirable contaminants, adding alloys, and adjusting the carbon content. Some <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> grades are suitable for producing ductile iron. These are high purity <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> and depending on the grade of ductile iron being produced these <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> may be low in the elements silicon, manganese, sulfur and phosphorus. These types of <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> are used to dilute all the elements (except carbon) in a ductile iron charge which may be harmful to the ductile iron process.|$|R
50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} eventually {{replaced the}} <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace. It rapidly superseded both the Bessemer process and Siemens-Martin process in Western Europe by the 1950s and in Eastern Europe by the 1980s. The <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> steelmaking had superseded Bessemer process in UK by 1900, but elsewhere in Europe, especially in Germany, the Bessemer and Thomas processes were used {{until the late}} 1960s when they were superseded by basic oxygen steelmaking. The last <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace in the former East Germany was stopped in 1993. In the US, steel production using the Bessemer process ended in 1968 and the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces had stopped by 1992. In Hunedoara steel works, Romania the last 420-tonne capacity <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace was shut down on 12 June 1999, demolished and scrapped between 2001 and 2003, but the eight smokestacks of the furnaces remained until February 2011. The last <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> shop in China was shut down in 2001. The nation with the highest share of steel produced with <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces (almost 50%) is Ukraine. The process is still in use in both India and Russia.|$|R
25|$|As Allaire's {{business}} grew, {{he found}} {{it increasingly difficult to}} source adequate amounts of quality <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> from which to manufacture his engines. The best quality <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was imported from Britain, but high tariffs made it uneconomic to use. The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> industry in the United States was at this time still in its infancy, and producing neither the quality nor quantity of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> required.|$|R
5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> furnaces to convert <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|R
40|$|The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the traditional blast furnace process by Kobe Steel. The process aimed to produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets, which have similar chemical and physical properties to blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> in a single step. The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget process utilizes coal instead of coke and self reducing and fluxing dried green balls instead of pellets and sinters. In this process the environmental emissions caused by coke and sinter production, and energy lost between pellet induration (heat hardening) and transportation to the blast furnace can be eliminated. The objectives of this research were to (1) produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets in the laboratory, (2) characterize the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget produced and compare them with blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> (3) investigate the furnace temperature and residence time effects on the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget production, and (4) optimize the operational furnace temperatures and residence times. The experiments involved heat treatment of self reducing and fluxing dried green balls at various furnace temperatures and residence times. Three chemically and physically different products were produced after the compete reduction of iron oxides to iron depending on the operational furnace temperatures and/or residence times. These products were direct reduced iron (DRI), transition direct reduced <b>iron</b> (TDRI), and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets. The increase in the carbon content of the system as a function of furnace temperature and/or residence time dictated the formation of these products. The direct reduced iron, transition direct reduced <b>iron,</b> and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced were analyzed for their chemical composition, degree of metallization, apparent density, microstructure and microhardness. In addition, the change in the carbon content of the system with the changing furnace temperature and/or residence time was detected by optical microscopy and Microhardness measurements. The sufficient carbon dissolution required for the production of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets was determined. It was determined that <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced had a high apparent density (6. 7 - 7. 2 gr/cm 3), highly metallized, slag free structure, high iron content (95 - 97 %), high microhardness values (> 325 HVN) and microstructure similar to white cast iron. These properties made them a competitive alternative to blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron...</b>|$|R

In June 1970 the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency gave U.S. Steel three years to conduct a study of its harmful emissions at the Duluth Works and a two-year follow-up window to implement corrective actions.
