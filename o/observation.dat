5|$|All <b>observation</b> {{involves}} both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an <b>observation</b> passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all <b>observation</b> is theory-laden.|$|E
