500|$|Although King Henry doubtless {{intended}} to tie political opponents together, John's marriage to Elizabeth of York {{may have had}} the unintended consequence of tying Suffolk to York's future opposition of Henry. And, as Hicks says, Suffolk [...] "once again hazarded the future of his House" [...] by involvement in national politics. The year following their marriage, York's political opposition to Henry had become an armed campaign. Following their rout at Ludford Bridge in October 1459, Suffolk's brother-in-law and allies had been forced into exile and attainted at the Coventry parliament. Suffolk himself appears to have taken no part in York's military campaign, but according to one contemporary chronicler, at the same parliament, Suffolk was stripped of his dukedom and reduced {{to the rank of}} earl, because he had married a daughter of York. Official records continued to refer to John as duke, and in any case, as he was still strictly a minor, and not in <b>official</b> <b>receipt</b> of any of his titles, {{it may not have been}} true. Or, if it did happen, it may well have been on the grounds of his fiscal inability to uphold the status of a duke.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the height}} of the settlement's extent, there were five {{thousand}} Norse Catholics in two settlements. Sixteen parishes and churches were founded along with several monasteries and a convent for Benedictine nuns. Churches built in Greenland were not independent properties owned by the church, but were built on farmland given by local farmers and other chief villagers, and collected a part of the tithes given to the church and sent them to the archbishop in Nidaros. Attempts were made in nearby Scandinavian countries {{to take control of the}} local churches, and Norway's control of trade with Greenland in 1261 may have put pressure on local churches to become independent, just as they had in Norway. [...] Bishop Arnes in 1281 contributed to Peter's Pence and the expenses of the Crusades with walrus tusks and polar bear hides, and tithing continued in later years by selling raw materials for gold and silver. The introduction of Christianity is thought to have caused a major cultural break from the past, introducing many mainland European ideas and practices, such as the building of large churches and cathedrals, and this connection was maintained by the fact that the bishops appointed to Greenland were from Scandinavia, and not locals. At least until 1327, the Vatican made an <b>official</b> <b>receipt</b> of six years worth of tithes from Greenland. Sixteen to eighteen bishops held the title of Bishop of Gardar during the diocese history, though few are thought to have actually resided in Greenland. In 1341, the bishop of Bergen sent a representative named Ivar Bardarson, who returned to Norway with detailed lists of all church properties, which is thought by some to indicate the church was attempting to become more independent in Greenland.|$|E
