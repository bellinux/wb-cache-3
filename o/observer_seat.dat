5|$|Before {{the final}} vote, Parliament demanded {{a number of}} {{concessions}} {{as part of a}} future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings.

One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.|$|E

50|$|The Merlin powered Balliol, {{designated}} Balliol T.2, first flew on 10 July 1948, {{and after}} extensive evaluation, it was chosen over the Athena, with large orders being placed to replace {{some of the}} Harvards in RAF service.

50|$|The Albatros C.I was {{the first}} of the {{successful}} C-series of two-seat general-purpose biplanes built by Albatros Flugzeugwerke during World War I.

5000|$|The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was accorded {{observer}} status within the United Nations on 22 November 1974, having been recognised {{as the sole}} legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The State of Palestine was proclaimed on 15 November 1988 in Algiers at an extraordinary session in exile of the Palestine National Council, citing the partition plan of 1947 as legal justification.

25|$|One issue {{treated as}} {{secondary}} at the inquiry was the {{presence in the}} flight deck <b>observer's</b> <b>seat</b> of Captain Collins. The Lane report recommended greater caution in allowing off-duty flight crew members to occupy flight deck seats, and aired speculation that Collins might have been distracting his colleagues. The report noted that Collins' body {{was found to be}} holding a can of aerosol air freshener in its right hand. Sources close to the events of the time suggest that Collins played an altogether more positive role by attempting to lower the leading-edge devices in the final seconds of the flight; Eric Pritchard, a Trident captain who happened to be the first airman at the accident site, recalled that a fireman had stated that Collins was lying across the centre pedestal and noted himself that his earphones had fallen into the right-hand-side footwell of the flight deck, diagonally across from the <b>observer's</b> <b>seat,</b> as might be expected if he had attempted to intervene as a last resort.|$|R

50|$|The {{member states}} {{entitled}} to <b>observer</b> <b>seats</b> {{were supposed to}} make provisions before the 2009 elections for who would get the additional seats in the European Parliament.

In December 2011, they took their seats.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{photographs}} of B.E.2ds supplied to Belgium {{make it clear}} that not only were these re-engined with Hispano engines, but {{at least some of them}} had the pilot and <b>observer's</b> <b>seating</b> positions reversed, giving the latter a much better field of fire for his gun(s). At least some Belgian B.E.2cs were similarly modified, at least one even being fitted with a Scarff ring over the rear cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|The B.E.2d was a {{dual control}} version. Otherwise {{identical}} to the [...] "c" [...] variant it had full controls in the front cockpit {{as well as in}} the rear. This modification meant that there was no longer room for the fuel tank under the <b>observer's</b> <b>seat,</b> which had to be replaced by a centre section gravity tank; in order to give the [...] "d" [...] a superior endurance this tank was unusually large, adding extra weight and drag that reduced the type's performance, particularly in the climb. Most B.E.2ds were used as trainers, and the few used on operations by the RFC seem to have been flown from the normal (rear) pilots' seat. On the other hand, photographs of B.E.2ds supplied to Belgium make it clear that not only were these re-engined with Hispano engines, but at least some of them had the pilot and <b>observer's</b> <b>seating</b> positions reversed, giving the latter a much better field of fire for his gun(s).

25|$|The {{designation}} B.E.2a {{was given}} to production aircraft. The B.E.2a designation first appeared on a drawing dated 20 February 1912, this shows an aircraft with unequal span wings with slight dihedral. These differed from B.E.1 and B.E.2 in having a revised fuel system, in which the streamlined gravity tank below the centre section of the wing was moved to a position behind the engine. The main fuel tank remained under the <b>observer's</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{flight crew}} {{consisted}} of two pilots, both ranked as captains; the captain was aged 42, {{with a total of}} 4,914 flying hours and the co-pilot was 45, with a total of 6,922 flying hours. There was also an <b>observer</b> <b>seated</b> in the cockpit jump seat, who had a total of 16,121 flying hours. There were also two flight attendants as cabin crew. All crew members were Taiwanese citizens; the copilot was a dual New Zealand-Taiwanese citizen.|$|R
