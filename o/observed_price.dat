5000|$|The main {{economic}} issues that arise with tariffication {{stem from the}} nonequivalence of tariffs in NTBs {{in a number of}} scenarios. The issue analyzes nonequivalence arising from the existence of imperfect competition in importing countries, price instability in importing and exporting countries, and inefficient allocation of quantitative restrictions. It is shown that in all these cases the definition of an appropriate [...] "equivalent tariff" [...] to be used in tariffication is not straightforward, and that in general this equivalent tariff cannot be computed on the basis of only <b>observed</b> <b>price</b> differences between countries. Tariff-rate quotas, which are meant to be the main tool in implement tariffication according to the existing proposal, are analyzed in some detail. Concerning the relationship between tariffication and the other elements of the trade liberalization package, it is shown that tariffication would limit the scope of export subsidy policies, and that the existence of production and export subsidies makes <b>observed</b> <b>price</b> gaps between countries of questionable value in setting equivalent tariff levels. Finally, it is argued that the main focus on tariffication should be the conversion of NTBs to acceptable long-run (bound) tariffs rates, and considerable flexibility in the conversion process could be exercised during the transition period.|$|E
50|$|A {{price action}} trader's {{analysis}} may start with classical technical analysis, e.g. Edwards and Magee patterns including trend lines, break-outs, and pull-backs, which are broken down further and supplemented with extra bar-by-bar analysis, sometimes including volume. This <b>observed</b> <b>price</b> action gives the trader {{clues about the}} current and likely future behaviour of other market participants. The trader can explain why a particular pattern is predictive, in terms of bulls (buyers in the market), bears (sellers), the crowd mentality of other traders, change in volume and other factors. A good knowledge of the market's make-up is required. The resulting picture that a trader builds up will not only seek to predict market direction, but also speed of movement, duration and intensity, {{all of which is}} based on the trader's assessment and prediction of the actions and reactions of other market participants.|$|E
5000|$|The year-by-year {{chain linking}} method differs {{from some other}} {{techniques}} for compensating for monetary inflation and deflation {{that are used in}} economics, such as the consumer price index. The consumer price index uses the <b>observed</b> <b>price</b> of a set 'market basket' of goods and services in any two given years to determine the relative prices in those two years; it does not rely on a cumulative accounting of changes in the intervening years. The consumer price index is thus an example of a fixed-weight compensation method; fixed weight methods relate prices in all years to some single base year. The problem is that the compensation factor derived from any index depends on the weights given to the various items in the market-basket [...] - [...] or the proportions of each item in whatever aggregate amount is being looked at [...] - [...] and the weights that were correct for one time may not be correct for other times. For example, in 1850 the price of horse-fodder would have been an important component of overall price levels, but now it is not. If one is comparing 1850 price levels to present ones, then, the question arises, what weight to give to horse-fodder? It is difficult to know. The chain linking method attempts to avoid this conundrum by never making large leaps in time.|$|E

However, when informed traders also <b>observe</b> <b>prices,</b> uninformed traders generate reversals by engaging in contrarian trading.

Transport costs (both marine and road haulage) were found to account for only a relatively small part of the <b>observed</b> <b>price</b> differentials. Other major causes of price differentials between the island economy and the mainland were found to include: high stockholding and inventory costs; the failure to exploit economies of scale fully in the on-island wholesaling and retailing sectors (as a result of small market size); and imperfect competition among island business sectors. The study highlights the difficulties faced in integrating island and mainland economies. Freight transport improvements alone cannot eliminate price differentials...|$|E

By incorporating the probabilistic thresholds for gain and loss, we describe the fuzziness of the cut-off points for the transaction utility.

The results of model calibration show that the proposed model significantly improves the model fit compared to the existing reference price models, and that the thresholds vary quite significantly over time and across consumers.

40|$|We employ an {{overlapping}} generations {{model of}} a financial market to demonstrate that, in equilibrium, investors can become skittish in that they appear to overreact to earnings news during some stretches of time. In an equilibrium with investor skittishness, price deviates from steady state equilibrium price and can be highly volatile relative to a steady state equilibrium price. In addition, price levels are, on average, higher than steady state price levels and can revert back to near steady state prices only if subsequent earnings news is bad. Our findings suggest that <b>observed</b> <b>price</b> volatility can vary significantly over time, with episodes of excessive volatility, even though fundamentals exhibit constant volatility. In addition, <b>observed</b> <b>price</b> to earnings relations can be quite unstable even though fundamentals Keynes is credited with the observation that short horizon investors naturally concern themselves with predicting the beliefs of future investors regarding a firm’s equity value, as opposed to predicting the firm’s fundamental equity value (e. g., present value of the discounte...|$|E
