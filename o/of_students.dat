5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number <b>of</b> <b>students</b> required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number <b>of</b> <b>students</b> required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number <b>of</b> <b>students</b> enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number <b>of</b> <b>students</b> to take an AP exam in its first year.

Education majors at Northern Illinois University were presented with information about a hypothetical fourth-grade student.

Additionally, the impact <b>of</b> <b>student</b> physical attractiveness on teachers' attributions, judgments <b>of</b> <b>student</b> academic potential, and evaluations <b>of</b> <b>student</b> misbehavior were assessed. Results did not support student physical attractiveness as having a significant influence on teachers' judgments.

Europe is the last bastion (some might say the last refuge) in the world of fully (or almost fully) tax-supported higher education, extending in many countries beyond free higher education to at least some governmental, or taxpayer, responsibility for expanding higher educational participation and equity with need-based grants covering some of the costs <b>of</b> <b>student</b> living. However, there is a long tradition in Scandinavia <b>of</b> the <b>student</b> bearing all or most of the financial responsibility for food, lodging, and other costs <b>of</b> <b>student</b> living—generally through partially subsidized student loans (in Sweden, loans of the income contingent variety). This long tradition <b>of</b> <b>student</b> contributions in Scandinavia, plus the increasing expenses <b>of</b> <b>student</b> living costs everywhere in Europe, coupled with low and frequently diminishing (in the UK virtually disappearing) cost-of-living grants from the government, has kept the question <b>of</b> <b>student</b> contributions [...] and thus <b>of</b> <b>student</b> loans [...] at least on the table in many countries of Europe...|$|R
