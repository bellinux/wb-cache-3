5|$|The first {{chairman}} of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly was the scholar Nguyễn Văn Tố; {{he was not a}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> On 3March 1946, under the chairmanship of Nguyễn Văn Tố, the National Assembly formed the first government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

While he was never a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> he was a committed revolutionary. Tôn Đức Thắng succeeded Bùi Bằng Đoàn as chairman in 1955, and was the first chairman to be a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> Trường Chinh became the fourth and longest-serving {{chairman of}} the National Assembly in Vietnamese history, holding the post from 1960 to 1981, when he became {{chairman of the}} State Council, a newly established post.

5|$|Following Joseph Stalin's {{consolidation}} {{of power in}} the 1920s the post of the General Secretary of the Central Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> became synonymous with 'Leader of the Soviet Union' because the post controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet Government. The post of the General Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary; in 1966 Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>communist</b> <b>party,</b> the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990. The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader, the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo, the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The President of the Soviet Union, an office created in March 1990, replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.|$|E
