5000|$|Lymphocytic choriomeningitis is a {{particular}} concern in obstetrics, as vertical transmission is known to occur. For immunocompetent mothers, {{there is no significant}} threat, but the virus has damaging effects upon the fetus. If infection occurs during the first trimester, LCMV results in an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Later congenital infection may lead to malformations such as intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, microcephaly or macrocephaly, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. Other findings include chorioretinal scars, and optic atrophy. Chorioretinitis, which is followed by chorioretinal scarring, is the most common <b>ocular</b> <b>lesion.</b> [...] Mortality among infants is approximately 30%. Among the survivors, two thirds have lasting neurologic abnormalities.|$|E

The first patient was a 59 -year-old man presented with a mass in the right eye. The histological and immunohistochemical profile of the biopsy showed a probable renal cell carcinoma.

The second patient was a 72 -year-old man presenting with an ulcerated lesion on the right inferior tarsal conjunctiva. An excisional biopsy of the lesion showed histological and immunohistochemical patterns of a clear cell carcinoma. Abdominal tomography disclosed a right peripheral renal tumor. A right radical nephrectomy was performed. Renal cell carcinoma may present atypically with metastases to quite uncommon organs. Nephrectomy may be of value in selected cases; the ocular metastases are usually excised for aesthetic and functional reasons...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{autoimmune}} uveitis {{and finally}} panophthalmitis could {{be produced in}} mice by repeated immunization of syngeneic eyeball extract mixed with Klebsiella O 3 lipopolysaccharide (KO 3 LPS) as a powerful immunological adjuvant. No <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> were produced in mice given eyeball extract emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), KO 3 LPS alone or eyeball extract alone. Histopathological changes in the <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> at the early stage after the second or tertiary immunization were characterized by infiltration with inflammatory cells in the ciliary body and iris. The iridocyclitis was followed by extensive infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) into the cornea, lens and the surrounding tissues after repeated immunization. Finally, these areas were replaced by granulomatous tissues infiltrated with mononuclear cells. On the other hand, {{the structure of the}} retina and sclera was partially preserved. Those mice exhibited production of autoantibodies and development of the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to syngeneic eyeball extract. Moreover, <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> could be produced in normal recipient mice by transfer of sensitized lymphocytes from hyperimmunized mice. Therefore, it was suggested that the <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> produced by repeated immunization with the mixture of eyeball extract and KO 3 LPS were due to the autoimmune mechanism.

40|$|Ligneous {{conjunctivitis}} is {{a severe}} and rare chronic “idiopathic membraneous” conjunctivitis, {{characterized by the}} formation of pseudomembranes mostly on the palpebral surfaces that progressively replace the normal mucosa. Evidence has been provided that ligneous conjunctivitis {{is caused by a}} severe systemic plasminogen deficiency with decreased plasminogen antigen and decreased plasminogen functional activities. Objective of the present study is to verify the hypothesis that a topical eye application of plasminogen is able to ameliorate the consequences of this disease. Here we report the results of pre-clinical studies performed to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of an eye-drop plasminogen preparation in B 6. 129 P 2 -Plgtm 1 Jld transgenic mice, a model of ligneous conjunctivitis.

Although the finding of typical and multiple ocular lesions indicates VHL, the risk of multisystem disease in those presenting with a single <b>ocular</b> <b>lesion</b> has not been determined.

40|$|Many persons {{infected}} with Toxoplasma gondii develop <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions,</b> Immunologic parameters in {{the response to}} I gondii were evaluated in infected persons with and without <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> and in noninfected controls. Subjects were divided into groups {{on the basis of}} presence of serum antibodies to I: gondii, presence of <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions,</b> and clinical history. Production of interleukin- 2 and interferon-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with probable congenital toxoplasmosis was decreased, compared with that in persons with presumed acquired infection. Cell proliferation and delayed-type skin reaction induced by soluble toxoplasma tachyzoite antigen followed the same pattern. Asymptomatic persons showed high levels of interleukin- 12 and interferon-gamma, whereas persons with <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> had high interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha responses toward soluble toxoplasma tachyzoite antigen. These data suggest that patients with ocular disease due to congenital infection show tolerance toward the parasite. Furthermore, susceptibility to <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> after acquired toxoplasmosis is associated with high levels of interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, whereas resistance is associated with high levels of interleukin- 12 and interferon-gamma.

40|$|CASE HISTORY: In September 2004 two hinds on Farm 1 were {{observed}} with epiphora and keratoconjunctivitis, and corneal scarring. A low pregnancy rate in some hinds had been recorded that year. In {{the same year}} six yearling deer {{were observed}} on Farm 2 with keratitis, uveitis and corneal scarring. CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: On Farm 1, conjunctival swabs and blood samples were collected from the hinds with <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions,</b> and from 24 other hinds. The two affected hinds were immunosuppressed with dexamethasone for 7 days. Conjunctival, nasal and vaginal swabs were collected daily before euthanasia and necropsy on the eighth day. Subsequently, another five non-pregnant hinds were similarly immunosuppressed and necropsied, and the reproductive tracts of 20 non-pregnant hinds were collected following slaughter. Semen samples were collected from four stags implicated with reproductive failure. On Farm 2, conjunctival swabs were collected from six hinds with <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> and from 14 unaffected deer. Viral culture, consensus primer PCR and sequencing for specific herpesviruses was carried out on conjunctival swabs, buffy coat from blood samples, semen and reproductive tracts. Necropsy samples were also examined using gross pathology and histopathology. On Farm 1, a type 2 rhadinovirus (CvRhV) was detected in the conjunctiva of one hind with keratoconjunctivitis using PCR. Following immunosuppression, gross vesicular and histological vaginal lesions typical of infection with alphaherpesvirus were observed in samples of vaginal tissue from the same hind. Buffy coat, vaginal and lumbar spinal nervous tissues were also positive for cervid herpesvirus 1 (CvHV- 1) using PCR. Herpesviruses were not detected in reproductive tracts, ocular or semen samples of the other deer. CvRhV was detected in buffy coats from four other hinds and in a conjunctival swab from one hind, all without <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions,</b> using PCR. On Farm 2, conjunctival swabs from two deer with keratitis were culture positive for CvHV- 1. Two culture-negative conjunctival samples from deer without <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions</b> were positive for CvHV- 1 by PCR. In two other affected animals, presence of CvRhV was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. DIAGNOSIS: Infection with CvHV- 1 associated with keratitis and vulvovaginitis, and CvRhV infection in deer with and without <b>ocular</b> <b>lesions.</b> CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CvHV- 1 is a likely cause of keratoconjunctivitis and possibly reproductive tract pathology in deer.
