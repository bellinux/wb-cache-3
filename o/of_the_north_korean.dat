5|$|Over two weeks, North Korean and South Korean ground units {{fought in}} several bloody back-and-forth battles, taking and retaking ground in which neither {{was able to}} gain the upper hand.

5|$|The Chaplain–Medic {{massacre}} was a {{war crime}} {{that took place in}} the Korean War on July 16, 1950, on a mountain above the village of Tuman, South Korea.

5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} the North Korean {{line and}} cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> units began conducting delaying actions attempting {{to get as much}} of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18–19. After the forces there, the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Naktong River positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.|$|E

5|$|After the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the US Army's 2nd Infantry Division {{was moved}} to defend the Naktong River line. The division, which was untried in combat, was struck with a strong attack by several {{divisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division's line. The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half, and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Yongsan, promoting a fight there.|$|E
5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 4th Infantry Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E
5|$|As a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{build-up}} in the south, the untried NK 7th Division also arrived near Masan {{with another}} 10,000 men. The 7th Division occupied key ports {{to protect the}} 6th Division against possible amphibious landings in its rear. Eventually, though, the division was committed to combat {{in conjunction with other}} North Korean units. The simultaneous attacks were hoped to overwhelm UN lines.|$|E

2500|$|On <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> Foreign Ministry {{stated that}} [...] "if the U.S. keeps pestering us and {{increases}} pressure, we will {{regard it as}} {{a declaration of war}} and will take a series of physical corresponding measures".|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, {{which was based}} in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, {{and most of its}} equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was {{the only part of the}} U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Despite American counterattacks, the North Koreans {{were able}} to {{continue}} pressing forward and take Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By August 10 the entire NK 4th Division was across the river and beginning to move south, outflanking the American lines. The next day, scattered elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces attacked Yongsan. The North Korean forces repeatedly attacked US lines at night, when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E
5|$|Five North Korean Army (KPA) {{divisions}} massed {{around the}} city preparing to cross the Naktong River and assault it {{from the north and}} west. Defending the city were the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK II Corps. In a series of engagements, each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> divisions attempted to cross the Naktong and attack the defending forces. The success of these attacks varied by region, but attacks in the 1st Cavalry Division sector were repulsed and the attacks in the South Korean sector were more successful.|$|E
50|$|North Korea had {{developed}} {{weapons of mass}} destruction for several years prior to the Bush administration, and the Clinton administration had sought to trade economic assistance for an end to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> WMD program.

5|$|Forces of the South Korean Republic of Korea Army, {{supported}} by the United States Navy and United States Air Force, defended the eastern coast {{of the country as}} a part of the Pusan Perimeter. When several divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Army crossed through mountainous terrain to push the UN forces back, a complicated battle ensued in the rugged terrain around P'ohang-dong, which contained the vital supply line to the main UN force at Taegu.|$|E
5|$|Having {{pushed back}} U.S. forces at both Osan and Pyongtaek, the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, {{supported}} by elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 105th Armored Division, continued their advance down the Osan–Chonan road, up to 12,000 men strong under division commander Lee Kwon Mu in two infantry regiments supported {{by dozens of}} tanks. They were well trained, well equipped, and had high morale following previous victories, giving them advantages over the poorly trained and inexperienced Americans.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 25, 1950, ten {{divisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.|$|E
5000|$|After a joint Chinese and <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> assault {{breached}} <b>the</b> UN defenses at Chuncheon on New Year's Eve <b>of</b> 1951, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> [...] V Corps {{attacked the}} US X Corps at Wonju while <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> II Corps harassed US X Corps' rear {{by engaging in}} guerrilla warfare. In response, the US X Corps under <b>the</b> command <b>of</b> Major General Edward Almond managed to cripple <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces at Wonju, and the UN forces later carried {{out a number of}} anti-guerrilla operations against <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infiltrators.

5|$|Once {{again the}} fatal {{weakness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were {{not capable of}} exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean 2nd and 9th Divisions {{were almost}} {{completely}} {{destroyed in the}} battles. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men {{at the beginning of}} the offensive on September 1. The 2nd Division numbered 6,000. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the fight. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops had been killed, captured or deserted. All of NK II Corps was in a similar state, and the North Korean army, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, a {{newly formed}} unit {{consisting}} mostly of inexperienced new arrivals, {{was ordered to}} move to the South Korean village of Hadong to hold the pass there from advancing forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Army. Unprepared for combat, the American forces walked into an ambush in which most of the battalion's command staff was killed in the pass, leaving lower-ranking soldiers to mount a disorganized defence against North Korean troops occupying prepared positions on higher ground.|$|E
