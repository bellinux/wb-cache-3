40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Heat {{generation}} {{is a major}} safety concern {{in the design and}} development of Li ion batteries (LIBs) for large scale applications, such as electric vehicles. The total heat generation in LIBs includes entropic heat, enthalpy, reaction heat, and heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing.</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the influence <b>of</b> heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> on the LIBs and to understand whether it is necessary to consider the heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> during the design and development of LIBs. In the previous research, Thomas and Newman derived methods to compute heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in LIB cells. Their results show that the heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> cannot be neglected in comparison with the other heat sources at 2 C rate. In this study, the heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in different materials, porosity, particle sizes, and charging/discharging rate was investigated. A COMSOL mathematical model was built to simulate the heat generation of LIBs. The LIB model was based on Newman’s model. LiMn 2 O 4 and LiCoO 2 were applied as the cathode materials, and LiC 6 was applied as the anode material. The results <b>of</b> heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> were compared with the other heat sources to investigate the weight <b>of</b> heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in the total heat generation. The heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in cathode is smaller than the heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> in anode, because of the diffusivity of LiCoO 2 is 1 × 10 - 13 m 2 /s, which is larger than LiC 6 's diffusivity 2. 52 × 10 - 14 m 2 /s. In the comparison, the heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> is not as much as the irreversible heat and reversible heat, but it still cannot be neglected. Finally, a special situation will be discussed, which is the heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing</b> under the relaxation status. For instance, after the drivers turn off their vehicles, the entropy, ix enthalpy and reaction heat in LIBs will stop generating, but the heat will still be generated due to the release <b>of</b> heat <b>of</b> <b>mixing.</b> Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate to see if this process has significant influence on the safety and cycle life of LIBs.
