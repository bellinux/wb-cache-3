The campaign had been going on ever since the house was sold, but it was only now when facing eviction that the campaign got organized and began focusing on mass-mobilization. As the campaign got more and more attention in the media, the number of people started attending demonstrations in support of the house rapidly increased. The demonstrations grew from a couple of hundred people to numbering several thousands in just a few months. For {{the first time in its}} history, Ungdomshuset experienced massive support from people outside radical left-wing circles. Much of this support came from young people, some of whom had never even visited the house before. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> was later going to form the main bulk of protesters in the subsequent riots.|$|E

40|$|That <b>young</b> <b>people</b> today reside within social {{worlds of}} {{unprecedented}} 'risk' is a persuasive position. While such discourses {{have become increasingly}} pervasive, {{there has been little}} interest in exploring contemporary shifts within specific socio-geographic contexts: place has been largely invisible. This paper considers Ulrich Beck's 'risk society' theses as a framework for exploring the experiences of 85 young residents of a regional Australian centre. <b>These</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> stories revealed complex and often contradictory, tensions in relation to identity, uncertainty and responsibility. Socio-geographic location was found to be a significant feature in the negotiation and repercussion <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> lives...|$|R

The aim was to develop an understanding <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> interaction with their peers. It became apparent that {{all but one of}} the participants had been bullied. In this context, participants reported difficulties in developing friendships, although each participant received support from at least one of their peers. Given the hostile school environment participants did not necessarily talk to these individuals about their experiences in relation to their gender identity.

2500|$|According to one Rand biographer, {{most people}} first read Rand's works in their [...] "formative years." [...] Rand's former protégé Nathaniel Branden {{referred}} to Rand's [...] "especially powerful {{appeal to the}} young," [...] while Onkar Ghate of the Ayn Rand Institute said Rand [...] "appeals to the idealism of youth." [...] This appeal has alarmed a number of critics of the philosophy. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> later abandon their positive view of Rand and are often said to have [...] "outgrown" [...] her ideas. Supporters of Rand's work recognize the phenomenon, but attribute it {{to the loss of}} youthful idealism and inability to resist social pressures for intellectual conformity. In contrast, historian Jennifer Burns, writing in Goddess of the Market (2009), says some critics [...] "dismiss Rand as a shallow thinker appealing only to adolescents," [...] although she thinks the critics [...] "miss her significance" [...] as a [...] "gateway drug" [...] to right-wing politics.|$|E
2500|$|Le Beau Serge and The 400 Blows were successful, {{and at the}} 1959 Cannes Film Festival, Truffaut and Chabrol {{used their}} fame to promote Paris Belongs to Us and help Rivette finish the film. According to Truffaut, who {{obtained}} funds for its completion, [...] "The release of Paris nous appartient is a score for {{every member of the}} Cahiers du cinéma team". He helped Rivette premiere it at the Studio des Ursulines on 16 December 1961, followed by a run at the Agriculteurs cinema in Paris. Although reviews of the film were mixed, it was praised by L'Express. Pierre Marcabru of Combat said, [...] "The connection between image and sound has never been so striking, evocative or necessary", and Jeander of Liberation praised the film's depiction of [...] "the moral and intellectual confusion <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> who are repressed by their epoch for more than their elders". Rivette, who later said [...] "It's the film of a sixteen-year-old child, but maybe its naïveté is where its strength lies", won the Sutherland Trophy for best first film from the British Film Institute.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we develop the concept of ‘transnational family habitus’ as a {{theoretical}} tool for {{making sense of the}} ways in which children and <b>young</b> <b>people</b> of migrant background are ‘doing families’ transnationally. Drawing on over a decade long cumulative research on Caribbean and Italian families in the UK, as well as on a new joint research project, the article firstly investigates the opportunities and consequences of a transnational family habitus on family arrangements, kinship relationships and identity within a transnational context. Secondly, it analyses the role <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> structural location in Britain in shaping the boundaries of their transnational family habitus. We argue that a transnational family habitus should be seen as an asset, which can potentially disrupt conventional understandings of belonging and processes of inclusion and exclusion. However, we also detail how social divisions of class, race, and increasingly migration status, shape such habitus...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{responses}} of nearly 1200 children and <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in Wales who {{were asked to identify}} which three famous people they most admired and which three they most disliked. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> responses reveals a number of sociological and educational issues. Their selections confirm other research which has highlighted the importance of celebrities in the lives of <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Their ‘heroes’ and ‘villains’ are drawn mostly from the worlds of popular music and sport. Their choices are also highly gendered and ‘raced’. Of particular interest is the finding that someone’s ‘villain’ is more than likely to be someone else’s ‘hero’. Our <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> selection of heroes and villains reflects the broader landscape of celebrity culture, where female fame is as much about appearance as talent and Black and minority ethnic celebrities are to be found largely in the fields of sport or popular music. The paper concludes by discussing the chasm between our <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> ‘heroes’ and ‘villains’ and those which are ‘officially sanctioned’ within the school curriculum and considers what schools and teachers might do about it...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} a series of life-history {{interviews}} with 16 young adults who were all formerly looked-after children. Eight young men and eight young women aged 17 to 25 took part in the study in Wales, UK. They had experienced a wide range of circumstances at home, in care and after care. They were contacted through a self-advocacy organization and other care leavers' groups. The paper explores how insights from the sociology of the family can serve to enhance understandings <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> life stories and, additionally, how their lived experiences can contribute to this sociological field. Key themes explored in the paper include the emotional co-presence of the birth family for children living in substitute care, the dynamic nature of experiences and perceptions of family relationships through the life course, the importance of siblings and the insightful reflections of participants on the challenges of learning to ‘do’ family across childhoods marked by nomadism. The paper concludes that a holistic theoretical approach that embraces ‘psy’ and sociological understandings of families and relationships will be most productive for researchers, practitioners and families...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} {{from school to}} the world of post-compulsory education is a major landmark in the lives of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with special educational needs (SEN). In England the Connexions service set up to support <b>young</b> <b>people</b> during transition was planned to provide both a universal service and one that provided special support to vulnerable <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> particularly those at risk of not being in education, employment or training (NEET). The present paper reports the findings of a study of 46 Connexions personal advisers (PAs) who were supporting <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with specific speech and language difficulties (SSLD) or general learning difficulties, as part of a longitudinal study <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> development.

The findings highlight the diversity among Connexions services, the limited expertise with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with SEN and the structural barriers that may limit effectiveness. In addition, the Assessment, Planning, Implementation and Review Framework was not consistently used. The Connexions service has the potential to provide important support to <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with SEN at this key transition point but our study indicates the need for modifications to its operation...|$|R

An organizing committee consisting of international students and young professionals brought together around 200 young professionals and students from around the globe to exchange ideas and knowledge on reducing disaster risk, building resilient communities, and advocating for the inclusion of youth priorities within the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 – 2030 (SFDRR). The knowledge exchange during the Forum was structured around a Toolbox for Resilience that connected to the SFDRR section on Priorities for Action. This article presents the outcomes <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> participation in the disaster risk reduction capacity building events and policy-making, as well as the follow-up actions envisioned by the young participants of the Forum. The voices of the younger generation were heard in the SFDRR and <b>young</b> <b>people</b> are ready to expand their actions for the framework’s effective implementation. <b>Young</b> <b>people</b> call on technical experts, donors, NGOs, agencies, governments, and academia to partner with them on this journey to create a more resilient tomorrow together.|$|R

40|$|This work {{discusses}} two connected {{case studies}} that advocate for an inclusion of non-conforming youth, and their voices, in research. The first explores {{the understanding of}} school practices and related identity construction of participants labeled as being “at-risk” in a ‘successful’ middle school’s alternative education program, and the second updates three <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> identities, life/school experiences, and perspectives, five years later. During the first grounded theory based study, I collected data through classroom observations, focus group sessions, and individual interviews with five eighth grade students, their parents, and school professionals, and then conducted one hour long, individual interviews with three of the original participants for the second, longitudinal effort. Findings from these studies include that these youth both actively affirm and resist others’ construction of their differences, actively pursue educational goals, and readily offer suggestions for reform. Additionally, through their eager agreement to continue involvement in this study at on-going five-year intervals, <b>these</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> indicate the value that they place on knowing that their voices are being heard. This work adds to the literature on identity construction and suggests {{the value of an}} addition <b>of</b> <b>these</b> youths’ own sociocultural and change-oriented perspectives in our efforts toward reform...|$|R
