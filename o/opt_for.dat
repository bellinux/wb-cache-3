The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs.|$|E
5|$|The Fairmont model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, the Fairmont could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh grille with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included traction control and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue clock on the top centre console stack, wood grain highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic headlights, which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on the Fairmont model. In addition to this, the Fairmont also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> the Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E
5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, {{a lack of}} adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine. Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E

5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia {{to reduce the size of}} its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong refugee camp in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi refugee camp was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Under HCI's Integrated Programme, the Sabbatical Programme {{is offered}} whereby {{students}} from Secondary 1 to 4 go on one week sabbatical courses in each {{term in the}} first semester (Terms 1 and 2). The programme is unique in allowing {{the majority of the}} school populace to put aside formal curricular lessons for a week in pursuit of their passions or interests. Sabbaticals offered are of a wide variety, in categories as defined by the school: Arts & Aesthetics, Chinese Studies, Humanities, English & Literature, Leadership, Technology, Science and Math, Camps and Student Exchange; they are essentially courses for students to <b>opt</b> <b>for,</b> such as beginner guitar and songwriting lessons, professional music production, Model United Nations training camps, football friendlies with other schools, et cetera. Also, the school requires students to use the specifically designed Online Bidding System - the i-ComP - to organise their sabbatical plans. Students who accumulate demerit points as a result of various offences are penalised in their sabbatical bidding or are recommended for corrective work order.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission {{over the life of the}} VL. The decision to <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E

5|$|Philipp {{participated in}} various {{sporting}} events {{organized by the}} Christlicher Verein Junger Männer (CVJM—the German equivalent of YMCA) such as hiking, bicycling, skiing, paddling and rowing. He also {{was a member of}} the Hitlerjugend (HJ—Hitler Youth) and received the HJ-Ehrenzeichen (Honor Badge). Philipp learned to fly glider aircraft in the Hitler Youth and received his A and B glider license, leading the local HJ-Fliegerschar (Flying Squad) in Meissen. Adolf Hitler officially re-established the Luftwaffe in March 1935. Following this event, Philipp then changed his mind and decided he did not want to become a journalist. He passed his physical examination to become a pilot, observer, aircraft mechanic and or radio operator on 6 September 1935 in Dresden. The financial situation of the Philipp family was always a cause for concern. When Alma's mother was paralyzed and required nursing care, the financial situation became severe. Alma's monthly income was 225 RM and the annual school fee of 180 RM was a big burden. She wrote to the city council multiple times asking for the fees to be waived. By early 1935, the family was behind on their payments which had accumulated to a debt of 390 RM by 31 March 1935. Philipp's graduation from school was at risk as he was threatened with expulsion on financial grounds. Philipp's decision to <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> military service in the Wehrmacht eased the financial tension. He was permitted to graduate, provided that his mother paid back the debt in instalments of 10 RM per month.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{resumption}} of competitive cricket, Tallon's chances of selection had improved due to the fates of his pre-war wicket-keeping rivals. Oldfield had long retired. Barnett, a captain in the army, had been a prisoner of the Japanese at Changi in Singapore for four years. Emaciated, he slowly recovered his fitness and forced his {{way back into the}} Victorian team, but was almost 40 and intended to retire in the near future. Walker had joined the Royal Australian Air Force as a gunner and was killed in a duel with Nazi fighter pilots over Soltau in Germany. This left Tallon as the front-runner, but there was a possibility that the selectors would <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> generational change and install a more youthful keeper like Gil Langley or Ron Saggers with an eye to the future. With the pressure of selection on his head, Tallon made eight dismissals in the first match after {{the resumption}} of cricket, against New South Wales in Brisbane, including three stumpings and three catches from the leg spin of Colin McCool, a future Test team-mate. The performance was to herald the start of a prolific bowler-wicket-keeper partnership. Tallon then scored 74 to guide Queensland to the target of 270 with four wickets in hand. Queensland won two of their seven matches and Tallon scored 305 runs at 30.50 and completed 27 dismissals to finally gain national selection.|$|E
