5|$|Live'r Than You'll Ever Be is a bootleg {{recording}} of the Rolling Stones' concert in Oakland, California, from 9 November 1969. It {{was one of the}} first live rock music bootlegs and was made notorious as a document of their 1969 tour of the United States. The popularity of the bootleg forced the Stones' label Decca Records to release the live album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert in 1970. Live'r is also one of the earliest commercial bootleg recordings in rock history, released in December 1969, just two months after the Beatles' Kum Back and five months after Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder. Like the two earlier records, Live'rs <b>outer</b> <b>sleeve</b> is plain white, with its name stamped on in ink.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} album featured {{an unusual}} gimmick: the album had an <b>outer</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{which was made}} to look like a plain brown paper bag (reminiscent of similarly packaged bootleg album sleeves with the title rubber-stamped on it), and the inner sleeve featured black and white line artwork which, if washed with water, would become permanently fully coloured. There were also six different sleeves featuring a different pair of photos (one on each side), and the external brown paper sleeve meant that it was impossible for record buyers to tell which sleeve they were getting (there is actually a code on the spine of the album jacket which indicated which sleeve it was—this could sometimes be seen while the record was still sealed). The pictures all depicted the same scene in a bar (in which a man burns a Dear John letter), and each photo was taken from the separate point of view of someone who appeared in the other photos. [...] The walls are covered with thousands of yellowed business cards and dollar bills. The photo session in a London studio was meant to look like a re-creation of the Old Absinthe House, in New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E

50|$|In some {{applications}} the {{two races}} may be arranged on plates {{parallel to the}} plane of the balls, rather than on inner and <b>outer</b> <b>sleeves.</b> In this case, the inner and outer sides of the grooves that form the race should have different angles with respect to this plane, with a steeper angle on the inside groove and a shallower angle on the outside groove, so that each ball can rotate properly without slipping.|$|R
5000|$|By 1925, all Panhard's {{cars were}} powered by Knight sleeve valve engines that used steel sleeves. [...] The steel sleeves were thinner and {{lighter than the}} cast iron ones that had been fitted in Panhard sleeve valve engines since 1910, and this already gave rise to an {{improved}} friction coefficient permitting engines to run at higher speeds. [...] To reduce further the risk of engines jamming, the <b>outer</b> <b>sleeves,</b> which are less thermally stressed than the inner sleeves, were coated on their inner sides with an anti-friction material, employing a patented technique with which Panhard engineers had been working since 1923. This {{was one of several}} improvements applied by Panhard engineers to the basic Knight sleeve-valve engine concept.|$|R
50|$|To save natural {{resources}} and increase recycling, in 2007 the company launched a 2-layer yogurt pot. The inner sleeve was a thinner mould using polystyrene, the <b>outer</b> <b>sleeve</b> made from recycled cardboard, and the over-cap made of polypropylene.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn orbital head of orbital {{forging press}} with double {{eccentric}} sleeve has {{four types of}} movement, but most workpieces are formed by circular movement. The motion equation is established according to the structure and the movement principle of orbital head. Then find that the rotational speed of inner and <b>outer</b> eccentric <b>sleeves</b> simply affects the rotation period of orbital head in circle and straight line movements, and not only affects the rotation period but also the movement shape in spiral and rose curve movements. The eccentricity of inner and <b>outer</b> eccentric <b>sleeves</b> can change the shape {{and size of the}} movement, adjust the distance from the movement to the center point, and change straight line movement into ellipse, spiral and rose curve movements do not cross through the center. It can solve the problem that straight line, spiral and rose curve movements pass the center, orbital angle is zero and the forming force increases sharply, achieve the continuous local deformation of workpiece during the forming process...|$|R

50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy <b>outer</b> <b>sleeve</b> that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the <b>outer</b> <b>sleeve</b> with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square socket head screws that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot head screws and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|E

5000|$|When reading old disks (especially those {{stored in}} non-climate {{controlled}} environments for long periods) {{there are a}} number of problems that can arise due including weakening of the magnetic field storing the data, deterioration of the binder holding the metal particles to the plastic disk surface, friction issues preventing the disk rotating freely in its <b>outer</b> protective <b>sleeve,</b> and issues caused by physical misalignment of the drive that originally wrote the disk or the one being used to read it. Users have detailed [...] various techniques to aid in the recovery of data stored on such marginal disks.|$|R

50|$|Thermal sleeves were {{originally}} simply insulators. They would prevent ambient {{conditions such as}} bright sunlight or winds from heating or cooling {{one side of a}} barrel more than the other which would cause a thermal distortion (bending or drooping), reducing accuracy. More modern variants contain concentric inner and <b>outer</b> insulating <b>sleeves</b> with a gap in between. Versions have been created which are detachable from a given barrel {{so that they can be}} re-used with a replacement barrel. Proposals exist for types that have advanced external thermal and radar profiles, reducing their thermal and radar signatures making the barrel and thereby the tank harder to detect.|$|R
