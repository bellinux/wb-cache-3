However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> {{the simplicity}} of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding {{is one of the}} world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
5|$|In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, {{adopted the}} Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality {{regulation}} {{still in use}} in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, hops and barley-malt. Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant {{by the end of}} the 19th century.

25|$|While PID {{controllers}} {{are applicable}} to many control problems, and often perform satisfactorily without any improvements or only coarse tuning, they can perform poorly in some applications, {{and do not}} in general provide optimal control.

25|$|ROF Sellafield was {{constructed}} by John Laing & Son in 1942 at Low Sellafield as a Second World War Royal Ordnance Factory. The nearby sister factory, ROF Drigg which produced TNT (trinitrotoluene) had been constructed in 1940, 5km to the south-east and {{adjacent to the}} village of Drigg. ROF Drigg and ROF Sellafield were built in these isolated and remote coastal sites because of the hazardous nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> to minimise the risk of enemy air attack. They were both classed as Explosive ROF specialising in high-explosive TNT (ROF Drigg) and propellant (ROF Sellafield), and production ceased at both factories immediately following the defeat of Japan.|$|E
25|$|Repeated interviews, written tests, medical examinations, {{physical}} fitness tests, comprehensive background investigations, fingerprinting, drug testing, a police oral board interview, a polygraph examination and consultation with a psychologist are common practices used {{to review the}} suitability of candidates.

Police oral boards are the most subjective part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> often disqualifies the biggest portion of qualified candidates. Departments maintain records of past applicants under review, and refer {{to them in the}} case of either reapplication or requests between other agencies.|$|E

Over a decade after the tragedy, thousands remained homeless and the value of real estate in zones untouched by the floods declined by as much as 70%, due to the destruction of infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|The olefin feed to an {{alkylation}} unit generally originates from a FCCU {{and contains}} butene, isobutene, and possibly propene and/or amylenes. The olefin feed {{is also likely}} to contain diluents (such as propane, n-butane, and n-pentane), noncondensables (such as ethane and hydrogen) and contaminants. Diluants in principle have no effect on the reaction of alkylation but occupy a portion of the reactor and can influence the yield of secondary reactions of polymerisation and of undesired organofluorine side products. Incondensable are from a chemical perspective similar to diluents but they do not condense at the pressure and temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>process,</b> <b>and</b> therefore they concentrate to a point that must be vented. Contaminants are compounds that react with and/or dilute the sulfuric acid catalyst. They increase acid consumption and contribute to produce undesirable reaction products and increase polymer formation. Common contaminants are water, methanol and ethanol.|$|E
