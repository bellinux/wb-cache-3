5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the levels <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> the states have little say in federal decision making.|$|E
5|$|A {{collective}} {{leadership was}} founded immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin as head <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) {{as head of}} state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership.|$|E
5|$|A second Legislative Council {{election}} {{was held in}} 1951 {{with the number of}} elected seats increased to nine. This {{election was}} again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. While this contributed to the formation of a distinct local government of Singapore, the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the Emergency over, a British Commission, headed by Sir George Rendel, proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A new Legislative Assembly with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a Chief Minister as head <b>of</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a parliamentary system. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.|$|E

5|$|Around 1785BC, as {{the power}} of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a Western Asian people called the Hyksos had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris, seized control of Egypt, and forced the central {{government}} to retreat to Thebes. The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models <b>of</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.|$|E
5|$|As Soviet forces {{continued}} to {{fight their way}} into the centre of Berlin, Hitler and Braun committed suicide on the afternoon of 30 April. Braun took cyanide and Hitler shot himself. As per Hitler's instructions, their bodies were carried up to the Reich Chancellery garden and burned. In accordance with Hitler's last wishes, Bormann was named as Party Minister, thus officially confirming his position as de facto General Secretary of the Party. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz was appointed as the new Reichspräsident (president of Germany) and Goebbels became head <b>of</b> <b>government</b> <b>and</b> Chancellor of Germany. Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide later that day.|$|E
5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} three branches <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> <b>and</b> eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, and again the Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E
