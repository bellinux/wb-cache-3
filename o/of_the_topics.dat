5|$|Bodyguard of Lies is a 1975 non-fiction {{book written}} by Anthony Cave Brown, {{his first major}} {{historical}} work. Named for a wartime quote of Winston Churchill, it is a narrative account of Allied military deception operations during the Second World War. The British and American governments resisted Brown's attempts to research the book. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> were still classified and he was denied access to British war records. The material {{in the book is}} predominantly based on oral testimony as well as some American records, declassified toward the end of Brown's research.|$|E
5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> his {{research}} focused on was {{the discussion of}} fashion and femininity in the French fin-de-siècle.

His own works include novels and fantasy books, such as Surprises du Coeur and Contes pour les bibliophiles (Tales for bibliophiles).|$|E

50|$|SCRIBE is a {{decentralized}} publish/subscribe {{system that}} uses Pastry for its underlying route management and host lookup. Users create topics to which other users can subscribe. Once <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> has been created, <b>the</b> owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> can publish new entries under <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> {{which will be}} distributed in a multicast tree to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SCRIBE nodes that have subscribed to <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b> <b>The</b> system works by computing <b>the</b> hash <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> name concatenated with <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> user who owns <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b> This hash is then used as a Pastry key, and the publisher then routes packets to the nodeclosest to the key using Pastry's routing protocol to create <b>the</b> root node <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> on that node. People then subscribe to <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> by computing <b>the</b> key from <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> and publisher's name and then using Pastry to route a subscribe message to <b>the</b> <b>topic</b> towards <b>the</b> root node. When the root node receives the subscribe message from another node it adds the node ID to its list of children and begins acting as a forwarder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topic.</b>|$|R

5|$|When the {{organization}} {{became aware that}} a certain person wanted to hold a reunion with Ojeda Ríos, they would discuss and analize it before approving the meeting, with the Commander issuing a report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> discussed afterwards. According to the briefing that followed his reunion with bishop González Nieves, it was established that the religious leader tried to convince him {{to move away from}} armed conflict and to abandon clandestine activities. However, Ojeda Ríos responded by replying that, despite respecting the motives behind these suggestions, he declined. He extended an offer of his own to the bishop to join the efforts of the EPB, which was turned down as well.|$|E
5|$|Resource Guides {{are offered}} for the art, economics, {{language}} and literature, music, science/social science, and Super Quiz events. The Super Quiz Resource Guide is {{a compendium of}} previously published articles, whereas the other Resource Guides are composed by individual writers under contract with USAD. The aim of the Resource Guide is to assist students in their study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> listed in the subject area outlines. As an example, in 2003 the music topic was Romantic music. Subsequently the Music Resource Guide focused {{on the development of}} Romantic music, its characteristics and the influence of the Classical era on the Romantic era. A large part of the guide focused on information about that year's composers: Beethoven, Berlioz, Rossini, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Verdi, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Bizet, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Strauss. Similarly, the art topic assigned was Romantic art in the European tradition. The Art Resource Guide included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as Joseph Mallord William Turner, Claude Monet, Albert Bierstadt, and Camille Pissarro.|$|E

25|$|The essay, {{written in}} harsh tones, listed what Caragiale {{saw as the}} major social {{problems}} tolerated by Romanian administrations: he discussed the landowning class, successor to the boyars, having maintained as much possible from the legacy of serfdom; he noted that, while the commerce was dominated by foreigners, the administration was gripped by a no longer aristocratic oligarchy and its far-reaching political machine. As several commentators noted, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> brought up by Caragiale built on the critical overview adopted by Junimea. To {{the social and political}} problems, the text offered a monarchist solution—Caragiale expected Carol I to carry out a coup d'état against the Romanian political establishment, replacing the Constitution of 1866, which left some room for privilege through the census suffrage, with a more democratic one.|$|E
25|$|S. cerevisiae {{has been}} highly studied {{as a model}} {{organism}} to better understand aging {{for more than five}} decades and has contributed to the identification of more mammalian genes affecting aging than any other model organism. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>topics</b> studied using yeast are calorie restriction, as well as in genes and cellular pathways involved in senescence. The two most common methods of measuring aging in yeast are Replicative Life Span, which measures the number of times a cell divides, and Chronological Life Span, which measures how long a cell can survive in a non-dividing stasis state. Limiting the amount of glucose or amino acids in the growth medium has been shown to increase RLS and CLS in yeast as well as other organisms. At first, this was thought to increase RLS by up-regulating the sir2 enzyme, however it was later discovered that this effect is independent of sir2. Over-expression of the genes sir2 and fob1 has been shown to increase RLS by preventing the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles, which are thought {{to be one of the}} causes of senescence in yeast. The effects of dietary restriction may be the result of a decreased signaling in the TOR cellular pathway. This pathway modulates the cell's response to nutrients, and mutations that decrease TOR activity were found to increase CLS and RLS. This has also been shown to be the case in other animals. A yeast mutant lacking the genes sch9 and ras2 has recently been shown to have a tenfold increase in chronological lifespan under conditions of calorie restriction and is the largest increase achieved in any organism.|$|E
