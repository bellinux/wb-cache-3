40|$|Editor’s note: This {{paper is}} a {{contribution}} to the ‘Policy Debate’ section of International Development Policy. In this section, academics, policy-makers and practioners engage in a dialogue on global development challenges. Papers are copy-edited but not peer-reviewed. Instead, the initial thematic contribution is followed by critical comments and reactions from scholars and/or policy-makers. In her article ‘Pay to Preserve: The Global Politics of Ecuador’s Yasuní-ITT Proposal’, published in DevPol’s special issue on  Energy and Development in 2011, Pamela L. Martin, Associate Professor of Politics at the Coastal Carolina University in Conway, South Carolina, provided a favourable outlook on Ecuador’s innovative environmental governance mechanism. Accordingly, its unique potential lay in its objective of contributing towards sustainable development and social justice and in case of success, the author even predicted a possible replication in other developing countries. Despite its benefits, the initiative was abandoned in 2013. In this paper, Martin revisits the initiative and analyses the reasons for its failure, namely President Correa’s public pursuit of a Plan B, entering into negotiations with oil firms interested to explore the ITT reserves. Moreover, the initiative was in stark competition with the national REDD+ programme, the mainstream policy approach to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation against payments, which is being negotiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Pamela L. Martin’s article is followed by a response by Dr. Imme Scholz, Deputy Director of the German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE). She examines why Germany, as the largest European donor, withdrew its support for the Yasuní-ITT Initiative.

40|$|The {{technology}} enhanced learning (TEL) strategy {{being developed}} by the University is focussing upon the use of online technologies to support learning through simulated experiences {{in a range of}} subject areas, using both “Web 1. 0 ” and “Web 2. 0 ” technologies. As we develop these techniques alongside the more traditional uses of online technologies, e. g. delivering teaching materials and enabling social educational activities such as collaborative learning, we are beginning to see the enormous potential that online technologies offer for enabling students to experience the essence of practice in a “safe” educational environment. The university has many students who study professional courses in, for example, law, environmental health practice, architecture, planning, tourism, health care and social work. Education in these professions is greatly enhanced where students can apply the theory they learn to examples of situations they are likely to encounter in practise. But, in many cases it is either impractical or dangerous to create these types of situations in real life. This presentation will outline demonstrate examples of simulations that use a mixture of web technologies, social networking and virtual worlds. In particular we will demonstrate a simulation that enables groups of law students to work as partners in simulated law practices, communicating through text, email and voice in a virtual town that supports a range of case types. We will also demonstrate an accident investigation simulation in Second Life. Groups of “witnesses” can experience the whole accident in real time and then groups of investigators can see the accident aftermath, interview the witnesses and retrieve simulated documentation. They then use theoretical accident modelling techniques to reconstruct their rendition of the accident, and make recommendations for preventive action. The students can then take their findings back inworld and we can rerun the accident so they can compare their findings with the actual event. We will also discuss how visualisation of mathematics topics can be simulated using virtual worlds.

But peace is more than the absence of war – and, in our case, more than the absence of hacks.

40|$|Transnational {{communities}} play {{an increasingly}} {{important role in the}} field of digital knowledge and culture both as providers of goods and services via commons based production (Benkler 2006) and as actors in regulatory processes (Djelic and Quack, forthcoming). While a huge variety of phenomena are subsumed under the umbrella of diverse “community ” concepts, most of them share a reluctance to investigate the relationship between communities and related formal organizations (for an exception see O’Mahoney and Bechky 2008). The main reason for this decentred role of formal organization in contemporary community theorizing is probably the convention to describe organizational features and dynamics of communities in contrast to classic organizational bureaucracies, and to thereby emphasize the informal nature of communities. However, for communities in general and for the free culture movement in particular, formal organizations are of great importance in at least two regards: First, even the most open and self-organizing community projects sooner or later develop formal organizational structures to make their work sustainable and to manage relations with external actors. Second, formal organizations play a major role as adopters, users or sponsors of community work and products. In my research so far, I have concentrated on these two relatively distinct relations of community development and formal organizing: Together with Sigrid Quack I have investigated the interplay of different types of communities {{in the realm of the}} organizational network of Creative Commons (Dobusch and Quack 2008; 2009). In a current research project we are comparing the organizational structure and transnationalization dynamics of Creative Commons with the ones of Wikimedia and its local chapter organizations. 1 Contrasting these two cases highlights not only the importance of organizational participation for community building and development but also the difficulties of organizing participation 1 Some work in progress can be found <b>on</b> <b>our</b> research <b>blog</b> „governance across borders“, in particular th...|$|R

This innovation has caught the attention of language practitioners who wish to experiment with blogging to enhance the teaching and learning experience. In 2007 I set up a class blog with my nine pre-intermediate EFL students in a language school in Brazil. This experience gave rise to two central questions: a) did my students see <b>our</b> <b>blog</b> as a learning tool? and b) what was blogging like in other language teaching contexts? To answer the first question I carried out some Exploratory Practice for three months. As for the second question, I designed an online survey which was answered by 16 members of a community of practice called the Webheads. Ultimately I learned that my students saw <b>our</b> <b>blog</b> as a learning tool and that blogs are being used in different ways around the world.

40|$|Purpose of this Study: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{implementation}} of an integrated art and humanities project entitled " Paper Dolls" at the middle school level. The curriculum discussed in this paper is based primarily on Andrade's theory (as cited in Murray. 1999) of how the reality of our beliefs, values, and perspectives are socially constructed by gender, media, family, and other social relationships. The curriculum provided opportunities for middle school students to reflect upon how their values and perspectives might have been formed and how both have contributed to their identity and/or sense of self. The curriculum was also designed to provide students the opportunity to reflect upon how their own perspective may impact how they view and treat others. Method: As students participated in this three week project, they were asked to explore such concepts as family culture, ethnicity, gender, social groups, and media and how these have contributed to their own identity formation. The culminating project consisted of each student creating three paper dolls to portray their understanding and perspectives on social constructs and how these social constructs have had an influence on shaping their identity. Data was collected throughout the project, including student writings and reflections, postings <b>on</b> <b>our</b> class <b>blog,</b> videotaping during the process of students deciding which dolls to make and how 10 dress them, a teaching journal, the students' artist statements, and images of their paper dolls. All of these were used to analyze the results of implementing this project. Conclusions and Findings: Students expressed new understandings of complex social constructs such as gender, ethnicity, and the media, and the impact of these on their sense of self and perspective of the world. Because of the implementation of No Child Left Behind in 2001 with its emphasis on accountability coupled with the decrease in funding for public institutions, many schools have had to alter and adapt programs in order to spend more time on Language Arts and Mathematics instruction and eliminate courses such as art, drama, and music. This paper argues that the time and effort spent to develop curriculum that is intellectually engaging and grounded in the everyday world of adolescents is well worth the time and investment necessary to implement such a curriculum...|$|R
