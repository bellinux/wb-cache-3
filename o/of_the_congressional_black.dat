On March 14, 2007, twenty-six members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Black</b> Caucus sent a letter to Carl J.

However, pursuant to the Electoral Count Act of 1887, any such objection had to be sponsored by both a representative and a senator.

The House Of Representatives version of the bill would have denied funds unless the Freedmen descendants were restored to citizenship. The Senate version of the bill had no mention of the Cherokee Nation or the Cherokee Freedmen descendants. Paul Lumley, executive director of the National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC), said that the NAIHC worked with members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Black</b> Caucus to create a compromise, resulting in the addition of the Cherokee Freedmen stipulation in the bill.|$|E

Walters commented that Representative Lee's [...] "passion for racial equality is admirable, but her grasp of the facts is not."

40|$|Book synopsis: <b>The</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Black</b> Caucus {{has grown}} both {{in size and}} in {{prominence}} in its short lifetime. Robert Singh considers <b>the</b> actual impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CBC on public policy in this new volume for the Contemporary American Politics series. Singh argues that while the CBC forcefully articulates <b>the</b> concerns <b>of</b> African Americans, it has not only proven an ineffective interest lobby for their issues, but has become increasingly irrelevant as a labor union for its own members. Drawing on extensive data, <b>The</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Black</b> Caucus provides <b>the</b> first coherent and balanced overview <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> electoral and institutional forces, which together shape the CBCÆs fortunes. <b>The</b> <b>Congressional</b> <b>Black</b> Caucus will be of considerable interest to scholars and students in <b>the</b> areas <b>of</b> legislative process, race and politics, public policy, and political sociology...|$|R
