25|$|The first {{effort to}} enact the law outside of Idaho was started in Oregon in 2003, when the Idaho law still only applied to stop signs. While it {{overwhelmingly}} passed in the House, it never made it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Rules Committee. The Oregon effort in turn inspired {{an investigation of the}} law by the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission in 2008. That investigation failed to spawn legislation, but it did garner national attention, which led to similar efforts nationwide.|$|E

25|$|Pataki and New York GOP Chairman Sandy Treadwell faced {{controversy}} after naming moderate Assemblyman Howard Mills the party's {{nominee for}} the U.S. Senate against Senator Chuck Schumer over conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages in both fund raising and organization. Benjamin publicly accused Treadwell and Pataki {{of trying to}} muscle him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> race and undermine the democratic process. Mills went on to lose the election in the largest landslide for a Senate seat {{in the history of}} New York.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{relationship}} between Cohn, McCarthy and Schine remains unknown. Cohn and Schine were certainly close, {{and rather than}} work <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> offices, the two rented nearby office space and shared bills. McCarthy commented that Cohn was unreasonable in matters dealing with Schine. It is unclear if Schine ever had a romantic or sexual relationship with Cohn, who was a closeted homosexual. (Three years after the hearings, Schine married and eventually had six children.) Some have also suggested that McCarthy may have been homosexual, and even possibly involved with Schine or Cohn.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin {{publicly}} accused New York GOP Chairman Sandy Treadwell and Governor George Pataki {{of trying}} to muscle him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> race and undermine the democratic process. Many Republican voters were upset when Benjamin was denied the chance {{to engage in a}} primary. He had campaigned throughout New York, visiting all 62 counties on several occasions, and had built strong support among political leaders and community groups. In addition, Benjamin received the majority of his financial support in small donations, with only $2,500 from Political Action Committees (PACs). Mills had raised $200,000 less than Benjamin, and a large portion of his campaign contributions came from PACs.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 2013, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Cooper {{to serve}} as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, to the seat vacated by Judge Royce C. Lamberth, who took senior status on July 15, 2013. On January 16, 2014 his nomination was reported <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Judiciary Committee. On March 13, 2014, Senator Harry Reid filed a motion to invoke cloture on the nomination. On March 26, 2014, cloture was invoked in a 56-43 vote. He was confirmed later that same day by a vote of 100-0. He received his commission two days later.|$|E
25|$|On January 24, his {{nomination}} was voted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Judiciary Committee on a 10â€“8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard right conservative in {{the mold of}} a Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. On the abortion issue, he stated that he would look at that {{with an open mind}} but would not state how he would rule on Roe v. Wade if that issue were to come up before the court. Some pro-life activists, however, claim Alito's confirmation as a victory for their cause.|$|E
25|$|After the 28 Democratic {{senators}} walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> chamber, Secretary of the Senate Angelo Aponte {{turned off}} {{the lights in the}} Senate chamber and stopped the TV broadcast of the Senate session. Nevertheless, the remaining senators proceeded to vote for new leadership, removing Democratic Senator Malcolm Smith from his position as Majority Leader and Temporary President of the Senate, and replacing him with two people: Republican Minority Leader Dean Skelos as Majority Leader, and Pedro Espada as Temporary President. Historically, the majority leadership and the temporary presidency of the Senate were held by the same person. However, in the new arrangement, Espada was to be the Temporary President of the Senate, while Skelos would become Majority Leader.|$|E

25|$|Alito's {{confirmation}} hearing was held from Monday, January 9, 2006, to Friday, January 13. On Tuesday, January 24, his nomination was voted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Judiciary Committee on a 10-8 party line vote. Debate on the nomination {{began in the}} full Senate on Wednesday, January 25. Despite a last minute effort by Democratic Senator John Kerry to filibuster, which was joined by, among others, Sens. Barack Obama, Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton, Charles Schumer, and Harry Reid, a cloture vote to end debate passed 72-25 on Monday, January 30. On the morning of Tuesday, January 31, Alito was confirmed to the Supreme Court {{by a vote of}} 58-42. He was sworn in privately later that same day. The next day, he was publicly sworn in.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Schumer won {{re-election}} against Republican Assemblyman Howard Mills of Middletown {{and conservative}} Marilyn F. O'Grady. Many New York Republicans were {{dismayed by the}} selection of Mills over the conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization. Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman Sandy Treadwell and governor George Pataki of trying to muscle him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> race and undermine the democratic process. Schumer defeated Mills, the second-place finisher, by 2.8 million votes and won reelection with 71% of the vote. Schumer won every county in the state except one, Hamilton County in the Adirondacks, the least populated and most Republican county in the state. Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.|$|E
25|$|During the Senate {{session on}} June 8, Republican Senator Thomas Libous {{proposed}} a resolution, {{similar to a}} motion of no confidence, that would allow for {{the election of a}} new leader of the Senate. The entire 32 Senator coalition voted for the resolution. After the resolution was passed, but before the vote was recognized by officiating officer, Senator Neil Breslin, Senator Jeffrey Klein moved for adjournment. Libous demanded that his resolution be recognized, but instead Breslin quickly granted Klein's motion for adjournment. Republicans objected, claiming a majority of the Senate did not vote to adjourn. After Breslin declared the meeting adjourned, all but four Democratic senators walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> chamber. The Democrats who stayed were Espada and Monserrate, who had voted for the resolution, and Carl Kruger and Ruben Diaz, who abstained from all voting during the course of events, but stayed to show their support.|$|E

25|$|Two plebeian tribunes, Favonius and Cato, led the {{opposition}} to the steps of the consuls. However, they did not get far, due to popular support for the measures. Favonius was given little time to speak before the plebeian council, and Cato applied obstructionist tactics that did not work. He was led away from the assembly, but he kept returning and he was eventually arrested. Gallus, a senator, slept in the senate house intending to join the proceedings in the morning. Trebonius locked the doors and kept him there for most of the day. The comitia (the meeting place of for the assembly) was blocked by a cordon of men. An attempt to pass through was repulsed violently and there were casualties. When people were leaving after the vote Gallus, who had been let <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> house, was hit when he tried to pass through the cordon. He was presented covered with blood to the crowd. People were upset. The consuls stepped in with a large and intimidating bodyguard, called a meeting and put the measure in favour of Caesar to the vote. It was passed.|$|E
25|$|The most {{controversial}} measure Caesar introduced was an agrarian bill to allot plots {{of land to}} the landless poor to farm. Conservative aristocrats had a tradition of vehemently opposing land redistribution and most such bills were not passed. In Cassius Dioâ€™s opinion, Caesar tried to appear to promote {{the interests of the}} optimates {{as well as those of}} the people, and said that he would not introduce his land reform if they did not agree with it. He read the draft of the bill to the senate, asked for the option of each senator and promised to amend or scrap any clause that had raised objections. The optimates were annoyed because the bill, to their embarrassment, could not be criticised. Moreover, it would give Caesar popularity and power. Even though no optimate spoke against it, no one expressed approval. The law would distribute public and private land to all citizens instead of just Pompeyâ€™s veterans and would do so without any expense for the city or any loss for the optimates. It would be financed with the proceeds from Pompeyâ€™s war booty and the new tributes and taxes in the east Pompey established with his victories in the Third Mithridatic War. Private land was to be bought at the price assessed in the tax-lists to ensure fairness. The land commission in charge of the allocations would be large and have twenty members so that it would not be small commission run by a clique and many men would share the honour. Caesar added that it would be run by the most suitable men. This was an invitation to the optimates to apply for these posts. He ruled himself out of the commission to avoid suggestions that he proposed the measure out of self-interest and said that he was happy with being just the proposer of the law. The senators kept delaying the vote. Cato advocated the status quo. Caesar came to the point of having him dragged <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> house and arrested. Cato said that he was up for this and many senators followed suit and left. Caesar adjourned the session of the senate and decided that since the senate was not willing to pass a preliminary decree he would get the plebeian council to vote. He did not convene the senate for the rest of his consulship and proposed motions directly to the plebeian council. Cassius Dio thought Caesar proposed the bill as a favour to Pompey and Crassus.|$|E
500|$|Cordray {{entered the}} U.S. Senate {{elections}} {{in a race}} that began as a three-way contest for the Democratic nomination to oppose first-term Republican incumbent Mike DeWine. The three-way race was unusual since the three candidates (Cordray, Rev. Marvin McMickle, and Ted Celeste) were encouraged to campaign together {{in order to promote}} name recognition, conserve resources and lessen infighting. Ohio Democratic party leaders believed Cordray was better suited for an Ohio Supreme Court seat and urged him to drop <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> race. [...] Despite the Ohio Democrats not endorsing any candidate in the primary election, the entry of Dan Radakovich as a fourth competitor, and the anticipated entry of former Mayor of Cincinnati and television personality Jerry Springer, Cordray persisted in his campaign. Celeste, the younger brother of former Ohio governor Dick Celeste, won with 369,772 votes. He was trailed by McMickle (the only black Senate candidate in the country in 2000) with 204,811 votes, Cordray with 200,157, and Radakovich with 69,002.|$|E

25|$|The Minnesota Health Act, {{which would}} {{establish}} a statewide single-payer health plan, has been presented to the Minnesota legislature regularly since 2009.

500|$|Finally, on May 19, Giuliani held what The New York Times again {{described}} as [...] "an emotional, riveting news conference" [...] that [...] "reached {{a new level}} of introspection" [...] to announce that he was dropping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> race: [...] "This is not the right time for me to run for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being {{able to take care of}} your health." [...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E
