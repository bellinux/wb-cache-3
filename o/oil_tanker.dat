It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain proper trim.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specialized}} {{types of}} oil tankers have evolved. One {{of these is}} the naval replenishment oiler, a tanker which can fuel a moving vessel. Combination ore-bulk-oil carriers and permanently moored floating storage units are two other variations on the standard <b>oil</b> <b>tanker</b> design. Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.|$|E

5|$|In November 1957, the Arthur Kill {{swing bridge}} was damaged by an Esso <b>oil</b> <b>tanker,</b> and was {{replaced}} by a state-of-the-art, single track, 558 foot vertical lift bridge in 1959. The 2,000 ton lift span was prefabricated, then floated into place. The new bridge was raised 135 feet and since the new bridge aided navigation on the Arthur Kill, the United States government assumed 90 percent of the $11 million cost of the project. Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25, 1959.|$|E
