5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offering no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> telling the truth was difficult and remains so.|$|E
5|$|Between 1958 and 1964, the Merseyside {{area had}} about 500 {{different}} groups, which were constantly forming and breaking up, {{with an average}} of about 350 groups playing concerts on a regular basis. In 1961, Harry and the Cavern Club's DJ, Bob Wooler, compiled a list of groups that they had personally heard of, which had almost 300 names. In 1962, Mersey Beat held a poll to find <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> the most popular Merseyside group. When the votes were counted, Rory Storm & the Hurricanes were in first place, but after looking through the postal votes again, Harry noticed that forty votes were all written in green ink, in the same handwriting, and from the same area of Liverpool, so the dubious votes were declared void. This was suspected to have been Storm himself, but Harry had no idea that the Beatles had done exactly the same thing.|$|E

25|$|Chipatá was {{the first}} {{settlement}} of the later New Kingdom of Granada, founded by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada on March 8, 1537. Shortly after, the rested and reinforced troops set foot to higher terrains towards the south. Different from the scattered and unorganised indigenous groups they encountered before, advancing into the Muisca Confederation, they found a much better organised society and economy. The agriculture of the Muisca impressed the Spanish conquistadors and made them even more curious to find <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> {{the leader of the}} civilisation. While the Muisca regarded the European conquerors with distrust, they were also curious about them and where they came from.|$|E
25|$|Scully {{decided to}} leave CBS {{in favor of a}} job calling {{baseball}} games for NBC (beginning in 1983) following a dispute over assignment prominence (according to CBS Sports producer Terry O'Neil, in the book The Game Behind the Game). CBS decided going into the 1981 NFL season that John Madden, whom CBS had hired in 1979 and who had called games alongside Frank Glieber and Gary Bender his first two years, {{was going to be the}} star color commentator of their NFL television coverage. But they had trouble figuring <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> going to be his play-by-play partner, since Scully was in a battle with CBS' lead play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall for the position. At the time Scully was the number two announcer for CBS, a position he had held since 1975, and was calling games alongside the former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram, who had been promoted from CBS' number three broadcast team alongside Curt Gowdy.|$|E
25|$|After this match, Jericho {{entered a}} rivalry with Goldberg, which {{was fueled by}} Goldberg's refusal to fight Jericho in WCW. During Jericho's first episode of the Highlight Reel, an {{interview}} segment, where Goldberg was the guest, he complained that no-one wanted Goldberg in WWE and continued to insult him in the following weeks. On May 12 on Raw, a mystery assailant attempted to run over Goldberg with a limousine. A week later, Co-Raw General Manager, Stone Cold Steve Austin, interrogated several Raw superstars to find <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> driving the car. One of the interrogates was Lance Storm, who admitted {{that he was the}} assailant. Austin forced Storm into a match with Goldberg, who defeated Storm. After the match, Goldberg forced Storm to admit that Jericho was the superstar who conspired Storm into running him over. On May 26, Goldberg was once again a guest on the Highlight Reel. Jericho expressed jealousy towards Goldberg's success in WCW and felt that since joining WWE, he had achieved everything he had ever wanted in his career and all that was left was to defeat Goldberg and challenged him to a match. At Bad Blood, Goldberg settled the score with Jericho and defeated him.|$|E

25|$|Las Ranas and Toluquilla {{were the}} two largest prehispanic cities to develop in the Sierra Gorda area. Las Ranas was the most {{developed}} city from the 7th to the 11th century, with Toluquilla somewhat smaller and reaching its height in the 11th century. Both cities are near {{to each other and}} both controlled the active trade routes of the area as well as the mining of cinnabar, highly prized as a red pigment in Mesoamerica. The trade that passed through the area linked the Gulf of Mexico to the central Mexican Plateau and some areas north as well. Extensive mining was done at both Toluquilla and Las Ranas beginning between 200 and 300 CE, extracting cinnabar, mercury and sulfur. Cinnabar was the most prized used in funerals. The structures at the sites indicate a stratified society and built with stone slabs and mud and covered in stucco in some places. At Toluquilla, many structures were built on terraces cut into the mountain to create more space. Las Ranas was taken over by the Chichimeca Jonaz late in its history {{but by the time the}} Spanish arrived, both cities were abandoned. In 2009, INAH and other institutions carried out research at Toluquilla on thirty skeletons from the pre Hispanic era in order to determine the importance of mining in the south of the Sierra Gorda. The objective of the study was to determine the amount of accumulation of mercury in the bones to find <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> most involved in the mining and how it affected the health of the population. It also study patterns of mercury contamination in the surrounding environment as well. There have been over eighty extraction sites for cinnabar found around Las Ranas and Toluquilla, which lie on one of the largest deposits of the mineral in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Bill Veeck hired Lemon {{to succeed}} Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16, 1976. Lemon {{took over a}} Chicago team that {{finished}} in last place in the AL West in 1976. [...] "Bob {{is the type of}} manager we need {{at this stage of the}} game", Veeck said. During spring training of 1977, Lemon said, [...] "I think we'll surprise a few people." [...] White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference. Comparing Richards to Lemon, Bannister said, [...] "He'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the game, and only then we'd find <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> playing and where. Lemon's made it a serious operation." [...] As late as August 14, the White Sox were in first place in the AL West. The White Sox finished with a 90–72 record, a 26-game improvement. The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award. [...] "The fans got behind us after about three weeks. They had a lot to do with our success", Lemon said after being winning the award.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 42, Sleipnir's origins are described. Gangleri (described {{earlier in}} the book as King Gylfi in disguise) asks High who the horse Sleipnir belongs to and what there is to tell about it. High expresses {{surprise}} in Gangleri's {{lack of knowledge about}} Sleipnir and its origin. High tells a story set [...] "right {{at the beginning of the}} gods' settlement, when the gods established Midgard and built Val-Hall" [...] about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods in three seasons that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to this, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons with the help of no man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figured <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki was to blame.|$|E

VanDerWerff felt that the story failed to work [...] "despite featuring Don Most and Valerie Mahaffey doing their very best". Canning thought Most's role as Emma's [...] "racist Ginger Supremacist father was perhaps the greatest bit of casting I've seen on television all year". Urban thought the subplot [...] "worked really well", though she added that there were [...] "missteps". Brittany's campaign rally flash mob, complete with her performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", was a huge favorite; Poniewozik called it [...] "an excellent Brittany dance showcase". Hyman was critical of the [...] "ridiculousness" [...] of Rachel's run for senior class president, a development Urban said [...] "made absolutely zero sense". VanDerWerff lauded the [...] "montage of the kids finding <b>out</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> cast" [...] in West Side Story, and said it [...] "might be the best thing the show has ever done." [...] Amy Lee of The Huffington Post wrote, [...] "The football team is dancing again. This can only be good."
