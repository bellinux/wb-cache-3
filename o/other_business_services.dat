30|$|This gives {{evidence}} of a relation between three rankings: the most central sectors in each European country, the most central sectors in the EU regional economy, and the most intra-EU traded goods and services. In addition to finding a relation between the most important sectors and the most intra-EU traded ones, we also explored {{if there is a}} relation between our results and the sectors with the highest share in GDP in each economy and the sectors with the highest relative shares with respect to the EU. Relative shares show the share of a sector in one country with respect to the share of that sector in the entire EU, so countries with sectors that have high relative shares show an advantage in the production of the goods of that sector. 13 Own calculations of sector shares in the EU with 2005 Eurostat data showed that the sectors with the highest shares were construction, real-estate, wholesale trade, <b>other</b> <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> food and beverages, chemicals, health and social work, public administration and defense, and motor vehicles. The most common sectors with the highest shares in European countries were construction, real-estate, wholesale trade, <b>other</b> <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> food and beverages, chemicals, health and social work, public administration, motor vehicles, and machinery and equipment. Our results are in line with European Comission (a), which shows that the sectors with the highest shares in EU GDP are <b>other</b> <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> health and social work, construction, public administration, financial intermediation, wholesale trade, real-estate, education, retail trade, and other services. Secondly, the sectors with the highest relative shares in most countries are crude oil and natural gas, radio television and communication equipment, office machinery and computers, wearing apparel and furs, forestry and logging, electrical machinery and apparatus, metal ores, and basic metals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} wider {{economic}} role of professional services within the EU. Besides their importance measured by shares in value added, gross output or employment, professional services {{contribute significantly to}} the economic performance in other sectors via forward linkages. Traditionally these linkages are defined by the Inverse-Leontief Matrix of an Input-Output system. However, we introduce a measure based on the methodology of Fujita (2008) that is {{more closely related to}} the concept of forward linkages that is intended to be captured by most empirical studies. Our proposed linkages describe the embodied content of professional services per unit of gross output in the other industries, and first we derive some useful properties. These linkages are, secondly, used to outline the importance of <b>other</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> (that consists of around two thirds of professional services) visually by network graphs, showing the most important forward links in an economy. Input-Output data from 2005 show that the sector ‘other business services’ holds a central position in the inter-industry network in most countries of the EU- 27. Thirdly, we introduce some new summary measures of economic knock-on effects out of these linkages. We find that <b>other</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> account for the highest forwarded knock-on effects. In 2005 the total embodied value of other business activities amounted to nearly 10 % of gross output in our sample of 20 countries of the EU in 2005 – the highest of all the industries covered. The value added share of other business activities attributable throughout the economy is 14 % compared to its own value added share of 8 % in the economy of the EU- 20 sample. These findings highlight the economic importance of <b>other</b> <b>business</b> <b>services</b> in general and professional services in particular...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{flows of}} {{international}} trade in services remain relatively concentrated in the European Union and the United States, {{a significant increase in}} emerging economies participation in them, particularly the BRICS, has been observed in recent years. According to IMF data, the average annual growth of services exports from the BRICS has been twice the one observed in OECD countries since 2003, what attests an increase in the relative importance of these countries in international trade in services. Given the rapid growth of trade in services in the BRICS, this article aims to analyze the participation of those countries in international trade in services. In order to do so, I analyze comparatively the participation of the BRICS in trade in services and identify competition and cooperation agendas between them. Then, the participation of the BRICS in New Dynamic Sectors trade is analyzed. Finally, I conclude that among the BRICS, only China and India {{seem to be able to}} assume positions of greater prominence in trade in services, particularly in sectors such as computing and information, as to India, and transport and <b>other</b> <b>business</b> <b>services,</b> in the case of China.
