5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest that the lack <b>of</b> <b>female</b> companionship for the male characters indicates their latent homosexuality and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder {{to apply to the}} play because of Sullivan's addition <b>of</b> <b>female</b> characters and heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>female</b> social dominance sets lemurs {{apart from}} most other primates and mammals; in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band {{together to form}} coalitions that displace them. However, many Eulemur species are exceptions and the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) does not exhibit female dominance. When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain dominance varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs <b>of</b> <b>female</b> aggression. Male crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.|$|E

5|$|A higher {{percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>female</b> {{workers of the}} bee species Apis cerana are reported to activate their ovaries than those of Apis mellifera or Apis florea.

5|$|As {{the two are}} {{otherwise}} unattested outside of Snorri's Prose Edda, suggestions have been made that Hjúki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) posits that Snorri may have known or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hjúki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} dís (a type <b>of</b> <b>female</b> deity).|$|E
5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism and specifically {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism. According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but {{are part of an}} underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning. In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes <b>of</b> <b>female</b> passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride.

5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were found {{in some of the}} graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, {{there was a lack of}} weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence <b>of</b> <b>female</b> skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E

5|$|Etty was {{the first}} British artist to specialise in the nude, and the prurient {{reaction}} of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.
