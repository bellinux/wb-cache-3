40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} two dimensions <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge, that is, breadth <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> (the number <b>of</b> words known) and depth <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> (the richness <b>of</b> word knowledge), and their effects on different aspects of English reading in Chinese high school students learning English {{as a second language}}. Two hundred and forty-six Grade 8 students in China were administered measures <b>of</b> word reading, <b>vocabulary</b> breadth, vo-cabulary depth, and reading comprehension. Results showed that breadth and depth <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> were moderately correlated. They both contributed to word reading, but breadth <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> had a stronger effect than depth of vocabu-lary. When reading comprehension was the outcome measure, vocabulary breadth significantly predicted a multiple-choice reading comprehension meas-ure, which requires general understanding of the text, while vocabulary depth contributed to summary writing, a measure of deeper text processing. Discussion focuses on the important roles of different dimensions <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge for different types of second language reading. According to the Lexical Quality Hypothesis (Perfetti 1985, 2007), skilled reading depends on high-quality lexical representations, and therefore vocabulary should be a powerful predictor of reading. Many empirical studies in both English as a first language (EL 1) and English as a second language (ESL) have demonstrated that there is a close relationship between vocabulary knowledge and reading (e. g. Stahl and Fairbanks 1986; Qian 1999, 2002; Nation 2001; Beck et al. 2002). Although many studies have found a strong relationship between vocabulary and reading, they have often employed only a single measure <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> and have not addressed the multidimensional nature <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge (Kieffer and Lesaux 2008). It has been proposed that traditional measures <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> assess mainly breadth <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary,</b> because although they do capture a sense of how many words are known, they do not indicate how well or how deeply those word...|$|R

50|$|The {{emergence}} of terminology of Hakha Lai {{is one of}} the reason where Lai language is more diversified than as known. CACC calls it Hakha station language. Unlike other dialects, Baungshe is not a tonal language. That's the reason why the accent or tone of Baungshe dialect speakers differs from township to township and village to village. Therefore, the orthography, phonology and some the vocabularies used in one township may not be used in other townships. However, there is almost no discrepancy <b>of</b> <b>vocabularies</b> between Hakha Lai used in capital Haka / Hakha, Matupi and Thantlang townships.

Teaching <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> is a process which is inextricably entwined with understanding relations between new words and phonetic and grammar aspects of the language.

The complexity is in the scope <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> to be remembered, {{as well as in}} the differences between grammar structures used in Russian and Kazakh. The simplification is in the fact that students are fully aware that lexical competence is formed gradually, and that every language has its lexical base required at the initial stage, and that such base is to be developed for mastering a specific language. Before identifying the methods <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> semantization in the course of teaching a language to foreign students, students shall be offered active vocabulary, used to express their ideas orally and in written form, and passive vocabulary, used to perceive oral and written information.

5000|$|In a wide sense, microlearning can be {{understood}} as a metaphor which refers to micro aspects of a variety of learning models, concepts and processes. [...] "No matter if learning refers to the process of building up and organizing knowledge, to the change of behaviour, of attitudes, of values, of mental abilities, of cognitive structures, of emotional reactions, of action patterns or of societal dimensions, in all cases we have the possibility to consider micro, [...] and macro aspects of the various views on more or less persisting changes and sustainable alterations of performances." [...] (Hug 2005, p. 4). Depending on frames and domains of reference, micro, meso and macro aspects vary. They are relational concepts. For example, in the context of language learning, one might think of micro aspects in terms <b>of</b> <b>vocabularies,</b> phrases, sentences, and distinguish them from situations and episodes (meso aspects) and socio-cultural specifics or complex semantics (macro aspects). In a more general discourse on learning, one might differentiate between the learning of individuals, group learning or learning of organizations and the learning of generations or societies.|$|E
