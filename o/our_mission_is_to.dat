500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Soviet {{leadership}} headed by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and the Politburo, were {{not eager to}} send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB Chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, {{the head of the}} International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, [...] "Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now <b>our</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> determine our further actions, so as to preserve our position in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there." [...] Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about [...] "the undesirable turn of events" [...] taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.|$|E

[...] However, despite instituting risk minimisation procedures, including wearing of robes, multiple gloves, surgical masks and goggles, hospital workers {{continued to}} fall ill. [...] Twelve more died. [...] At the funeral of an Italian nun on 7 November, he attempted to rally the morale of his workers: [...] "It is our vocation to save life.

40|$|Abstract. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) Bio-Portal {{provides}} common {{access for}} browsing and querying a large set of ontologies that {{are commonly used}} in biomedical communities. One of <b>our</b> <b>missions</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> align lexical features (i. e., textual definitions) that are commonly used in these ontologies across different representation formats with standard tags and to represent them in a standard way to the users. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a recommendation of the World-Wide-Web Consortium (W 3 C) for a common data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems on the Semantic Web. The BioPortal {{is in the process}} of adopting SKOS in the backend representation for its content. During this process, we discovered that there exists a set of commonly-used lexical features shared by the biomedical ontologies that SKOS does not yet represent. In this paper, we discuss our proposed SKOS extensions to cover this set of commonly used lexical features, the rationales, and the detailed description of each proposed construct. ...|$|R
