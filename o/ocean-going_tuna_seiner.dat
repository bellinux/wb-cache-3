Differences in past estimates made from <b>tuna</b> <b>seiners</b> and research ships and aircraft have been noted by Brazier (1978). To compare various methods of estimating dolphin school sizes a research cruise was undertaken with the following major objectives: 1) compare estimates made by observers aboard a <b>tuna</b> <b>seiner</b> and in the ship's helicopter, from aerial photographs, and from counts made at the backdown channel, 2) compare estimates of observers who are told the count of the school size after making their estimate to the observer who is not aware of the count to determine if observers can learn to estimate more accurately, and 3) obtain movie and still photographs of dolphin schools of known size at various stages of chase, capture and release to be used for observer training. The secondary objectives of the cruise were to: 1) obtain life history specimens and data from any dolphins that were killed incidental to purse seining. These specimens and data were to be analyzed by the U. S.

40|$|One {{challenge}} of the implementation of observer programs is the difficulty of ensuring an adequate statistical coverage of whole fleets, and this may hamper {{the usefulness of the}} data for management purposes. These constraints make it necessary to find alternative cost-effective methods. Electronic monitoring (EM) systems are being used in some fisheries as an alternative, or a complement to human observers. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} test the use and reliability of EM on a tropical <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiner</b> in the Atlantic Ocean. To achieve this objective 61 free and FAD sets of a <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiner</b> were closely monitored to compare information provided by EM and onboard observers to determine if EM can reliably document fishing effort, set-type, tuna catch, and bycatch. Set-type was correctly identified using EM for 60 of the 61 sets. Total tuna catch per set was not significantly different between EM and observer data sets; however, species composition did not match for all the species between EM and observers. Overall, bycatch species were underestimated by EM, but large bodied species such as billfishes were well documented. The analyses in this study showed that EM can be used to determine the fishing effort (number of sets), set-type, and total tuna catch as reliably as observers can. In order to be fully comparable with observer data, improvements for accurately estimating the bycatch will need to be developed in the EM system. Operational aspects that need to be improved for an EM program to be implemented include standardising installation and onboard catch handling methodology, as well as improvements in video technology deployment...|$|R
40|$|Billfishes are not {{targeted}} by <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiners,</b> {{but they can}} be taken incidentally during the setting operation. Because by-catch information is not recorded in the commercial logbooks, it is important to quantify by-catches taken by the purse seine fishery in the Atlantic Ocean. In this paper, we attempted to estimate the total by-catch of billfishes generated by the European tropical tuna purse seine fishery in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from 1991 to 2000. Information on the by-catch of billfish was collected by scientific observers at sea during the European Union Bigeye Program. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to account for some uncertainties in the changes over time of the fishing strategies adopted by the purse seine fishermen operating in this ocean. This study indicates that the temporary moratorium on fishing with FADs adopted by the European purse seiners, combined with a {{decrease in the number of}} fishing operations, produced a substantial decrease in incidental catches of marlins from 450 - 520 t/year to less than 300 t/year. For the sailfishes, the by-catch was very low (between 40 t and 70 t per year). RÉSUM...|$|R
40|$|Fisheries bycatch is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most significant causes of mortality for many marine species, including vulnerable megafauna. In the open ocean, <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiners</b> are known to use several cetacean species to detect tuna schools. This exposes the cetaceans to encirclement which can lead to incidental injury or death. While interactions between fishers and cetaceans have been well documented in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, little is known about these interactions and potential mortalities in the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Here, we provide the first quantification of these interactions in both oceans by analyzing a large database of captain's logbooks (1980 to 2011) and observations collected by onboard scientific observers (1995 to 2011). Distribution maps of sightings per unit effort highlighted main areas of relatively high co-occurrence: east of the Seychelles (December to March), the Mozambique Channel (April to May) and the offshore waters of Gabon (April to September). The percentage of cetacean-associated fishing sets was around 3 % in both oceans and datasets whereas 0. 6 % of sets had cetaceans encircled. Of the 194 cetaceans encircled in a purse seine net (122 baleen whales, 72 delphinids), immediate apparent survival rates were high (Atlantic: 92 %, Indian: 100 %). Among recorded mortalities, 8 involved pantropical spotted dolphins Stenella attenuata and 3 involved humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae. These high survival rates suggest that setting nets close to cetaceans has a low immediate apparent impact on the species involved. Our findings will contribute to the development of an ecosystem approach to managing fisheries and accurate cetacean conservation measures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the patterns of}} reproductive seasonality in two species of dolphin in the eastern tropical Pacific: Stenella affenualu and S. longirosrris. These are the principal species used by <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiners</b> in locating schools of yellowfin tuna in this area. Birthdate distributions are calculated from the lengths-at-capture of fetuses and calves killed in fishing operations, the dates of capturs, and the estimated growth curves for these species. Although births were found to occur at all times of the year, distinct modes {{could be seen in}} the distributions. Geographic dlfferences in patterns of seasonality could be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} strength of the observed modes, the number of modes. and their timing. The northern stock of S. arrenuofa has a diffuse bimodal pattern in annual reproduction with peaks in spring and autumn. The southern stock of this species has a strong unimodal pattern whose timing corresponds to the spring peak in the northern stock. The eastern spinner form of S. longirosfris also has a single annual peak in reproduction, between March and June, with regonal differences in the timing of this mode. The whitebelly spinner form of S. longtrosrris shows a bimodal pattern with peaks in spring and autumn. These seasonal patterns in reproduction can affect reproductive rate measurements by changng our concept of stock boundaries or by introducing biases due to time of sampling. If the mating season is short, this can also limit the rate at which females can be inseminated after an aborted pregnancy, calf death, or weaning...|$|R

Total number of pole-and-line vessels (larger than 20 GRT) was 116 in 2007 which is 7 vessels (6 %) less than that in 2006. The total WCP-CA catch of tunas (Pacific bluefin, albacore, bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack) by the Japanese fishery in 2007 was 482, 840 mt that corresponds to 105 % of 459, 679 mt in 2006. In 2007, the catch of tunas by the purse seine fishery was 270, 997 mt (56 % of the total catch of tunas), with 128, 632 mt (27 %) by the pole-and-line, 69, 943 mt (15 %) by the longline, and the remaining 3 %was made by the other gears.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the fishing effort exerted by purse <b>seiners</b> on tropical <b>tuna</b> requires a constant monitoring {{of the changes in}} individual fishing power of purse seiners due to changes in vessel characteristics, fishing gears or fishing strategies. Also, since the 1990 s, increasing numbers of drifting Fish Aggregating Devices have been used by this fleet. As dFADs contribute to a reduction of search times, traditional measures of fishing effort such as search time or fishing time are inappropriate. Here, using logbook data from the French and the Spanish purse seine fleets over 2003 - 2014, the effects of purse seiners' characteristics (length, the size of the wells, period of construction) and their use of support vessels on the efficiency of purse seiners are analyzed with GLM models. 3 dimensions of the efficiency of purse seiners are analyzed: monthly catch rates, monthly frequency of fishing sets and monthly distance of fishing sets. Among others, we find that support vessels contribute to an increase in catch rates (+ 10 tons per day) and in distance between fishing set. In a second steps, the results of the GLM models are used to build 3 indexes of fishing effort that are compared to a simple monitoring of the number of EU purse seiners over 2003 - 2014. Ours result show that this simple index provide a biased image of the evolution of fishing effort for the purse seine fishery. Though preliminary, they indicate that the main components of fishing power should be taken into account when measuring the fishing effort of tropical <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiners</b> in the Indian Ocean...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid 1990 s, {{the use of}} {{drifting}} Fish Aggregating Devices (dFADs) by purse seiners, artificial objects {{specifically designed}} to aggregate fish, has become an important mean of catching tropical tunas. In recent years, the massive deployments of dFADs, {{as well as the}} massive use of tracking devices on dFADs and natural floating objects, such as GPS buoys, have raised serious concerns for tropical tuna stocks, bycatch species and pelagic ecosystem functioning. Despite these concerns, relatively {{little is known about the}} modalities of dFAD use, making it difficult to assess and manage the impacts of this fishing practice. The present paper provides an overview of a 4 -year research on the use of dFADs by tropical <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiners</b> in the Western Indian Ocean. Though our primary objective was to derive information on dFAD fisheries from a large variety of quantitative sources of information (GPS buoy positions, onboard observers, logbooks and VMS), a multi-disciplinary approach was adopted throughout our research. Quantitative results (estimates of dFAD use, fishing efficiency and impacts of dFAD use) were discussed with French purse seine skippers during semi-structured interviews to understand their perception of the impacts of dFAD use and to propose adapted management options for tropical tuna purse seine dFAD fisheries. Interviews with French purse seine skippers revealed the existence of a competition between EU purse seine fleets, encouraging the recent increase in the use of dFADs. They underlined the need for a more efficient management of the fishery, including the implementation of catch quotas, a limitation of the capacity of purse seine fleets and a regulation of the use of support vessels...|$|R
40|$|Technological advancements can {{influence}} both the fishing {{power of a}} fleet and the fishing strategies itemploys. To investigate these potential linkages, we examined almost three decades of data (1981 &# 8211; 2008) from French tropical <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiners</b> operating in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Applying a sequence ofstatistical methods at different temporal and spatial scales, we analyzed two indicators of fishing power(sets per boat-day on fish aggregating devices (FADs) and sets per boat-day on free-swimming schools) each of which represent a distinct fishing mode. Our {{results show that the}} increasing modernizationof this fleet has led to increases in both fishing power and the available number of fishing strategies tochoose from. A key output of this analysis was the breakdown of fishing power time series (for each fishingmode) into separate periods of continuous years during which catchability was assumed to be constant,thus identifying regime shifts. This partitioning allowed us to identify when key changes occurred inthe fishery. Changes in FAD-associated fishing were mostly driven by the introduction of radio beacons(early 1990 s) which lead to an increase in fishing effort and an expansion of fishing grounds (directeffect) and the implementation of time-area management measures which resulted in a fragmentationof the traditional fishing grounds in the 2000 s (indirect effect). During the same period, fishing on free-swimming schools also increased despite the biomass of stocks decreasing and fishing grounds remainingunchanged. This suggests these increases were driven by improvements in fish detection technology (e. g.,bird radars, sonar). These identified increases are not entirely unexpected: indeed it is widely recognizedthat fishing power in the purse seine tuna fishery has increased over time. However, these increases donot necessarily occur linearly. Thus, understanding how fishing power is changing over time (such asdetermining when regime shifts occur) is critical to improving the CPUE standardization procedure intropical tuna purse seine fisheries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effect of Marine Stewardship Council {{certification}} on the allocation of fishing effort by Filipino purse seine fishers operating {{in the waters of}} the Parties to the Nauru Agreement. Targeting skipjack <b>tuna,</b> these purse <b>seiners</b> allocate effort under a vessel day scheme to either MSC certified free school fishing or non-MSC certified fishing on fish aggregating devices (FADs). Based on historical catch and price data, the optimal set of fishing activities are determined in terms of the mean and variance of fishers' gross margin at given levels of risk aversion. The results show that MSC certification stimulates fishers to reduce their allocation of effort on non-MSC compliant FADs, and consequently convert this effort to MSC compliant free school purse seining. In general, the MSC also increases the yearly gross margin of fishers as compared to the situation without MSC certification. The MSC therefore appears to be effective to a certain extent in promoting a transition to more sustainable fishing practices. However, the results also indicate that the risk profile of fishers is a key but underexplored dimension of assessing the potential impact of MSC certification on effort allocation...|$|R
40|$|By-catch {{species from}} {{tropical}} tuna purse seine fishery {{have been affected}} by fishery pressures since the last century; however, the habitat distribution and the climate change impacts on these species are poorly known. With the objective of predicting the potential suitable habitat for a shark (Carcharhinus falciformis) and a teleost (Canthidermis maculata) in the Indian, Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans, a MaxEnt species distribution model (SDM) was developed using data collected by observers in <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiners.</b> The relative percentage of contribution of some environmental variables (depth, sea surface temperature, salinity and primary production) and the potential impact of climate change on species habitat {{by the end of the}} century under the A 2 scenario (scenario with average concentrations of carbon dioxide of 856 ppm by 2100) were also evaluated. Results showed that by-catch species can be correctly modeled using observed occurrence records and few environmental variables with SDM. Results from projected maps showed that the equatorial band and some coastal upwelling regions were the most suitable areas for both by-catch species in the three oceans in concordance with the main fishing grounds. Sea surface temperature was the most important environmental variable which contributed to explain the habitat distribution of the two species in the three oceans in general. Under climate change scenarios, the largest change in present habitat suitability is observed in the Atlantic Ocean (around 16 % of the present habitat suitability area of C. falciformis and C. maculata, respectively) whereas the change is less in the Pacific (around 10 and 8 %) and Indian Oceans (around 3 and 2 %). In some regions such as Somalia, the Atlantic equatorial band or Peru's coastal upwelling areas, these species could lose potential habitat whereas in the south of the equator in the Indian Ocean, the Benguela System and in the Pacific coast of Central America, they could gain suitable habitat as consequence of global warming. This work presents new information about the present and future habitat distribution under climate change of both by-catch species which can contributes to the development of ecosystem-based fishery management and spatially driven management measures...|$|R

Important structural changes include the industry 2 ̆ 7 s early evolution from a competitive industry spun off from the sardine industry, to a tight vertically integrated oligopoly by WWII, to a weak unintegrated oligopoly today. Also examined are the roles of government policies and other institutions, the growth of foreign competition, imports, and industry globalization. A brief examination of the evolution of the 20 th-century Japanese tuna industry enables a comparison with the development of its U.

That is, has the industry 2 ̆ 7 s technological evolution been shaped by its structural and competitive evolution, and vice versa? The general hypothesis of a link between technological change and competition has a long history, dating at least from the classical and Marxian economists, through to today 2 ̆ 7 s game theorists and modern institutionalists. Particular attention is paid to the hypotheses developed by Joseph Schumpeter, who most forcefully set forth the argument that imperfect competition is necessary (if not sufficient) for technological advance in a capitalist economy. The author also contributes some preliminary work on a dynamic isoquant {{that can be used to}} examine the replacement of old technology with new technology. The intuitive implications of these various theories and views concerning the technology-competition link are examined for their relevance and usefulness in explaining observed events in the tuna industry.

40|$|Ecuador is an {{important}} player in the global tuna fishing and processing industry: The Ecuadorian industrial tuna fleet represents 17 % of the global <b>tuna</b> purse <b>seiner</b> fleet, {{and it is the}} second largest tuna processing country after Thailand. The fishing and processing operations of one of the largest vertically integrated tuna processing firms in Ecuador were evaluated regarding their environmental impacts and assumed representative of the Ecuadorian tuna processing industry. Results were compared with those of other international fish processing and other sources of animal protein for human consumption. Directions are finally identified toward reducing environmental impacts of both the tuna fishery and processing industry. Detailed operational fishery and processing data was collected from a representative Ecuadorian tuna processing firm, and the life cycle assessment framework applied to it for hotspot identification. Two functional units were used: 1 t of final product (for canned, pouched, vacuum bagged and mean products) and 1 t of "fish in product", which includes all process losses and normalises the final product/raw fish ratios among the different processing routes analysed. The ReCiPe impact assessment method was used. In the period 2012 - 2013, the studied sub-fleet featured a fuel use intensity of 835 L per landed tonne, which was 235 % higher than reported values for all tuna landings in the Pacific Ocean in 2009. Reasons for such underperformance may include inter-annual variations in tuna catchability and the fact that fuels are generally subsidised in Ecuador, and thus skippers perhaps do not apply sufficient fuel-saving strategies. The main contributors to impacts associated with tuna processing were the provision of tinplate cans (58. 0 % of the ReCiPe single score) and fuel use by the fishery (22. 6 %). Ecuadorian tuna products feature environmental impacts generally higher than those of other fish processing industries worldwide, yet lower than those of many alternative sources of fish and land animal protein. Efforts to reduce environmental impacts of Ecuadorian tuna processing should focus on the fuel performance of the providing fleet, and on the container technology. Increased use of larger tinplate cans, aluminium cans, or other non-metal container technologies (e. g. pouches and retort cups) would decrease environmental impacts of tuna processing. The sources of relative inefficiency observed for the Ecuadorian tuna fleet should be thoroughly investigated. Possible solutions could involve applying fuel-saving strategies...|$|R
