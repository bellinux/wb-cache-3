5|$|Shepton Mallet {{lies in the}} {{southern}} foothills of the Mendip Hills. The area is geologically founded on Forest Marble, Blue Lias and <b>Oolitic</b> <b>limestone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Above the Lias is the Lower Oolite Series {{which are}} chiefly clays and <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone.</b> The famous Bath Stone is {{obtained}} from the Great Oolite bed. Oxford Clay is the chief member of the Middle Oolite Series; and above this are the Upper Cretaceous rocks with Gault, Upper Greensand and Chalk. Alluvial flats and peat bogs occupy much of the centre of Somerset.|$|E
5|$|North {{and east}} of the Mendips the Carboniferous Limestone layers {{are found in the}} {{subsurface}} and are exposed in Avon Gorge, and are overlain by younger strata in Dundry Hill and the Cotswolds, where <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> of Jurassic age is found at the surface. West of the main Mendip plateau the Carboniferous Limestone continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm in the Bristol Channel.|$|E

40|$|On {{the top of}} the Zegrí Fm (Aalenian-Bajocian) oí the Median Subbetic in the Iznajar area (south of the Córdoba province) <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones</b> outcrop, {{interbedded}} between pelagic facies. These <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones</b> {{were previously}} interpreted as calcareous turbidites. The detailed study of their microfacies, stratigraphic location, geometry of the sedimentary beds and sedimentary structures has allowed us to interpret these limestones as deposited in isolated carbonate platforms similar to the recognized {{in other areas of the}} Median Subbetic. This interpretation asserts that the overlying and underlying pelagic sediments were deposited (o a moderate depth (some hundreds of meters...|$|R
5|$|The area {{through which}} the Wheeldale {{structure}} runs is predominantly uncultivated heather moorland. Hayes believes its appearance has remained fundamentally unchanged since the Bronze Age when its forest cover was removed to permit cultivation and grazing. Wheeldale Moor is poorly drained in places making it susceptible to flooding in both the ancient and modern eras. The underlying geology consists of patches of sand and gravel on top of mixed sandstone and <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone,</b> known as Ravenscar Group strata.|$|E
5|$|The {{base of the}} Kilmersdon valley {{consists}} of alluvium deposits. Above these, {{on both sides of}} all of the valleys, is a band of shales and clays from the Penarth group from the Triassic period. Most of the upland in this area is Lias Limestone (white and blue) while the highest part, above 130m, south of Haydon, is an outcrop of Inferior <b>Oolitic</b> <b>Limestone,</b> both are from the Jurassic period. The steepest slopes of both the Kilmersdon and Snail’s Bottom valleys have frequently slipped. Below these rocks are the coal bearing Carboniferous strata. Haydon is an outlying settlement of Radstock built to house miners from the local pit. The disused railway line and inclined railway at Haydon are important elements in the Kilmersdon valley east of Haydon. The modern landscape has a less maintained and ‘rougher’ character and texture than neighbouring agricultural areas caused mainly by the remnants of the coal industry and its infrastructure and changes in agricultural management. Disturbance caused by coal mining and the railways and the subsequent end of mining and abandonment of the railways has created valuable habitats for nature conservation.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{sedimentary}} rock forms when mineral constituents in solution become supersaturated and inorganically precipitate. Common chemical {{sedimentary rock}}s include <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> and rocks composed of evaporite minerals, such as halite (rock salt), sylvite, barite and gypsum.|$|E
50|$|Chalk {{as seen in}} Cretaceous {{deposits}} of Western Europe is unusual among sedimentary limestones in {{the thickness of the}} beds. Most cliffs of chalk have very few obvious bedding planes unlike most thick sequences of limestone such as the Carboniferous Limestone or the Jurassic <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones.</b> This presumably indicates very stable conditions over tens of millions of years.|$|R
50|$|The site is to {{the south}} west of Minchinhampton. It is {{important}} for the study of Middle Jurassic rocks of the Bathonian Stage. The exposed limestones contain a significant collection of fossil ammonites, which support them to be dated as morrisi zone. The rocks show the character change which occurs in rocks of this age from fine grained limestone to the coarser, <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones</b> of Minchinhamption.|$|R

On metallurgical subjects he also was an acknowledged authority; and he published observations on the order of sulphurability of metals (loi de Fournet).|$|R
25|$|London Stone is a {{historic}} landmark traditionally housed at 111 Cannon Street in the City of London. It is an irregular block of <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> measuring 53 × 43 × 30cm (21 × 17 × 12"), the remnant of a once much larger object that had stood for many centuries {{on the south side}} of the street. Currently the stone is housed at the Museum of London pending reconstruction of the 111 Cannon Street building.|$|E
25|$|Bath Stone is an <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> {{comprising}} granular {{fragments of}} calcium carbonate. Originally {{obtained from the}} Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines under Combe Down, Somerset, England, its warm, honey colouring gives the World Heritage City of Bath, England its distinctive appearance. An important feature of Bath Stone {{is that it is}} a 'freestone', so-called because it can be sawn or 'squared up' in any direction, unlike other rocks such as slate, which forms distinct layers.|$|E
25|$|He {{published}} his findings with many pictures from his fossil collection, enabling others to investigate their distribution and test his theories. His collection is especially good on Jurassic fossils he {{collected from the}} Cornbrash, Kimmeridge clay, Oxford clay, <b>Oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> and other horizons in the sequence. They included many types of brachiopods, ammonites and molluscs characteristic of the shallow seas {{in which they were}} deposited. Some of the names he coined (like Cornbrash) are still used today for this formation.|$|E

The second one, shows the silicification as generated from marine waters in diagenetic environments at relatively higher temperatures, during Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous time...|$|R
5000|$|The Group {{comprises}} up to 120m {{thickness of}} <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones</b> and subordinate sandstones and mudstones laid down during the Jurassic Period. In the East Midlands it comprises (in descending order i.e. oldest last) the Lincolnshire Limestone, Grantham and Northampton Sand formations {{whereas in the}} Cotswold Hills it comprises the Salperton Limestone, Aston Limestone and Birdlip Limestone formations.The limestones are rich in organic material. The ammonite Parkinsonia parkinsoni, an index fossil for the Bathonian, [...] is native to the Inferior Oolite of Burton Bradstock.|$|R
50|$|The railway {{construction}} led to {{the exposure}} of c. 180 million year old Cotswold limestone. The protection of these exposures {{was one of the}} main reasons why the trust purchased the site. The Middle Jurassic <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones</b> formed as layers of sediment in the shallow tropical seas. The structures and fossils in the different beds are significant research resources for investigating and evaluating the environmental conditions and lifeforms of those times. The bed exposures in the reserve are mostly level, but faults are visible and there are breaks in continuity.|$|R
25|$|The Rollright Stones is {{a complex}} of three Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments {{near the village of}} Long Compton, on the borders of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire. Constructed from local <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone,</b> the three monuments now known as the King's Men and the Whispering Knights in Oxfordshire and the King Stone in Warwickshire, are {{distinct}} in their design and purpose, and were built at different periods in late prehistory. The stretch of time during which the three monuments were erected bears witness to a continuous tradition of ritual behaviour on sacred ground, from the 4th to the 2nd millennium BCE.|$|E
25|$|The present London Stone is {{only the}} upper portion of a once much larger object, as {{described}} below under History. The surviving portion is a block of <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> approximately 53cm wide, 43cm high, and 30cm front to back (21 × 17 × 12inches). A study in the 1960s indicated that the stone is Clipsham Limestone, a good-quality stone from Rutland transported to London for building purposes in both the Roman and medieval periods. More recently Kevin Hayward has suggested {{that it may be}} Bath stone, the stone most used for monuments and sculpture in early Roman London and in Saxon times.|$|E
25|$|As the Jurassic period started, Pangaea {{began to}} break up and sea levels rose, as England drifted on the Eurasian Plate to between 30° and 40° north. With much of England under water again, {{sedimentary}} rocks were deposited and can now be found underlying much of southern England from the Cleveland Hills of Yorkshire to the Jurassic Coast in Dorset, including clays, sandstones, greensands, <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> of the Cotswold Hills, corallian limestone of the Vale of White Horse and the Isle of Portland. A particularly interesting Jurassic site is on the North Yorkshire coast between Staithes and Port Mulgrave.|$|E
50|$|Water {{draining}} from Black Down has exposed rocks {{from the}} Devonian sandstones of the Portishead Formation which show through the limestone, Carboniferous mudstones of the Avon Group, limestones of the Black Rock <b>Limestone</b> Subgroup and <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Burrington Oolite Subgroup; however the exact {{mechanism by which}} the gorge was formed is unknown. The northern and {{lower end of the}} combe, which was once the bed of the Congresbury Yeo, cuts through overlying Clifton Down Limestone. Triassic dolomitic conglomerate can also locally be seen along the combe.|$|R
40|$|An {{excellent}} stratigraphic {{section of}} the Middle Jurassic showing {{the record of the}} transition facies from hemipelagic (Baños Fm) to <b>oolitic</b> shallow platform <b>limestones</b> (Jabalcuz Fm) in the Intermediate Domain of the Subbetic, is described and interpreted in terms of depositional processes. The shallow carbonate platform sedimentation, which was abandoned {{toward the end of the}} Early Liassic, was thus restored in some areas of the Southern Iberian Continental Paleomargin (SICP) in the Middle Jurassic. The described facies succession make up a shallowing-upward sequence which begins with a thick accumulation of breccias and ends with cross bedded <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones.</b> The triggering factors of this shallowing-upward sequence were, probably, tectonics and relative sea-level fluctuations. All the described features and events took place during the rifting episode affecting the SICP from the Early Jurassi...|$|R
50|$|The quarry (Snowshill Hill) {{lies in the}} Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and exposes a {{relatively}} thick sequence of Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones,</b> and thin clays of significant importance in correlating similar sequences in north Gloucestershire. The rocks, which belong to the Clypeus Grit, Chipping Norton Formation, Sharps Hill Formation and the Taynton Limetone Formation, are considered to have been laid down c. 170 million years ago. This {{would have been in}} a warm, shallow sea which covered much of the Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire areas. The conditions then would have been similar to those in the present day Bahama Banks in the Caribbean.|$|R
25|$|At {{the very}} top of the hill of Corton are the densely covered {{woodland}} known as the Bois de Corton. On the slopes just below the woodland, most of the clay topsoil has eroded away leaving a narrow band of <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> mixed with marl. This band of limestone, which has a radial exposition of 270 degrees stretching from the east-facing lieu-dits of Bassess Mourottes and Hautes Mourottes above Ladoix-Serrigny to down south and west to northwest facing lieu-dits of Le Charlemagne above Pernand-Vergelesses, is most suited for white wine grape varieties and have historically been the source for Corton-Charlemagne wine.|$|E
25|$|The soils {{closest to}} the plains of the Saône are too fertile, with patches of poorly drained soils, that make growing quality wine grapes difficult. As you move upwards along the cote {{escarpment}} the soil becomes progressively less fertile with higher proportions of the well-draining and highly porous <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> and less clay. At this elevation of around 800ft (250 m) most of the premier cru vineyards start to be found with areas of particularly favored location being designated as grand cru. The band of suitable soils for viticulture is narrow because too far up the hills (beyond 1000ft/300 m) the top soil becomes too thin to support vines.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} these rocks are {{overlaid}} with <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> which forms flat-topped tabular hills with an escarpment {{to the north}} and gentler slopes to the south. Ice action in the last glaciation deepened pre-existing valleys, and determined the line of the rivers and streams. Newtondale to the north of Pickering was cut by meltwater from ice in Eskdale gouging a deep channel as it flowed southwards to the lake which filled the Vale of Pickering. This lake was blocked by ice and glacial deposits near the coast so it drained through the Kirkham Gorge towards the River Ouse. South of Pickering, extensive marshes have been drained and exploited as fertile agricultural land.|$|E
40|$|Three dredge hauls were {{obtained}} in I 973 by R/V Vema {{from the northern}} slopes of Hatton Bank. The most common rock types in each haul are arkosic and subarkosic arenite. The arkosic arenite is associated with other sedi-mentary rocks which include fossiliferous <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones.</b> The age range of the limestones in-ferred from palynology is Cretaceous-Pala-eogene. We argue that these rocks are of local origin {{and that they were}} formed near the margin of a shallow-water basin during the early separation f Rockall Plateau and Green-land. G EOLO O ICAL and geophysical evidence suggest that Rockall Plateau is a large fragment of continental crust which was originally joined to Europe and Green...|$|R
40|$|With {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} {{transferring to}} deeper and more ancient marine strata, more researches have been conducted about the Meso–Neoproterozoic and Cambrian microbial carbonate rocks by petroleum geologists. The Cambrian deposits experienced the first transgression of the Paleozoic, with shallow marine facies depositing in most areas, which are favorable for different kinds of biological reproduction. The Lower Cambrian in Beijing area is lithologically dominated by purple red shales interbedded with limestones, the Middle Cambrian is mainly composed of thick <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones,</b> and the Upper Cambrian consists of thin limestones and flat-pebble conglomerates. Two beds of microbial carbonate rocks were discovered in the Cambrian outcrops in the vicinity of Beijing. One is from the Zhangxia Formation of Middle Cambrian, and the other is from the Gushan Formation of Upper Cambrian. The microbialites are characterized by combination of multiple stromatolites forming different bioherms. The bioherms are mostly in oval shape and with different sizes, which are 3 – 4  m long, and 1 – 3  m high. The surrounding strata beneath the bioherms are <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones.</b> A central core of flat-pebble conglomerates occurred within each bioherm. Wavy or columnar stromatolites grow on the basis of flat-pebble conglomerates, with dentate erosional surfaces. The bioherm carbonate rocks are interpreted as products from a deep ramp sedimentary environment where potential oil and gas reservoirs can be found. The analysis of sedimentological characteristics of bioherm carbonate rocks and its lithofacies palaeogeography has significant implication for petroleum exploration. Research on geological record of microbialites is beneficial to investigating the Earth evolution, biodiversity, palaeoenvironment and palaeoclimate change, as well as biological extinction event during geological transitions. It also gives warning to human beings of modern biological crisis...|$|R
50|$|The {{lowermost}} (and hence oldest) {{unit of the}} Great Estuarine Group is the ‘Cullaidh Shale Formation’. Overlying this is the 'Elgol Sandstone Formation', {{the type}} locality {{of which is to}} be found at the village of Elgol on Skye. These sandstones are interpreted as being deltaic in origin. Above the sandstone is the 'Lealt Shale Formation', a unit in which fossils of creatures which lived in brackish lagoons abound. These include mussels, sharks and plesiosaurs. The discovery of the first plesiosaur was made in 1844 by the geologist Hugh Miller. The ‘Kildonnan Member’ of the Lealt Shale Formation contains stromatolites and various microfossils such as dinoflagellates and acritarchs. The succeeding ‘Lonfearn Member’ consist of shales and thin shelly and <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones</b> with conchostracan fossils. It has also yielded dinosaur footprints.|$|R
500|$|The square {{tower was}} built of local coursed <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone</b> with Doulting stone dressings. The walls are [...] thick at the base, and the tower is [...] in plan. The doorway has an ovolo moulded arch which is [...] high. This {{suggests}} a construction {{date in the}} late 16th or early 17th century. Another entrance was made for cattle to enter {{at a later date}} but this has been blocked up. Several of the windows have also been filled with stone. On the north-east face there were two-light chamfered mullioned windows on each floor while on the north-west wall they were one- and two-light windows.|$|E
500|$|The {{house is}} built of {{two types of}} Bath Stone, and is highly picturesque, bristling with turrets and {{possessing}} an elaborate roof. The combined effect of the architecture and chosen materials {{has been described by}} journalist Sir Simon Jenkins as [...] "severe". During restoration, stonemasons either conserved or, on occasion, copy-carving new sections, carving new mouldings to replace standard architectural elements that formed the weathering, as well repointing most of the miles of lime pointing. All stone was accurately matched to the original, with Veyzeys quarry near Tetbury providing Cotswold <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestone.</b> The house, which includes the servants' wing and the chapel, was made a Grade II* listed building in 1973, and has since been upgraded to Grade I.|$|E
500|$|Hitherto, {{the quarry}} masons had always hewn stone roughly {{providing}} blocks of varying size. Wood required stone blocks {{to be cut}} with crisp clean edges for his distinctive classical façades. The [...] Stone was extracted by the [...] "room and pillar" [...] method, by which chambers were mined, leaving pillars of stone to support the roof. Bath stone is an <b>Oolitic</b> <b>Limestone</b> comprising granular fragments of calcium carbonate laid down during the Jurassic (195 to 135 million years ago). An important feature of Bath stone {{is that it is}} a freestone, that is one that can be sawn or 'squared up' in any direction, unlike other rocks such as slate, which forms distinct layers. It was extensively used in the Roman and Medieval periods on domestic, ecclesiastical and civil engineering projects such as bridges.|$|E
50|$|The very {{simplified}} diagram {{is not to}} scale, and has massive vertical exageration. It shows {{a vertical}} section through the strata from Aynho to King's Cliffe (line A to B on the map), and ignores the many river valleys and other topographical features. Various sedimentary rocks were laid down over the Middle Jurassic Epoch during periods of shallow seas and deeper oceans, {{in what is now}} Northamptonshire, creating the <b>Oolitic</b> <b>limestones,</b> sandstones and ironstones found across the length of the county. Various deposition periods were separated by periods above sea level, creating formations that get progressively thinner and then become absent in places that had periods without any deposition.

40|$|Cathodoluminescence {{analyses}} on {{samples from}} Middle Jurassic <b>oolitic</b> <b>limestones</b> {{allow us to}} reconstruct the diagenetic history of these oil and gas reservoirs: a succession of events starting with the early, synsedimentary phases of marine cementation and ending {{with the addition of}} hydrocarbons to the reservoir. Constraints on the timing of events are derived from their calibration with the chronology of the well-known regional tectonic calendar. Fracturing, due first to the post-Pyrenean extension and then to the Alpine compression, led respectively in Oligocene times to a recharge of the aquifer and a correlative change in cementation, and in Miocene times to the addition of hydrocarbons into the same flow units, this last event blocking diagenesis, at least in the zone above the oil-water contact. Distributions of cements and residual porosity within sedimentary units without stratigraphic significance, called here "pseudo-parasequences", were for the most part inherited from the original depositional facies...|$|R
