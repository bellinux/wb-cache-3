5|$|Even {{though to}} me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform is kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> blackface, I am just in {{acceptance}} over it, because something {{is better than}} nothing.

5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a photo album, so every single scene is kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} {{some insight into}} his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly {{among the most important}} of these for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends the extent to which a particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others <b>of</b> <b>like</b> mind.|$|E
30|$|The first {{question}} concerns {{the relations between}} the characteristics of the Facebook posts and the number <b>of</b> <b>likes</b> and shares they received. To make the statistical analysis possible the posts had to be divided to at least two groups based on the number <b>of</b> <b>likes</b> and shares they received. If a post was liked by 1800 people or less it was coded as Low and if more than 1800 people liked a post it was coded as high. For this section of the study 491 posts were taken into consideration, among which 245 posts fell under the group with low number <b>of</b> <b>likes,</b> and 246 posts received high number <b>of</b> <b>likes.</b>|$|R
40|$|It was {{hypothesised}} that consumers' expectations <b>of</b> <b>liking</b> for a food {{would be}} affected by its appearance both when raw and when cooked and that the impact of these expectations on actual liking for the product after eating would vary with consumer awareness of internal body states (private body consciousness). We found that consumers' expectations <b>of</b> <b>liking</b> for the food generated by the appearance of the cooked product was related to expectation <b>of</b> <b>liking</b> from viewing the raw product. Under some conditions, consumers liked a food less after consumption if a raw product that generated low expectation <b>of</b> <b>liking</b> had been presented beforehand. There was no evidence that private body consciousness modified the consumers' susceptibility to expectation effects. It was concluded that expectations <b>of</b> <b>liking</b> for a food generated by appearance both when raw and cooked influenced final evaluation of the product during consumption.

5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
5|$|Barber {{finished}} hubs for {{the four}} coins in September 1883, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent A. Loudon Snowden had two sets struck and sent to Preston in Washington. Snowden praised {{the beauty of the}} coins, and was happy that Barber had required less relief than needed on US coins <b>of</b> <b>like</b> value, since this meant the coins would be easier for the Mint to strike. Preston sent the coins to Spreckels in San Francisco, and authorized Philadelphia to make additional sets, both for its coin cabinet and for the director's office in Washington. Barber was instructed to make five sets of coining dies for each denomination, to be sent to the San Francisco Mint, with instructions that no coins were to be struck pending a final contract with Spreckels, and that the dies were to remain Hawaiian government property, to be turned over on request.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2012, Madonna's {{official}} website announced that her former record company, Warner Bros. Records (1982–2009), was to release and reprint the eleven-disc box set. It was released to coincide {{and on the}} same date as the 2012 studio album MDNA in the United States. The set includes every previous studio album Madonna had released; the remastered versions of Madonna (1983), Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986), plus the original versions <b>of</b> <b>Like</b> a Prayer (1989), Erotica (1992), Bedtime Stories (1994), Ray of Light (1998), Music (2000), American Life (2003), Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005) and Hard Candy (2008) with each disc housed in a cardboard sleeve. To complement {{the release of the}} box set, iTunes sold every Madonna studio album digitally for £3.95 for a limited time in the UK. On the same day as its release, Warner Bros. released another box set Madonna: Original Album Series which included five discs; the remastered version of True Blue, Like a Prayer, Ray of Light, Music and Confessions on a Dance Floor.|$|E
30|$|We {{analyzed}} the number <b>of</b> <b>likes</b> {{in order to}} get an idea on the priority of the needs posted. On average, a participant used the like functionality 2.1 times. However, the use <b>of</b> <b>likes</b> varied significantly between the groups (see Table 2).|$|R

A higher number <b>of</b> <b>likes</b> may be the indication of a higher attention to the post. Also when a post is liked it is automatically shown to other Facebook users, suggesting them to check out the post because their friend has liked it. Some studies have shown relations between the number <b>of</b> <b>likes</b> and people’s attention to specific content e.g. loyalty to a brand (De Vries et al. 2012).|$|R

5|$|The Pitch Document {{described}} Avatars as {{sharing the}} ability to envision the past, present and future, both literally and symbolically. Accessing this plane of pure truth is given as an Avatar's birthright and can be improved through study and practice. Avatars can manipulate and transmit the resulting visions through dreams to others. As far as established, only Creatures of Darkness suffer physical weakness or pain when their opposite makes use of his powers. Avatars can sense the existence of their moral opponent, but are unable to detect or identify them outside of close physical proximity. They can, however, easily detect and locate an Avatar <b>of</b> <b>like</b> kind over great distances with great accuracy. These abilities contribute to the convergence of the two storylines in Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands <b>of</b> <b>like</b> polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind <b>of</b> <b>like</b> everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

40|$|The {{marketing}} {{literature has}} provided a limited examination of the concept <b>of</b> <b>liking,</b> and even this has mainly occurred within business-to-business or advertising contexts. In this paper, the authors propose {{a model of the}} intervening role <b>of</b> <b>liking</b> in the customer-service provider relationship in two countries, China and Greece. The antecedents <b>of</b> <b>liking</b> include three key service constructs, namely customer education, customer participation, and service quality. The outputs <b>of</b> <b>liking</b> are proposed to be affective trust and affective commitment, which in turn influence (behavioral) loyalty. The research model is tested using samples from China (N= 277) and from Greece (N= 306). The model is largely supported in both samples. Therefore, the authors suggest that liking in financial services has {{an important role in the}} customer-service provider relationship. Implications for international businesses are discussed...|$|R
