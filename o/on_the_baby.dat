Cherlindrea {{identifies}} the baby as Elora Danan, the future princess of Tir Asleen and Bavmorda's bane, and assigns Willow the task of helping the baby fulfill her destiny. Willow sends Meegosh home, and two of the brownies, Franjean and Rool, are instructed to guide Willow to the sorceress Fin Raziel. The three of them later encounter Madmartigan at a tavern, where he is disguised as a woman to hide from Lug, a cuckolded husband, who then flirts with the disguised Madmartigan. Sorsha arrives and reveals his identity, and in the ensuing brawl started by the furious Lug upon the realization that Madmartigan is not a woman, Willow, Madmartigan, and the brownies escape. Madmartigan guides them to a lake where Raziel lives, but departs again as they cross it.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{medicines}} {{pass into}} breastmilk in small amounts. Some {{have no effect}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> {{and can be used}} while breastfeeding. Women with hypothyroidism may be unable to produce milk. Alcohol use during pregnancy carries a significant risk of serious birth defects, but consuming alcohol after the birth of the infant is considered safe.|$|E
25|$|Postpartum {{infection}} {{is one of}} the main causes of maternal death and may account for 10% of maternal deaths globally. Caesarean section greatly increases the risk of infection and associated morbidity (estimated to be between 5 and 20 times as high), and routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections is recommended. Infection can occur in around 8% of women who have caesareans, largely endometritis, urinary tract infections and wound infections. The use of preventative antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section decreased wound infection, endometritis, and serious infectious complications by about 65%. Side effects and effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is unclear.|$|E

The {{most common}} are dry skin, overgrown nails, creases <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> palms and soles of their feet, minimal fat, {{a lot of}} hair on their head, and either a brown, green, or yellow discoloration of their skin. Doctors diagnose post-mature birth based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> physical appearance {{and the length of}} the mother's pregnancy. [...] Some postmature babies will show no or little sign of postmaturity.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the Schneider {{company had}} been given the order to develop heavy {{artillery}} tractors in January 1915. On 30 January it sent out its chief designer, Brillié, to investigate tracked tractors from the American Holt Company, at that time participating in a test programme at Aldershot in England. On his return, Brillié, who had earlier been involved in designing armoured cars for Spain, apparently without mentioning being influenced in this by Quellennec, convinced the company management to initiate studies on the development of an armoured fighting vehicle, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> Holt chassis, two of which were ordered. The type was intended to be sold to the French Cavalry.|$|E
25|$|A Cochrane review {{suggests}} that active management (use of uterotonic drugs, cord clamping and controlled cord traction) {{during the third}} stage of labour reduces severe bleeding and anemia. However, the review also found that active management increased the mother's blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and pain. In the active management group more women returned to hospital with bleeding after discharge, {{and there was also}} a reduction in birthweight due to infants having a lower blood volume. The effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> of early cord clamping was discussed in another review which found that delayed cord clamping improved iron stores longer term in the infants. Although {{they were more likely to}} need phototherapy (light therapy) to treat jaundice, the improved iron stores are expected to be worth increasing the practice of delayed cord clamping in healthy term babies. For preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks) a review of the research found that delaying cord clamping by 30–45 seconds increased the amount of blood flow to the baby. This is important as increased blood volume in the baby made them less likely to develop some serious complications. Much of the research around this subject is poor quality so further, larger research projects are likely to produce more reliable results.|$|E

[...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV included the performance on her list of Spears' Top 10 Best TV Performances.

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{decides to}} throw a garden party at Schrute Farms to impress his parents and Robert California (James Spader), and exhaustively {{explains}} party manners to the office workers. Andy is jealous {{at the amount of}} attention his younger brother Walter Bernard, Jr. (Josh Groban) receives from his father, and thinks that by throwing an elaborate party he can ensure his father's blessings. At first, the party goes along smoothly. Andy makes a toast to Robert in order to get his fellow employees to toast him, as if to show to his parents and California that he is valued by his employees. His plan backfires, however, and instead more people toast Robert. To get everybody's mind off of Robert, Andy decides to sing [...] "More Than Words" [...] as a duet with his father. This too goes awry as his father corrects his playing and singing, and ultimately decides to sing a duet with Walter Jr. instead of Andy. Upset, Andy takes his guitar and storms off. His father confronts him privately about his outburst, and when Andy admits to trying to win his father's affection, he reacts with annoyance. This conversation is overheard by the other staff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> monitor Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) brought for their daughter, and Pam quickly turns off the monitor to let Andy save face. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) confide to the camera that they now understand why Andy feels he needs to prove himself to everyone. After his family leaves, a dejected Andy, feeling unwanted by his family and co-workers, says goodbye to the office staff as they turn the garden party into a barbecue. Darryl and Oscar, however, convince Andy to stay with a cheeseburger and a beer.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy {{does not}} tell Darren that she is helping Mitzeee, which Fox told a {{reporter}} from What's on TV is because [...] "Darren is so focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> that if she told him he'd be really angry. Nancy feels he doesn't understand the relationship she has with Mitzeee and he hasn't been terribly supportive". When questioned if Nancy feels her involvement with Mitzeee may place strain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> Fox answered: [...] "At the moment she feels incredibly tired, but she's sure that everything's fine and all she {{needs to do is}} focus on her friend". Darren discovers Nancy is helping Mitzeee, making him [...] "absolutely furious" [...] as he can not believe Nancy is [...] "going against the law, is running around and getting stressed - especially while she's heavily pregnant". When urged to put their child first by Darren, Nancy dismisses him as she believes he is [...] "just being silly". Fox said that [...] "Nancy thinks she knows best, as Nancy always does", adding that Nancy is [...] "a bit like a dog with a bone.

2500|$|Experiments on the Holt {{caterpillar}} tracks started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a 75hp wheel-directed {{model and the}} 45hp integral caterpillar Baby Holt, showing {{the superiority of the}} latter. [...] The Castéran and the Killen-Strait Tractor were also tested but rejected. Work was now begun on an auto-mitrailleuse blindée à chenilles ("tracked armoured self-propelled machine gun"). On 16 June, new experiments followed in front of the President of the Republic Raymond Poincaré, leading to the order of six, later expanded to ten, armoured tracked vehicles for further testing. The type was since July called a machine offensive à chenilles ("tracked offensive machine") and was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baby</b> Holt with a suspension that was to be thirty centimetres lengthened. [...] In August drawings were made of what was now designated the tracteur blindé et armé ("armoured and armed tractor"). In September 1915 the Schneider programme was combined with an official one for the development of an armoured barbed wire cutter by engineer and Member of Parliament Jules-Louis Breton, the Breton-Prétot machine. [...] Ten of the fifteen available Baby Holt vehicles were to be armoured and fitted with the wire cutter of which ten systems had been ordered on 7 August. [...] This involved the Service Automobile in the project. [...] On 10 September, new experiments were made for Commandant L.
