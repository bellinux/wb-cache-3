It includes a mix of methods (m-marketing, social networks, viral marketing etc.) to create awareness for the company’s brand, products and services. This paper, in particular addresses the <b>on-line</b> viral <b>marketing</b> method. In particular it provides a theoretical framework involving elements and actors important for the planning of an <b>on-line</b> viral <b>marketing</b> campaign. The framework presents four different phases of the analysis. The first phase involves {{the analysis of the}} company, its business context and the knowledge of the type of <b>on-line</b> viral <b>marketing</b> campaigns already done (both internal and external).

40|$|Persistently high profits on “insurance” {{for small}} value losses sold as an add-on to other {{products}} or services (such as extended warranties sold with consumer electronics, loss damage waivers sold with a car rental, and credit life insurance sold with a loan) pose a twofold challenge to the standard economic analysis of insurance. First, expected utility theory teaches that people should not buy insurance for small value losses. Second, the market should not {{in the long run}} permit sellers to charge prices that greatly exceed the cost of providing the insurance. Combining the insights of the Gabaix and Laibson shrouded pricing model with the behavioral economics of insurance, this article explains why high profits for add-on insurance persist and describes the negative distributional and welfare consequences of an unregulated market for such insurance. The article explores four potential regulatory responses: enhanced disclosure, a ban on the point of sale offer of add-on insurance, price regulation, {{and the creation of a}} new, <b>on-line</b> <b>market.</b> Drawing on theoretical, empirical, and comparative law sources, the article explains why enhanced disclosure will not work, the circumstances under which a point of sale ban is desirable, and why a new, <b>on-line</b> <b>market</b> is preferable to price regulation in circumstances in which a point of sale ban is undesirable...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} in Internet-enabled markets for professional services. We investigate {{the characteristics of}} these markets by examining bidding behavior in the most active area of these early knowledge markets: the market for IT contractors. These markets are important both because they provide an early view {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>on-line</b> service <b>markets</b> and because they have a potentially large impact on how IT services are procured and provided. Using auction theory, we develop a theoretical model that relates market characteristics to bidding and transaction behavior. The model is tested using data from one active <b>on-line</b> <b>market</b> for IT services. Our analysis suggests indicate that these markets are liquid with active bidding on projects and a high rate of contracting. In their current format, however, they may induce excessive bidding by service providers, raising the cost of transacting to all participants. Excessive bidding lowers the average quality of the bidding pool. Difficulties associated with excessive participation by service providers are more acute for high value projects, leading to fewer projects being contracted. Market design prescriptions, to resolve these problems, include limiting vendor participation and pre-screening service providers...|$|R

The present research addresses their trust-rebuilding function-specifically, {{the role of the}} short text comments given in reaction to negative feedback. Rebuilding trust is often necessary because <b>on-line</b> <b>markets</b> are noisy environments. The results of two experimental studies of eBay users show that trustworthiness judgments are influenced by the text comments accompanying negative feedback and also by whether a trust violation is perceived as competence-based or morality-based. Plain apologies were more successful than denials in repairing trust. These effects were mediated by the perceived believability of the comments. Thus, to avoid the detrimental effect of noise on trust, operators of on-line marketplaces should encourage text feedback comments and reactions. © 2009 M. E. Sharpe, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{expansion}} of Low Cost Carriers (LCCs) {{and the increasing}} use of Internet are provoking a deep transformation in the marketing of the typical Mediterranean summer tourism product in Europe. Internet may significantly reduce intermediary costs by enabling the connection between accommodation and transport business and consumers. At the same time, a more flexible product can be created in contrast to the conventional rigid tourist package offered by traditional tour operators. This paper investigates differences in price level and price dispersion across off-line and <b>on-line</b> <b>markets</b> and across tour operators and new emerging Internet retailers -including LCCs- using microdata on travel & accommodation individual expenses of tourists in the Balearic Islands, one of the most representative mature Mediterranean resorts.

Additionally, results reveal how <b>on-line</b> and off-line <b>markets</b> differ in the indirect value attributed to different characteristics of the product showing market segmentation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: New {{kinds of}} markets demand {{new kinds of}} market design. In {{the past twenty years}} several new kinds of market have been devised and put into operation, {{sometimes}} after several false starts. Designing markets is a new activity for economists, who haven’t readily thought of themselves as engineers. Emergence of the market engineer has been hastened by the interest of computer scientists in designing <b>on-line</b> <b>markets,</b> {{and there has been a}} three-way marriage of game theory, experimental results, and computer science in the use of computer simulation models to analyse, and to design, new markets. This paper argues for several things. For simulation as an alternative to closed-form analysis in market analysis and design. For agent-based computational economic models as specific simulation models. For explicit validation of such models, using several heuristics.
