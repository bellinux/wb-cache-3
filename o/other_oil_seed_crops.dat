Three J. curcas oleosins were isolated and characterized at the gene, transcript and protein level.

Isolation of its promoter revealed seed-specific cis-regulatory motifs among others. Spatio-temporal transcript expression of J. curcas oleosins was largely similar to that in <b>other</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> plants. Immunoassay with antibodies against an Arabidopsis oleosin or against JcOle 3, on seed proteins extracted by different approaches, revealed JcOle 3 oligomers.
