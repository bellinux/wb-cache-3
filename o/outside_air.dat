5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the <b>outside</b> <b>air,</b> condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the <b>outside</b> <b>air.</b> If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E

25|$|To provide heat more efficiently, an {{electrically}} driven {{heat pump}} {{can raise the}} indoor temperature by extracting energy from the ground, the <b>outside</b> <b>air,</b> or waste streams such as exhaust air. This can cut the electricity consumption to as little as 35% of that used by resistive heating.|$|E

The effect on the stained glass is not yet understood.|$|E

25|$|By definition, all heat {{sources for}} a heat pump must be colder in {{temperature}} than {{the space to}} be heated. Most commonly, heat pumps draw heat from the <b>air</b> (<b>outside</b> or inside <b>air)</b> or from the ground (groundwater or soil).|$|R
25|$|Larger server {{centers are}} {{sometimes}} located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available. Local availability of renewable energy, climate that allows <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> {{to be used}} for cooling, or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions.|$|E
25|$|When coal, oil, natural gas, wood, or {{any other}} fuel is combusted in a stove, oven, fireplace, hot water boiler, or {{industrial}} furnace, the hot combustion product gases that are formed are called flue gases. Those gases are generally exhausted to the ambient <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> through chimneys or industrial flue gas stacks (sometimes referred to as smokestacks).|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, a {{heat pump}} uses an {{electric}} motor to drive a refrigeration cycle, that draws heat energy from a source such as the ground or <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> and directs that heat into the space to be warmed. Some systems can be reversed so that the interior space is cooled and the warm air is discharged outside or into the ground.|$|E

50|$|When the <b>outside</b> <b>air's</b> dry- and wet-bulb {{temperatures}} are low enough, a water-side economizer can use water cooled by a {{wet cooling tower}} or a dry cooler (also called a fluid cooler) to cool buildings without operating a chiller. They are historically known as the strainer cycle, but the water-side economizer is not a true thermodynamic cycle. Also, instead of passing the cooling tower water through a strainer {{and then to the}} cooling coils, which causes fouling, more often a plate-and-frame heat exchanger is inserted between the cooling tower and chilled water loops.|$|R

25|$|When {{used for}} cabin pressurization, the bleed {{air from the}} engine must first be cooled (as it exits the {{compressor}} stage at temperatures as high as 250°C) by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by cold <b>outside</b> <b>air.</b> It is then fed to an air cycle machine unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} pressure inside the casing is maintained {{slightly higher than}} atmospheric pressure to avoid <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> ingress. The hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing. Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. Seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Artificial fog is {{man-made}} fog that {{is usually}} created by vaporizing a water- and glycol-based or glycerine-based fluid. The fluid is injected into a heated metal block, and evaporates quickly. The resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent. Upon coming into contact with cool <b>outside</b> <b>air,</b> the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog. Such fog machines are primarily used for entertainment applications.|$|E

25|$|The shaft was {{elevated}} as {{it moved}} toward the Confederate lines to make sure moisture did not clog up the mine, and fresh air was drawn in via an ingenious air-exchange mechanism near the entrance. A canvas partition isolated the miners' air supply from <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> (also allowing miners to easily enter and exit the work area). The miners had constructed a vertical exhaust shaft located well behind Union lines. At the vertical shaft's base, a fire was kept continuously burning. A wooden duct ran {{the entire length of}} the tunnel and protruded into the <b>outside</b> <b>air.</b> The fire heated stale air inside of the tunnel, drawing it up the exhaust shaft and out of the mine via the chimney effect. The resulting vacuum then sucked fresh air in from the mine entrance via the wooden duct, which carried it down the length of the tunnel to the location where the miners were working. This precluded the need for additional ventilation shafts that could have been observed by the enemy, and served well in disguising the diggers' progress.|$|E
25|$|In heating mode, {{the outdoor}} coil is an evaporator, while the indoor is a condenser. The {{refrigerant}} {{flowing from the}} evaporator (outdoor coil) carries the thermal energy from <b>outside</b> <b>air</b> (or soil) indoors. Vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it. The indoor coil then transfers thermal energy (including energy from the compression) to the indoor air, which is then moved around {{the inside of the}} building by an air handler.|$|E
25|$|As {{with any}} {{surgical}} procedure, {{there are risks}} of bleeding and infection. The newly transplanted lung itself may fail to properly heal and function. Because {{a large portion of}} the patient's body has been exposed to the <b>outside</b> <b>air,</b> sepsis is a possibility, so antibiotics will be given to try to prevent that. Other complications include Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, a form of lymphoma due to the immune suppressants, and gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration of the stomach and esophagus.|$|E

25|$|At {{the peak}} cooling times, the HVAC (climate control) system {{requires}} cooling {{equivalent to that}} provided by 2,000 t of melting ice in one day. The building has a condensate collection system, which uses the hot and humid <b>outside</b> <b>air,</b> combined with the cooling requirements {{of the building and}} results in a significant amount of condensation of moisture from the air. The condensed water is collected and drained into a holding tank located in the basement car park.|$|E

During the same time period, antimicrobial copper was able to limit bacterial loads associated with the copper heat exchanger fins by 99.99% and fungal loads by 99.74%.|$|E
25|$|If these homeostats are compromised, then a {{respiratory}} acidosis, or a {{respiratory alkalosis}} will occur. In {{the long run}} these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO3− concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the hyperventilation syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the blowing off of too much CO2 from the blood into the <b>outside</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
