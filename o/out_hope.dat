5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton {{as he wanted}} a move to a Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Joan of Arc {{puts the}} player {{in command of}} the battered, bloodied and demoralised French during the Hundred Years War against England. At the {{beginning}} of the campaign, nearly every major and decisive battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—Joan of Arc intends to save France by the command of God. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the Siege of Orleans earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns the confidence of the uncrowned Dauphin Charles VII by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against Joan of Arc. At several turning points in the Hundred Years' War, namely the Loire Campaign where the entire English and Burgundian forces were cleared <b>out,</b> <b>hope</b> for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under Joan of Arc.|$|E
5|$|After {{the other}} {{candidates}} had been nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third, and no candidate had the required majority of 379. Sherman's delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, {{but he refused to}} release them through twenty-eight ballots {{in the hope that the}} anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. By the end of the first day, it was clear that neither Grant nor Blaine could muster a majority; a compromise candidate would be necessary. Sherman held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> that he would be that compromise candidate, but while his vote tally reached as high as 120, he never commanded even all of Ohio's delegates. His divided home-state support was likely fatal to his cause, as Blaine delegates, searching for a new champion, did not think Sherman would make a popular candidate. After several days of balloting, Blaine's men found their compromise candidate, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to his fellow Ohioan, Garfield. By the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E

25|$|Less {{than a week}} later, Carpenter {{announced}} he would not travel to the club's Spring training site in Jupiter, Florida and instead remain in St. Louis, fearing {{he could be a}} distraction. At a press conference that same day, he said he still holds <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> of pitching in 2013, and refused to talk about retirement. On February 22, the team placed Carpenter on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E
25|$|Civil service reformers held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> for {{the second}} Cleveland {{administration}} but saw Vice President Stevenson {{as a symbol of}} the spoils system. He never hesitated to feed names of Democrats to the Post Office Department. Once he called at the US Treasury Department to protest against an appointment and was shown a letter he had written endorsing the candidate. Stevenson told the treasury officials not to pay attention to any of his written endorsements; if he really favored someone he would tell them personally.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{ballpark}} was {{a subject of}} sometimes intense discussion in the , it fell victim to a political climate {{which resulted in a}} lengthy shutdown of Minnesota government due to a budget impasse. No action was taken in either the regular session or the special session which resolved the budget dispute.

25|$|Hungarian {{public opinion}} split over the country's {{relations}} with Austria. Some Hungarians held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> for full separation from Austria; others wanted an accommodation with the Habsburgs, provided that they respected Hungary's constitution and laws. Ferenc Deák became the main advocate for accommodation. Deak upheld {{the legality of}} the April laws and argued that their amendment required the Hungarian Diet's consent. He also held that the dethronement of the Habsburgs was invalid. As long as Austria ruled absolutely, Deak argued, Hungarians should do no more than passively resist illegal demands.|$|E
25|$|Only 58 {{when he left}} office, Hoover held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> {{for another}} term during the 1930s. At the 1936 Republican National Convention, Hoover's speech attacking the New Deal was well received, but the {{nomination}} went to Kansas Governor Alf Landon. In the general election, Hoover campaigned for Landon's unsuccessful campaign with numerous well-publicized speeches attacking New Deal liberalism. Though Hoover was eager to oppose Roosevelt at every turn, and Senator Arthur Vandenberg and other Republicans urged the still-unpopular Hoover to remain out of the fray during the debate over Roosevelt's proposed Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937. At the 1940 Republican National Convention, Hoover again hoped for the presidential nomination, and was dismayed when {{it went to the}} internationalist Wendell Willkie.|$|E
25|$|While the Lyttelton {{road tunnel}} {{was still under}} construction, the Board sought and was granted a license to operate a {{passenger}} service to Lyttelton via Ferry Road, which commenced {{as soon as the}} tunnel opened in 1964. This route competed for passengers with the Railways Department's Christchurch–Lyttelton suburban passenger trains. Though the Department had held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> that both the Board's and the Department's services could coexist following the opening of the road tunnel, and even opened a new railway station at Lyttelton in 1963, the losses mounted due to competition from buses and private motorcars forcing the Department to terminate the passenger rail service in 1972. The Board then had its license for the Lyttelton route altered so it could run its buses roughly paralleling the railway line to collect passengers who had been using the rail service.|$|E

500|$|Some colonists {{still held}} <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> for reconciliation, but {{developments}} in early 1776 further strengthened {{public support for}} independence. In February 1776, colonists learned of Parliament's passage of the Prohibitory Act, which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels. John Adams, {{a strong supporter of}} independence, believed that Parliament had effectively declared American independence before Congress had been able to. Adams labeled the Prohibitory Act the [...] "Act of Independency", calling it [...] "a compleat Dismemberment of the British Empire". Support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that King George had hired German mercenaries to use against his American subjects.|$|E

500|$|In 1909, the British Parliament {{authorized}} {{an additional}} four capital ships, holding <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> Germany {{would be willing}} to negotiate a treaty about battleship numbers. If no such solution could be found, an additional four ships would be laid down in 1910. Even this compromise solution meant (when taken together with some social reforms) raising taxes enough to prompt a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom in 1909–10. In 1910, the British eight-ship construction plan went ahead, including four [...] super-dreadnoughts, and augmented by battlecruisers purchased by Australia and New Zealand. In the same period, Germany laid down only three ships, giving the United Kingdom a superiority of 22 ships to 13. The British resolve demonstrated by their construction programme led the Germans to seek a negotiated end to the arms race. The Admiralty's new target of a 60% lead over Germany was near enough to Tirpitz's goal of cutting the British lead to 50%, but talks foundered on the question on whether British Commonwealth battlecruisers {{should be included in the}} count, as well as non-naval matters like the German demands for recognition of ownership of Alsace-Lorraine.|$|E

500|$|Austen {{published}} {{all of her}} {{novels in}} the Regency period, during which King George III was declared permanently insane and his son was appointed as Prince Regent, and the novels are firmly rooted in {{the social context of}} the time. Throughout most of Austen's adult life, Britain was at war with revolutionary France. Fearing the spread of revolution and violence to Britain, the government tried to repress political radicals by suspending habeas corpus and passing the Seditious Meetings Act and the Treasonable Practices Act, known as the [...] "Gagging Acts". Many reformers still held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> for change in Britain during the 1790s, but by the first two decades of the 19th century, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars had exhausted the country and a deep conservative reaction had set in. While Austen's novels rarely explicitly touch on these events, she herself was personally affected by them, as two of her brothers served in the Royal Navy. When Napoleon was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Britain rejoiced. However, economic hardships in the 1810s increased the income disparity in the country and class conflict rose as the Industrial Revolution began.|$|E
500|$|Some {{fans and}} columnists have accused Reinsdorf of {{breaking}} up the championship Bulls team after their third straight title and sixth in eight years, claiming the Bulls could have competed for more titles with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and good support {{from the rest of}} the team that in the eight-year span included Dennis Rodman, Horace Grant, Toni Kukoč, Ron Harper, BJ Armstrong, and coach Phil Jackson. [...] Some accounts claim that because Jackson feuded with both Reinsdorf and Krause and because both Jordan and Pippen were linked to Jackson, the team was broken up. [...] Forbes describes the scenario as an example of owner greed. [...] Many note that Phil Jackson's decision not to return as coach and Jordan's retirement during the 1998–99 NBA season lockout impacted the decisions of several players on whether to return to Chicago. [...] Krause and Reinsdorf had held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> that they could convince Jackson and Jordan to return and thus had introduced Tim Floyd as President of Chicago Bulls Basketball Operations instead of head coach. [...] Reinsdorf had made it clear to Jackson that he was wanted back.|$|E
500|$|Although local {{business}} owners and land owners held <b>out</b> <b>hope</b> that the turnpike company would pay off, the turnpike experienced problems. Richard Holmes and Henry Swain, {{the director of}} the turnpike company, were running into problems including failure to buy land from Elijah Hand's pasture and Samuel Hoffman's local residence for the turnpike route, because they kept land prices high. The farmers refused to the sell their rightful land, and locals started showing opposition due to the fact it would cost money to deliver important foods. One of those locals, John Tomlin from Goshen, soon after brought up the idea of the [...] "Shunpike" [...] – a free turnpike road {{to the west of the}} Cape May Turnpike. However, the turnpike company kept pushing forward, persuading Hand and Hoffman to sell land in 1857 and erecting two tollhouses in the route, one at the Court House (now Cape May Court House) and one near Cold Spring. Eventually, locals finally began to move towards support of the turnpike. In April 1858, John Wiley, who helped persuade Hand and Hoffman to sell, announced that in three weeks, the route would be complete as one continuous road from Cape Island to Cape May Court House.|$|E
60|$|But when America severed {{diplomatic}} relations with Germany, the situation for China was changed. America was not bound to subservience to Japan, as we were; America {{was not one of}} the Allies; and America had always been China's best friend. Accordingly, the Chinese were willing to take the advice of America, and proceeded to sever {{diplomatic relations}} with Germany in March 1917. Dr. Reinsch was careful to make no promises to the Chinese, but of course he held <b>out</b> <b>hopes.</b> The American Government, at that time, could honestly hold <b>out</b> <b>hopes,</b> because it was ignorant of the secret treaties and agreements by which the Allies were bound. The Allies, however, can offer no such excuse for having urged China to take the further step of declaring war. Russia, France, and Great Britain had all sold China's rights to secure the continued support of Japan.|$|R
