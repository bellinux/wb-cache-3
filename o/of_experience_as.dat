5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E
5|$|Motherhood, a theme {{throughout}} Angelou's autobiographies, {{becomes more}} complex in The Heart of a Woman. Although Guy {{struggles with the}} developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close. Many years <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a mother, and her success as a writer, actress, and activist, enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity, professionally and as a mother. Her self-assurance becomes {{a major part of}} her personality. Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him {{at the end of her}} previous autobiography that they would never be separated again. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.|$|E
5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q.

Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying the three leading actors.|$|E
30|$|<b>Experience</b> is seen <b>as</b> an {{ambiguous}} phenomenon between making-an-experience (process) and having-an-experience (product) (Brinkmann 2011; Waldenfels 2002). Phenomenological reflection aims at exploring the productivity <b>of</b> making-an-experience, capturing <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a process. Theories of embodiment (Merleau-Ponty 1965) and of intentionality (Hua XI, p. 165) {{lead to an}} understanding <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>as</b> pathic events, i.e. an event in which we undergo something coming from {{the world around us}} (Waldenfels calls this pathos, 2011 p. 27; 2007). In pedagogical perspective, Dewey has marked the pathic or disturbing character <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>as</b> the point, where learning and inquiry begin (Dewey 2008).

5|$|Development of Invisible War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and designer, he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a designer was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{emerged in}} early 1997 that Keating was {{planning}} {{a run for}} district attorney (DA) of Norfolk County. He faced two former Norfolk assistant DAs, John J. Corrigan and William P. O'Donnell, in the Democratic primary. Keating, whose name recognition was boosted by the attempted Bulger coup, presented his work on public safety, criminal justice, and judiciary committees as a strength, while the other candidates pointed to his lack of courtroom experience as a disqualifier. While Keating held a part-time law practice during his legislative career, he lacked exposure to the criminal cases handled by the DA's office. After winning the Democratic nomination, Keating faced incumbent DA Jeffrey A. Locke in the November 1998 general election. Locke, a Republican, had been appointed to the position by Governor Weld the previous year after the resignation of Bill Delahunt. With years <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a prosecutor, Locke portrayed Keating as a career politician and echoed his primary opponents' criticism of his experience. Keating highlighted a range of endorsements from police organizations, and from Delahunt, as evidence of his criminal justice qualifications. Aided by a Democratic-leaning electorate, Keating won the election with around 55 percent of the vote.|$|E
40|$|For {{several decades}} the {{official}} teaching {{office of the}} Roman Catholic Church has consistently invoked the notion <b>of</b> religious <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a category for interrelgious dialogue. Moreover, the Church has app- ealed to the so-called dialogue <b>of</b> religious <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a means <b>of</b> encouraging its members to constructively engage with persons {{who are committed to}} ‘other’ religious traditions.

40|$|Tapping {{into the}} {{consumers}} 2 ̆ 7 mind is essential when designing {{tourism and leisure}} experiences and creating effective marketing tools to promote them. However, capturing perceptions and/or memories <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> is far from easy. Much of consumers 2 ̆ 7 thinking occurs in their unconscious and only surfaces through metaphors and stories; yet, most research practices wrongly assume that consumers {{have easy access to}} memories or attitudes and can readily explain their thinking and behaviors (Zaltman, 2003). The challenge of capturing perceptions and memories <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> is especially apparent for sensory aspects <b>of</b> <b>experiences,</b> <b>as</b> a lot <b>of</b> sensory information is unconsciously processed. Sensory descriptions or depictions <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> are critical in the context of experiential marketing but are difficult to formulate if the sensory essence <b>of</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>as</b> perceived by the consumers is unknown and cannot be easily captured through traditional research approaches...|$|R
5|$|The {{adaptation}} of the scenario is credited to Lloyd F. Lonergan and Gertrude Thanhouser. While {{the director of the}} film is not known, two directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production nor does Bowers credit a cameraman.
