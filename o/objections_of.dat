Instead {{of going to the}} Cuban Government, it was agreed that proceeds would fund baseball programs in Cuba.|$|E

The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement changes over the <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E
5|$|In April, {{losses at}} Stalingrad and in Tunisia allowed Berger to recruit from foreign {{workers in the}} Reich, over the <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> Reichsminister Albert Speer, the Minister for Armaments and War Production. By August, he had {{recruited}} 8,105 of these labourers, and 3,154 had already completed selection for the Waffen-SS. In June, Berger was promoted to SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS, and later the same month the new division, 12th SS Panzergrenadier Division Hitlerjugend was officially activated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{prior to the}} {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the Fairbanks economy was unsteady. The News-Miner planned to expand its printing plant, but many in the company were unsure if the economy could support the added capacity. Over the <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> the News-Miner newsroom, Snedden decided to expand the Aurora Building by adding a second floor at a cost of $2 million. In 1974, as construction of the pipeline got under way, demand for office space in Fairbanks was so great that Alyeska Pipeline Company rented several News-Miner offices in the newly expanded building. About this time, the News-Miner replaced its Associated Press teletypes with a satellite connection.|$|E

Now for the first time, the king had Greeks in his Council and the French Party, the English Party and the Russian Party (according to which of the Great Powers' culture they most esteemed) vied for rank and power.|$|E
5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of Euler's {{religious}} beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work, Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister (Defense of the Divine Revelation against the <b>Objections</b> <b>of</b> the Freethinkers). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May, with Chinese forces {{slackening}} their offensive, 3rd Ranger Company was recalled to Kimpo Airfield for parachute proficiency training, {{above the}} <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> the 3rd Infantry Division commanders who considered the company invaluable.

In one of these rearguard actions, the Rangers evacuated a rundown village only to have {{one member of the}} unit, Corporal Dave Rauls, captured by three Chinese infiltrators.|$|E

Kasa-Vubu was proclaimed President, and Lumumba Prime Minister, of the Republic of the Congo. Despite the <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> CONAKAT and others, the constitution was largely centralist, concentrating power in the central government in Léopoldville, and did not devolve significant powers to provincial level.|$|E
5|$|The Jews of the Papal States, {{numbering}} 15,000 {{or so in}} 1858, were {{grateful to}} Pope Pius IX because he had ended the long-standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year, based on that week's Torah portion and aimed at their conversion to Christianity. He had also torn down {{the gates of the}} Roman Ghetto despite the <b>objections</b> <b>of</b> many Christians. However, Jews remained under many restrictions and the vast majority still lived in the ghetto.|$|E
