5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route through the town <b>of</b> <b>Cairo.</b> It comes close to the hamlet <b>of</b> <b>Cairo,</b> but {{bypasses}} it on a four-lane divided highway that takes it around the northern fringe of the community. As it runs around Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 bypasses this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} keep updated on their daily {{business}} activities Halliday and his brothers installed private telegraph lines between their residences and their business offices. In the early 1870s Halliday held the public office of city councilman for the city <b>of</b> <b>Cairo</b> Illinois, for the city at large ward with Daniel Hurd.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} into Greene County, {{the road}} intersects NY23A at an undeveloped junction. NY32 remains in its straight course through the lowlands below the escarpment, passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of Kiskatom, then winding around {{the north side}} <b>of</b> <b>Cairo</b> Roundtop before it joins with NY23 at Cairo. After , NY32 leaves the divided highway to once again strike north as a two-lane route. It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the north-northeast just south of Freehold.|$|E
5|$|Another song {{sequence}} ("Suraj Hua Maddham") involving Khan and Kajol {{was shot}} with {{the backdrop of}} the Pyramids of Giza in the city <b>of</b> <b>Cairo</b> in Egypt. Due to the lighting conditions, the crew could shoot only between 7 and 9am in the morning. As a result, the song took several days to film. In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced a bad fall.|$|E

5|$|Cairo protesters had {{gathered}} {{in the morning in}} front of the High Court in the centre <b>of</b> <b>Cairo.</b> The demonstration was larger than expected. It broke through the security cordon and moved to Tahrir Square. Thousands protested in Cairo, with 15,000 occupying Tahrir Square (Liberation Square). Police used tear gas and water cannons against the protesters, who in turn threw stones at police, eventually forcing them to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Director Colin Campbell was {{concerned}} with the film's realism. He had sets constructed to represent the streets <b>of</b> <b>Cairo,</b> Baghdad, and Damascus, and used animals from the Selig Zoo. Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' clothing was genuine, and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was hand tinted. Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms.|$|E

5|$|Grant's Union Army of the Tennessee of the District <b>of</b> <b>Cairo</b> {{consisted}} of three divisions, commanded by Brig. Gens. McClernand, C.F. Smith, and Lew Wallace. (At {{the start of the}} attack on Fort Donelson, Wallace was a brigade commander in reserve at Fort Henry, but was summoned on February 14 and charged with assembling a new division that included reinforcements arriving by steamship, including Charles Cruft's brigade on loan from Buell.) Two regiments of cavalry and eight batteries of artillery supported the infantry divisions. Altogether, the Union forces numbered nearly 25,000 men, although {{at the start of the}} battle, only 15,000 were available.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Tulun {{stands out}} as the first {{governor}} of a major province of the Abbasid Caliphate to not only establish himself as its master independently of the Abbasid court, but to also pass power on to his son. He was thus also the first ruler since the Ptolemaic Pharaohs to make Egypt an independent political power again, with a sphere of influence encompassing Syria {{and parts of the}} Maghreb, setting the tone for later Egypt-based Islamic regimes, from the Ikhshidids to the Mamluk Sultanate <b>of</b> <b>Cairo.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Nasser married Tahia Kazem, the 22-year-old {{daughter}} of a wealthy Iranian father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom {{died when she was}} young. She was introduced to Nasser through her brother, Abdel Hamid Kazim, a merchant friend of Nasser's, in 1943. After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb <b>of</b> <b>Cairo,</b> where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives. Nasser's entry into the officer corps in 1937 secured him relatively well-paid employment in a society where most people lived in poverty.|$|E

5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure <b>of</b> <b>Cairo</b> and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also inherited from the Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon, who {{had been}} well {{respected}} in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people <b>of</b> <b>Cairo,</b> lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered {{the closing of the}} mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, Grant's command was reconfigured {{to include}} C.F. Smith's and renamed the District <b>of</b> <b>Cairo.</b> From that perch, in February 1862, Grant led the Union {{campaign}} against Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, and Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River. His troops for this campaign eventually numbered approximately 27,000 men, {{divided into three}} divisions commanded, respectively, by John McClernand (1st Division), C.F. Smith (2nd), and Brig. Gen. Lewis Wallace (3rd).|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} aims of D-CAF is the revival and {{reclamation}} <b>of</b> Downtown <b>Cairo</b> as a vibrant cultural center, capitalizing on its unique architectural and social heritage.

5|$|Relations between an-Nasir Yusuf and the Bahri Mamluks grew tense {{after the}} former refused to invade Egypt. In October 1257, Baibars {{and his fellow}} Mamluks left Damascus or were {{expelled}} {{from the city and}} together they moved south to Jerusalem. When the governor Kutuk refused to aid them against an-Nasir Yusuf, Baibars deposed him and had al-Mugith Umar, the emir of Karak, pronounced in the khutba at the al-Aqsa Mosque; over the years, al-Mugith Umar had allowed the political dissidents <b>of</b> <b>Cairo</b> and Damascus, who sought protection from either the Mamluk and Ayyubid authorities, a safe haven within his territory.|$|E
5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque was {{commissioned}} by the Caliph Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah for the newly established capital city <b>of</b> <b>Cairo.</b> Its name {{is a tribute to}} the name of Fatima Al-Azhar, the daughter of the Prophet Mohammed. Jawhar al-Siqilli, commander of the Fatimid army started construction of the mosque in 970. It was the first mosque established in the city. The first prayers were held there in 972, and in 989 the mosque authorities hired 35 scholars, making it a teaching centre for Shia theology. A waqf for the mosque was established in 1009 by Caliph al-Hakim.|$|E
5|$|The Fatimid Caliphs {{competed with}} {{the rulers of}} the Abbasid and Byzantine empires, and indulged in luxurious palace building. Their palaces, their {{greatest}} architectural achievements, are known only by written descriptions, however. Several surviving tombs, mosques, gates and walls, mainly in Cairo, retain original elements, although they have been extensively modified or rebuilt in later periods. Notable extant examples of Fatimid architecture include the Great Mosque of Mahdiya, and the Al-Azhar Mosque, Al-Hakim Mosque, Juyushi and Lulua <b>of</b> <b>Cairo.</b>|$|E
