5|$|As England had {{a strong}} batting lineup, Bradman wanted a large range of {{specialist}} bowlers in the Tests, and this was made possible as his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both left arm orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing <b>one</b> <b>Test</b> due to chickenpox, and leg spinner Dooland replacing left-arm spinner Tribe in two Tests.|$|E
5|$|He {{ended the}} 2006–07 Ashes with {{a century and}} two fifties, totalling 229 runs at 45.80 at a strike rate of over 100 as Australia regained the Ashes with a 5–0 whitewash. It was an {{inconsistent}} series; aside from three scores mentioned, Gilchrist failed to pass one in his other three innings.

5|$|Mervyn Roye Harvey (29 April 1918 – 18 March 1995) was a cricketer {{who played}} in <b>one</b> <b>Test</b> match for Australia in 1947.

5|$|More {{efficient}} {{weapons would}} require less efficient initiators. This meant that less polonium would be required.

During Sandstone, at least <b>one</b> <b>test</b> would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.|$|E
5|$|One E {{aircraft}} (AF Serial No. 56-0632) {{was modified}} as a testbed for various B-52 systems. Redesignated NB-52E, the aircraft was fitted with canards and a Load Alleviation and Mode Stabilization system (LAMS) which reduced airframe fatigue from wind gusts during low level flight. In <b>one</b> <b>test,</b> the aircraft flew 10knots (11.5mph, 18.5km/h) {{faster than the}} never exceed speed without damage because the canards eliminated 30% of vertical and 50% of horizontal vibrations caused by wind gusts.|$|E

5|$|When Andrew Stoddart's English team visited Australia in 1894–95, Trumble {{played only}} <b>one</b> <b>Test,</b> the Second at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

England fought {{back in their}} second innings, scoring 475runs to win the Test by 94runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.|$|E
5|$|Willis then {{returned}} to England, to face India and Pakistan, playing in <b>one</b> <b>Test</b> against each. Against India he took 4/64 – a career best against that team – and made a Test best 24 with the bat. Pakistan toured in early August, and Willis featured in <b>one</b> <b>Test.</b> He took one wicket for 133 runs. He also played one ODI where he took one wicket caught and bowled as Pakistan achieved a seven wicket victory. At this point, Willis was suffering from a recurring back injury. He played 13 Championship games for Warwickshire during the 1974 season, taking 44 wickets at 21.56 including one five-wicket haul. In November, Willis touring Australia during the 1974/75 Ashes series, playing in five Test matches. He took 17 Test wickets at 30.70, including a best of 5/42, out of 26 first-class wickets at 31.19 overall. He was, however, playing with growing injury concerns which required several painkilling injections.|$|E

5|$|As the match-fixing scandal took centrestage, former player Manoj Prabhakar accused Kapil Dev {{of trying}} to bribe him in 1994 during a tournament in Sri Lanka. Under severe {{pressure}} from politicians and fans, Kapil Dev resigned as coach in September 2000, after having spent {{less than one year}} as the team coach. The reports of CBI (India's premier investigating agency) and K. Madhavan (appointed by BCCI to investigate match-fixing allegations) in November 2000 exonerated Kapil Dev of any involvement in match-fixing. India's performance in the coaching stint of Kapil Dev was below-par, winning just <b>one</b> <b>Test</b> match (out of 8 played) and 9 ODIs (out of 25 played).|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was dropped}} after two matches in 195657, ending his {{first-class}} career. After his playing career was over, Harvey took up umpiring, {{and made his}} first-class debut in 197475. He became a regular official {{over the next few}} seasons and then broke into international umpiring in 197879. In that summer, Harvey stood in two One Day Internationals (ODIs) and <b>one</b> <b>Test.</b> The following season he made his final appearances at international level, presiding over another Test and four ODIs. His last season of top-level domestic umpiring was in 198182 during which he officiated in two matches. He finished his career having presided over 31 first-class and 13 List A matches.|$|E
5|$|Hutton's {{controversial}} exile thus ended {{after just}} <b>one</b> <b>Test.</b> However, both E. W. Swanton and Bill Bowes believed Hutton to {{be a better}} batsman once he returned to the side. He and Washbrook put on 168 for the first wicket, the first time England had put on more than 42 for the opening stand during the series, as the hosts went on to make 496, their highest score for the series. The pair added another triple-figure partnership in the second innings. Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on the final day to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. <b>One</b> <b>test</b> of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|In June, India toured Bangladesh for <b>one</b> <b>Test</b> {{and three}} One Day Internationals. Rahman was picked in the ODI squad. In his first match of the series, Rahman gave signs of his {{potential}} against the strong Indian batting line-up {{by taking a}} five-wicket haul off 9.2 overs in the first match. Bangladesh won the match and Rahman became the tenth bowler {{in the history of}} ODIs to take five wickets on debut. In the second ODI, Rahman took another six wickets. This helped him to earn the record of most wickets of any bowler after two ODIs, surpassing the record previously held by Zimbabwe's Brian Vitori. He completed the last ODI with 2 wickets and made history by taking 13 wickets in a three-match ODI series.|$|E
5|$|Kartik then {{played in}} <b>one</b> <b>Test</b> against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe {{respectively}} in India, taking match totals of 1/42 and 2/66. He scored 43 in the nine-wicket win over Bangladesh {{but was not}} required to bat in the seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe. New captain Sourav Ganguly—who had taken over after Sachin Tendulkar resigned following the South African whitewash—did not show much confidence in him, by only affording him frequent but short spells. Kartik was dropped from the team after the First Test against Zimbabwe, {{and did not have}} an opportunity to immediately prove his captain wrong, as the one-day domestic circuit was in progress at the time. Kartik took nine wickets at 25.22 at an economy rate of 4.02, and then had a chance to stake his claims for a Test recall in the Duleep Trophy.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{played a}} vital role in the side's success in the Test series, {{particularly}} with the ball. Despite a back injury which meant he passed <b>one</b> <b>Test</b> without bowling, he took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 26.28, and also contributed 184 runs at an average of 23.15. He {{played a key role in}} subduing England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton, with a barrage of short-pitched bowling, troubling Hutton to such an extent that he was dropped for the Third Test. In all first-class matches on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.|$|E
5|$|The West Indies' {{inconsistent}} performances {{saw them}} dominate <b>one</b> <b>Test,</b> only to play poorly and lose the next. Bishop's and Walsh’s combined 26 wickets {{in the first}} and third Tests ensured the West Indies won these matches by commanding margins. Cork contributed greatly to England’s second and fourth Test victories, taking 7/43 in the second Test and a hat-trick in the fourth in claiming the wickets of Richardson (bowled), Junior Murray (LBW) and Carl Hooper (LBW). The remaining two Tests were dominated by the batsmen, with five centuries being scored. The series finished 2–2, with the West Indies retaining the trophy.|$|E
