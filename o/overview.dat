40|$|Background: <b>Overviews</b> of {{systematic}} reviews (SRs) {{are useful for}} public health policy; however there is an absence of Cochrane <b>Overviews</b> covering public health (PH) topics. Objectives: We sought to analyze the methodological approaches used in existing Cochrane <b>Overviews</b> and Protocols for <b>overviews</b> (primarily clinical in nature), and compare these to the methods and approaches used in PH <b>overviews</b> (non-Cochrane). The intent was to identify issues that would be relevant for undertaking Cochrane <b>overviews.</b> Methods: We conducted a descriptive analysis of <b>overviews</b> published between 1999 and 2014. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for Cochrane Protocols for <b>overviews</b> and Cochrane <b>Overviews,</b> and the HealthEvidence. org for PH <b>overviews.</b> The primary characteristics of the <b>overviews</b> and elements of the methodology were extracted and compared. Results: A total of 61 <b>overviews</b> of SRs were included in our analysis; specifically, this included 21 Cochrane Protocols for <b>overviews,</b> 15 Cochrane <b>Overviews,</b> and 27 non-Cochrane PH <b>overviews.</b> Amongst the <b>overviews,</b> the most significant differences are that PH <b>overviews</b> (non-Cochrane) tend to: include earlier and more reviews, greater number of participants, allow lower levels of evidence, use assessment tools other than AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews, i. e. a tool for assessing quality of SRs), not assess quality of evidence in reviews, search more databases overall, specify search limits including English-only reviews, and not consider recent primary studies for inclusion. Some of these differences clearly related to quality, however many relate to the nuances of PH interventions. Conclusions: The methodology in Cochrane <b>overviews</b> and PH <b>overviews</b> varies widely. Future PH <b>overviews</b> may benefit from the Cochrane methodology but the Cochrane approach requires modification to accommodate PH research methodology. Additionally, the use of databases that pre-screen and quality assess relevant PH systematic reviews may help expedite the search process...|$|R

40|$|To aid {{designers}} of digital library interfaces and web sites in creating comprehensible, predictable and controllable environments for their users, we define {{and discuss the}} benefits of previews and <b>overviews</b> as visual information representations. Previews and <b>overviews</b> are graphic or textual representations of information abstracted from primary information objects. They serve as surrogates for those objects. When utilized properly, previews and <b>overviews</b> allow users to rapidly discriminate objects of interest from those not of interest, and to more fully understand the scope and nature of large collections of information resources. We provide a more complete definition of previews and <b>overviews,</b> and discuss system parameters and aspects of primary information objects relevant to designing effective preview and <b>overviews.</b> Finally, we present examples that illustrate the use of previews and <b>overviews</b> and offer suggestions for designers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} use of categorized <b>overviews</b> of web search results, based on meaningful and stable categories, to support exploratory search. When searching in digital libraries and on the Web, users are challenged {{by the lack of}} effective <b>overviews.</b> Adding categorized <b>overviews</b> to search results can provide substantial benefits when searchers need to explore, understand, and assess their results. When information needs are evolving or imprecise, categorized <b>overviews</b> can stimulate relevant ideas, provoke illuminating questions, and guide searchers to useful information they might not otherwise find. When searchers need to gather information from multiple perspectives or sources, categorized <b>overviews</b> can make those aspects visible for interactive filtering and exploration. However, they add visual complexity to the interface and increase the number of tactical decisions to be made while examining search results. Two formative studies (N= 18 and N= 12) investigated how searchers use categorized <b>overviews</b> in the domain of U. S. government web search. A third study (N= 24) evaluated categorized <b>overviews</b> of general web search results based on thematic...|$|R

40|$|To aid {{designers}} of digital library interfaces, {{we present a}} framework {{for the design of}} information representations in terms of previews and <b>overviews.</b> Previews and <b>overviews</b> are graphic or textual representations of information abstracted from primary information objects. Previews act as surrogates for one or a few objects and <b>overviews</b> represent collections of objects. A design framework is elaborated in terms of the following three dimensions: (1) What information objects are available to users, (2) How information objects are related and displayed, and (3) How users can manipulate information objects. When utilized properly, previews and <b>overviews</b> allow users to rapidly discriminate objects of interest from those not of interest, and to more fully understand the scope and nature of digital libraries. This paper presents a definition of previews and <b>overviews</b> in context, provides design guidelines, and describes four example applications...|$|R
