By 2006, California produced the second-largest rice crop in the United States, after Arkansas, with production concentrated in six counties north of Sacramento. Unlike the Arkansas–Mississippi Delta region, California's production is dominated by short- and medium-grain japonica varieties, including cultivars developed for the local climate such as Calrose, which makes up as much as 85% of the state's crop.|$|E

25|$|The Thais never {{lacked a}} rich food supply. Peasants planted rice for their <b>own</b> <b>consumption</b> {{and to pay}} taxes. Whatever {{remained}} was used to support religious institutions. From the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, however, a remarkable transformation took place in Thai rice cultivation. In the highlands, where rainfall had to be supplemented by a system of irrigation that controlled the water level in flooded paddies, the Thais sowed the glutinous rice that is still the staple in the geographical regions of the North and Northeast. But in the floodplain of the Chao Phraya, farmers turned to a different variety of rice—-the so-called floating rice, a slender, non-glutinous grain introduced from Bengal—-that would grow fast enough {{to keep pace with}} the rise of the water level in the lowland fields.|$|E
25|$|After {{slavery was}} phased out by 1888, many former slaves {{had little choice}} but to stay on the farms on which they had been prisoners for years. The {{plantation}} owners adapted to the situation by incorporating wage labour, tenantry and contract farming. After gaining their freedom, some more fortunate ex-slaves were sold small plots of land where they could build a house and plant crops for their <b>own</b> <b>consumption</b> and for sale at market. According to the Spanish Civil Code, rights of possession were paramount, making a signed and verified agreement very important. In 1890, however, a new civil code (which had been introduced in Spain the year before) came into effect which acknowledged the rights of prescription (squatter’s rights). Granted, these rights were minimally recognized, but still they motivated many landless workers to occupy and cultivate previously unused land.|$|E
25|$|A {{familiar}} {{sight in}} several Asian countries is paddy laid {{out to dry}} along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has {{to be carried out}} quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple hullers, with a throughput of a couple of tonnes a day, that simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their <b>own</b> <b>consumption.</b>|$|E

25|$|Parliament granted NOK1.2 {{million to}} upgrade the mines, with the company having an {{operating}} deficit of NOK2.9 million that year. A further grant of NOK1.9 million was issued the following year. The population dropped to 72 while production was halted. In 1954 there was produced 5,000 tonnes of coal, mostly for the towns <b>own</b> <b>consumption.</b> By 1955 the estimates for continuing operation, mostly prominently the need for improved ventilation systems, reached an estimate of NOK20 million. A certain amount of production was resumed, reaching 15,000 tonnes in 1955. Parliament approved a new production plan on 20 March 1956, which set a production goal of 200,000 tonnes of coal annually. The company built a new power station, bath and a fire station, as well as additional housing. Ester I was re-opened and upgraded. Production gradually increased to 47,000 in 1958, before falling again, {{in part because of}} falling coal prices.|$|E

500|$|Hard {{apple cider}} {{was by far}} the most common {{alcoholic}} beverage available to colonists. This is because apple trees could be grown locally throughout the colonies, unlike grapes and grain which did not grow well at all in New England. Cider was also easier to produce than beer or wine, so it could be made by farmers for their <b>own</b> <b>consumption.</b> Since it was not imported, it was much more affordable to the average colonist than beer or wine. Apple trees were planted in both Virginia and the Massachusetts Bay Colony as early as 1629. Most of these trees were not grafted, and thus produced apples too bitter or sour for eating; they were planted expressly for making cider. Cider was sometimes also distilled or freeze-distilled into applejack (so called because freeze-distillation was called [...] "jacking"); the cold climate of the Northeast in the wintertime encouraged the process. The beverage was particularly popular in New Jersey, where applejack was occasionally called [...] "Jersey lightning" [...] and was sometimes used to pay road-construction crews.|$|E

2500|$|Aché foragers {{living in}} the forest share food extensively, and animal prey are divided up communally among band members. [...] Social norms proscribe men from eating {{anything}} from their own prey, and {{emphasize the importance of}} band-wide distributions. In essence, wild game is cooked and redistributed in equal portions to resident families, taking into account the size of each family that receives a portion. [...] This means that successful hunters and their families obtain no more meat from their own captured prey than would be expected by a random distribution to resident families. Palm starch produced in large batches is shared {{in a manner similar to}} meat (but with no overt taboo against women consuming some of the starch they have extracted). Honey is somewhat less widely shared, but large portions are saved for members absent at the time of extraction. [...] Collected fruits and insect larva are even less widely shared but are still redistributed to those not present at a collection site. A hunter's nuclear family usually consumes about 10% of the game brought in by the male head of the household. [...] For most other resources the nuclear family of the acquirer keeps less than 50% for their <b>own</b> <b>consumption,</b> but only 10-20% of small collected fruits are shared outside the family. More recent analyses show that high acquisition variance resources are shared more widely, that the amount of most foods shared is contingent on amount received across dyads of potential sharing partners, and that needy families consistently receive more than they give. Reservation food sharing patterns show that people who are more generous are more likely to receive help and support when they become sick or injured.|$|E
