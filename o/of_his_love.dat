The {{treatment of the}} character changes in two ways {{in the literature of}} the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes an important and active protagonist in the pursuit of the Trojan War itself. Second, he becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than the passive victim of Achilles' pederasty. By the time of John Dryden's neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida it is the ultimate failure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>love</b> affair that defines the character.|$|E
