50|$|The {{analogous}} connection {{used with}} MOS transistors is an <b>open-drain</b> connection. <b>Open-drain</b> outputs {{can be useful}} for analog weighting, summing, and limiting as well as digital logic. An open drain terminal is connected to ground when a high voltage (logic 1) {{is applied to the}} gate, yet presents a high impedance when a low voltage (logic 0) is applied to the gate. This high impedance state occurs because the terminal is at an undefined voltage (floating) thus such a device requires an external pull-up resistor connected to the positive voltage rail (logic 1) in order to provide a logic 1 as output.|$|E

The W65C22N has an <b>open-drain</b> interrupt output (the IRQB pin) that is compatible with a wired-OR interrupt circuit. Hence the DIP-40 version is a [...] "drop-in" [...] replacement for the NMOS part.|$|E
50|$|Light {{aircraft}} electrical systems are typically 14 V or 28 V. To allow seamless integration with either, the encoder uses {{a number of}} open-collector (<b>open-drain)</b> transistors to interface to the transponder. The height information is represented as 11 binary digits in a parallel form using 11 separate lines designated D2 D4 A1 A2 A4 B1 B2 B4 C1 C2 C4. The Gillham code contains a D1 bit but this is unused in practical applications.|$|E
50|$|The NMOS 6522 has an {{open drain}} IRQ output {{that may be}} used in wired-OR {{interrupt}} circuits. The WDC W65C22S, in contrast, has a totem pole IRQ output that must be isolated from a wired-OR circuit by a Schottky diode, {{due to the fact that}} the totem pole output actively drives the IRQ pin high when the W65C22S is not interrupting. This specific issue is resolved on the WDC W65C22N which is fitted with an <b>open-drain</b> IRQ output.|$|E

Comparators with an <b>open-drain</b> output stage use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain comparators {{are more suitable for}} mixed-voltage system design.

50|$|Pulse-width {{modulation}} (PWM) is {{a common}} method of controlling computer fans. A PWM-capable fan is usually connected to a 4-pin connector (pinout: Ground, +12 V, sense, control). The sense pin is used to relay the rotation speed of the fan and the control pin is an <b>open-drain</b> or open-collector output, which requires a pull-up to 5 V or 3.3 V in the fan. Unlike linear voltage regulation, where the fan voltage {{is proportional to the}} speed, the fan is driven with a constant supply voltage; the speed control is performed by the fan based on the control signal.|$|E
5000|$|High speed mode (3.4 Mbit/s) is {{compatible}} with normal I²C devices on the same bus, but requires the master have an active pull-up on the clock line which is enabled during high speed transfers. The first data bit is transferred with a normal <b>open-drain</b> rising clock edge, which may be stretched. For the remaining seven data bits, and the ack, the master drives the clock high {{at the appropriate time}} and the slave may not stretch it. All high-speed transfers are preceded by a single-byte [...] "master code" [...] at fast/standard speed. This code serves three purposes: ...|$|E
5000|$|At the {{physical}} layer, both SCL and SDA lines are of <b>open-drain</b> design, thus pull-up resistors are needed. A logic [...] "0" [...] is output by pulling {{the line to}} ground, and a logic [...] "1" [...] is output by letting the line float (output high impedance) so that the pull-up resistor pulls it high. A line is never actively driven high. This wire-ANDing allows multiple nodes to connect to the bus without short circuits from signal contention. High-speed systems (and some others) may use a current source instead of a resistor to pull-up on SCL or both SCL and SDA, to accommodate higher bus capacitance and enables faster rise times.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} features of the I²C protocol is clock stretching. An addressed slave device may hold the clock line (SCL) low after receiving (or sending) a byte, indicating {{that it is not}} yet ready to process more data. The master that is communicating with the slave may not finish the transmission of the current bit, but must wait until the clock line actually goes high. If the slave is clock-stretching, the clock line will still be low (because the connections are <b>open-drain).</b> The same is true if a second, slower, master tries to drive the clock at the same time. (If {{there is more than one}} master, all but one of them will normally lose arbitration.) ...|$|E
50|$|Buffers {{can be used}} {{to isolate}} {{capacitance}} on one segment from another and/or allow I²C to be sent over longer cables or traces. Buffers for bi-directional lines such as I²C must use one of several schemes for preventing latch-up. I²C is <b>open-drain,</b> so buffers must drive a low on one side when they see a low on the other. One method for preventing latch-up is for a buffer to have carefully selected input and output levels such that the output level of its driver is higher than its input threshold, preventing it from triggering itself. For example, a buffer may have an input threshold of 0.4 V for detecting a low, but an output low level of 0.5 V. This method requires that all other devices on the bus have thresholds which are compatible and often means that multiple buffers implementing this scheme cannot be put in series with one another.|$|E
5000|$|The Pseudo Open Drain (POD) {{drivers have}} a strong {{pull-down}} strength but a weaker pullup strength. A pure <b>open-drain</b> driver, by comparison, has no pullup strength except for leakage current: all the pull-up action is on the external termination resistor. This is why the term [...] "pseudo" [...] has to be used here: there is some pull-up on the driver side when output is at high state, the remaining pull-up strength is provided by parallel-terminating the receiver {{at the far end}} to the HIGH voltage, often using a switchable, on-die terminator instead of a separate resistor. The purpose of all this is to reduce the overall power demand compared to using both strong pullup and strong pull-down, as in drivers such as HSTL. DDR4 memory uses POD12 drivers but with the same driver strength (34 Ω/48 Ω) for pull-down (RonPd) and pull-up (RonPu). The term POD in DDR4 referring only for termination type that is only parallel pull-up w/o the pull-down termination at the far end. The reference point (VREF) for the input is not half-supply as was in DDR3 and may be higher.|$|E

40|$|In subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} (SAH) patients intracranial pressure (ICP) is usually monitored via an extraventricular drain (EVD), which can produce false readings when the drain is open. It is established {{that both the}} ICP cardiac pulse frequency and long term trends over several hours are often seriously corrupted. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish whether or not the intermediate frequency bands [respiratory, Mayer wave and very low frequency (VLF) ] were also corrupted. The VLF range is of special interest because it is important in cerebral autoregulation studies. Using a pattern recognition algorithm we retrospectively identified 718 cases of EVD opening in 80 SAH patients. An analysis of differences between closed and <b>open-drain</b> periods showed that ICP amplitude decreased significantly in all of the three lower frequency bands when the EVD was open. A similar analysis of systemic arterial pressure signal revealed similar changes in the same frequency bands that were positively correlated with the ICP changes. Therefore we concluded that the changes in the ICP signal represented real, physiological changes and not artifact. Pressure reactivity index (PRx) values were also computed during closed and <b>open-drain</b> periods. We found a small but statistically significant decrease during <b>open-drain</b> periods. Based on analysis of the change in the PRx distribution during open drainage we concluded that this decrease also represented physiological changes rather than artifact. In summary the ICP respiratory, Mayer wave, and VLF frequency bands are not corrupted when the EVD is open, and it safe to use these for autoregulation studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of the electrical characteristics of SiC “Super ” Junction Transistors (SJTs) is investigated under long-term avalanche-mode, DC and pulsed-current operation. There is absolutely {{no change in the}} blocking I-V characteristics after a 934 hour repetitive avalanche stress test. Long-term operation of the Gate-Source diode (<b>open-Drain</b> mode) alone does not result in any degradation of the on-state voltage drop (VF) or current gain (β). Long-term operation in common-Source mode results in negligible VF or β degradation, if the base-plate is maintained at 25 °C. A greater degradation of β results with increasing base-plate temperature. The same total electrical charge, if passed through the SJT as a pulsed current instead of a DC current results in a smaller β reduction.
