5|$|A serious {{accident}} with radioactivity release {{occurred in the}} 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954.

The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day.

At first the Communists were not interested in helping her, as she was not well-liked by them because of her refusal to allow the KPD to give her husband the standard burial rite used for members of the Red Freedom Fighters League, but when they realised that Horst Wessel was involved, they agreed to give Wessel a beating and get him out of Salm's flat by force.|$|E
