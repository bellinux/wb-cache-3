5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and good <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have good <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E
5|$|In Malagasy culture lemurs, {{and animals}} in general, have souls (ambiroa) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if {{killed in a}} cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other {{elements}} of daily life, have {{been a source of}} taboos, known locally as fady, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good <b>or</b> <b>bad,</b> onto human babies. In general, fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.|$|E
5|$|The aye-aye {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, <b>or</b> <b>bad</b> luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E

5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were good <b>or</b> <b>bad,</b> seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{recycling of}} waste and downgrading of secondary resources using a classical {{type of production}} model represented by a Sraffian model. Residuals emitted as waste by households and secondary resources obtained by recycling of waste are negatively or positively priced, depending upon technological conditions and income distribution. In other words, they can be commodities (goods) <b>or</b> discommodities (<b>bads),</b> and the distinction cannot be determined by physical characteristics. How such distinction comes about is explained, based upon an inter-industrial relationship and the choice of technique. It is also demonstrated that per capita consumption {{may not necessarily be}} a decreasing function of a growth rate. This is an anomaly which cannot be found in the economy where discommodities <b>or</b> <b>bads</b> are not explicitly considered.|$|R
