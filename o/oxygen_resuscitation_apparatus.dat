40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The utilitarian construct of two alternative criteria of human death increases {{the supply of}} transplantable organs {{at the end of}} life. Neither the neuro-logical criterion (heart-beating donation) nor the circulatory criterion (non-heart-beating donation) is grounded in scientific evidence but based on philosophical reasoning. A utilitarian death definition can have unintended consequences for dying Muslim patients: (1) the expedited process of determining death for retrieval of transplantable organs can lead to diagnostic errors, (2) the equivalence of brain death with human death may be incorrect, and (3) end-of-life religious values and traditional rituals may be sacrificed. Therefore, it is imperative to reevaluate the two different types and criteria of death introduced by the Resolution (Fatwa) of the Council of Islamic Jurisprudence on <b>Resuscitation</b> <b>Apparatus</b> in 1986. Although we recognize that this Fatwa was based on best scientific evidence available at that time, more recent evidence shows that it rests on outdated knowledge and under-standing of the phenomenon of human death.

40|$|Perinatal {{asphyxia}} {{remains one}} of the major causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Mild therapeutic hypothermia reduces brain injury after perinatal asphyxia. There is an ongoing search for strategies to further improve outcome, including best practice resuscitation and interventions {{that can be used in}} combination with hypothermia. The use of supplemental <b>oxygen</b> during <b>resuscitation</b> causes a number of harmful effects including increased cerebral injury. It is not known whether hypothermic neuroprotection can be improved by avoiding supplemental <b>oxygen</b> during <b>resuscitation.</b> In this work, in vitro neurons, neonatal rats and newborn pigs were used as experimental models to study the effect of hyperoxic reoxygenation on hypothermic neuroprotection after perinatal asphyxia. A neuroprotective effect of therapeutic hypothermia was confirmed in all three models. Also, pigs treated with hypothermia had less expression of DNA repair enzymes. Hyperoxic reoxygenation resulted in a significant overshoot in oxygen tension in the piglet brain. Increased injury following hyperoxic reoxygenation was evident only in the rat model, where reoxygenation in 100 % O 2 increased brain injury and worsened neurological performance. Hypothermia reduced brain injury in the rat both after reoxygenation in air and in 100 % O 2, but hypothermia after 100 % O 2 gave no net protection. The results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia is counteracted by using 100 % O 2 during reoxygenation. Thus, one way to optimise outcome after perinatal asphyxia is to avoid supplemental <b>oxygen</b> during <b>resuscitation</b> before therapeutic hypothermia. This thesis supports the combined use of the two recommendations in the new international resuscitation guidelines: to use therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, and to use air for <b>resuscitation</b> if supplemental <b>oxygen</b> can be avoided...|$|R

Objective: To analyze the preventable causes of death and the factors associated with {{a higher risk of}} early newborn death. Methods: A cross-sectional and descriptive study was performed with data about newborns that died during the neonatal period at a university hospital located in Curitiba; 314 cases of pediatric necropsies were selected, and preventable causes of death, survival time, sex, weight, gestational age, first- and fifth-minute Apgar score, cyanosis, acidosis, meconium aspiration, the need for <b>oxygen</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> cause of death and baseline disease were analyzed. Results: When considering only the cause of death, 300 cases (95. 54 %) would have preventable causes, but when analyzing the underlying disease, the number of cases decreased to 209 (66. 56 %). The most frequent cause of death was hypoxia (85 %), and the main baseline disease was diffuse alveolar damage (52. 9 %). There was a positive association between these variables with survival time: cyanosis (p = 0. 02), gestational age (p = 0. 012), cause of death (p < 0. 001), Apgar score < 6 (p < 0. 001) and pH value (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{study design}} with the {{smallest}} bias for causal inference is a perfect randomized clinical trial. Since this design is often not feasible in epidemiologic studies, an important challenge is to model bias properly and take random and systematic variation properly into account. A value for a target parameter might {{be said to be}} "incompatible" with the data (under the model used) if the parameter's confidence interval excludes it. However, this "incompatibility" may be due to bias and/or extra-variation. Discussion We propose the following way of re-interpreting conventional results. Given a specified focal value for a target parameter (typically the null value, but possibly a non-null value like that representing a twofold risk), the difference between the focal value and the nearest boundary of the confidence interval for the parameter is calculated. This represents the maximum correction of the interval boundary, for bias and extra-variation, that would still leave the focal value outside the interval, so that the focal value remained "incompatible" with the data. We describe a short example application concerning a meta analysis of air versus pure <b>oxygen</b> <b>resuscitation</b> treatment in newborn infants. Some general guidelines are provided for how to assess the probability that the appropriate correction for a particular study would be greater than this maximum (e. g. using knowledge of the general effects of bias and extra-variation from published bias-adjusted results). Summary Although this approach does not yet provide a method, because the latter probability can not be objectively assessed, this paper aims to stimulate the re-interpretation of conventional confidence intervals, and more and better studies of the effects of different biases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hesham Abdel-Hady, Nehad NasefNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, Mansoura University Children&# 39;s Hospital, Mansoura, EgyptAbstract: The {{survival}} of preterm infants has improved significantly {{during the past}} several decades. However, bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains a major morbidity. Preterm infants have both structural and functional lung immaturity compared with term infants, making them more likely to require resuscitation and more vulnerable to developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Interventions in the delivery room may affect short-term and long-term outcomes for preterm infants. The paradigm of resuscitation of preterm infants has been changing over the past decade from being interventional and invasive to be observational and gentle. Recent developments in respiratory management of preterm infants in the delivery room include oxygen supplementation and monitoring, alveolar recruitment techniques, noninvasive ventilation, new surfactant preparations, and new techniques for administration of surfactant. Providing nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than intubating has been identified as a potentially better practice. Experimental studies have demonstrated that early application of nasal CPAP is protective for the preterm lung and brain compared with mechanical ventilation. Several observational studies have suggested that early nasal CPAP and avoiding intubation leads to reduced oxygen requirements, intubation rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, and may decrease rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Multicenter, randomized controlled trials support the use of nasal CPAP as a primary strategy in preterm babies with respiratory distress syndrome. This approach leads to a {{reduction in the number of}} infants who are intubated and given surfactant without an impact on bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates. On the other hand, half of the infants enrolled in these studies failed nasal CPAP treatment. New techniques for surfactant administration include INSURE (&quot;intubate give surfactant and extubate&quot;), administration through a laryngeal mask airway, nebulized surfactant administration, and minimally invasive surfactant therapy.

40|$|Immediately after birth, {{the newly}} born infant {{undergoes}} physiological changes including lung aeration, decrease of pulmonary vascular resistance and initiation of pulmonary gas exchange. Under particular circumstances, this transition {{process is not}} adequately accomplished, thus resulting in perinatal asphyxia. In the past decade, remarkable changes have occurred in attitudes towards the use of oxygen in the delivery room. Although oxygen is a lifesaving therapy in neonatal <b>resuscitation,</b> high <b>oxygen</b> concentrations may be harmful to term infants, and especially to preterm infants. In fact, the use of high concentrations of oxygen in the first minutes after birth can lead to an excessive release of free oxygen radicals and to subsequent oxidative stress, with potential damage to multiple organs including the brain, lungs, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. In 2010, the American Heart Association published revised guidelines for neonatal resuscitation including the recommendations on the measurement and monitoring of oxygenation status and on oxygen supplementation in the delivery room. Some key points of these recommendations are the following: (1) the clinical assessment of skin color is a poor indicator of oxygenation immediately after birth; (2) pulse oximetry provides rapid, continuous and accurate measurement of both oxygenation and heart rate during delivery room resuscitation; (3) the provision of blended <b>oxygen</b> during neonatal <b>resuscitation</b> should be aimed at maintaining oxygen saturations {{similar to those of}} uncompromised babies born at term.

Additionally, they concur that H 1 -antihistamines, H 2 -antihistamines, and glucocorticoids are not initial medications of choice. For self-management of patients at risk of anaphylaxis in community settings, they recommend carrying epinephrine auto-injectors and personalized emergency action plans, as well as follow-up with a physician (ideally an allergy/immunology specialist) to help prevent anaphylaxis recurrences. ICON: Anaphylaxis describes unmet needs in anaphylaxis, noting that although epinephrine in 1 mg/mL ampules is available worldwide, other essentials, including supplemental <b>oxygen,</b> intravenous fluid <b>resuscitation,</b> and epinephrine auto-injectors are not universally available. ICON: Anaphylaxis proposes a comprehensive international research agenda that calls for additional prospective studies of anaphylaxis epidemiology, patient risk factors and co-factors, triggers, clinical criteria for diagnosis, randomized controlled trials of therapeutic interventions, and measures to prevent anaphylaxis recurrences. It also calls for facilitation of global collaborations in anaphylaxis research. In addition to confirming the alignment of major anaphylaxis guidelines, ICON: Anaphylaxis adds value by including summary tables and citing 130 key references.

The majority (90 %, n = 61) of respondents were aware of recent guideline changes but continued to resuscitate with PO {{because of the lack of}} equipment and uncertainty about international guidelines (61 %, n = 41 for term, 44 %, n = 30 for preterm). Most (81 %, n = 55) believed that PO caused adverse effects in term neonates. The availability of oxygen blending equipment correlated significantly with the country's gross domestic product. Conclusion: The majority of the practitioners we surveyed in non-Western countries are aware of the most recent recommendations regarding oxygen use in neonatal resuscitation. However, lack of oxygen blending equipment remains a hindrance to the use of blended gas at resuscitation in low resource, non-western countries. Global guidelines from developed countries must take into account the resource limitations and implementation difficulties faced by countries with restricted resources, where the majority of the high-risk infants are born...|$|R

In {{the study reported}} here, we {{examined the effects of}} three different <b>oxygen</b> concentrations at <b>resuscitation</b> on <b>oxygen</b> saturations (SpO 2) and oxidant stress in premature infants. Study design: Infants < 32 weeks gestational age were randomized to 21 %, 40 %, or 100 % O 2 and resuscitated as per 2005 neonatal <b>resuscitation</b> guidelines. <b>Oxygen</b> groups and SpO 2 were unmasked at 10 minutes of age and FiO 2 adjusted to maintain an SpO 2 of 85 %– 95 % for the next 20 minutes. Blood was collected at 24 hours, 1 week, and 4 weeks for measurement of the oxidative-stress markers, such as a reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio (GSH/GSSG), nitrotyrosine levels, and 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) levels. The study was stopped at 30 % enrollment following publication of the 2010 neonatal resuscitation guidelines. Results: We enrolled 18 patients during the study period. SpO 2 increased over time (P< 0. 0001); however, this increase was not different among the three oxygen groups in the first 10 minutes after birth. FiO 2 was significantly higher in the 100 % O 2 group, despite weaning (P< 0. 02) to maintain target saturations at 30 minutes of age. The GSH/GSSG ratio was significantly lower in the 100 % O 2 group at 24 hours than in the other groups (P< 0. 01). Plasma nitrotyrosine was significantly higher in the 40 % and 100 % O 2 groups over time (P< 0. 01). Levels of 8 -OHdG were significantly higher at 4 weeks compared with at 24 hours, independent of the oxygen group (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion: In this study, we defined the natural evolution of SpO 2 in the first 10 minutes of life with exposure to three different concentrations of oxygen. Randomization to higher FiO 2 led to higher total <b>oxygen</b> exposure at <b>resuscitation,</b> and this was significantly correlated with markers of systemic oxidant stress.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{simulation model}} for the infant-incubator-feedback system was developed in a Matlab/Simulink® environment to investigate all heat exchange relationships, variables and factors that have an influence on the overall thermo-neutrality of the environment. The model was also {{used to determine the}} benefits and limitations of using a convectively heated single-walled incubator in nursing preterm infants with very low birth weight < 1000 grams and low gestational age 28 weeks. The infant was modelled as one-lump with two layers; core and skin. The infant shape was approximated to a cylinder. The model incorporated all compartments of the infant-incubator system including core, skin, incubator air space, mattress, incubator walls, air-circulating fan, heating element, added <b>oxygen</b> (for <b>resuscitation</b> purposes), and humidification chamber, which has not previously been considered. The results of the simulation were in terms of the temperature variation over time, of the following parts of the system: core and skin temperatures and incubator air space temperature. Results of the simulation with added humidity showed that the body temperature of a 900 gram infant, with an initial body temperature of 35. 5 ºC, did not reach the thermo-neutral range between 36. 5 - 37. 5 ºC in two hours, on air mode. Whereas, on skin mode, both core and skin temperature reached to 36. 87 ºC and 36. 5 ºC in two hours, and thus a thermo-neutral environment was achieved. These outcomes are consistent with clinical empirical reports. The simulation model is a closed-loop system with a PID controller for each mode; air servo controlled and skin servo controlled. The controller parameters were virtually estimated by the Zeigler-Nichols Method as real values were not available. Nevertheless, the overall stability of the whole system has been achieved by applying a step input which was verified by the Root Locus Method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis focuses on oxygen therapy of mature and premature newborns, particularly {{as a part of}} resuscitation. The thesis summarizes general findings about postpartum adaptation of individual groups of newborns and about immediate care provided in the delivery room. The {{theoretical part}} also deals with a nursing care of newborns and young babies requiring ventilation support in the hospital neonatology ward. The practical part surveyed both theoretical knowledge and practical skills of pediatric nurses and midwives. The survey used quantitative inquiry and observation. Anonymous questionnaires were distributed to midwives and pediatric nurses working at the gynecology-obstetrics and neonatology wards in the hospitals in České Budějovice (Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s.) and in Benešov (Nemocnice Rudolfa a Stefanie Benešov, a. s.) The observation was conducted during my practice at the neonatology ward in the hospital in České Budějovice. The thesis had one formulated objective and two related hypotheses. The objective was to determine the level of knowledge of midwives and pediatric nurses about the principles of treatment of newborns and young babies with oxygen. The objective has been met. Hypothesis 1 : ?I believe that the level of knowledge of midwives and pediatric nurses about the oxygen treatment of newborns and young babies is sufficient? has been confirmed. Hypothesis 2 : ?The nursing team in the delivery room is familiar with the current recommendations for application of <b>oxygen</b> during <b>resuscitation</b> of newborns in the delivery room? has been confirmed. This bachelor degree thesis may serve to future students of midwife profession as a study material and source of information. Moreover, the thesis might be used as an educational material for midwives and pediatric nurses working in delivery rooms and at neonatology in-patient wards...|$|R
40|$|Septic, or distributive, shock is {{a severe}} {{condition}} withan associated mortality rate around 50 %. 1 After vol-ume resuscitation, it typically presents as a syndrome of low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output. 2 The goal of therapy {{is to raise}} blood pressure and maintain it at levels that provide adequate perfusion pressure to fa-cilitate <b>oxygen</b> delivery. Fluid <b>resuscitation</b> {{is an important component}} of hemodynamic management of septic shock and, ideally, should be achieved prior to initiating vaso-pressor support. 3 However, following adequate fluid resus-citation, many patients continue to experience hypotension as a result of sepsis-induced impaired cardiac contractility and insufficient systemic vascular resistance. 4, 5 Typically, dopamine and norepinephrine are considered first-line agents in the treatment of septic shock due to the improved safety profile of these medications over other products, such as epinephrine and phenylephrine. 3 Catecholamine responsiveness may decrease over time during severe sep-sis, possibly due to an increase in nitric oxide–induced va-sodilation; as a result, patients may develop septic shock that is resistant to catecholamine treatment. 2, 6 Vasopressin is an endogenous neurohormone that func-tions as a direct systemic vasoconstrictor independent o...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} {{the treatment of}} newborns with oxygen from the nursing perspective. Work has part of theoretical and of research. In the theoretical part I focus on the latest European Resuscitation Council best practices {{in the administration of}} oxygen as well as longer-term oxygen according to best practices of the Czech neonatology in inpatient Department. First, particular attention devoted to the reconstruction of the fetoplacental circulation of the newborn with subsequent changes in his lung and blood circulation after birth, because it {{is an integral part of}} the knowledge in the treatment of oxygen. The next section is devoted to the principles of the first treatment of the newborn, in particular with regard to the assessment of the postnatal adaptation and the decision to open the oxygen therapy by nurse or midwife assistant. The following are mentioned in the work at the same time valid recommendations for the resuscitation of the newborn, again with an emphasis on the question of the use of oxygen. In the next chapter is summarized the most common neonatal pathology, which requires oxygenotherapy. The following chapter covers ways to feed oxygen to newborns as early in the process of adaptation, so when a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. There are described the proper techniques of monitoring and summarises the complications of treatment with oxygen in its inadequate application. Research section includes the identification of the knowledge of the nursing staff in the treatment of oxygen for newborns and then system in the education of nursing staff in matters of oxygen therapy. For research were established two objectives. The first objective is to map the knowledge of nursing staff in the principles of application of oxygen for newborns in the neonatal intensive care and resuscitation and in the birthing room. And the aim of the second was to determine what form is tutored by the nursing staff in the area of oxygen for newborns. On the basis of these objectives have been laid down 3 research questions. The first question is: What are the main differences between knowledge and best practice version of the nursing staff in the application of oxygen for a newborn? The second question is: Is the education of nursing staff in the resuscitation of the emphasis is on the practical implementation and on the systematic recurrence? And the third question is: How does the education staff in the principles of <b>oxygen</b> therapy beyond <b>resuscitation?</b> For research inquiries, he was elected qualitative research. For data collection have been used individual interviews with 5 children's nurses, who work in a specialized neonatologickém work in the field of neonatal intensive care units and in the field of bithings rooms of the Hospital Department in České Budějovice a. s. The Interviews were subsequently rewritten into a Bachelor's thesis and at the conclusion of the results of a detailed table was created, where results are presented. Of the investigation can be concluded that nursing staff have sufficient knowledges in the field of oxygen therapy in newborns and nursing and best practices in the application of oxygen. As regards education, which relates to the resuscitation of newborns is done regularly, once a year in the Department The results of the work could be used to identify deficiencies in training in the field of application of <b>oxygen</b> in <b>resuscitation</b> with the aim of directing the education of personnel in this area...|$|R
