25|$|The {{religious}} institutions of African-American Christians commonly {{are referred to}} collectively as the black church. During slavery, many slaves were stripped of their African belief systems and typically denied free religious practice, forced to become Christian.

These practices, including dance, shouts, African rhythms, and enthusiastic singing, remain {{a large part of}} worship in the African-American church.|$|E
