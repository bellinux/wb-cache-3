5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>judiciary</b> <b>committee.)</b> The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee,</b> Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E

500|$|In the Thomas hearings, Biden's {{questions}} on constitutional issues were often long and convoluted, sometimes such that Thomas forgot the question being asked. [...] Viewers of the high-profile hearings were often annoyed by Biden's style. Thomas later wrote that despite earlier private assurances from the senator, Biden's questions had been {{akin to a}} beanball. The nomination {{came out of the}} committee without a recommendation, with Biden opposed. In part due to his own bad experiences in 1987 with his presidential campaign, Biden was reluctant to let personal matters enter into the hearings. Biden initially shared with committee, but not the public, Anita Hill's sexual harassment charges, on the grounds she was not yet willing to testify. After she did, Biden did not permit other witnesses to testify further on her behalf, such as Angela Wright (who made a similar charge) and experts on harassment. Biden said he was striving to preserve Thomas's right to privacy and the decency of the hearings. The nomination was approved by a 52–48 vote in the full Senate, with Biden again opposed. During and afterwards, Biden was strongly criticized by liberal legal groups and women's groups for having mishandled the hearings and having not done enough to support Hill. Biden subsequently sought out women to serve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee</b> and emphasized women's issues in the committee's legislative agenda.|$|E

Sessions based his opposition on the nominee's lack of experience, her background as a political operative (Kagan had said that she worked in the Clinton White House not as a lawyer but as a policy adviser), and her record on guns, abortion, and gay rights. Sessions pointed out that Kagan [...] "has a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago".|$|E
2500|$|But Edmunds {{also had}} admirers. One Democrat with {{no reason to}} {{appreciate}} him wrote a colleague that among all the Republicans, [...] "Edmunds made the most impression upon me. [...] I couldn't help admiring his clear and incisive way of putting a question, although it appeared to me that his manner is occasionally very irritating. [...] This manner of his is very much that of a lawyer employed as counsel in a case, who therefore makes ex parte statements, and thinks it fair to make all manner of allegations."

Sessions also questioned the nominee about her views {{on the use of}} foreign law in deciding cases, as well as her role in the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (PRLDEF). On July 28, 2009, Sessions joined five Republican colleagues in voting against Sotomayor's nomination in the Judiciary Committee. The committee approved Sotomayor by a vote of 13–6.

2500|$|Through his {{testimony}} before Congress on {{issues ranging from}} the Patriot Act to U.S. Attorney firings, he commonly admitted ignorance. The response to Gonzales's testimony by those Senators serving on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees was one of disbelief.

[...] The ranking Republican <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee,</b> Arlen Specter, said to Gonzales, [...] "Your credibility has been breached to the point of being actionable." [...] Leahy and Specter's comments were interpreted as warnings that Gonzales might have been perjuring himself.

[...] Rockefeller's sentiments were echoed by Jane Harman, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, who accused Gonzales of [...] "selectively declassifying information to defend his own conduct." ...|$|E
